B003UM9GDM|4|So far this jack has worked as advertised. I found no missing parts. I had no trouble assembling it. It picked up my rather light Kawasaki KLR 650 and my  not so light CanAm 800 Outlander Max XT with equal ease. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it's made in China and the build quality shows it. The little rubber pad for the pump lever will not stay on and the wheels don't exactly glide over the surface of my smooth wood shop floors. But for the money and so far it's doing the job.
B00LNNR9GG|5|Super bright.  Love them
B010MHV00O|5|I just got this today!  Couldn't wait to get in the car to try this out.  Awesome!  Now, I don't have to worry about my big HydroFlask on the car seat.  I plan on leaving it in the car since I use my HydroFlask everyday!  Thanks again, Bottle Pro!
B00537CIHS|5|Great caster for the boat.
B007TQJTFK|3|easy install but it needs to come with a connector hose...I had to build one to connect it. The seat is rather flimsy...moves around when you sit on it & is very thin...I expect it to crack & break soon. Very easy flush.
B00M9IKNX0|4|Quality is good.  Finish and manufacturing quality is better than average.  Have not sued extensively yet so cannot give 5 stars.
B001LHVOVK|5|good price. works fine.
B00RQJUBR0|5|Excellent

B0002Z9R5W|3|Does not fit as described. Not worth the money.<br />Buy normal wipers.

B0092K33C6|4|Good price and got here quick..
B00GJK4X8U|5|Exactly as described.  Used some YouTube videos and it works perfectly.  The solder pump is a great adder, it really helps to get the solder of the board to pull out the motors!
B003NI5IXU|5|Wife much happier now
B00OV48KBM|5|Application was easy. Everything was as described.
B00T36MJMO|4|It arrived & functioned as I expected.

B000BN3A4Y|5|These r the originals n i have 1 in every vehicle  it come with base mounting plate that can be attached with screws or u can just velcrow it down
B003N9LTSM|4|Smaller than I anticipated.
B0046CZKIA|5|Seems sturdy, looks like it'll work. Will have to wait several months to truly test it out.<br />I got this at a discount for my honest review,
B00IKCPYR4|5|Fit perfect in my dodge worth the paso
B0008FUH46|3|I could not use it on my large travel trailer because it has a flared end. It worked on my older trailer.
B00G6KGPFM|5|Boy this stuff work nice... self-leveling and stays supple so it won't crack and leak down the road.
B00Y7BLATI|5|Very nice
B00J67VNFE|4|Doing a total restore on a 1970 Mustang Mach 1 FB. Yanked rear end last week end, cleaned underside of car from front to back, resealed all seams and wanted to undercoat car before new powder coated 9&#34; rear end arrives.<br />Always had great luck with POR-15 products for almost 20 years but had never tried their undercoating, been using 3M professional. Purchased (4) cans of this stuff to give it a try.<br />I really like the coverage and if it's anything like other POR-15 products, it may outlast me.<br />A few things to note:<br />1. Pretty flat - looks good but not too much texture to hide imperfections (like a lot of people are going to be crawling under your car anyway - right?)<br />2. Fumes are POTENT - I had three bay doors open with a slight breeze blowing through (would have pulled car out but remember, no rear end installed). I had to walk away from the garage after each can to get rid of the buzz. Recommend doing this outside with a fan to move the fumes off and wear a respirator or at least a mask<br />3. Had 1 of 4 can nozzle stop up, which was an easy fix for me since I had empty cans but would have ticked me off it was the only can I purchased and it stopped up<br />Real question is, would I go back to 3M professional - undecided at this point. Want to give it a couple of days to cure and then test it before making that decision
B0029V9DRY|3|The cargo carries is weell made and easy to use.  I like the idea that it is expandable making it easier to load.  It would have gotten a 5, however, I had to replace the attaching straps.  After the first use two fell off
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great
B00FSIC6GK|5|Excellent quality, very quiet and smooth ride.Thank you
B00A7ET190|5|The JRA import valve cores fit my 2005 Subaru Outback perfectly.  I couldn't find a reliable cross-reference ANYWHERE, so hopefully this will help someone else with a similar bad core.
B00E5OUOCQ|5|this is a fabulous sunshade--fits our 2007 Honda perfectly, is easy to open and use, and stores in a little bag right in the door pocket
B001KNYO26|5|This can be done yourself.  Research videos on Youtube.  Best with after market exhaust and air intake.
B000IYN4KG|5|totally pleased with this product
B00J65I43U|5|Love this stuff. I use it almost every time I wash a vehicle.
B00G2U0LHY|2|Fine at first.  After 8 months they started losing points of light.  I had to change back to regular bulbs.
B00NLG4Q2I|4|Very flashy and sparkly! Expect people to notice these. It seems sturdy enough; I don't expect stones to fall out any time soon. I was worried that these would cover up too much information on my plates, but that is not an issue at all.  One thing to note is that the screws did not fit on my car, so I couldn't use the caps it came with. Unfortunately that was one of the reasons why I bought these over similar products. They still look very pretty regardless.  EDIT: One year later and these still look new! Not a single stone has been lost. That is after a Colorado winter and frequent car washes.
B005WG87QG|4|I bought this at a local store.  Had it for a few months and it started working intermittently....  I changed the battery and that did not fix it.<br /><br />I figured I'd e-mailed the company before throwing it out.  They replaced it--no questions asked.<br /><br />Great Service.  The company gets a 5-star review.<br /><br />The gauge is more accurate than most.  I had a tire pressure warning light that would never go off even after adding air to the correct pressure.  I thought my sensor was bad.  Someone suggested it might be a poorly calibrated gauge....<br /><br />So I bought this to see if that was the cause.<br /><br />This said my other gauge was off by 5+ PSI.  I used this, and my warning light went out.<br /><br />I did  hot have any problems with air leaking.  Easy to use.
B00V2XHMBY|5|Great bar! Bright as H E double hockey stick! Only complaint is that after purchasing and getting my hands on it, I figured out I don't have anyplace to mount it. Not sure where to go from here.
B009YXF5A4|5|Good price

B002XM3IP2|4|Very good filter, had an initial leak, but just needed tightening.  Allows good flow and well costructed.
B00IBOKOPS|5|These mats are fantastic. They fit my Honda Accord 2014 perfectly. They are easy to clean and look great. They are not bulky and very lightweight. I highly recommend these mats.

B0029TQDLA|5|My husband uses this to hold his wheelchair placard around the rear view mirror in the car.  It is sturdy, the plastic is crystal clear has not clouded in color and protects the placard very effectively.  It is neither too long or too short and hooks on and off the rear view mirror easily.  We keep it in the car all the time and are very pleased with this purchase.
B00XZ9POLI|5|Good

B0024NSRSI|5|They came on time. And they fit and look great !!
B0012LHQT4|5|As stated in another review it fits the 911 perfectly. It holds 11 oz. it seems to be made solidly (although in China). Overall I'm very satisfied with it.
B001PNC5CW|5|Works good nice it's oem part thanks.
B009E9J1Y4|5|Worked fine
B00MSROSPG|1|This product is a cheap piece of garbage. Although I currently have it attached to my truck and I do like the look, attaching it appropriately to the design of my grill was tricky. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that it is still attached given all the flaws in the actual design of the emblem! It could  fit better with some slight modifications, however I think few people would rather not put in the effort for something so cheap just to make it work for their vehicle. Save your money for something better.
B00BTLEHSK|3|The head rest covers are too big for my 2012 Mazda3. The front seat covers look nice and weren't hard to install but they kind of remind me of cheap Halloween costumes with nice fabric in the front and flimsy stuff in back. The rear seat cover is in two main pieces for the seat back and bottom with straps that wrap around to connect everything together. But, my car has thick fabric from the back of the rear seat into the truck which does not allow the straps to go through. I was also unable to lift the bottom of the rear seat to send those straps through. I managed to tuck the cover into cracks enough that it looks okay but, overall, I was hoping for a better fit and easier installation with nicer material.
B004RCT17U|5|What can one say about a steel plate with a ball welded to it?  &#34;The welds look nice and strong.&#34;
B004W6NH94|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Jeep Wrangler TJ
B0085I1DL4|5|Item received as expected.  performs as described.  Saves the backache....  Good value from this seller.

B00SQYQMTK|4|Works good
B000GV7EKW|5|These Cobra Speedster Longs are just amazing.  They sound great and make the bike look a lot sleeker compared to the quiet bulky factory exhaust.  Easy to install.  It was harder taking the factory exhaust off compared to putting the new exhaust on.
B0010T6SC4|5|Great fit and finish.
B00BC3727S|5|fit was perfect I had a little trouble with wind until I sinched up the strap a bit more and had no more problems. I am very happy with this helmet.
B007TY8AR0|4|it's what we needed for our Ram Truck...Thankyou
B000FIY08U|5|I love it.  I ordered another one also.  Now I have 2 power converters.  One is installed in my RV and I use the other away from my RV.
B00GOQFG4E|5|Purchased for my son's 2005 VStar 650.  He loves them.  Very nice sized bags.  Bigger then we thought.  We do have to buy some supports but otherwise they are nice looking and hold a lot.

B000PH73SU|4|Good set of quick connects for vehicle ac system.
B007XUIWAK|5|Part fit perfectly and worked great.  Only have had it installed for 24 hours.  Got rid of the battery warning light and the &#34;alternator workshop&#34; message on my 2003 Passat GLX V6.  I had estimates to replace the alternator at a auto shop between $692 & $1300.
B00NURO830|5|wow! bought this for a friend through my account, but is this thing bright!, now i want one
B000F5JMEA|4|Item as described, fair price

B002VJGWVE|3|They got the job done for a good price
B00A1V94S2|5|The best. The molly rings are great!
B005GM9CRE|2|I guess the saying you get what u paid for is true. Very thin. The stitching is already comming apart. I would spend the money for a better quality mat that's double in price. Don't buy these.
B00PJOIA8Q|5|Looks awesome and works really well. Easy to instal took me an hour for my motorcycle drag pipes.
B003CEOJGM|3|These hubcaps arrived quickly and seemed to be of good quality but I returned them beacause they are not the same as original honda. These are designed to snap on the rim,over the lug nuts instead of being held on by them, and they have fake plastic silver lugs where the actual lugs would be. I really only needed two wheel covers and I found 2 genuine honda covers at a local used hubcap store($25 ea). Would recommed going that route if you want to maintain the original look.
B000BCKVHY|5|Great Door Mat! Can't wait until the Dawgs start playing.
B0047RKS72|5|I bought this pack of lights to try out on my Nissan 350z and loved it. I started by putting them into my license plate lights and the effect was awesome. They were not overly bright but gave the car a nice accent from behind. They are sensitive to polarity so if they don't work at first, flip them around and try again.<br /><br />This pack of eight ended up going a very long way. I also ended up replaced some lights in my headlights with them to give the HIDs a nice while accent from the housing at night, rather than the yellow orange color that was stock. I then also had enough of these little guys to put into my brother's truck's license plate lights.<br /><br />Long story short, these guys are not the brightest LEDs you can get, but that's why I liked them. For accent lights, they work wonderfully at keeping those areas as accents.
B00COOS4ZS|5|Awesome
B00XIRVE66|5|Exactly as advertised with a great price.
B00MBEWIZS|4|They fit perfectly in my suburbans gauge
B007Z0QN72|5|Good value.
B002SE1EQK|5|Great fit and new look on my Honda CRV 2008 LX. Excellent packaging of the product. Easy to put on with simple included instruction. Hopefully the 3M adhesive will stay on good, will see...overall great add-on to make a 2008 car looks good!
B000IG20RM|5|Slick and long lasting.
B00LFL8LM2|5|great buy better then oem amazing price
B001O0AMZS|5|Fit my 2005 Prius great for the aftermarket wheels.
B00E7VFH0G|4|I bought the black and white one about 2 months ago, I did not tape it down or anything just set it there and haven't had any problems so far. Fits okay, scratches easily but hasn't warped from my beverages which I was worried about. It's more of a hidden luxury that adds a nice professional and subtle touch. Probably want to try the silver one next time to stand out a bit more
B00029JMXU|5|Just as it was presented should never rust
B007VRDUY8|5|Love these Jegs exhaust tips!  Easiest and cheapest 50 horsepower you can add!
B00P6UTAQ4|5|This lift workd perfectly! Took a hour to put in and made my 99dodge look so much better,I highly recommend
B00Y5FA97K|5|Would love to get this for my Nissan Note but if the color were blue or black.
B00SVEQPRE|5|This is Awesome and a small sample was sent with it ,too!!!
B005Z8HAUK|4|If you're like me, you do your research before buying something and I did so with these 12v Portable Tire Inflators and air compressors. After MUCH reading I finally got my decision down to 2 products. Here are the criteria I decided I needed and why I chose this Slime 40026 model over the other product I was considering, the [[ASIN:B005ASY23I Viair 88P]].<br />1. The unit must work off the car battery and NOT the cigarette lighter. Lesser inflators/compressors work from the cigarette lighter jack but still have a high power requirement (15A or higher). This can potentially blow your cars' accessory fuse and cause more headaches than it solves. Direct connect to the battery insures the inflator/compressor gets the power it needs and won't blow any fuses. [TIE].<br />2. I want an inflator/compressor that works fast, I don't want to sit around forever waiting for a tire to be inflated. Both models are rated at about 1.9CFM. In the real world, that equated to taking 30seconds to add 10psi to each of my sport 17&#34; tires (245/40R17) that were all a bit low. [TIE].<br />3. Has to be portable and easily storable in my small car. [SLIME WIN: Only the Slime comes with a carry case and has a handle on the unit, the ViAir 88p doesn't have the case or a carry handle].<br />4. Has to be reliable. I will be keeping this stowed in my car trunk for emergencies and for tire maintenance. Whether it makes an actual difference or not, it does seem to makes sense it would...The Slime has Dual Cylinders while the ViAir has only 1. [SLIME WIN: Slime dual-cylinders, ViAir single-cylinder).<br /><br />The Slime and the ViAir both have almost exactly the same specs when it comes to performance and made the choice between the 2 extremely hard. But when I took into consideration the portability and storability, then the Slime easily edged the win. The Slime has the carry-handle, a storage case and a coiled-hose which all work together to get the job done, but then also packs up nice and tight to be stored away.<br /><br />The other little nicety that the Slime has, but not the ViAir, is an LED light to help light up the work area. That's very considerate since you're not always guaranteed a well lit area to work in.<br /><br />So that's why I bought the Slime, now here's what I think about how well the unit actually works;<br /><br />+++ THE PROS +++<br />+ WORKS FAST<br />+ TWIST-ON TIRE CONNECTOR<br />+ CARRYING HANDLE<br />+ COILED HOSE<br /><br />--- THE CONS ---<br />- SMALL BATTERY CONNECTORS<br />- HARD TO READ TIRE GAUGE<br />- FLIMSY CASE<br /><br />*** THE DETAILS & WRAP-UP ***<br />While these inflators/compressors seem great for pumping up tires, and come with built-in tire pressure gauges, I don't put much stock in the gauges accuracy. A tire gauge is most accurate in their mid-range and the one that comes with the Slime reads from 0-150psi so it's most accurate in the 75psi range which doesn't help me with my car tires that are around 35psi! So I also purchased the [[ASIN:B0002WRIFG Intercomp tire gauge]] (highly rated by Consumer Reports) to go along with the inflator. It is well regarded for accuracy, has a HUGE 4&#34; easy to read and glow-in-the-dark display, and it's range is 0-60psi so its' accuracy sweetspot is right where I need it.<br /><br />I had swapped out my stock tires on my car with 17&#34; summer sport tires sized 245/40r17. I checked the pressure and they all read 24psi (give or take a psi on each wheel). I'd like them to be 35psi. I connected the battery leads (red first, then black, as instructed), twisted-on the hose to the front  passenger tire and flipped the on/off switch to on. Waited about 30 seconds then turn it off, I check the pressure with the Intercomp and it reads 35psi almost right on the dot, great. Repeat the process on the back passenger tire and get the same result. Repeat for the other tires and I'm done. Added 10psi to all 4 wheels in less than 5min, with a little portable pump, not bad at all! After the last tire was done I checked the unit for heat and it was cool to the ouch all around...Though the hose where it connects to the unit was rather hot (almost too hot to touch and hold).<br /><br />Afterwards everything goes back into the case fairly easily and I pack it away in the passenger side rear footwell (until I get a proper trunk organizer so it doesn't go flying around everywhere in the trunk) and it fits there no problem (which is a testament to how compact this unit packs away because of my small car (Scion FR-S).<br /><br />I don't doubt I would've gotten the same performance and results with the ViAir 88p, but it wouldn't have packed away so easily or compactly as the Slime does. This is a great little unit, I highly recommend it.r the last tire was done I checked the unit for heat and it was cool to the ouch all around...Though the hose where it connects to the unit was rather hot (almost too hot to touch and hold).<br /><br />Afterwards everything goes back into the case fairly easily and I pack it away in the passenger side rear footwell (until I get a proper trunk organizer so it doesn't go flying around everywhere in the trunk) and it fits there no problem (which is a testament to how compact this unit packs away because of my small car (Scion FR-S).<br /><br />I don't doubt I would've gotten the same performance and results with the ViAir 88p, but it wouldn't have packed away so easily or compactly as the Slime does.

B009AA2GQC|5|'04 Chevy Avalanche &#34;Service Air Bag&#34; warning along with the airbag light came on.  Ordered one of these disconnected battery, dropped splash plate and replaced the drivers side only.  (Guess to what side) connected back up, good to go.  Save $500 vs a garage doing this.  Easy, less than 25 minutes from start to finish.
B008BG60JU|5|True to size/fit and overall quality is great.
B0006HP9EY|4|you need a MSD distibutor for this to work BEWARE

B000E2ANSI|5|read the instructions for important info. this thing fits perfect
B0074FQKDA|1|Had to purchase this in order to have working HID headlights again.. Within 2 weeks, one of my headlights was out again. I will never make the mistake of purchasing this brand.
B00TD4T046|4|fit perfect, just as described, started first pull
B009VKHWP6|4|This fits a Land Rover series 3  2.5 NA Starter. Works well so far.  I would give it 5 stars if the plunger was copper, but boy it wouldnt be this price then would it?
B000BRQ0TW|5|Great Product!
B002YCE5V2|5|I took a chance and ordered this switch because my service four wheel drive warning was on. This switch did the trick!

B007JSGR9Y|5|Great product. Great seller. Fast delivery.<br />Thanks++++++
B00B4WK8FK|1|Does not fit a bombadier ds650. The fuel outlet is on the wrong side. Rip off
B0082CTSOM|5|these look great makes a huge difference and very inexpensive vs dealer.
B000KKKZEG|5|Bought this after reading it was a close match to Harley Orange. It's not exactly the same color of course, but it's darn close. Close enough for me! And the paint went on great! Looks almost pro! Seems durable too.
B004PHDWMM|5|Great stuff, it's portable and comes with hanging brackets, works on all classes of fire, great price, I keep,at home and in my truck
B000EQ0M94|5|It's been working for a couple months now, no issues.
B0041DXAI6|5|As advertised.  I was able to do the removal and installation after watching a YouTube video once and then watching or again (pausing when needed) while I did it.  It took some maneuvering to get the new one in but I am happy with the results.
B0073W7ZLA|4|Definitely lost a few stations. But I mainly just wanted the lower profile. I don't use the radio much anyway.
B00EE8JZGE|5|Looks tough, Good welds,  Bolted right up no problem,  well pleased
B00GHQGN1G|5|Works just like the original Lugs and look great
B00ZE5RGTY|5|The Car Seat Catcher is pliable, it fits perfectly, not only closing the gap between front seats and console, but also a great place for other &#34;stuff&#34;!! In addition, the color is a great match to my car's black interior. Using the product is easy just insert these car seat side pocket holders between car seats and instantly make storage room. These car seat pocket catchers catch any items that might fall between the seats.<br /><br />The pocket holders are a great place to store phone, magazines, maps, pens, sunglasses, and any other items that you normally store in a car that you need easy access to. The holders fit in between the car seat and the console. The holders are a great way to keep items that you need on-hand close to you for easy access. Organizing the car with these car seat side pocket holders is a breeze.<br /><br />Anti Slip Non Slip Pad Mat Car Accessory works as expected, collects dust rather fast but I imagine that's dust that would have collected elsewhere in my car so win win. And it cleans up in seconds with a little soap n water. I leave all kinds of stuff on my dash with this thing, my flash light, my DSLR, my cell, a new business card -it's super handy to be able to keep something in sight and off the seats where someone might sit. i also use it as a cell phone phone and keep my phone vertically to view the map when i am driving, it is easy to touch the screen of the phone.<br /><br />Baby on Board sticker is UV and Water Resistant. It is made of Highest Quality Vinyl and hence its easy to apply on the car. It helps to warn driver that you have a baby in the car and not to follow your car closely.
B00UEABQ0Y|5|Fits perfect and comfortably
B00390VH96|5|Replaced my 4 year old ones that finally ripped.  Expect another 4 years.

B00BRJDM9E|5|Worked great until the gloves started falling apart
B00T47V2FW|5|Great quality A++
B00T5NKDSC|5|Absolutely wonderful emergency kit. I purchased this for my daughter who's starting her second year of college this fall. Luckily before giving it to her I charged it up and put it in my car to go to her house. I pulled out of my driveway and stopped immediately when I heard a noise. The tire was flat!! It took me a second to realize what I needed to do, but eventually pulled out the kit and aired the tire right up. I highly recommend putting one in your car.
B00M47XKMC|4|Works great for the price and don't have to listen to the wife complain anymore.
B00BCRMAR6|5|No complaints at all, came exactly as described and fit well.
B0016VGUGU|5|Fits great
B00PRTXTN4|1|It did not meet my expectations. For the price I expected moore. Was very disapoonted that there was no suction to pock up even the smallest dirt. The mini vac kept dropping the dirt back onto the floor.
B00CFMF7GI|5|Ver y good
B003PA07DC|5|It  worked fine and fit.
B00150T13G|5|We've used these before a few years back and it smells wonderful.  Don't let the scent name fool you, squash who thinks of squash smelling good?  Oh but it sure does smell really good.<br /><br />Cons:  The smell does not last that long.
B001C6N7ME|1|Could not get it to fit even after trying to shave it with a knife, so threw it out.
B003W5NWKA|5|The fit was perfect. My only complain is that it needs to have stronger support bars as it has a tendency to sag as the heat builds. I have to use my coin holder to help support the midsection.
B00379ABX2|5|Awesome
B001P2AZPC|5|Worked great to couple two 5&#34; static hoses I had together with some pipe clamps.  Solid with a little give...was exactly the coupler I needed for my dust collector.
B000GZAUQ8|3|Increase in horsepower, but not mileage. Wouldn't purchase again.
B006P8A6K0|5|Great quality!
B00WVJR0D8|5|I installed this bulb on an 03 Kawasaki KLR 650. The only modification I had to make was to the rubber boot that seals the bulb against the elements. All this required was a few slits to allow it to go over the fan assembly on the bulb. The light output is significantly better than stock and than a number of other after market bulbs. The most important part of a headlight for me is its ability to light up the sides of the road so I can see animals on the side of the road - BEFORE they run onto the road!!!  The animals we have to deal with are moose. They are nothing short of a fur covered brick wall; deadly for a motorcyclist to run into. The bulb does a wonderful job of lighting up the sides of the road on both low and high beam. High beam also does a great job getting down the road a good long way. You would have to buy some high dollar driving lights to do much better. We ride a lot in the rain and on rough roads so it's going to be interesting to see how long this unit holds up to the punishment. I have kept a record of the odometer reading and date in order to have that information for a long term review after some time and miles. I have high expectations. I WANT it to last because it works so well.<br />Frosting on the cake? I love the little turbine sound the fan makes when you turn the key on =)
B001I9XOXW|5|works great, just like it was supposed to.
B004BTAJ2A|4|It look nice
B005C57NA8|5|work good and fit was great
B00K5527EW|2|Only good for smooth flat lenses which most these days are not. Was no way to place them on a curved headlight with contours and it not crease or bubble.
B009E9JRM0|5|Exactly what I needed
B0097JKBDG|5|Well, I'm happy to see these for sale at Amazon. I've been buying them at a local auto parts store and paying over $25. I have not had any issues with this filter- no visible problems with quality. I use them on my Nissan Maxima with resulting better performance and gas mileage. Recommended.
B001B8P66S|5|Gift
B005O16IQA|5|Fits on my steering wheel of my Ford Sporttrack perfectly, great product!
B001KOL5SG|5|Nice
B00YQHFJFY|5|Great price, very good quality
B00T36ODKK|5|seems to work as advertised--ok with it so far.
B001C6E7GY|1|Did not fit my 02 wrx, I had to return for refund.
B006F9AKK0|5|2001 Z3 2.5i.  A real pain to put on, but was exactly like the OEM part (minus the cracks and dry rot).
B0006306NC|5|Great gauge. I do wish these came with a light dimmer as part of harness as they are bright at night. But it is a very nice gauge and works great. I put it in my 99 Cummins using the steering column mounting slide over gauge holder which also is great. This gauge did come with sending unit, which screwwed directly into stock fuel filter system, and the wiring harness. Install takes a good little while depending on how picky you are and on whether you know which wires are what in your current wiring harness.
B000M6TXHS|5|Excellent job as usual.  Fast delivery and great prices.  Keep up the good work!!
B000GTTWKE|5|Perfect, made one happy man
B00N3MPXAO|4|awesome product
B00XILM5GK|2|The end was off of one of the grips looks like it was glued on never used them still in the box.
B00LDRA3R4|5|Great lights.
B00E7WEFQ2|2|I loved while they lasted. I had them on my car for less than a week when one blew off. It wasn't even at a high speed. I was going 35mph.
B00B10GYPI|5|These arrived quickly and in excellent condition. They fit the interior of the 2015 Nissan Sentra perfectly. Only the driver's mat has holes to fix the mat to the floorboard, requiring the driver to remove the carpet floormat first (if applicable). The others can simply be placed atop the carpet mats if so desired. I am very happy with this purchase, and feel that my car's flooring is much better protected now!
B000NCOKZQ|5|Works just fine easy install
B000BP7M8W|5|This was an upgrade to the standard sewer hose that came with my Roadtrek. This is much sturdier.
B004LQCDOA|5|easy to air down and quickly as well.  well built product.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Great. Way less mess.
B000KZ2AUS|5|Great remote, easy to program
B001KS8AV2|5|Right fit, thanks.
B008G2YFOG|5|noticeable bonding between the clear material and the housing itself... yet far much clearer than the new oem parts.
B005FKA9G0|5|Great brakes. On time and completed order. Many bad ratings but may order was flawless. Highly recommend, saved me a lot of money. Went  on easily.
B000GV6S2C|5|Showed up in excellent condition. Wife loves them.
B006LJ80C4|5|received on time, form,fit,function met expectations.
B009RPFMP2|5|This was a good assortment of various sizes. Everything was as described and it arrived in a normal timeframe. I would buy from these folks again.
B000B5SA2Y|5|A tad too high for a low model but went in easily and works great!<br />That is to say not an exact replacement. Old one was 35 yrs old so expect some changes.
B008S2AWO6|1|This switch does not work! do not get it. Tried two different switches from this seller and both did not work. After 3 months of trouble shooting i installed oem switch and everything is back to normal.
B00DULUN8K|3|Smaller than expected but very functional.
B000EQE40M|5|Fits Perfect !!!
B00CZBQCR2|5|worked well. used one in a tailgate of a 2001 toyota tundra and just tied it into the factory locks. the only thing is, they require a bit of amperage. when tied into the factory lock/unlock harness, they drew so much power that none of the lock solenoids had enough power to work. so two relays and a lot of wiring and connections later, and they work like a charm.
B0047ROXOG|5|Good!
B00SIDSPGC|1|Falls apart :(
B003BG7HY2|2|I ordered this kit and the water pump is GMB brand and was made in Thailand, not in Japan as they advertised.
B00ECCOX8C|5|A beautiful gift for myself and my family;)
B00GYHU1N4|1|The item I received was fake. The front label does not match the original label, and the product states 'Made in Thailand' when the real My Shaldan is made in Japan as the description states. Buyer beware.
B00WNFQ7M0|5|Excellent
B00EM8944O|4|This works! I tried nu-finish scratch remover and didn't work. Yes I know you can't remove a scratch, but this  did a great job
B00HFLH5LE|5|Easy install and worked great!
B00NYC5V96|1|I am really disappointed about the lack of true updating on this disk.  My wife and I used the navigation system and Waze to go on vacation recently and we found that the Honda navigation was way too dated and Waze was a much better platform to travel with.
B0090149R0|2|Not very sturdy, as you would hope.
B00VUU0BGM|1|It works but the vehicle doesn't recognize it when turning so it flashes at a higher speed to indicate there is a burned out bulb. Is not compatible with the 08 Chevrolet Impala.
B00B3L2DQO|5|It is a perfect sticker for hubby's tool box
B008QR1ASK|5|As Advertised, product and delivery
B00U1706L0|5|Nice headlamp, not too big or smnall
B001FNG7BM|3|Ended up being wrong one so was uselless
B0068FUOMA|1|Wrong picture, when I received the item it was not for my helmet. The picture is for a N102, but the item is for a N104.
B00BG3XJYO|5|Worked as advertised.  Had to re-arrange my fuel lines but other than that, it works...
B0049ZBPJ2|4|Performs as expected
B003ZWHHGU|4|good quality
B00REJXFM0|5|Easy to install and fits well.
B00BGAV0BQ|4|Quality is good.  Finish and manufacturing quality is better than average.  Have not sued extensively yet so cannot give 5 stars.
B00873J0YY|4|The racks arrived on time and work well, these are defently not a high quality rack, I found them a little flimsy and a few defects one one. But overall they work well for the one trip a year I'm gonna use them on.
B008G24SL6|5|Excellent
B00OYC58XO|5|nice matts. they are heavy duty and you ca cut them to fit.
B00AH8BI7E|5|Love the item  - received as promised.  Item easy to use.  disappointed that Zipper broke after one use, but Velcro still working.
B00480N19K|5|Nice bulb for the money. Would buy again.
B003FPQFCO|5|Great product never seen any thing like it
B008WUY2MC|5|cool
B003PA0B9W|5|Same store quality as you could see anywhere, completely satisfied...  Keep in mind these are one for the left end of the tail gate and one for the other end of the tail gate.  On Fords, the part on the tail gate is welded on at the factory and you cannot buy them anywhere, except maybe the dealership.
B0002F668S|4|Worked good.
B004I8HKEE|1|This thing is a POS. Made of really bad plastic material, DOES NOT FIT my 2004 Subaru Impreza WRX. To get it to kinda fit, i had to cut about ½ inch on each side, even after that it didn't fit.. I honestly thing it makes my car look worse up close.<br />You can see in the picture how it didn't fit the curve on the back of the car. I had to use a bunch of electrical tape so you didn't see the blue on my car. Don't buy :-)
B0002SRH7O|5|Great set of tool. Used them on a BMW X5, Busted those control arm ball joints like butter.
B00KCBYCOM|5|Great value for the money when compared to dealer installed options. Spend an hour on installation and save yourself about $600 .Easy install. The only hard part is opening the factory clips on the bottom side of the tailgate. Works well in my 2015 Tacoma.
B00498YJL0|4|good
B00V56U28I|3|Works for about two months
B007USCM7E|3|The gauge didn't work that well. When it finally worked right, it said I overcharged it.
B000ELVJZU|5|Works pewrfectly.
B00SBZRELY|5|Awesome
B00EA0ZB7I|2|Cheap light had one fail 2 weeks after instal. Buy a nice pair
B003S1RQ2S|1|Won't hold charge after 3 days
B00DWKXLEM|4|These are good and bright and very easy to install, but they flicker on and off sometimes other than that great product..
B00ICSWGJ0|5|I drive a BMW which uses synthetic oil and I have always used Castrol Edge.  My vehicle now has upwards of 200,000 miles and has had next to now issues.  This is a high quality oil for the price.
B00CX5SPB6|5|Showed up before the time estimate, fit perfectly and works great!  Like another reviewer said this one is a little shorter than the original one, but works just fine.
B007JSGR9Y|5|I would give this 10 Stars if I could, It is simple design and easy to use. If you don't need a fancy reader, and only need to know what is wrong and be able to clear the code to shut off the Check Engine Light. If these are the only 2 things you really care about, then this is a great investment
B001EP0GMW|4|perfect fit,,arrived schrach
B00LCXWED0|1|It sucks.. Broke trying to put then on... Don't spend your money on such crap
B00L9NHZGY|5|It has the port for the vaccum tube shown in picture and has a hole for maf aswell (no sizing /threading required)
B004IBZS04|5|I loved it got on on Thursday but then I got in a accident Friday so I'll Probaly be buying another one.
B001DRJN0C|4|Fit perfect and easy installation
B00RTFB3UA|5|Nice product at half of OEM costs. Came in a very timely manner!!
B000UK22TC|5|shipped fast.good price.
B00LNOVDOO|5|Cover looks good on my truck. Instructions leave a little to be desired but went on in about 20 minutes. The side rails and the front and rear aren't marked but the long rails go to the sides of the bed. I would recommend to someone looking for a good cover but doesn't want to spend a lot of money.
B0024NWW9I|5|Perfect. Got them real good time. Actually early. The fit and was exactly what I wanted. Thanks !
B000F79Z7M|5|look and work great
B007V2C2G0|5|This heat shield exceeded my expectations and I plan on getting many years of use from it.  It is sturdy, fits the entire window area snugly and looks great.
B0082365AQ|5|Like all the other reviews the tires smeel horrible I did take the warning and put them on the deck to air out. As for needing instructions for assembly there are only two clips that hold the wheels on don't see the problem. I discarded the tiedown straps and used bungee cord I think it works much better keeping tension on the boats. The cart dose a great job going back and forth to the boat ramp which is about a 1/4 mile away. The best thing is it frees up the truck. A final note on the tires we have a dog that has to pee on every thing with only one smeel they are still pee free.
B00JZ5BBJU|5|PERFECT. I received the product very quick. I wanted something to represent Puerto Rico other than a flag. This decal is great and red is my favorite color. Looks great on the back window of my tacoma. Perfect size as well
B00MFB7R94|5|These were a little expensive but after getting them they ARE very well made and worked perfect for my application.
B00N71ZNTC|2|rubber broke in less than a month. car sits outside but still...
B001UCB1C8|4|Received quick, installed right away, work great with no issues on my 2010 Silverado
B00J62ZTJU|5|It fits my &#34;12 nissan frontier. .... bolts a little off but I was  able to make wk
B00NCLR1BU|5|fit right on and looks great.
B000C2WF9A|2|key not working..
B009M4PMIK|5|OEM replacement for Husqvarna 6021P. Exact same plug. 18MM deep socket.
B00EVY2SKG|5|exactly as described, arrived on time, great price!
B007T4JTHU|4|exact fit
B007RRSZQ0|2|Don't buy this product if you expect to use the pen, it does not work only The little paintbrush that comes with it Will work.
B001G7NH9M|5|totally pleased with this product
B002S70MP6|5|Worked very well for me. AC was around 75 and after a full can it dropped to 50. As for some other reviews, yes the gauge is not the best, BUT only use the gauge numbers when the compressor is ON. Otherwise its an inaccurate reading. Its best to get a digital thermometer and add coolant till you get to 50-40 degrees.
B009AQS4IU|5|Very pretty, high quality.
B00HWGD2CS|4|So far, so good for my 2013 Leaf.  Install was easy and I like the holster.
B00VGL6CWW|5|Perfect fit. I have a heavy duty receiver hitch that most locking pins couldn't reach and lock. Not this one! It's perfect! Fast delivery and excellent product. Great description matches product in every category.
B00NI4YHJ0|5|exactly what we needed and on time. thank you.
B005ES621E|1|grease has come out and bearing has play in it only 2 weeks and 1500 miles after installation.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|It worked great until some bone head stole it off the front of the truck. The instillation brackets are not very strong and it was just broke off. It did put out plenty of light.
B000VU56Z8|5|Fits my 14 f150 6.5 bed perfectly. Looks awesome and does the job.
B00NRYZCLS|5|It fit and was well put together.
B00LG07MZE|5|Excellent sun shade for Honda Civics
B00CXAGE2S|5|Great
B00RY3RE3M|5|Awesome! Love it!
B00BRMIBME|3|nice
B0058IMW9Q|5|Got it fast.  It works as it is supposed to.
B005ZG64N6|3|It is a nice chrome license plate, excellent quality but the chrome caps and washers were not included in package as described.
B009AA2HDO|5|Solid product.
B000WJFF6S|4|Nice small tire repair set.
B00KRMS2H4|5|This stuff is the real deal! No exaggeration on gains when using this product.
B0050DD0GS|5|The brackets move the floorboards forward and out by 1&#34;.  I was worried about dragging the floorboards easier because of the moving them out.  I still drag floorboards but not really any difference from before I installed these. I guess its because moving them forward an inch the rear of the floorboard is a little higher than original.<br />The brackets are heavy and fit the oem brackets well.  There is a set screw on them to tighten them up to keep them from moving around.  The floorboards will still move up as they did on the oem bracket.  The chrome looks good, but time will tell as they are on a part of the bike that gets hit with water, mud, sand etc.<br />Overall I am liking these as I can get my feet and legs out a little bit farther from the motor/pipes and I can use all of the floorboard instead of the just the outside half.
B00P2MS5RG|5|It came right on time, was easy to put on.
B0002STSW6|5|Great value, better than the plastic ones. Mine is perfect.
B000EQR7XS|5|perfect fit arrived on time
B000E4JLM0|5|Perfect fit!  My tailgate looks good again.
B000P4UD6C|5|Excellent
B00L4HRDJO|5|Mine was shipped by discount keyless, came with screw.  Looks really close to the original.  Original case only (front and back plus screw) here in NJ is $70 plus cost to have key cut.  For $5, you cant go wrong.
B004A0ZLSC|5|Mat fit perfectly in the 2015 Dodge Ram truck.  Heavy weight mat.
B00QL1TPI0|5|The automobile seat delivered was exactly what we wanted. It appears to solve the problem for my wife in her car to enhance vision and comfort. There have been comments about durability but since she doesn't drive that much doesn't seem to be an issue. Well constructed and very nice material for an economic price. When it wears out we'll purchase another one. The tapering mimics the actual seat to enhance comfort and vision.
B00I2WVJTO|5|great
B00B53ZMRW|5|These tip are top notch, very clean TIG welding
B0009IQZPW|3|They were too small to get a good grip on as I was applying the compound on my car. other than that it was ok to use .
B00ENO3IQW|5|Thanks,  perfect
B00E5UF2JK|5|Great helmet!!!  Son Loves it!
B004N1GNM6|1|Be warned, Motor Drive does not last, mine broke after 3 months, replacement motors for stock regulators do not fit.
B002N5W8Q4|4|works very good had one about 10 years until batter leaked
B000E2APZO|5|You do have to trim the S&S cleaner base a little.. but it really is a great fit and replaced my crumbling original filter nicely.  It's only the seventh or eighth K&N I've purchased over the years... yes I am a fan.
B000BUU5Z4|5|very good
B00T2GT9L4|4|HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE IT YET, BUT DID ASK A QUESTION OF ANKER AND THEY ANSWERED PROMPLY.  LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THE CHARGER WHEN I NEED IT.
B00JF5LRN0|4|Great for Highway Travel (95%) of what I need it for.  Looks good, easy to construct.  If you are going to be doing significant off road activity, I would get one with no henge.  Overall we were pleased, this gets most of our cargo and suit cases outside of the vehicle for family trips, which makes the ride more enjoyable.
B000AXE7DI|5|Works great on the grill for cleaning after meals
B00152Y2II|5|Exact replacement.  Comes with never seize in the package and relatively easy to install if you have the Sensor tools.
B007XZK816|4|Good stuff
B00651BVDI|5|Sporty antenna. Works great!
B002DKX2XM|5|Totally Great and all inclusive would be great at twice the price. Showed me how to fix a problem I have had my bike in shop three times with no results
B004UQQT0A|4|New product to me - Relieve a lot of my windshield speckling, but not all, the truck is 21 years old - made the water stand on all the glass and help with over all clarity - No harm or hazing - I'll use it routinely. Thinking might be helpful for vehicles that go through sandy and dusty environments,
B000CPCMC2|5|I like Raybestos pads and shoes. I find they fit well, perform well and last pretty long. Thank you
B00KTIAREM|5|Good product
B00ABZ7NMM|5|Did just what it was supposed to.
B00B8Y0QPG|5|All parts included. Easy installation. Looks great on our jeep.fast shipping.
B00EQMQDAO|4|Pretty good deal considering they are actually Power Stop branded calipers and power stop Z16 pads. No markings on rotors but they look like good quality. Packaging could have been better as every box arrived pretty beat up, one of them had to be repackaged by the shipper. Will update review when installed.
B00LGIDEVC|5|excellent item. works great
B001LQHSSY|5|Nice. Great touch for my wife's Cadillac!
B001JK23QY|5|Time-serts are the best way to go. We use them on Harley repairs.
B0013LDM46|3|Would not fit over my grips with the thumb rest. Otherwise would work fine
B001C6OWTG|5|Bought this for my 2006 Nissan 350z Touring Edition to replace the old worn out one.  My clutch pedal would not return properly and I don't think that the adjustment rod would have fixed 100% so i opted to replace both the master/slave cylinder plus add a Stainless Steel braided clutch line.  Seems to be working great so far.  I will post an update after a few months.
B000ET5TGW|5|Improved performance and saves on fuel. Changed out plugs @ 67000 miles on my cts and you can feel the difference.
B000CD6GLM|1|While I have had success with Valeo in the past (RX-7 and Toyota Pickup), on my 1995 F-350 I haven't found anything but Motorcraft that fit the curve of the windshield.  With these wipers they would skip over the most important part of the viewing area directly in front of the driver every time on the &#34;upstroke&#34; and get a little of the rain when parked on the &#34;downstroke&#34; but if the truck was moving, forget it and lean over to the passenger side.  Tried Goodyears from Costco, better but still unacceptable.
B00KN18DL4|5|Been on my car for over a year now still looks brand new
B0002KKIQO|5|Cleans my daughters jeep top great. Love
B001GMX9FO|4|installed and operating as advertised
B0006JLW5M|2|product came loose and fell off after hours of carefully placing it on van .
B00ES3TDJY|1|I think that I would have been better off printing this sticker on my printer at home. Looks like thats what they did here. Terrible quality. Look elsewhere.
B004PIIAZ0|5|Perfect
B008C0WV16|4|Fits the front window of my car perfectly.  Only wish it were a little more pliable.
B001KP2U16|5|Part was in perfect condition, and fit my car beautifully!
B0009NUG66|5|Very good
B001UG4WIO|2|Looked cool. Pretty low quality. Already peeled off
B0067UJMD8|5|This IAC works great on my 5.2L Magnum engine in my Dodge truck.  I had a Standard Motor Parts IAC in there for a while and it was very laggy compared to this one.  This OEM part seems to respond much quicker so when there's a sag in idle speed it brings it to where it needs to be very quickly.  I have had it in my truck for 4 months now and it has performed flawlessly so far.  I'll update the review if I run into any problems.
B00L4LFYK0|5|Very solid...will definitely buy again.
B00Y5NCEN4|1|This thing looks  but it is no louder than the stock horn on my Victory. Got ripped off again.
B0068FYGDS|1|Would not work on my 2004 Harley road King.
B00ZW66RXQ|5|These are more than great! After 4 different sellers I finally found pure white 194 led. They are way brighter than the blue tinted white led's. I'll post a pic showing the difference in my Trailblazer dome light during daytime. Yitamotor led left vs AGT led right. Also a great pic during night. Great product for a great price. Very very highly recommended!!
B00WOT3YM6|5|Ive used this pump on. Motorcycle tires 60psi, truck tires 35psi and car tires 33psi. Works well. Digitakl readout & auto shut off is great. Great value quality pump.
B000E28EL6|5|Does this hitch fit a 2011 Silverado
B000IYNVN6|5|Perfect fitment and good quality.
B00XTY2CHI|5|If you are in the business of construction and road work etc. This is definitely the way to go as it may seem a little cheap when u receive it but definitely wait until installed to pass judgment as this has been the replacement to the lighting prior installed costing over 3800 as this new technology as killed the market cause these lights are what they say they are and they are bright i wish the connections wires were longer but definitely a great product and there right on the money with shipping i received it the day i was promised
B003P640E8|5|My hubby loved mine, I ended up buying a set for car also.
B00HSGNL96|4|Good funnel for hyundai sonata oil change fitment. Will sit in the hole.
B009DK6CQO|5|Fit great on my 06 Chevy Trailblazer.  My husband had no problem installing it on my car. I am so thankful that it fit, I think that the price is amazing to because the shop wanted so much more for the same part.
B009465R2M|5|Love them look great on my Harley
B003TU7L0U|5|Used this to line my trunk and rear deck panel. Cut the road noise noticeably. Enhanced the sound of my rear speakers, also. Thought the strong asphalt odor they give off on initial opening might be a problem; however, once applied and cured, there was no odor whatsoever. Have used other similar products that cost much more and FatMat performs just as well at a much more wallet friendly price. Can't go wrong with this.
B00FMUZ4TA|5|They helped break up the white everything on my truck. Be careful applying as they will not come off without damage if applied crooked.
B000N8F0P4|5|This worked out great for me
B00GHT8NM0|5|Good quality and easy to install
B005C2ACBI|3|They are nice an long. A little wider than I anticipated. But one broke on me and It made me sad.now I don't have a set.
B00062ZICM|1|Looks great once installed, but after only a month the seals went bad and started leaking fuel all over the place. Bought this as better replacment for a cheap clear filter, but at least that one did not leak, so I'm using the cheap one again for now. Would not recommend.
B001Y8XRFC|5|Great buy!
B00KGGTGO4|5|I've been trying to find a shade which will cover the front window of a Sprinter van based motorhome.  Class A sunshields are far to big.  Extra large Costoco sunshields are too small.  This is just about perfect. If you are looking for a shade for your sprinter that can be compact and easy to use, this is the one.
B005IV1CR6|4|Havn't install them yet, look like they will work
B00JIEX722|5|Super bright replacement!
B001JT7B3A|4|Item is as described and well constructed. I use it as a power port on my motorcycle.
B00SISKX58|5|These caps matched the original caps that I currently have and fit the rim on my car (not the original rim for the '02 C320 but if you're original caps look like this you should be fine). They came packaged nicely and earlier than expected. It does take a bit of time seeing that they are coming from China, but it's worth the wait. I only needed 2 so I have 2 extras just in case something goes wrong. Great price. Great product.
B00K35U5X4|5|Perfect fit and really easy to install - 2007 liberty
B00CMHY0UA|5|parts arrived in a timely manner. it fit on my 2007 Honda Civic EX Coupe 1.8L perfectly.  I had to use all 4 shims provided with the kit for proper gapping of the clutch plate.  The disassembly and assembly without removing the compressor from the car was difficult however. Also, invest in a good pair of deep external snap ring pliers!
B001GJ3DZS|3|Works with a good wash.
B007Q1DQHK|4|great
B00K1N43M2|2|fan ran backwards
B000E4OK2Q|4|Good fit for my 98 ZR-2. Good quality and easy install.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works great!  No lag on 3 out of 4 cars when using DashCommander on Android phone...1999 Civic has small delay between reving engine and seeing response on phone.  People witnessing delays, delays are most likely coming from cars computer...not the OBD2 connector.
B00WKTTNEI|4|Ties on easily
B005BHCE24|4|Bag fits perfect on my Harley tour pack. I have the Air Wing rack and straps and snaps are all positioned perfectly.  100% water proof! Holds alot of gear.
B00L7XHITU|4|They look excellent on my red 98 f250. They also fit in flush with nothing sticking out.  The only problem  was where they mount on the tailgate side. I had to modify the holes on the tail light so that I could use the screws to hold them in place.
B00X2TUW1I|5|Our son had always pulled the suction cup type shade off of the window so we gave these a try. They work perfectly! They fit size of our cross-over vehicle without letting a sliver of sun in but the baby can still see what's going on outside. They come off of the window very easily and are reapplied easily. When removed, they fold up in to themselves to neatly store. The shade is well-made and customer service is beyond great. Definitely recommend.
B007OWW15Y|5|Exactly as described.  Just what I needed to use as a protector/deflector for my trans cooler
B006ZNCT00|1|PICTURES SHOWN NOT ACCURATE
B00GM2CYWW|5|Came in and gave my car that update look<br />Looks really good and easy to install
B00P2KANI2|5|Used these to replace the actuators on my Malibu and they are working well.
B00429NKWK|5|Worked great. Headlights look amazing.<br /><br />Make sure you read all the directions before beginning. I made the mistake of using all the surface prep spray in the beginning, not knowing I would need it again after sanding.
B000EDSSDY|3|A whole lot smaller then I had thought it to be, but it will do.
B003PI2BFG|5|mounted up perfectly, I took a couple of hours and made sure everything was done to my expectations. I was able to do it all solo, I highly recommend watching the install video on youtube and carefully going through the instructions.
B000R3SMMS|5|Fits like a glove. Well worth the investment. Been using it for over a year and a half. Still like new.
B000YYNZFY|5|great
B000C9FI7Y|5|Fixed Intermitant A/C problem in 5 minutes
B00063X38M|5|Work fast because it does!!!
B00597ML2Y|4|They look good and fit great... good seal around the eyes.  I would definitely buy another pair if I lose these!
B004VDT54Y|5|easy fit and looks great!
B00V6X2BDY|1|Battery life was about 15 minutes hooked it up worked great to start the atv rode it around for about ten minutes s*** it off and nothing...tested it tested out at 4.3 bolts....battery is toast took battery out of another machine and tested atv worked great rode it the whole next day no problems....
B00K16FUIK|5|very good , have two hi class white cars this armor was and wax is the best !
B001R5U38G|5|I used this on a modified supercharged MINI Cooper S. The belt drives the supercharger. With other belts, I would get stretching over a short time and cause belt slip. I've had this belt on for 3 months and it seems to be holding tight, very little stretch.
B00D3298A0|5|Again ,I am very pleased with this product. It shows you exactly where to cut it to get a perfect fit.I ordered the cargo mat for the back of my 2005 jeep liberty also. I bought my jeep new and have never found the rubber mats that would fit perfect.
B00N6D7K38|2|They look bright when looking at them, but they hardly light the road.
B00230IUX4|5|Excellent Product. Good price. Quick Delivery.
B00VT5UCQW|3|Arrived quicker than expected.  Looks good. The fit is loose though.
B00A2WRJ7S|5|Arrived on time,  easy to apply, looks great on the truck
B00GYTEBPQ|5|Perfect replacement
B00MNSN568|5|These were put on the back of a side by side as backup lights and they work great very well built and very bright super pleased would buy them again.
B005JU5YCU|5|USED ON VACATION AND THEY WORKED GREAT!
B00CII917K|5|Perfect!
B001L1MGEU|4|Stylish and cool to the touch
B00PTQOF4W|5|makes it simple to hook up lights bars on a jeep
B007JPXH8Q|5|Just what I needed!!!
B00A7EPYLE|5|Used this for a couple years now and it is pretty durable.  the light is not quite a Flood and not quite Focused (in between) but is bright enough you can't have it shining in your eyes either!  The hooks fully swivel on both ends and I figured they would 'give way' a long time ago but are partly flexible and holding strong - as well, pretty useful!
B009KW82CC|5|Surprisingly good quality, looks and feels like a fair amount of craftsmanship went into making this product. A fun, attention grabbing keychain to have.
B00LWKO7C4|5|Work and look great! Easy install! Make sure you silicone the screw holes.
B00SR43VHU|1|doesn't fit around my key
B0088YE6YQ|5|Worked perfectly!! My mechanic quoted me $900 - my son used these and saved me a ton of money! :)
B0080MXQFQ|5|A big improvement to the look of my Beetle.  The originals were scratched up and the plastic brittle which explains why one fell off somewhere.
B00OBZ9H4A|2|Look fantastic. But material Is super soft, easy to distort when removing backing.
B005N766KI|2|These are extremely small... like little girl sizes ... the medium ones do not even fit my 12 year old daughter who is a size 5 ...
B0017KMKZU|5|Easy installation, good looking pad!
B001LQMEY2|5|very high quality works great like all ac Delco products
B00DM8NCM0|2|did not fit correctly
B00Q7QY2YG|4|Fits in my 2004 Subaru WRX excellent. This shift knob + blue interior lights look pretty dope. Only gripe is that its a little taller than i thought.
B00NQH69PE|5|I ordered a second unit.  perfect for hunting or sporting clay shoots.  Holds high dollar guns securely.
B001P2F020|5|Perfect fit. Took longer to open the box than to install.
B001P2BL9G|5|VERY HAPPY- Shipped quickly and packed well!  All installed on truck and son pleased with them!
B0023TQEFQ|5|replaced schrader valve on AC with another tool and it worked awesome.
B00L3OJW4C|5|Great product.  Been using it for about 4 months and it does exactly what I ask.  Construction is great.  may want to take some needle nose pliers to change fuses on the road but that keeps them from getting loose on the dirt roads.
B004HXIR5Q|4|I recomend this product for the price. The chains work great, and I've been in several winter hikes. The only down side is that started to rust withing few weeks, even when I rice off after every hike.
B00IUU6O9I|1|Bought 2 sets of these for a 2015 Nissan Rogue and a 2014 Nissan Maxima. I have to think these problems will be true for most newer cars:<br /><br />The back seat bench cover completely hid all the seatbelt latches on the seat (as well as the entire middle seatbelt), so use of seat belts in the back is impossible with this installed. Headrest covers are included, but the back seat cover has no holes to accommodate the headrests themselves, so you WILL NOT be able to use headrests in the back, unless you cut holes in them yourself. The back seat bench cover requires you to connect loops with S-hooks under the seat, but there was almost no room under the seat to get my hands in there, so this was impossible.<br /><br />Also, there is an armrest/cup holder console that swivels down in the middle of the back seat, and the cover made this impossible to use.<br /><br />We returned these, and I think a better option for the back may be to buy 2 front seat covers. Though it's a bench seat, the right and left sides are actually separate. This will allow the seatbelt latches and middle seatbelt to remain free and the console to swivel down, and the front seat covers DO have holes for the headrest.
B001A6SQWW|5|Absolutely love this helmet! I'm a tiny woman, 100 pounds, so I think it looks a little bulky on me but I bought it for safety, not style. It is very comfortable and I love how you can choose to cover your ears or not. Great quality and you can't beat the price!
B0012WHBSO|5|Powerful compact unit.  Used numerous times for slow leaks on car tires.  Fills quickly.  Long cord.
B00CXUGZ4U|5|Came very nicely packaged and didn't even need adjusting. The light that came with was very good quality and has lasted for a long time now. The only thing to consider is there is no directions so take that in mind before ordering.
B0036IA77O|5|Fast shipping!!!!! Thanks!!!
B002K6K3RM|5|Great price and bargain, no issues here
B000FOVLAO|2|This lift has poor instructions and will not clear 35&#34; tires. I had to put a 2.5&#34; leveling kit as well for my tires to clear.
B00Q2UPTXU|4|Looks great on my bike can be little difficult to get off without a wrench.
B00RSOLXFM|1|Mine does not work, no difference in the air when i use it in the car. I've got an ozonator at home, so this little thing is producing zero results
B0009IQXJ0|5|Long lasting shine
B009TB5Z7E|2|The product dimensions that are listed are incorrect.  Under the description &#34;Product Dimensions&#34; read &#34;50x39x2&#34;.  The actual dimensions of the product I received are &#34;50x48x2&#34;.  A nine inch difference is huge.  Will be sending this back.
B008KSLCRY|5|Great product really shot down temp  iam happy
B00852684M|5|[[VIDEOID:c79db1eb513dfb76603e4dd9c9b03d72]]Abco Tech LED Flash Tyre Wheel are super cool and awesome.We are a family for three ( couple and a kid) and all of us love biking every evening during the summer and sometimes it does get dark by the time we are returning back home.All our bikes are using these leds and we are loving it.These are  motion activated so you don't have to remember to turn them on or off and they make our bikes more visible at night and looking rather cool in the process.<br />The pack included 3 pack of 2 x green 2 x blue 2 x colorful LED Valve Bike Lights.<br />For the price its a steal...and yes the plastic isnt the best of quality but then look at the price. They are easy enough to screw onto your bike and  come right on and off easily and quickly.When i first tried them it did not work and i thought was a waste or damaged then i saw some reviews and found that there is a piece of paper between the batteries that needs to be removed before putting on bike( shown in my review video). I would recommend the seller to add this in the instruction so that people don't misunderstand as i did.overall its a fun product and would recommend it totally.I received this for a discounted price to provide my unbiased reviews.
B000KL32YU|5|I like this hose becauseit is compact, but streches out to reaches where I need it to be used. I use it on a deck garden tower and do not want to use a hose that has lead or other contaminates in it.
B000SXCLIS|3|Looks like it's starting to fade. ....
B000GU3EFW|5|Great item as described; real nice addition to rear fender.
B001AXGT7O|5|Installation was an easy-breezy project - attached to the frame underneath the trailer. Easy to remove once at boat launch. Outstanding product to take your boat off-road to those remote lakes or rivers - bumps and rattling does not affect motor being &#34;suspended.&#34;<br /><br />Our set-up is simple - flatbed trailer with inflatable (15.5') and 15 Suzuki outboard. No more concerns about transom while going on gravel roads and even off-road...<br /><br />LOVE IT!
B00FADIZYA|5|Great wipers, no issues. The fitment was a bit tight compared to OEM.
B00513G82U|5|Its awesome. Thanks
B000HJBF3K|5|great drip pan. It is just right for my leaky antique Willys.
B000CEO708|5|Perfect fit great product !
B004EI6A8K|4|works well.
B000GGJQ7G|5|love it
B00QO1ENMA|5|Great product, quick delivery
B00WOY33EA|5|Fixes the problem, quick and easy.  Gets rid of the bad factory design.
B00FBSFZQU|4|Great. Used the same mounting holes as the original.
B001CA8W6Q|5|perfect fit with no issues and it works great...
B00JTUBP6U|5|Great product.
B0024E6QX0|5|Product is very well made works great for the RV I'm very satisfied with the reflective material one side it seems to cut down on the heat entering the RV when trying to pull it. We have not use the product during the winter yet but I could see where it could be a very well insulator for those cold nights.
B002EW9JL8|5|Item was great ! Great buy
B0081SC7O0|4|I have used these switches several times on ford tractors and they will fit about all tractors.  They are easy to install and work well as long as you have a remote starter button.
B001DH0P9U|5|Excellent
B000C57W1S|5|You will have to install the grease fitting and the hole is not threaded. Not much trouble to use the fitting to cut the threads but getting it started can make you say some new words. The ball/head is larger than OEM but the tapper shank is direct fit, this must be a problem they solved (hints problem solver). The larger ball must provide more surface and some other stuff, just remember to pack it with grease after installing it.<br />If you are doing what I did and bought Tie Rod End boots to replace the rubber style with poly then you need to get these and measure first. Energy Suspension part 9.13102R does not fit. Even though they would fit my OEM rods.
B0042KJV9U|5|Works great, very satisfied
B009GLDSTO|5|Seems to work really well on my 2016 cx-5. Easy install with YouTube video.
B00BEXGPVA|3|cheap but functions well
B005N53AM2|5|Love!! Just what I wanted! No problems. Fits my 09 Honda Accord perfectly
B00HE68SYI|5|Worked well and covered the small dings. Easier to use brush,  pen top applies to much
B00CPW2A4A|1|Warning! Unless you want something bootleg that does not fit in your car do not buy this product they are garbage they don't even fit the contour of the car with the door lines and the window trim!
B000C30J0Q|5|fits and works fine on a mercury cougar 2.5 year 98.5 with a/c
B005RR42LY|5|Very nice! I bought these for my son's acura tl and he loves them. He says they were very easy to install.  And they look sharp
B001N729FS|5|works well
B00M0443ZW|5|Love the look
B00PV37ZEA|5|My daughter loves this Bag for all the kids trash in car
B00R45Y55K|1|Horrible product. First time 3 out of 5 lights didn't work out of the box,  the second time (replacement,  after I had paid for next day shipping only to have them not work for the car show)  ZERO OUT OF 5 WORK OUT OF THE BOX.<br /><br />Would give zero stars if I could
B00VF7HZF0|5|Excellent product. Met my expectations
B009SEG60M|3|not as good as i thought, spray nozzel kept leaking
B009SUBTSA|2|The Keychain was very small
B000NKCM2Q|5|Loving it
B00IEEW2LY|5|Good
B004CRC352|4|Showed up as described. It shrinks just like other high quality shrink tube I have used in the past
B00I59XBEK|1|Disappointed that the font isn't what the picture showed. It is just a basic font. Also it doesn't fit the area around the mousepad. The one I got was also white and not black. I don't know what I'm going to do with it either.
B006E4SKQ2|5|Lovett
B00KN282X2|4|worked well , looks great for a knockoff , and inexpensive.
B00CAWROEG|5|If all you are doing is an aftermarket intake and exhaust, this will set you up perfectly.  Brings the crispness back to the throttle (2012 883 Iron) and the power curve back and you can feel the gains in the &#34;butt dyno&#34;.  (The stock intake and exhaust are restrictive)<br /><br />If you can install a high-flow air filter, you can install these.  With a couple zip-ties, it looks factory.  If you ever have to remove them (to go to stage II and a tuner) it is even easier.
B00814921K|5|Super Bright, Exactly what I needed. These are about an inch long so make sure they'll fit before you order.
B003TNHEO0|4|HI, I like to be lifted off the car seat so I am more cool. This kind has plastic in it instead of coils of metal. It seems longer on the bottom or may slip. It is ok. I am glad they still make this type of seat cover. It is a good design and look good. Happiness...
B00493UPL8|5|This also solved my problem. My c5 was having problems with the signal lights while the hazard lights worked normally. Overtime they both went out completely and randomly would work, did some research and decided to replace this switch like people suggested and it fixed my problem. Saved me a lot money doing it myself rather then letting the shop look for the problem. Had a little trouble taking old switch off but I eventually just needed a small flat head ( after removing knee cover under steering wheel). I stuck the screw driver along the top and bottom of switch to remove plastic lip, then moved it towards the side that appears blue here, however, on the original it appears blue and a dark red area, I pushed in between the red and green wall and pushed it right out. Could not find any helpful video that explained that. Others showed it pushed right out  maybe mine was just stuck. I would recommend replacing this first before taking it to he looked at.
B00GW3E7C6|2|Not sturdy and straps not tight! Comes loose easy😕
B001AY2WLU|5|great gadget to have handy
B002C5YU20|5|My mom loved it
B00IZFNJ6Y|5|Works great eazy to use
B00EPROSES|1|Great price but 2 coils died within a month. Don't buy!  Other 2 coils burnt out a month later!
B00KY0ND82|5|installed easily and has been working good and true for the past month without problems!
B00AEH4PP0|5|Fits like a glove and arrived quickly!
B00474N160|2|These don't stay in location but they work and feels more comfortable . And look cute .
B006RUMDKC|2|Leaves less residue than other orange cleaners, but the small layer it leaves is enough to attract dust that sticks to it, making the removed letters still visible. I may be missing a trick or two, but I can't say it lives up to it's name in my case. I read in the instructions that I need to let it soak in for a minute, but in less time than that, it is already dry, so perhaps I need to use it when it is cool outside.  Not worth the money in my case..........gasoline worked as well, for $2.68 per gallon......Joe
B00E9W2PPS|5|Worked great
B012X49ENY|5|I love using this accessory in my car. It keeps my car clutter free and it just attaches to the head of my seat. It's so minimal without having a bulky bag. Great product!
B0043D7LBQ|5|A perfect fit for our 2005 Honda accord. Came with everything shown.
B005F9GY4M|5|Perfect fit and function.  And cheap!
B00JM5ZC70|4|Great price for a great product!
B0024NSKZ8|5|The headlights were fine.  We still haven't gotten the adjustment right on high beam, but we will.  Thanks.
B003SS62PS|5|We live in the desert, so this fan came in handy for my daughter in the back seat.
B0010Z4MDK|5|The battery works great for my home security system (it's kind of an off-brand ADT, I think).  The old battery finally died.  Interestingly, I was able to use a spare automatic gate battery until this one came in.  I think as long as it's between 5 and 8amps, you're good to go.  That's what my security person told me over the phone anyway.<br /><br />The only issue I had is that the metal contacts were just *slightly* too big for the metal clips that my security system was using.  I tried creating a make-shift bridge out of paper clips, and that probably would have worked, but my paper clips were coated in plastic so I had to give that up.<br /><br />In the end, I used wire snips to trim the sides of the contacts to make them smaller, so they would fit correctly.  Since then, everything's been fine.
B0024E6W02|5|Great hose at a fraction of what it costs locally.  I like the 2 pieces instead of one long one.  I only use as much hose as i need.  Seems heavy duty enough but have only used it a couple times so far.  I like that it came with end caps for both hoses, and the angle fitting.  Didn't need to buy them separately.
B0049XGS1E|1|Had to trim one of the tabs to make it fit as tge y we're too big for the socket. Light came on for about 5 seconds and went out. Unable to get refund because I had to modify them to fit. It was only 8 bucks though so what can you expect.
B00CJ5DY16|5|Saves me from ever having to help my husband bleed the brakes when hes working on cars.
B00JJY3IFC|5|Great and genuine products. ..
B000C560O8|5|the joints are bigger than my oem parts, this must have been one of the problems it solves by giving more surface area for the balls. The tapper shaft is the correct size though so no worry about fitting your center link. The grease fitting holes are not tapped, you can use the fitting itself to make threads or you can tap it, I just used the fitting even though starting it lets your neighbors know what kind of words you can scream out in public.
B000CODGKK|1|Does not fit
B001810SHA|1|A quick fix all right, dead end. My 2000 Ford EXplorer 2x4 A/C capacity is 1lb and 14 oz. I purchase a Arctic Freeze Ultra Synthetic 18 oz can with built-in hose and gauge included. The hose was too short for the tall can to shake every 10 second, the location was tight for space. Purchase at O'Reilly Auto Parts store on sale $29.99 plus the additional $10.00 for return of the can recycle. I follow the can instruction, spend 15 minutes charging up and the needle went to the red zone, almost half the can was empty, great, I stop. In the begining A/C Max and the blower setting to max, windows open and the back hatch door open, A/C compressor cycle on and off every 15 second, it shouldn't be, not at the starting stage when inside of the car is hot, but later I got cold air. The next day I told a reading, same thing. I send an email to the manufacturers, he reply, go see your shop mechanic. I went to see a skill A/C mechanic, he hook up a machine with 2 gauges high and low side reading, he told a reading and it show only 4 oz in the A/C system, he discharge and recharge the freon, in 10 minutes it ran perfect and the A/C compressor was NOT cycling on and off. A/C told in 1lb and 4 oz freon (12oz =1lb), I was happy. Larry the mechanic said, low freon made the compressor run hot, cycling the compressor on and off. Low side inlet pipe is now cold with frost showing. I pay $95.00 total (parts and labor with coupon) and wasted the $30.00, it pays to do it right in the beginning. 2 other A/C shops, 1 charge $225 and other at $205.  Larry say, a new compressor is priced about $400.00 to $500.00, no rebuilt are available. Next time I will go to YELP and get customer reviews ratings, Chow Automotive has a 5 star rating ( in San Francisco location). August 6, 2015
B005DUNK2W|3|Bulbs work great when they work.  Had to move the contact wires from side to side to get them to touch the truck contacts.  When I got them perfect, they worked great.  We will see how long they will keep contact as the vibration of the truck may affect them.
B000Y832VC|3|I liked its, its too small anf its really hard material you cant bend it easily
B00C7720J8|5|Best amp for the money
B001DX5JP4|5|If you are replacing your MAF, it is better to go brand new ACDelco OEM and pay the higher price.  It is that important of a part.  After replacing mine and cleaning the IAC, the idle stumbling quit and my gas mileage improved at least one, maybe 2 mpg on the open road.
B00BR05EEY|1|Item not as delicited/described.  No mention of a &#34;no return&#34; policy.  Item arrived damaged (paint leaking from pen)
B00BJ8IB9Y|3|Flimsy tag with cheap vinyl letters. Save your money and buy a simple tag from the dollar store and vinyl letters from Walmart! For what it is, the price was fair.
B004E4DC94|2|It's not stable
B002OUZK7W|4|seems to work as advertised. also, it isnt bery attractive for thieves, with everyone else at the campground having Star Trek console style protectors. i like it
B005KVLX50|4|Very pleased with the extender! Great multi use!
B003SWNVI0|5|Worked like we needed it too. Plenty of extra storage. Directions for securing the tie downs could be better but overall a nice product. Did not rain on our 150 mile trip so don't really know if it is rain proof as they advertise.
B00IKIIRPE|5|100 % recomendable
B00279F67E|5|Good fit and price, prompt delivery
B00JHQ7PZQ|5|Easy to work with and put somewhere in the engine bay. Also very loud, but it needs more pressure going through the horns to make it that deep tone most people want. So I'll hook up another compressor to it and then update it later.<br />---Update---<br />I added another compressor (same one as the stock one) its is now a lower tone and much louder. Changing it to 5 stars. Very happy!
B00HRY5X18|5|Easy install work great
B003BZX4I6|5|Quality product, went on easy, works great.
B00UGGF8S2|3|Ok but not sturdy!
B006P2K57K|5|Great lights, very bright for 35w 3000 color.  Ordering another pair now.  H8 Fogs 2013 Sonata.  l'll try to post a pic later.
B006BXK1F4|5|Shiny and new. Works well.
B007TK0TOQ|4|Is just what I needed to get rid of the steel cable.
B00J4QFK38|4|Very cute as it wobbles.  It would be better if it was solar powered.
B00KCN0PE6|5|Just what I was looking for and they went on so easily.
B00332GO70|3|Fit great good quality but i washer and cleaned and followed the directions exactly and kept my truck in a garage for three days and still the tape doesn't hold one side down. Not saying dont buy these but buy extra tape.
B001OBKJVO|2|Was disapointed in this product because it did not fit my vehicle like it said. This seems to be for the 4wd version only.
B00C4O8M00|5|Muy rapido. Fast delivered.
B000CGRQ3Q|5|Great deal for those with mechanical knowhow.
B00POG32PK|5|Too cute!
B00TY0G30S|1|The silver in the emblem turns gold in extreme heat, sorry its on my car.
B00480BWA0|5|Excellent easy to use met all of our expectations
B001UE0LLI|5|Perfect fit. Same as the original one it replaced.
B0083POY10|5|They are cute, n very helpful, thank u, linda
B000B5H1W4|2|Works good and then leaks after so many use. We are an autoshop and gets alot of use maybe home use will be ok
B00VURPED0|5|It looks good
B000GU3KHE|5|It fits my Triumph Street Triple Rx very well (size medium).
B00FRHOMNM|5|Works perfectly on my tundra. Just got back from the dusty backroads and they kept the windshield perfect. Would recommend to anyone.
B00GURK4LW|5|Great mirrors. Fit my 2008 Yamaha Zuma. The mirrors were facing forward so I had to twist the mirror part itself 180 degrees. One of them had a some soft of bump on the glass but for the price I can't complain. $6 a piece vs $25 OEM
B000BQKBP2|3|Leaks a little bit.
B00AGDEGVA|5|Got here before they said, wonderful product!
B008XHSMYS|3|The product is perfect even though it came in a box with more holes than a fishing net. The process is miserable. Trying to get to old one out is a complete joke, it is not easy no matter how many happy people say it was easy. You have to loosen dip stick, jam it as close to firewall as you can and then eee errr eee errr wiggle like heck pull pound the old one out. Comes out between fender and frame. You have to cut off the heat shield on the turbo, I used sawsall. I welded mine back together after and got it put back in place, some just leave it off. As far as performance, it can tell a little, and sound no difference. EGT's are little lower. Not really sure it was worth the time and effort.
B00CPL8WY8|4|Turned out, it wasn't for my problem, rust holes in the oil pan so I can't give it an honest review.
B001JEIHAG|1|The quality of this product is terrible, you can find better deals online, also it is just 1 piece, this is junk
B00GM2D3IG|2|Bulbs did not fit in very well. Many came already blown. 4 came blown
B000SL4AA2|4|works
B00MYF7ZZC|4|I like it, but I find it a little large for my front seat,
B001CEG90I|5|So far works great!
B00KNPRRIU|5|Fit perfect on our Warrior and received the carburetor before we were expecting it!  Best price also!
B008BWMSOK|5|After messing with many different sets of 194 led bulbs that last only weeks I decided to try these out. Granted I haven't had then that long as of now but I can say they are the brightest setup I've used.<br /><br />A little heads up though on install is that you may or may not need to file down some areas for it to snap into place. Wasn't expecting to have to do anything but snap into place but luckily it was only a quick 5 second fix.
B000IY5H8S|5|Pump was perfect match easy to install and work beautifully
B00AZQY7Z8|5|These gloves are amazing all i got to say.
B000C7TU4S|5|The product fit perfectly and works great
B003P64XU4|5|No more smell!
B005VNWPE0|4|Part comes exactly as described and is a great alternative to the $180 OEM Toyota part.  I have noticed however on either really hot or really cold days when selecting either direction of the turn signal it makes a slight creeking noise.  This may be due to it being brand new and I'm used to the old worn in signal that was in there.  Overall to me just as good of quality as OEM and would recommend buying it.
B00WFILAWM|1|Most likely a scam, wouldnt trust this honestly!
B00IXW0H3W|5|Worked good nice that it's oem part thanks
B00CSBUOP0|5|Nice item.  Quality is there.  Buy with confidence and &#34;check your tires often&#34;.
B000VU7M4G|5|Worked perfect<br />Less than half price of marine dealer<br />I just bought some extras and replaced the 3 others in case they go bad
B00FX40C9C|5|I got this for the front right of my 2008 Honda Odyssey. I was skeptical about buying wiper blades online but Amazon makes it so easy as you can input your car model and year and it tells you if the part will fit. It was super easy to install, literally in a snap and right now I have one Bosch and one other brand and I definitely notice the difference. Who knew wiper blades could really be so different? This Bosch blade really does get every drop and doesn't smear the rain around or squeak. Smooth wipes and great visibility! I will definitely be using Bosch for future purchases.
B000QG0B3Y|5|Great product. Very stable when mounted.
B003UZV1KU|5|Works
B004M25BXS|5|Fit great. Slightly difficult to remove the rear mat since it is one piece but I like that it covers the entire back carpet area.
B000BKZHA2|5|It work well
B00IOZMNTY|5|Looks awesome!
B000UK9IRQ|5|Nice work the product fit I installed them myself. They arrived on schedule no damage to shipping box or product. Thanks I'll let you know when I plan to replace my rear bearings
B00KQOCLP2|5|This works great. I like because it helps the seat belt lay across the chest more comfortably (women will know what I'm talking about).
B005JU5VUK|5|excellent wipers !! the best i've had so far
B00E1LSXR6|5|it work very good with my truck
B003VLBPJA|1|This arrived in a tiny little plastic bag that basically looked like it had a cup full of dirt dumped in it before the shipper closed it for shipping. The net itself seems to be of extremely low quality. Not sure I'll ever actually use it.    It also smelled so bad that I immediately put it outside before even looking at it. It's still out there as I type this.
B001PNIJIG|5|Perfect
B00NF18V8E|5|Put it on my dodge 2500 did not fit right used a file to make it fit now it works great
B00K56PSI8|5|Love this it fits ok in my van. It is a fun sun protector.
B0007RDVH0|5|This stuff melts away brake pad dust and road dirt and, with the aid of a wheel brush and a little elbow grease (not much of the latter), leaves tires and wheels shining. Try it; you won't be sorry.
B00G4SSGU8|5|just the right size. soft & comfortable.
B00029JOE2|5|Thank you!
B0009VIQ1A|4|came on time and performs as advertized
B00HQYTUYA|4|I was expecting a wool sheepskin and this silky like fur. Fits the belt fine and is nice and soft. Concerned about how hot it will feel, will update if it's too hot. Wooly sheepskin never bothers my bare skin, even in the middle of summer. Seems like nice quality.
B006SN9R48|1|Looks good.  Hooks are useless. Seat bottoms slide and show wear real fast. Back seat has no holes for the seatbelts and this was not stated in the description.
B008G28CWC|5|Excellent
B00GZR490Y|5|Excellent
B00PXF46ZW|5|This cover fits the 2015 Nissan Sentra's Intelligent Key perfectly. The image is very true to color. It also has a small window in the back that grants the driver access to the key release latch so that the cover does not have to be removed for this purpose. The faub cover I ordered from a different seller (which is made by Nissan) does not have this feature.
B00I9JFHI4|5|Worked great
B0018YD2NE|5|Awesome product, can't go wrong with this brand
B004C24Y7C|5|Great product delivered in a timely fashion
B00A66GYDA|3|Didn't work for my car,  worked for my boyfriends car. ..
B004VNLOJS|5|Very reflective and noticable.
B007NKPE2O|5|keep your lites secure
B001G64BNE|5|Easy to install and works very well. I put a pair in a 2001 GTI VR6 despite Amazon's insistence they wouldn't fit my car. It's great to have a hatch that doesn't fall on my head anymore.
B000AOMQ80|5|Had a leak in tire tube so small it didn't reveal bubbles when submerged. I put this in and it is fixed!
B00KGGTF9U|5|Great quality for the price & wonderful customer service! I have a Mazda CX-5 and it fits perfectly.
B007QWKPT6|5|Perfect fit for my 98 boat All works good with no problems encountered.
B005RNEH5O|4|You need this if your electric car windows are sluggish.
B0030WM7BU|1|I bought these August 2014 and two of the three didn't even last a year. Don't be fooled by the 5 star reviews, those guys will be replacing these again in 12 months too. I went back and ordered OEM Denso 673-1201 off Amazon for $58 each and my truck runs much better now. I wish I hadn't wasted the money and just bought the OEM part the first time. If you factor in the cost of wasted gas every time these weren't firing correctly  they may actually cost you more in the long run.
B008I7QYW0|4|It fit perfectly.
B007V2CN8W|5|Easy to put on and easy to take out. That's it.
B0010DZZQA|5|This thing is my sub & save list. change it every 6 months. keep my car smell clean.
B001GG2H8K|5|Cut great , nice way to finish a part for my mustang
B00H3JPKEW|4|It came rather quickly even though tracking still says its on it's way from China. It is exactly what the picture shows. Its cute! The only negative thing is that the case does not fit completely snug to the upper corner of the key nor the edges where the key pops out at. However, overall the cover will protect the key from scratches and breakage. Its worth a try being that the key is around $300.
B00BPBQPAC|5|Perfect description ensured a perfect fti.
B00BCR5ZUA|1|Back seat covers did not fit at all and the front covers ripped at the seams within 2 weeks even with no one sitting in them. I got a refund.
B00N58M6CO|5|I really love this product. I came across a few months ago while browsing Amazon's products, and was intrigued by the claim of it being able to jump start a car. I got it 3 weeks ago, and as luck would have it my wife's battery died last week, so I put it to the test and it started the car flawlessly. This was a life saver.
B004Y3V2N8|5|Bought this for my 2006 Nissan 350z Touring Edition to replace the old worn out one.  My clutch pedal would not return properly and I don't think that the adjustment rod would have fixed 100% so i opted to replace both the master/slave cylinder plus add a Stainless Steel braided clutch line.  Seems to be working great so far.  I will post an update after a few months.
B00L6WR2ES|2|Wanted for2000 VW Beetle and did not work.  Was sent a Jetta set.  Found out after keys were cut.  Can use to start car but cannot use remotes to open doors.
B0027XYKZO|4|Looked different from the fitted one, but worked flawlessly on my 2001 Tahoe 4.8L V8 SFI.
B009OIBBXY|3|nice metal parts but the back rest  is made cheap cheap but looks nice
B00030DLEE|4|A most have for every service technician on the field ... No more cold subs from home... Plug in for 10 mi & enjoy a nice warm homemade meal¡
B00CFALFXY|5|Way better than any towel that I have used before. Very washable . My wife loves them.
B00M3NEBMK|4|Great product, fits like a head glove!! Arrived on time. Comfortable to wear.
B0015RJ27E|5|Installed easily.  Works great
B00T6B53HO|5|I love it looks good on my convertible mustang
B00GOR6CBE|5|Work great in my 1995 540i e34 bmw. Came fast, everything worked. Would buy again.
B000BARFCK|5|great product!
B000C9CC14|4|WORKED ON MY 98 CHEVY K1500,ALSO REPLACED PIGTAIL WITH AC DELCO PT1346..HEATER AND AIR WORK AGAIN.THANX AMAZON
B00D6DWHNG|5|Be advised that if you have a 2013 or newer Jeep, with the dual windshield sprayers, you need to order two of these kits. I learned that the hard way. I also recommend just ordering extra windshield washers for a few bucks each. It lets you keep your original ones in place without having to put that ugly round disc in place of the washers. Install was fairly easy. I do recommend taking the cowl off though. Pull the plastic covers off the base of the windshield wipers and take them off with a 13mm socket, unbolt the four 30 torx bolts from each corner of the cowl, and pry the 4 plastic anchor bolts out with a screwdriver(a hammer would work well to assist in pulling the bolt out). Just make sure you put a cloth under the hammer or screwdriver so you don't scratch the paint. Cut out the holes in the plastic mesh and mount the washers. I then zip tied my hose to the wires for the windshield washer motor. The wires ran right where I needed to go so there was already a path. Wasn't cheap but I finally can spray my windshield.
B009XPSZB4|5|Holds a soda can size drink, or your sunglasses, phone, change....anything you wish. About the diameter of a can of soda, about half the height of a can. Super cute!!
B008VJXWMA|5|Perfect fit, just what I needed without the high dealer cost.
B001F235EA|5|Better wind protection, easy installation.
B00L2X2KYI|4|Used this with my 2004 G35. Over all easy to install, no drilling required. Only thing I would change is the connectors. All the connectors are little flimsy metal probes. I personally cut them off and spliced in an adapter to the actual connection. Gives the car a nice little extra touch.
B004MSA3PI|5|Like this bolts on tight nice price
B00GTQ9BN6|2|did not fit my 4 wheeler
B00ONHJWSW|1|EDITED TO ADD  THIS DOES NOT FIT RIGHT!!!!! WE ARE HAVING TO BUY A NEW ONE!!  YAY now my car is back to normal. It fits great. My husband had no problems installing it on my trailblazer.  The color is Flat black so it does stand out a little on my black Trailblazer but its better than missing the fender all together
B002R0RDN8|1|I'm were not blacked out just clear
B005JU5VUK|5|Works great. However too great. It rubs like crazy and makes an obnoxious noise while running. Im thinking i may put ok rainex or something on my windshield to see if it lubes it up better
B003CXK3QS|5|Great quality, great looking.
B00AOGDNE0|5|Perfect match as described.
B001ULTVRG|4|well packaged nice chrome good finish more than I expected for the price , very happy.
B003YLIHT8|5|A/C went out on my 2005 Durango. I figured for sure I'd be out hundreds at the local Dodge dealer. Went online and read some forums. There was a chance the blower motor could have some sort of short on it since the resistor went out, but I figured I'd put in a new resistor and worry about the bigger issue later. Its been around 6 months later and my A/C is still blowing. At least giving this a try only puts you out $5-$10. Very easy to install and took less than 10 minutes.
B00GXDIFZA|5|The cover fits perfectly. It has zippers panels, which is quite convenient. The material is sturdy enough to last a while. I think it is a good buy
B000SBCHCA|5|Great for reading live data while driving.
B004HP2J0S|3|ok
B00MEPIRQ8|5|ASE master, L1 and L3 tech here. Lead tech at independent shop. This has just about everything you will need.  covers 98% of the stuff out there.  The plastic disconnects worried me a bit when I ordered, but these are very god quality, and very heavy duty.  The rest of the kit has excellent quality as well.  Great kit that you get off the tool trucks ,just not the sticker on the outside for a fraction of the cost.  This also comes with the jiffy-tite disconnects, and the toyota/nissan green disconnect.  Love this kit.
B00Q3V06SQ|5|i use this for my denso ballast and work perfectly
B0041CAECM|5|Bought for my 08 Road Glide. Easy install (afternoon by myself with plenty of refreshment breaks). Noticed improvement in sound, looks great and butt dyno approved.  Running with V & H turn down tip mufflers. Great service through Amazon as always.
B00V30J86I|2|much too small to be useful
B0055QOKC8|5|Was skeptical at first, since it holds a constant throttle position and the speed goes up or down based on the incline, but after using on a few rides I like it now.  I set the lock on a level piece of highway, then add a little throttle when going up hill, and let it build a little speed if going down hill, as long as it isn't too much speed.
B00WXQQC6U|5|Priced right, works great.
B004RFKBEO|4|A bit much if you're just looking to haul a couple of bikes around but a good, solid product. I have a smaller trailer hitch than the 2&#34; (which is rated at 500lbs) so I had to add an adapter so I'm unclear on how that affects the weight rating now so be leary of that if yours is the same situation. Other than that, it's fantastic. Very well crafted.
B000SBCHCA|5|It s a cable alright!  super
B000BG1X54|4|Handy to have.
B001QIUGVI|5|Works awesome. highly recomend
B000V5CIJK|4|I usually don't buy cheapest but this filter seems well built we will see after 15000 miles
B000HBM8HU|5|permatex makes good stuff, half the bottle was empty which is a joke but the net weight seems to be right.
B0028JIDN2|4|Clips on to existing mirror good. Does not fall off. Clear view
B00SBZAG5U|4|Very well made. A little tough to get the metal covers over the screws. Seems to be holding.
B0080E6YVW|5|I own a Porsche 911 SC 1982 for the last 25 years, I have always use this filter, my car is now 33 years old and the engine is in great condition.
B0039KLMXM|5|Super quality, looks awesome on my snowboard. PANF'NTERA!
B00I8SJPPW|5|The sounds of freedom come out of this exhaust.  You want to be heard but at a decent note; you need to put this on your bike.
B001FLZ1YI|5|Delivered as desribed. Looks a lot better than my painted brackets. Good fit.
B00496RE82|5|Great value
B00JIJ4LWW|5|(Magic)very happy how my car seats looks
B004X973EA|5|Red Line will take the clunk out of your tranny when you shift. Wouldn't use anything else. Great product!
B00S0ERKIS|5|For information purposes this cable is approximately 38 inches long.  And the gray end fits into GM USB receptacles with part numbers:<br />20944422 - Circular USB Plug<br />20944418 - Square USB Plug - White face<br />25832462 - Square USB and AUX in Plug - Black Face<br />20870101 - Square USB and AUX in Plug - White Face
B002LYQALQ|5|Wanted something that sealed tight for inclusion in my zip up cleaning kit that allowed precise applications. These answered my needs.
B00M1OUBES|4|a storage bag would have been nice
B0024ECHII|5|The step works great!
B007JMTSTQ|2|Only lasted 1 year before it ripped the first time I had to pull it off to use the winch ( to pull someone else out of course). I guess for the price its worth it but when contacting the seller they told me &quot;it had a 60 day warranty have a good day&quot;  I told them &quot;way to back a product they sell&quot; and all I got back was &quot; thanks have a good day.&quot; Kinda crappy customer service if you ask me. I will be trying another cover
B0052SF0LO|2|The LED Solar Motion Light arrived and I installed it quite easily for use. After having used it for about 1 month, it would not turn on. I contacted Sunforce customer support and they suggested removing the battery to reset the unit. After doing that, the unit still would not turn on after detecting motion. I had to gently tap the unit before the light would turn on. There is probably a sticky relay in the unit. Sunforce customer service shipped out a replacement unit and I trashed the original one. The second unit has been in use for 3 months now and it seems to be working fine.
B00QHU40YE|5|Fit my 2014 r6 perfect. They look real good and not cheap.
B00JKSSXFM|5|Look amazing, very happy
B004J8P22A|5|What's not to love? One hitch to tow almost any trailer out there... Plus a tow hook. Realistically, this is a much better option than buying multiple trailer balls if you have multiple trailers that you might have to tow, like I do.<br /><br />Granted, finding that tow hook with your shin isn't fun, but that's my fault.
B00JK322MW|5|These jumper cables are perfect for keeping in yur car trunk because they stay tangle free inside the handy case provided by the manufacture. The case is clear on one side so you'll know what's inside of it as well. The cables are made from very think copper wire which are much heavier than what other companies on Amazon are selling. The clamps are of a high quality as well. If you're looking for some great jumper cables at a cheap price, this is the product for you.
B00189BHA4|5|Super Nice! Love this top bottom line.  I have it on in tandem with a SmittyBilt CRES cargo net top and it it works great and l looks good aswell.
B007VRCPOO|1|Don't buy, rattles like crazy
B00464F9BQ|5|Second time I bought this company blades quiet smoothly operating long lasting....
B008FTZOJ0|4|Exactly as expected.
B00AOAFP9C|5|works great, just what I wanted
B00HZZ63TK|5|Great
B001LHVOVK|5|Simple fast and reliable.<br />What else is there?
B001RBCU90|3|Not black color,so sad
B0083G3AXC|3|It has a weird fit on the side of the chair and the two rectangular &#34;pockets&#34; aren't deep enough.
B006FUT0CS|5|Love it, smells great.
B002Z5VIS6|5|Nice covers for the money.
B00FR363UG|5|The cover was delivered packaged in an oversized box and a protective zippered bag which speaks to the care given in it's construction.  It seemed at first install would be difficult but after a couple minutes I found sort of a sweet spot and it went on quickly.  It's snug and doesn't move, which I like.  It has a quality look and the red stitch doesn't overwhelm in my black and chrome interior.  I may even get the red Jeep interior accents since I like this so much.  I spent $15 on a Walmart cover that moved constantly in my hands.  You get what you pay for...
B00AV1FM42|5|Prefect, good quality compared to other's on the market.  I bought some $1 ones and they didn't fit as well and the lines weren't perfect either.
B00Y401JHU|3|looks ok. no strap to secure the lower portion.
B002XA0ZJQ|5|love
B00JYMZ8HK|5|Products works as advertised. I am pleased with the item and would purchase again.
B00LOX4SNM|5|A beautiful sticker with bright colors and was as described. Would definitely buy another if needed too.
B00JH1HFSS|4|Good product for the price.
B000E4QM7W|4|Good fit for my 98 ZR-2. Good quality and easy install.
B007T7U3MC|5|Excellent quality, price and delivery.
B000COBC38|5|exact fit
B002NFCCLU|5|Works great
B0018R9RE4|2|Was a nice wire set for the price but I had to return and buy some locally because some of the boots were split open on the plug side.
B00CUNVHEI|5|I should say works great, I should of drove prior so I could see if beads improved but I didn't So I have to say seems to balance ok. So for next guy...ride first see what you have let air out again and put beads in and see if they improve the balance. You don't need so much maybe total of 3 oz but I got this one to share  because of the cost
B00873J0YY|3|I want to start off by saying they work.  When they finally were put up they got the job done and held the kayaks up on securely.<br /><br />Now with that said, I don't think I have ever gotten more frustrated at trying to tighten 6 bolts in my life and that's before even getting them on the rails.  Getting the poles to line up and then getting the carriage bolts to just fit through the hole was a nightmare.  Then of course one of the longer bolts had damaged threads and I ended up having to cut it off, wonderful.  Turns out that didn't matter in the end since I needed to replace them anyways since the there was not enough clearance on the front crossbar even though they fit on the rear (not a criticism of this product, but the Mazda rack system on my girlfriends car).  Anyways I had to wait to the next day to get to the hardware store and obviously they don't carry M8 carriage bolts so I had to go with hex bolts so as to not have to replace the star nut with a 1/4-20 thread which were $6 a piece (x4).<br /><br />Now that I had that nightmare over with I was relieved, I had 4 assembled racks ready to go up on the roof with a couple of simple hand wheels... NOPE.  Trying to get the threads of the star nut to engage from underneath, fighting gravity, with terrible tolerances, while holding the mounting plates in place, with like half an inch of clearance, all while standing on a chair in the blazing afternoon sun, and hours beyond schedule... oh man I can't even describe it.  I don't know what it was about the threaded insert on the star nut that made it so difficult to get started, but I nearly gave up and threw them in the street after the first 2.  Give me more relief on the thread, a bigger chamfer, something to get this thing started, c'mon.<br /><br />Now they are on, I don't ever want to take them off and it's not because I love them so much. I don't care if we get another 100+ inches of snow this winter they can stay on all year.
B002P8RBIE|5|Perfect fit, next day service w/great price..
B000CB04QC|5|all I expected
B000GL19WG|5|By junk I mean the threads of your spark plugs, what did you think I meant?<br /><br />I hate seized plugs and you should too.  Seriously this is a cheap way to avoid a nasty problem.
B0068MM8TU|5|totally pleased with this product
B00ZQ3A9Y8|5|What I expected
B00RFUY6XU|3|I personally own a Maxisys Pro MS908P. The scan-tool can do about 95% of what the dealer tool can do, but will not program all makes and models. Most manufactures use online websites that required you to use their security measures. For instance a manufacture like Ford may require you to use internet explorer and have windows 7 pro installed. Maxisys will not work in this case. I personally use Cardaq by Drewtech. Also their tech support is terrible. $4,000.00 scan tool that will not flash most vehicles and when you have a problem, they may ignore you. You can only contact them through email. I do think the Maxisys is a great scan tool, but wouldn't waste the money buying the pro. Mine is still under warranty and my BMW app will not open properly, for 5 months I've tried to get tech support to help and they just ignore me.
B005O0UYD4|4|perfect fit
B00Y17A828|1|Six months in the desert of western colorado and the paint is literally falling off. See pics, these are clearly not scratches. Worst quality &#34;powder coat&#34; job I've ever seen.  No place for safety chains to pull any kind of trailer.
B00077ZDUS|5|Used it for vacation n our van we rented, working great. for my cargo hitch.
B010R32L3I|5|This product is amazing!  We took a small amount and applied it to a 1998 Buick with considerable wear.  It made the paint shine like it was new again!!  Like they stated, it only takes a little dime size application to work wonders.  I have 4 more cars that I'll be applying this to. I would recommend this product highly.
B001BAYEWS|5|These are identical to the pair I removed from the E39. Nice OEM product.
B00L7FC9JW|1|Should have followed the advice and reviews of others.  Super cheap construction.  The suction cups are useless, they don't even stay attached to the shades.  You'll come back to your car and see suction cups stuck to the windows and the shades fallen on the seats. You'd be better off duct taping them to your windows.
B00KTHY2DA|5|Works just as well as the factory key fob.  Easy to install, you just pop open your factory fob, remove the electronics, place them in the new case, and you'd never know that these were not Toyota factory fresh.  No weird fit or funkiness at all, totally satisfied!
B005KDOAP8|5|After first ones blew up cause I'm a dummy and totally forgot to wear gloves while installing them,thank god for Amazon returns, they work awesome. Really do make it brighter and a lot easier to see at night without breaking the bank for an hid kit, and specifically for my car I would need to vaggcom it which would be a royal pain.<br />I have an 06 passat and the lights sucked,put these bad boys in and I thought I was driving with brights on haha gotta love em
B00KTHZISI|4|key worked great
B009S9RURU|5|Awesome !
B00HY4CNEQ|5|We ordered the gold color because our front door is currently painted a dark brown. Easily seen, looks great and very easy to apply.
B00GLQBDVM|4|Didn't fit my car but they are nice pedals
B00S0QLUUK|5|works well, good price, arrived in one day.
B00PRKCWQS|5|Still intact
B00HU6N3LK|1|Do not order this product. It doesn't clean, nor condition your leather as described. It must be diluted and isn't worth the higher cost!!
B000C4087O|5|Use a 1 inch socket, instead of your own INSANITY!!!!
B00AMLQ7KE|5|Great looking product however please read reviews and switch back brackets with each other I didn't and had a hard time.  Horrible instructions
B004GCTINI|5|Very good!!
B001GC2LVM|3|Havnt used them much, but seem to work ok so far.
B006N8LUDE|1|WAs not the correct item
B003N8VWYE|1|Too small. It doesn't even cover the original floor mats on my Chrysler Town and Country van. The cut outs don't match the picture of the one I ordered.
B00S0QLUUK|5|Great deal. Super fast delivery. Thanks.
B00316Y2SG|2|Even though the package says its for pro taper 1 1/8th bars, they are not. It will work but clamps should be square not at a slight angle. The bar is also not out far enough. The levers are 1/2&#34; from touching the bars. I bought it from my local stealership so I am stuck with with.<br /><br />Don't buy these. I am stuck with them so hopefully they won't destroy my $80 bars in a bad crash. They have held up to a couple light drops but moved due to the clamps angle not getting a good hold.
B00NT5U52Q|5|Absolutely love it!  Looks so freakin cute in my car!
B000C31KX6|4|I have used these filters previously and had good results. The most recently purchased filter was defective though. The internal part of the filter was not properly attached and rattled around. Not sure what would have happened if I had installed it. Good idea to check this before you buy or when you receive the item.<br />The filter and the Extended Performance oil are both rated for 15,000 miles, although the oil may not maintain the level of performance necessary for optimal fuel economy. I usually change the oil after 10-12,000 miles.
B00RJ3PNC6|4|It's ok!
B002UC4P2U|5|Came quick, work great, super cheap!  Have a sharp knife / razor ready for tjhe heavy packing, though, but better than receiving damaged goods...
B001HBX2RO|5|I sometimes break the cap when loading the boat so just buying the cap is cheaper.
B005SB6S3Y|5|Works great as described, helps keep our RV trailer under control when traveling the long distances, much easier on the driver!
B00GYR418U|5|Perfect - exactly what I expected.
B0029TQDLA|5|Works well and there's 2 in case one breaks.
B005C57HCM|5|fit great
B0095RXBKA|5|Excellent
B000CIUC9O|5|Very happy. No problems.
B000C55LQQ|5|good for the money
B00WRALWT4|5|Bought in May 2015 Went to use it jumppak found the battery too low and wouldn't take a charge. Contacted Arteck customer service and they sent me out a new unit. Great company I recommend this product and company. Unit works great power is incredible
B004JKX4X2|5|Love this when we went to Branson it rained A LOT and none of our stuff was wet. It is durable to use for many of our trips.<br />It really came in handy!
B0039ILD42|5|Great product. It same as described and shown. Love it
B007KPX7HQ|5|Awesome product
B009XP18F4|5|love it
B000HUN7YO|3|never installed. I do not know if these are good or not
B004MEA4D8|5|Awesome product, fits with no issues. Lots there products and highly recommend Mishimoto to anyone.
B002N5W8Q4|5|Can not believe it works, rechargeable batteries DO NOT LAST AS LONG
B002VVJZI4|5|Passed inspection
B00EA0ZB7I|5|These little lights are bright
B004GCDV9K|5|This fit just fine on the &#34;OE Replacement Chevrolet/GMC Front Bumper Face Bar (Partslink Number GM1002168)&#34; I also bought here. I used 3/4 inch long quarter inch bolts, nylock nuts and fender washers to mount it instead of using the recommended clips because I seriously suck at parking over curbs and stops and didn't want it ripped off like the last one. Holes all lined up, pretty much perfectly, and it snugged up to the lower edge of the bumper with no unreasonable gaps (it IS flex plastic after all). If my driving doesn't improve, I'd buy it again in a second.
B0022ZMC6G|5|Good fender fits Good.
B00H5F3T56|5|Very nice at a good price.  Real metal and much classier than plastic. I bought another set for my other car since I liked them so much.
B00FSCMSAA|5|This item was very ok. I removed the old one and replaced with this one. It fitted so well.
B00144AKJC|5|Exactly what i expected
B005JIQJLC|5|great product!
B0002SRCKG|3|Works as advertised.
B0079OPFLY|1|This product is no good. Last only about 1 month before the sun eat it alive
B00M0F7QAA|5|Just right
B00KPQYEBU|1|to expensive,  bad customer return policy
B00THR39SC|5|These are great! Only $109 (I think)! Doesn't get much better. Installation was easy and fast, love the look of them. Only complaint is for the 2 front ones, they aren't a complete fit, as there is a small portion of the fender/wheel well outside rim that is still visible and not covered by the flares maybe its just my truck - 2002 silverado 1500 regular cab - but its a small price to pay, overall; very satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for some decent fender flares!
B007J8IKFI|5|Just as expected, thanks!
B00069CN2I|4|Good mirrors, great price point, easy on and easy off. Wish mirrors were larger. Recommend them!
B000DCN9BW|5|they do the job!
B000C5EAKY|4|Does exactly what it needs to do on my 83 rx-7
B00199BXNY|5|the right part
B001Y8LORA|5|Works great a little wobbly ,
B008FCDAT8|4|Love it!
B000C5602U|5|Moog is always a good product fit perfectly
B002GTKAHQ|5|put these on my 1979 GS 1000L cafe fits nice I love them!!
B00O0X370S|5|They're great! !!!!
B00QVXWKEY|5|Looks great on my Jeep! Went on easily and isn't fading in the Florida sun. Would very much recomend for any zombie hunter!
B00MJ470RG|1|Bought this as a gift for my dad. He said it was too bulky and stuck it in the barn where it never got used.
B00UZFPKBE|5|tested it when it arrived since my car battery was dead...started car twice with success and battery was still full...very cool and portable looking, hope it lasts
B008AWDYRG|5|only used the brushes, the fit was a little tight but it went together. great price fast delivery
B00QFEJVG4|5|great
B0041TQS5M|5|This works great. It keeps the car at least 20% cooler. Plus it covers the little side windows. I would recommend buying this.
B0086GCL3Y|5|This worked just fine, thanks a lot!
B008VQ666M|4|Fits over a Honda Grom perfect.
B0013Q27CE|4|Shipped in 4 days  Great lug wrench !
B00LBNHUQ2|3|Fit the plug socket perfectly but not as bright as I would have hoped. Good for interior not so much for exterior.
B009YHUYME|2|letters were just stickers that peeled off after awhile & the &#34;stainless steel&#34; pitted & corroded like aluminum...
B00EUUNJRM|5|Muy buenas
B006N9EUTO|5|ACDelco skimped on lube so if you didn't buy other poly bushings that came with the little tubes of lube then you better get or have something to install these with. They are still good quality and a direct fit.
B003DNJ728|5|Fits very well I use it often
B00VVFO39W|5|Bought this unit because it's water proof, made by a well known company and it's was the lowest price of name brand EV charger available.<br />While it's bare bones it performs very well. It's bare bones compared to the more expensive EV chargers on the market, but it's not rocket science to charge a battery. On important thing to note: Unlike several others that are available, this hard mounts to the wall vs units that have a slide on and off bracket. These are to expensive to be easily stolen by simply sliding the unit off a wall mounted bracket.<br /><br />So far it works great, no problems as all.
B00PGH5SLS|5|Fantastic
B00RJKB2FQ|5|Does what it needs to do and says it does, good price. Pretty simple to install.
B00VW1JL6A|5|Awesome!  Looks great on my husbands new mustang.  Super fast shipping!!!
B000KQOELU|1|These floor mats do not fit my 2006 Honda CRV very well. I would not buy again.
B00XKLE3OK|3|Keeps everything from sliding around as I drive.
B00B3YM0DM|5|Tail Bag and Saddle Bags are Awesome!!
B000GOJWE0|3|Bolted right in and fixed old bad motor BUT, blower wheel appears to be the wrong one in that the fins are curved the wrong way, SO the airflow is not as much as it should be. In researching a new motor/blower, here is what I found: Original motor runs counter clockwise looking at the shaft end and counter clockwise blower wheels are white. Clockwise blower wheels are black. Looking up the specs for the TYC 700 031 it runs counter clockwise, and it does. The picture shows a white blower wheel, and it is. BUT the blower wheel is molded like a clockwise rotation (black) wheel even though it is white. Probably the reason this one is so inexpensive.... If you buy this motor, try saving your old blower wheel first to see if it is reusable on this new motor. I may tackle changing the wheel once the summer heat dies down.
B000GVD2ZI|1|Is these the same as 65mm bore over .40
B000M3V95U|1|Overpriced
B007MOXBTO|5|Applied perfectly and easily. Exactly what I was looking for.
B0048F7P2Y|5|This dashboard cover fits well and came with hook and loop pile tape fastener strips that I cut into smaller sizes to allow me to place them in more places on my dash for a secure fit. It fit well without the fasteners; however, I wanted to make sure it did not come loose while driving. I think the car is a bit cooler inside on hot days.
B00NLR1OVI|4|other that the nozzel's leaking great product
B00NR7UQ4I|5|love it
B005JI71RI|5|This was exactly what we needed and it was very easy to install.
B006LLB2UE|5|Nice replacement part.
B0090N4X9M|3|I noticed on the 2015 XTR for my RZR 1000 4 it has interactive capabilities but doesn't work, supposedly there is a wire harness that would read the brain. Where is it ? How do you get one? Help
B00HMOJO3G|5|K&N is synonymous with air intakes and I can see why. Here is the break down:  Cons: Installation pictures sketchy for my Chrysler 200. To be fair 90% was on par, but the important install parts were off. Pros: Car sounds amazing, actually growls from a 4 cylinder. Can feel increase in acceleration instantly. Kicks in soon after 2500rpms.  Point here is, if you don't like mean sounding cars or acceleration, then keep the stock garbage.
B00KYZ47IW|2|I installed the halo projector lights and everything seems to work perfect except the halo rings won't turn on
B00IO8J6ZU|5|Fits perfect!  Must be factory.....or better!
B00G1Y4NKM|5|Extremely fast shipping took a quarter of the estimated time. Super fast swap and look great on my k6 gsxr1000
B004VDT9ZY|5|Awesome item made rims look brand new
B00XCANO4O|5|It's easy to use and easy to see.  It's accurate.  It's heavy duty so it will last a long time and won't break easily in your tool box.  It can be used on any size tire, the gauge will measure up to 160 psi maximum.  I got this for my boyfriend and he said it's the best tire gauge he has ever had or even seen. Plus it looks cool.  I purchased my tire gauge at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.
B00SZZKU02|4|Will this big bore kit fit my 50cc kazuma atv
B0006HLH04|5|Went on with ease,  a very good product. .
B004UQQVJY|5|This stuff works great. Can tell a major difference in my cars appearance after removing all the old wax and redetailing the car.
B0106NZBQ8|4|Perfect
B0098WDKKI|5|They go on easy and look good.
B00851NNBE|5|Purchased these for my TT- replacing the doorway light and one light by my hitch.  Very bright and I can even leave the porch light on all night for days and not worry about my house-batteries dying.
B000BWCFLO|1|Seemed to work when I could see the gauge. After less than 1 month on a off-road jeep that hasn't left the garage more than twice since installed, the gauge is fogged up and unreadable
B008YFTB4E|1|orderd these HIDS for 94 Integra got in today at 6pm tryed to install it the plug that goes to the main connector in my head light did not fit and even when I made it fit it was really tight and the bulbs didn't work. I currently have these in my 05 Hyndai they work fine. but for my integra I would recommend them
B00E1SKEZI|5|Got this for a 2002 Ford Explorer V8.  Perfect fit.  No noise or rattle after 3 weeks of use.
B00ZW66WK4|5|Good price, nice product.  I was afraid because me lack of reviews, but is a very nice product well manufactured and well packaged.  Bulbs are bright and white (not the 6000-8000 Kelvin usually found in leds, but nice 5000 Kelvin in my opinion is the perfect lighning, not too blue, not too yellow/orange.  So far I tried one in my car and I was surprised on the result they give.  Very, very recomended as replacement for standard incandescent bulbs.  I will try to post some pictures.   Edit: maybe I should have mentioned that I got the warm light led bulbs.
B005XRH2YC|5|Fast shipping and part was perfect
B007CMQC06|5|Greatstuff
B0052XFWCG|5|My mechanic is sold! He told me this kind of stuff doesn't work. Told me not to waste the money and get new injectors. We'll I didn't listen and tried it in my 2005 F450  anyway. Just like others have said, it was like turning on the switch. Right around 2k miles sticktion cleaned out. Started seeing mpg's go up. I'm around 4k now. Startup shows no sign of missing. My mechanic came over last weekend to help me clean the vgt vanes and u-ring in the turbo. On a cold start he was amazed there was no misfire at all. Asked me what I did, told him it was the Hot Shots!
B007V1QSNY|5|Excellent hubs.
B00V5GYUPO|5|This is a heavier plastic ash tray and is pretty durable. It is big and it cleans up easy. I like that if it gets knocked off of a table it will not break. It is nice to have outside for people to put their cigarette butts in and not throw them in the yard. I haven't seen this type of ash tray in the stores in a while so I was glad I got this. I received this product in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.
B003TVNDG0|5|Plug arrived on time and was as described.
B002J7VX4Y|3|I wanted to like it.  But man its hard for me to dilute the smell to make it tolerable.  Ive been testing on pieces of material outside the vehicle and just cant find the right amount for me.  It does have a new plastic type smell, not new car necessarily.  Its just strong.  I can see why people either love or hate it. I may be on the hate side.  I will continue to experiment with it.  I think I am going to try leather one next.
B00U0IX680|4|Amazing. Very easy to install. Good materials. Nice looking. I liked so much. Excelent shot of ligth. Why a four ? Because of the curved support, a little easy to fold. Just a week installed on place. I will update my review when something happens.
B003CEJXGI|4|From afar, they look just like the Nissan rim and they do the job, nicely.  Makes the car look new.
B002E1AYAY|4|The product works well enough but if you have a truck of any type it won't reach the frame and lift enough to actually change your tire. It's definitely designed for use on a car that's lower to the ground.
B00029ND7G|5|Great and shipped quick!
B00VJ4LHUS|4|Works great!
B0108YH3LG|5|A little worn out but clean and nothing unspected with a 2nd hand item. Item is what was described by seller. I'm very satisfied with purchase.
B000RXNLK6|5|very good
B0124AS83E|1|Too small!!! Poor quality!!!!! Do not waste your money!
B003NBFKDK|5|Great we love it.  It comes apart easily and we have even used it in the rain with a cover.  :)
B004HMBK5G|2|Only one of the two would snap shut over the belt.
B00CQD4BUE|5|presently working fine - thought it would be difficult to insert but was not - solved problem of constantly breaking - would recommend
B00FNJQ0ZM|5|Works great with my Honda CBR500R
B00CASDZKC|5|Excellent product<br />Excellent service<br />Reasonable price
B00IBONKKY|5|Wish I could give them more stars.  As others have said, they fit my '15 Crosstrek Limited perfect, and look fantastic with the carbon-like pattern.  They are comfortable underfoot and stick to the floor like glue, literally zero movement.  I actually had to pick them up and replace them several times to get the placement just right, because once they are down, they are not going anywhere.  I have used the Subaru all-weather mats in my past two vehicles, but these provide a lot more coverage and containment of debris due to the raised edge design.<br /><br />Definitely glad I gambled with these as I have never been a fan of some of the other options out there.<br /><br />Note: It is shown fairly obviously in the photos, but the only thing that is not covered by these mats is the rear hump.  I only point this out as some of  the other companies do cover this area, and for some people that might matter.
B0002SRECC|4|Basic tool that performs well.
B004TADG7Q|5|These are replacement for the stock parts.  They look good and give an added edge to my Jeep.  They were easy to install and were a great fit.  Looks better than stock.  I would purchase again if I ever need to.
B002DZJQ0A|5|The E-Z Pass strips were perfect - exactly what we needed.  I couldn't find them anywhere locally or through E-Z Pass.
B00KRQR6KO|5|Very nice sticker.
B00PZTYBZG|4|These look very sharp. Unfortunately, the front passenger side panel did not fit my 2015 Subaru Forester 2.5i Premium. When I notified the seller, he quickly refunded me the cost of the item. Very easy to work with 9 MOON!
B0081SAEOU|3|the Massey Ferguson Generator To Alternator For Mount Bracket  is not correct the monting holes do no line up make sure before you buy that it will fit your engine the way it should be is one hole from the two do not line up it sets down on the bracket just like the stock one
B0051CAE1C|5|Worked flawlessly for my Jeep and S6 Active.
B000FGJP5U|3|Still up in the air on this one.  My mileage seems to have gone down and I don't feel any increase in excelleration
B00077YWV4|5|These are great and I am very pleased
B00HL1X288|5|I do a lot of specialty work, either laptop, tablet, and/or small gaming systems and I need a reliable set of tools. This set has just about everything I need and then some. The only thing I would point out as an issue, is how hard it can be sometimes to pull the bits out, which isn't all that bad if you consider that they'll stay in place. I'd recommend this set to anyone who likes to work on small projects like myself.
B009AAEP1G|5|Perfect fit 13 Subaru Impreza. Righty tighty
B000PSMVTA|3|the product is not what is advertised. listed pro electric heat tool, which was not included . instead a heat tool that had to be heated by an iron was included. why does Amazon continue to sell this product?
B008VY1IWQ|5|I have owned Porsche cabs and used this stuff once a year, and the water just runs off the top.  It also enhances the black color of the top.  Excellent product.  Don't forget however to mask all painted and glass services before applying.
B004KEJYMW|5|this is exactly the size puller i needed for my small block chevy crankshaft gear. good quality and price. exactly as described. good to have on hand.
B00O92T1NC|5|Works great in my car less garbage on my floors
B00HZDJ6W8|4|It looks very nice on my matte black RF1200. Price is too high though.
B00AXL5AHY|5|What a great value and fit. These seat covers are amazing. Simple to install and look great. Installed in a 2004 Chevy Tahoe front buckets. Fit and finish are perfect. Seats look brand new.
B003PIPTKU|5|This bracket replaced one with a cross threaded bracket bolt.  The new hardware easily fit onto this bracket and the pads and caliper fit perfectly as well.  The threads for the bracket bolts were clean and helped attach this bracket to the steering knuckle nice and tightly with no cross threading.
B0008FUH46|5|Fits perfectly
B0002SRGYI|5|Exact tool needed for for work. Just as described
B00SXBG7TG|5|awesome price for the quality
B00SK1THYG|1|Complete Bust!!  Very disappointed!  O rings were not the right size.  After opening package and seeing they were different from OEM, I double checked to insure they were for my 1997 Road King.  Installed them, Turned on ignition to pressurize fuel system and gasoline spayed everywhere requiring I pull everything back apart, a trip to HD dealer, and reassemble with OEM parts.  Someone is putting the wrong parts in these packages!!
B00RU9GZK8|2|Its universal and does not fit our sienna-the company gave us a discount to keep it, but they don't work well
B00GZKC6EW|5|Ok, so we are just talking about synthetic motor oil  And, that is what this is.  It is Valvoline, so it is a reputable brand.  It is of the correct weight for my vehicle.  It has all of the appropriate SAE ratings.  It has an American flag on the label, which reminds me it is made in America.  All of these are good things, and things I was looking for in finding affordable synthetic oil<br />At then end of the day, these were the things I was looking for.  Synthetic oil (from any reputable manufacturer) is so far superior to &#34;regular&#34; motor oil or even synthetic blends I can't imagine why anyone would still be using &#34;regular&#34; oil .  And, at less than 23 bucks for 5 quarts, this isn't even that much more expensive than standard oil.<br />If you are &#34;brand loyal&#34; to some specific synthetic, good for you!  Me, if it is a major brand, is the right weight, and is priced right, I'm a happy camper!
B005JUWZ3Q|4|A bit large fitting compared to my prior Arai helmet of the same design. (I bought the same size)
B0079I8KFS|5|I had them for over a month and they are great!! I live in Los Cabos Mx. And they work great keeping my hands safe and cool!!
B001GF0OPO|4|I have ordered these for numerous cars over the years.  This is the first one that did not fit perfectly.  It won't go all the way to the windshield at the top.  Still fits well, and still better than any other shield I've owned.
B00KLL2PAG|5|very good quality, good communication, thank you
B001THQX1S|3|Works ok, but used it three times, each time it leaks around the rubber seal. Tried both locking points, still leaked. Tried different points on the can, still small leak.
B0042HFGQU|4|Got here in a decent time frame and very well priced.
B001HT47PW|5|This is the best comfortable seat I ever sat on for long distance riding.
B002XM51CA|5|They work great and look nice and easy to put on
B00KN0UOEE|5|Excellent product !!  - Easy to use and absolutely gets the job done. Very happy with results.
B008S9CN6Y|1|This helmet is cheaply made, I only gave a star because the lowest the system will allow, I immediately returned this helmet for s refund!
B002CXS596|2|Does not work on my 1996 Tacoma because their are no mounting holes in the glass.
B00QJEB4GK|5|Good and fast
B003O0Z8NW|4|works great... toughest part is taking the worn/pressure-less ones out since they're settled in and can't hold much weight... make sure you have the broomstick or pipe ready to keep the hatch open. Wish these new ones didn't have such a royal blue sticker on them (you know the stickers that want to stay one and leave adhesive/paper marks when you try to take em off). anyway, just keep em on and nobody notices, right?
B0013HJTEC|3|The holes in the mount bracket did not align with the holes in the frame rail on one side so I had to drill both mount holes on RHS.  The instructions said to slot the frame rail holes to insert the carriage bolt/backing plate an reuse the original cap.  That works fine for the backing plate but the carrige bolt head won't go through without a lot more filing.  Much easier to a drill bigger frame rail hole to get the bolt head through and put a bigger cap on when you are done.  Apart from that it's a solid piece of kit that looks good when complete.
B00NP41YB2|5|It was perfect--just what I needed.
B00B4HWRD6|5|Exactly as advertised. Factory new OEM parts.
B00MBPX5PY|3|Fine item, but I bought the wrong size. Our Genesis needed the large size.
B005FMN74O|5|Its a quality well made hat.
B0046ZIW0U|5|The package arrived super fast. Installation took around 10 minites with the right set of tools. Overall great very pleased with this
B001TNR4M4|4|Works well enough for what I use it for.
B00G2GACC2|3|Soft but move around a lot. The straps don't seem to keep the cover in place very well.
B00CIMSGSG|1|Product looked great, up to OEM level looks and feel,  but sadly was DOA,  I e-mailed the company for support and after 2 weeks gave up on getting a reply.  Returning to amazon for a refund.  Maybe I'm missing something and there's a way to unlock?  them but as they sit they are stuck open,  I understand that they are hard to compress by hand which is to be expected,  but I went ahead and installed them and still could not get them to budge even with the weight of the rear glass.  Looks like its a fluke but it would be nice to at least receive a response from tofnk
B004TMHF8K|5|People get out of the way much faster. I have a dodge.😂
B0036QZ8VQ|4|They are  great and makes it easy to work on the bike
B00EXGEBQG|5|It's very good
B000OEDQQW|1|Does not scrape very well
B000EDOT8C|4|Very useful.  Sturdy and heavy duty.
B004W900GE|5|They look good and are easy to install. They seem brighter than the OEM taillights.
B00G168F40|5|Amazing
B00WGULLP0|5|Very high quality decal!! Highly detailed and exactly what I wanted. Seller (Barefoot Graphix) has excellent communication and shipping was fast!! Highly recommended
B005CLM78K|5|works as original replaced
B007Y34V3S|5|Great price!  Durable.
B00XQDDTO2|5|Easy to install
B00Y5KFO48|5|Product was exactly as described and fit and finish was very good.  This was installed on a 1973 Corvette four speed with a Hurst Competition Plus shifter.  The provided bushing allowed a perfect fit for this application.
B00F675F8Y|1|Unfortunately the actuator motor is not working well in my car. It had been fixed and 4WD didn't work. Another used actuator motor was fixed and it works well with it.<br />The inner assembly was removed and checked by spechilised mechanic. But It has no problem.
B000C2YXQI|5|Arrived  as promised. Just what I needed for my 1985 Chevrolet CUCV.<br />Carl
B0050ZAFGO|3|Added 12/3/15  SEE COMMENT BELOW for a simple fix for you who have rubber boots. Cut, don't drill  ADDED 4/4/16: The beam change from low to high is much less than with halogen bulbs. If I adjust the high beams for an adequate lighting of the road, I am flashed by drivers complaining of too bright low beams. A compromise puts the major portion of my high beams about a maximum of 4/5 car lengths down the road. The beams do spill further down the road than low beams but overall it is very disappointing. I don't know if other manufacturers do better.  This is my reason for changing my star rating from 5 to 3.  Oh, note the suggestion for a better way to modify the rubber boots than my screwing them up. END OF UPDATE. One problem was with my protective rubber boots. Trying to enlarge the hole to one inch was not a DIY job. I wasted money and destroyed the boots. It you have rubber boots that protect the lamp fixture from road dirt, take the boots to a machine shop. It is impossible to enlarge the socket access hole with any home tools.  Other than that problem Kensun gets a 5 star rating. There are some suggestions for solving some common problems. Skim this for anything helpful.  This concerns installation and adjusting the beams. Note that when adjusting your light, low beam should always have a sharp cutoff: Bright light below and dark above. It they don’t,  you have an installation problem.  Installation is straight forward except there is no mounting hardware to secure the ballasts to the car. I assume from the low cost charges by professionals that wire ties were used. I drilled and mounted the ballasts to the framework, using silicone and washers to prevent loosening. A secure wire tie mounting (tight to the car), is OK. You will need your own ties.  Connecting the wires is bullet proof as the connectors don’t allow mistakes. The short part of the wiring harness will be closest to the battery with the long wires leading to the opposite side headlight. The harness is quality. Don't understand the negative comment.  My big problem was enlarging my rubber boots as mentioned earlier. I still need to resolve the problem. The HID beams have a very sharp cutoff that makes beam adjustment easy. The cutoff is much sharper that my old Halogen lights. Although the lights are bright to on coming cars, they are not blinding. I do not get flashed by on coming cars. The included instructions are minimal. For beam adjustment, I recommend going to U tube. A good site there is ChrisFix – adjust headlight beams. There are others. It’s your choice.  I encountered a “nut behind the wheel” problem. An easy call to tech support and they sent me a set of bulbs that helped discover the problem.  I bought another HID set from eBay several years ago. The experience turned me off as I was cheated by the supplier so never installed them. I bought a complete set from Kensun, thus could compare the two systems. I am very happy with Kensun. They are superior to the cheaper set. If you review HID systems, Kensun comes out tops.  I recommend the 5000K bulbs. The light approximates daylight where as 4300K is on the orange side and 6000K begins to have a blue/green tinge. I want to see in the dark. The 5000K gives the brightest light. Either side of 5000K begins to reduce the strength of the beam.  WHICH IS BRIGHTEST? Someone tested all the Kensun varieties. The standard ballast, 35 watt 5000K system was significantly brighter than even the 55 watt system. That was a surprise. light meters can be subjected to different light frequencies but the 35 & 55 watt systems emit the same frequency.  There are folks who are like some young kids. They confuse being different and being better. Just remember the two are not the same. Blue or Purkile lights may look cool but their light output sucks.  Note about the headlight lens.  Most cars have clear plastic headlight covers. These will cloud due to dust and dirt attacking the plastic. I restored them with 1500 grit wet/dry sand paper – used wet. (Do not use a more coarse paper. It will seriously increase your time with the polishing end.). Work the sandpaper in small circular patterns. Be careful, be CLEAN, do not allow foreign grit to get in your sanding. Just a single stroke will create significant damage. Continue sanding until close examination shows there are no scratches, fogging or pits on the plastic ( there are fine scratches from sanding). You may have a few really deep pits or scratches. Ignore them.  If the damage is extensive you may need to buy replacements at $100 plus each. It’s your call.  Follow your sanding with “White” polishing compound. It takes a lot of time depending on the destruction. Polish until all the fine sand paper scratches are removed. Wash with water adding a few drops of detergent. NOTE: If you try to stop short on the sanding, no amount of polishing will work. do each part properly.  HID lights do not solve the problem of messed up plastic headlight covers. You can buy restoration kits but they are no better than my system and much more expensive. Some kits use a clear solution to fill in scratches after a thorough cleaning. They look good but the solution is softer than the original plastic and will not last like the original. Faster ain't always better.
B00THRM80M|5|The motorcycle cover arrived quickly and fit out of the box. I expect several years of service from it.
B000KOR766|5|was what it was said to be
B004GC5FBM|5|This was great quality no problem getting it on at all. There was no directions but installation was intuitive.
B002M4G9FM|4|Good item and clean.
B004SMGAJ6|4|good
B00A8NRMY6|4|Nice quality and colour. The reverse lock out on the vehicle did not fit into the bottom of the knob. I will get it machined larger. 2007 hyundai accent
B000CITG5K|5|Easy to use, hardens quickly and is very strong once hard. I used it to repair some good sized holes on the body of my truck. It is much easier to use than resin and fiberglass cloth and because it hardens quickly can fill large holes well. Very pleased with the results.
B00XNNH34M|5|Very nice and got a good control in my hand.
B000HBNX38|5|Works exactly as advertised. I touched up the rust spots on my truck with rust prevention paint, but the rust spots reappeared within a few weeks. I sanded it down again applied this product then primed and repainted. So far so good . The rust has not reappeared.
B00K8N56E4|5|Keep your sweat off of the helmet doing a great job in a sunny day
B011VHTT7U|1|it love it
B00267PZUK|5|I bought this preemptively and it worked perfectly. It scared every one of the spark plugs into coming out of the heads without breaking.
B00NFJP1YI|5|Perfect, same as described.
B006EGAIII|5|Great for simple things like changing my oil.  Be sure to use on a surface that won't slip.
B00ISCB4MK|5|Well made and looks great on my vintage Fiat Spider.
B00F7GXNX8|5|Arrived quickly and applied easily (without any bubbles).
B0031I4PD6|1|No Acdelco logo on it.
B004X339AS|1|Not the size as it appears on the car window . Very dissatisfied .
B00BF0OJK6|5|Perfect fit in my 2008 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Unlimited (4 door)
B007GR585M|5|I had the older version of this which was also great.  I upgraded to the new one because it has a USB interface and records.<br />Working excellent.
B00TFZNNG4|5|Cheap alternative to the more expensive varieties. Fit nicely on my 2015 Grand Cherokee Overland.
B00HWI3WSU|5|only problem I had was installing them once I got them install they looked pretty neat and they were bright I really like them.
B00QT1JCMG|5|love them
B008EEXV46|4|The product is good but would it hurt to include instructions or a 'This Side Toward Engine' stamp! As a help to others, the boss side of the clutch plate goes toward the engine flywheel.
B00157TGXY|3|price bit to high,  works ok .
B0002KKIVE|5|I have used this product on the original vinyl top on my 1981 ( built in 1980 ) Lincoln Mark VI and it is wonderful. While the car stays garaged, it gets detailed more than washed. The vinyl top is definitely something that I never want to have to replace. RaggTopp has proven to me over the years that it is better than anything I could ever use. It puts a nice new shine on the vinyl and it never runs after buffing dry. The water beads up just like the waxed paint. It keeps the top in the same condition exactly as if new.
B000FPY9ZM|5|Great item fast delivery
B00L84EKI0|5|Don't even buy from the Toyota dealership. This one works best. The ones from. The dealer doesn't work
B000182EUA|4|works as expected
B00CXW0VIY|2|it is big  will  not recoment at all  not happy at all it
B00VB3WODQ|5|Well it took me forever to put these on since the old hoses were nasty and dry rotted, but after taking 2.5 hours to get all the hoses on I was shocked how awesome they looked. Really high quality material. I was a bit worried at first since i never heard of this brand before, but I wanted the complete set instead of paying around the same price for just the upper and lower radiator hoses. Can't really tell if it did anything performance wise since I still have the stock civic radiator, might have lowered the engine temp alittle but bother crazy. I'm the type of person who like high end stuff and is very picky with what I buy. this is definatley high end and I approve 100%  The blue color really looks nice if you already have matching blue part in your engine bay.
B00B3V1WY8|5|Works good went on easy
B005MVB4JI|4|nice tool but their a little flimsy like a pair of tweezers
B00XXLZ2EM|5|[[VIDEOID:768f51f02639356d2c679c70fd6a008b]] Wow! These detailing towels are really soft and luxurious.<br /><br />The Autofiber towels arrived in a medium size box.  They were packed in a clear bag with a display card.  The front of the card shows the features of the towels and the back has some guarantee information.<br /><br />When you open the bag, the towels kind of expand to show how big and thick they are.  They are a full 16 by 16 inches.  One side is long fibers and the the other side is a short pile. They are incredibly soft!<br /><br />These towels will be great for the car or other household chores.  I can't wait to use them.<br /><br />I received a discount in exchange for my honest review.
B003O0ZD5A|4|Fits in my 2009 Hyundai Sonata near perfectly, does not have enough power to lift trunk on its own after hitting the trunk latch button. needs a little push and then it will open by itself.
B00GMO4H1G|2|Looks like a cheap gas station license plate cover !!!!!!!
B00INC7TEC|5|Good
B00252F3AI|5|Well it's been over a year and a half, my poor car needed a new air filter, with the heat and the high gas prices, this was a smart solution! My mileage already increased by 3mpg!!
B004PL4H0O|5|The buckles hold well. I use these to hold the ladders on my ladder rack on my work truck. They do the job perfectly.
B000FNSTV4|5|Works great for our trucks
B000JFNAAS|5|Creates a good, reliable seal. I've used this on several cans now, some have even sat in the garage with the tap connected. None have leaked and this tap has performed flawlessly so far. If it ever starts leaking, I'm sure there are just a couple of small o-rings inside that could be replaced. Sourcing these might be a little difficult, but I'll deal with that when I have to.
B00QMS5UMC|5|Loved it fit perfectly and works great and saved me a lot of money over the local auto parts store Thank you
B000HCRF0Y|5|Fit the car without an issue and improved airflow.  Also did not have the fa-breeze that so many have and I consider this a big bonus.
B00NPQV06O|5|This is a great quality fixture for the price. Heavy cast aluminum frame and a fairly sturdy lens from what I can tell as so so far( haven't installed them yet. I bought them to use as additional reverse lights. I'm still a few days away from installing them but I've bench tested them and they illuminate in the typical fashion of a 18w cool white led fixture. The beam pattern has a hot spot on center but it is a wide (60' flood) and light does get outward as well. Perfect for my usage as extra lumens while backing up through tinted windows.<br /><br />At this point, I would highly recommend these lights. Very good value for the buck!
B000CGINZG|5|same quality i would get from my mechanic just for a lot less
B00M8UDCBO|4|helmets run fairly large... i use a medium HJC helmet so i bought a medium one of these.. i swim in it... other than that great helmet
B00T0OW0DM|5|Great item.
B00JY5SQ3A|5|Great price, fast service, and works as expected. Another great Amazon purchase. I love Prime service from Amazon.
B00KAHKIZ0|5|Looks great and fits perfectly on my 2014 Honda accord v6.
B001THBZ52|1|I went through three of these units and each of them was defective. The vacuum port would leak fuel causing a rough idle. If you suspect this is the problem for you, pull the vacuum hose off and smell it. If its smells like fuel, you have the same problem. The only silver lining was that it wasn't disastrous when it failed and was relatively simple to access...I'm pretty good at it now!<br /><br />Not happy with this company. Normally they make really high quality components, but that was definitely not the case this time.
B008VPYY08|5|Perfect fit in my 1997 Wrangler TJ
B00JBICGEA|5|Im very very happy !<br />Lights fit perfect and install take like 5 minutes !<br />Thank you for making my car look new again !!!
B00686125C|4|it nice on the car , better than with out it .. thank you . AMAZON .. the safe , and protect money ...
B00ZIRACWQ|4|Simple and looks a lot better than the factory gold
B00OOJG4E4|5|looking good, just found the Item was come from my hometown
B00IJ7F0P6|5|Good quality
B0044E9MXE|5|very good, worked great
B000C2Q69U|4|Good replacement for the original suction line
B001O7PNNM|5|This stuff works great!  It was suggested to restore headlights, but I have also used it for many small scratches.  You have to be careful not to apply it to the plastic areas though, as it does not come off very easily.  I have had one bottle for a couple of years now, you don't need much in one application.
B009XP5FFS|2|It smells so strong of rubber I can't stand to have it in my car.  I liked the look
B00V3MKZ18|5|Awesome
B00DSD875Q|3|Smaller than expected
B00IGIMWY0|5|I'm a Nissan tech at a dealership , we use Nissan genuine parts and parts master parts , I wanted to save money on my daily and buy cheap pads for it since I only drive it to work , and the Nissan pads with my discount are still pricy and parts master stuff is junk so I tried these pad boys , direct fit , completely quiet and stops right on the dime , if your looking for cheap durable and reliable brake pads check these out !
B00CQAR2DU|5|with proper help , this item was easy to install
B00G186POK|5|very nice give my car batter view .
B00EQQIQ6O|4|Great product. Looks amazing on the engine and you can tell the difference in throttle response. I gave it 4 stars only because it doesn't mention how loud this thing is under normal driving conditions. It takes a little getting used to. Under hard acceleration it sounds like a beast. If you can get past the noise you' love it. The HP boost and the improved gas mileage is worth it to me.
B008FCCYWC|5|As expected, fits our standard box crew cab perfectly! Saved us $$$ over buying from the dealer! Thank you!!
B004EBNTYK|5|Good stuff
B00QULZ9G8|5|Good accessori. Great price.Is a solid aluminum piece.
B00OQP87SW|5|Very bright works great
B004I8SF5M|4|Fits good, rubber seal doesn't fit exactly like original, reused original seal instead.
B001L9ZBZS|2|Love the title but this thing is sooooo small. I was hoping for a bigger one.
B0069TND14|5|Very nice,, great lights , very bright, easy install.
B00RYPBHNI|5|MVP
B00JNL6BOG|4|Great product & perfect fit!
B007LIBWU6|3|this pos was marketed as a motorcycle licence plate came to me as a car.
B003D280M2|5|fits fine
B001B5MBG4|1|Didn't last long only. A few months , not even a year<br />I don't known I have warranty
B000COCRW8|2|much softer metal compared to OEM
B000FQ0DQA|5|Fit great on my 95 wrangler.  Bought 1 for the passenger side, but now I think I need the drivers side, just because it looks so clean and nice.  The one drawback I found was that the Rampage tail light conversion insert will not fit when set in the groove.  I had to place it above the groove on this new tail light.  It fit perfectly with the old one and sits in the groove on the drivers side which is the stock side.  It still works and looks great so will buy the drivers side next.
B000XBK7C2|5|This is a great deck brush.  The bristles are stiff enough that I can scrub with substantial pressure and the brush doesn't flatten out.  The rubber strip around the wood is great for protecting the gunwales when scrubbing the deck.
B00QEIH47E|4|Worked great!!
B004A69U9M|4|Pretty big for a 2011 toyota yaris but it did fit. Had them on for about 4 months and they are very quiet.
B000G76PLA|4|They are nice but when you are putting a tarp on a tent frame they don't streach much.
B000EQQZXQ|5|Great product fit my 05 express 3500 6.0L. gets rid of the old brittle wires that connect to all 8 coil packs, made my van run like new.
B000GUX0T2|5|I have a 88 sportster deluxe 883 EVO with this complete carb,manifold, air cleaner, cover and it absolutely RIPS with this carb! HOLD ON! E-Z starts,just touch the button doesn't even crank over 1 turn, just jumps to life. cold engine full choke,warm engine no choke, But dont twist the gas before you start it as it will flood.i was looking for a 1200 like this because of the taller gearing would be less vibes at super slab speeds but this engine with this hugh carb will handle a taller front sprocket no problem which will drop the r's down at speed.i am running stock original pipes and everything,dont know what the jetting is but feels spot on and plugs look perfect. i was looking for this bike for a while,4 speed,chain drive and the super E on it was the big bonus.only thing i want to do is forward controls and drop the rear down an inch or two with some progressive shocks and maybe a lo profile rear tire like on the super low XL.i just ordered a new A/F i think the new cotton pleated element will filter better,those K&N's are scary looking at them with a 5x glass.This aint my 1st sportster,its like #5  or 6 plus a few big twins in between. i had 1200 evo sportsters and the 883 with this carb hauls butt. oh i am a huuuuugh kawasaki 900 1000 1100 fan too! Kaw shoulld do a historic reissue of the original kz900(but  make it a 1100 engine)
B0081S9SEC|1|need to send back doesn't lift need instructions to return and get refund thanks
B0002MA3O4|5|Love these little things. Easy to wire. I hooked these up so that when I turn my parking lights on these babies fire up. I've had these installed now for about 4 months no moisture issues on the inside that i can see.  P.S. If you can't figure out how to wire in 12v check out YouTube. There are lots of helpful videos out there. I would defiantly recommend these to a friend. :)  Update! Today is Sept 13, 2016 I still have no moisture issues, and the lenses look great. I live in Minnesota so im surprised to see how well these are holding up after the great salt bath of winter. I would not hesitate to buy these again!
B00NB8JU7M|5|Great sticker !!
B000TMP8E2|2|I love the idea, but not the product. It looks nice on my car from far away but is a nightmare trying to move the little plastic pieces. Make sure you use the head of a screw driver and don't have anything breakable nearby because it takes a lot of strength. They fade and chip extremely easily so I tried to coat the letters with a black sharpie. Not worth it, sorry bell!
B00L9KG72A|5|Loved it
B0006FKFMC|1|Product failed to work And screw is now stuck in cross bar. Waste of my money
B00OMT6UEK|5|used with torque pro
B003A82GV0|4|It's a gas can, what else can really be said. It has durable sides and works well. I just hate the new no spill spouts. This one has a tendency to siphon air a little a then dump fuel in. Makes it hard to make a clean fill in a leaf blower.
B009Y7MJVS|1|Didn't work. This kept falling off. A waste of money.
B0040CWYUI|3|This part does not fit a Pontiac Vibe 2006.
B00N5BAWYK|5|These look great! I got these for my BMW 335i fog lights and I am definitely impressed. They match my 6000k lights. These lights aver very bright at better than the typical LED fog lights I have used on other vehicles.<br /><br />These are not meant to be used as true fog lights which are yellow......but rather they compliment the look of your vehicle. Form over function.
B001O0W5SU|1|This brake cable was listed as compatible for my 2004 Chevrolet Malibu.  I checked multiple sources including a couple of large auto parts chains' websites as well as the Wagner site.  They all showed that this was the correct rear parking brake cable for my car.<br /><br />When I received the brake cable and completely removed my seats, console and carpeting which is required to access the rear brake cable to change it out I was disappointed to see that this brake cable was not even remotely similar to the original brake cable.  Not only was it shorter by at least half, it did not have any of the clips, brackets and grommets that the original brake cable has.  At this point I was stuck - I had to get the part from my local dealer who did not have it in stock - luckily they were able to get it in next day so my car was only laid up with a partially gutted out interior for 2 days.
B003IOKPLO|3|It was as advertized
B00PMFSI6G|4|Used in my Saab 93 runs great very good  spark plug
B001O0ZT2O|2|Yet another Chinese product.  Items that your safety depends on should never be outsourced to communist China.
B00BPSUCPE|1|Interesting concept ,this company has many products to support this one . Easy to use<br />Effectiveness is useless as if you need this you have a serious leak ,I used the sealer which was totally useless . Go get it fixed professionally don't waist your money as I did
B00LXKYA0C|1|it broke after two months... its not something you touch and break but the clips broke...
B00W5XYK3I|4|A little small, but nicely produced.  I would love the option of one that's street-sign sized.
B00IQWP6HQ|5|great quality and price. very reflective in low light. sticks on very well.
B00T1CT0GI|5|Buy buy buy I tried many I have these on my jet ski freaking great sound and you hear them at top speed..
B002NAS2AU|5|Are you kidding me!  Assembly comes complete with bulbs and the works.  The price is awesome!<br />Delivery was lightening fast, safely packaged.  Construction is just like the original part, adjustment of<br />fasteners got it to sit just right.  So if I ever run into another mailbox, I am getting another one of these!
B000VUASMY|5|This bed mat fit my 2014 ram quad cab to a tee! I have a tonneau cover already so I didn't  want to  have the bed sprayed with rhino.when you put something in the bed it stays put! And this bad boy is super heavy duty. I like that I can remove it and clean the bed after unloading. I also purchased the tailgate liner to go with it.the best part was the price!
B003GD4FP4|5|very good product
B0001EVTGE|3|We had to drill holes. The adhesive did not match to our hood, only two of the four spots.
B001QIUGVI|5|Got this to find an ABS code.  Worked very well with my dodge 2008 caravan.  Make sure you go to their web site to see if it is compatible with your vehicle before you buy.
B00BFDHNXS|5|Fast shipping, OE part in OEM packaging.
B00192JFI6|4|As a new RV'er I wanted to ensure that my new Class A didn't suffer from some of the issues on the units on dealers' lots with water heaters and furnaces crammed full of wasp nests.  This does the job extremely well.  The only reason that I did not give it a 5 star rating is because of the spring installation method.  I fiddled with it for nearly an hour and finally gave up and installed it with galvanized lock wire (.032 works well).
B000W1XX4M|5|Amazing- it worked! Had the dreaded P0420 &#34;catalytic below threshold&#34; code for several years on my 2002 Toyota Camry.  Would pass inspection by clearing the ECM (disconnect battery), then driving just enough (about 75 miles) to store the required info on the ECM before it would sense the P0420 and turn on the check engine light.  What drove me to try this gadget is that the car failed emissions this year, and only because I had not driven it enough after resetting the ECM.  The failure report actually said that there was not enough info on the ECM.  Installed the gadget on the &#34;downstream&#34; sensor and without clearing the ECM the check engine light shut off after about 75 miles.  Out of curiosity I ran a diagnostic with an OBDII sensor, and yes, there was no error code, however, the ECM had stored the P0420 code it sensed prior to installing this gadget.  I then cleared the ECM and have driven over 300 miles, and still no check engine light.  So, I'd say, yes, this gadget is working...<br /><br />Note: even with having this P0420 code for about 3+ years, the engine's been running beautifully and giving me excellent gas mileage (33 highway, 28-30 overall).  It now has 230K miles.  I question whether there's something really wrong with catalytic.  Perhaps it is on the &#34;threshold&#34; edge, but for 3+ years?
B004GE6KMI|5|Perfect fit
B00C3J2GOO|5|be careful that you will need to rewire before you can use it.  The instruction came with 2 diagrams of possible connection for rewiring but the motor is of a different brand so connection diagram was on the motor itself!  Had to exchange, thanks to Amazon for their great return policy.
B00J01VJJ6|4|Worked good on my Suzuki LTZ 250
B002JH7PEQ|4|This is a little bit louder than I would like, but I think that's par for the course given what it's doing. It's significantly quieter than the device it replaced. It's still quiet enough that when there's a lot of road noise, it blends right in. We've used this several times now while on road trips. My kids will plug in two electronic devices and a USB device and it works great.
B00GWFKSOK|5|Fits greats.  2015 GMC Sierra 1500 SLT Crew Cab.  The black shows dirt more than I would like but it is also doing its job.
B009PJIV0I|5|Fit perfect ....great buy...thanks
B00BFDGZV4|5|perfect as it's displayed on site
