B000CIKJMY|5|B&M 80277 Universal Remote Transmission Filter Kit<br />Wix 51269 Spin-On Hydraulic Filter<br />Hayden Automotive 402 Ultra-Cool Tube and Fin Transmission Cooler<br />Derale 13017 Transmission/Engine Oil Hose<br /><br />Added filter kit and trans cooler prior to a trip to Yukon and Alaska.  Put 17Kkm (10K miles )  on a 2000 ford explorer with 200k KM in one month.  The hydraulic filter is better than B&M supplied oil filter with the kit.  Simply added the cooler and filter in series after the factory aux cooler.  Extra cooler / oil hose was needed. Easier installation with grill removed.  Easy with internet reference.  With cooler lines open, I had one line in empty oil jug (outflow)  and one line drawing from gallon jug of new transmission fluid (inflow).  Not quite a complete flush but a good transfusion.  Many internet concerns about the transmission but this combination was well worth the afternoon to install.
B003VAX3IC|5|This makes for a much neater connection between the trailer and the tow vehicle. No more cable hanging down or getting tangled in the electrical cable or chains.
B009BNG2HW|5|As described. You will probably want to glue or job weld the screw under the Union Jack.
B0092ZUO2S|5|A bit pricey but it is very quality. Seems to do the trick. The only negative is that is can be cumbersome to rool up inside the tight space of the front seat, steering wheel and all.
B00RCKI5YO|5|Great price
B009DJSEM0|5|looks good
B000IZGIA8|5|As a recent widow, I've been pretty depressed.  Someone recommended I read the reviews on this nutty product, and it was just what I needed.  The reviews, not the product!  Thanks to all the creative review writers - you sure did give me a lift.
B003V57NUQ|5|Excellent.  No need to spend hundreds for something so simple
B00BG4C0B6|1|Within the first month the white face plate containing the logo fell out. Keep it up China, you're only cheating yourselves in the long run...
B004CUZMC0|3|This jacket was to large and we had requested info on exchange for smaller size.  Did not receive  any info.<br />Quality of the jacket is good.
B007R5DB1G|5|Awesome mug got for fiancee as she has a CTS she loves and it was a genuine GM product way cheaper than what they charge.
B007KPVZ3E|4|I'm always amazed at how well Kuryakyn's covers fit and blend in making them look like part of the bike instead of an add-on. I have had this cover for a number of years. There are two stainless steel L shaped brackets in the center that bolt to the primary to hold the cover in place which have broken. I am sure vibration over time is the culprit. I chatted with a rep online to see if new hardware was available and to my surprise he immediately sent out a new hardware kit no charge. Way to step up and stand behind your product Kuryakyn! Now if only you could improve the durability of the chrome on your cast metal products. This cover and my ISO floor boards have crazing lines starting all over them. Yes it has been a few years but the bike spends most of it's life inside the garage polished. Five stars for service, three stars for long term quality, equals a 4 I guess.
B00BKXDWAG|5|great price
B000C910P8|5|Not too much to say about brakes, but these were exactly as described, and are working wonderfully on my car :)  The quality seems very good and they fit on my car just fine.
B006CRT72W|5|Worked as it should on my 2009 F-150 Lariat. Easy to follow instructions. Simple operation. Stealership probably hates these things...But, I love them!
B0052FROSY|5|Fits perfectly in our 96 Honda Accord. Replaced a broken handle and we've had no problems with this new handle.
B00378KBGU|5|Got this bumper for my YFZ 450 to replace my GYTR bumper I had that bent like it was made of butter with the slightest impact. The Pro Armor Bullhorn bumper looks great, feels and looks well made, and looks like it can take a beating. Overall I'm very impressed by it.
B000OQMK58|5|I love this cover. It's very comfortable. One thing I found though, it does not fit all steering wheels. It fit perfectly on my car but I recently bought a new car and the steering wheel is about an 1/2 inch wider and it does not fit it. I still give it 5 stars because thats no fault of theirs.
B00T6J9TL2|5|This windshield trim is well made and takes less than 10 minutes to install.
B004I6603I|5|Exact replacement
B008BLKI2U|1|it was not 20% tint. it was very light. it came damaged as well.
B00SUQT6II|4|Look great, easy install.
B003CMIH2Q|5|The decal is great and looks really good on  my truck. My friends arfe asking about where to get them.
B001V8UKBY|5|great product fast shipment
B00480J4KA|5|I have a 2004 Infiniti G35. The only downside installing a headlight on this particular car is you have to take your front wheel off and undo the undercarriage to get access to the headlight bulbs. You can't just open your hood like an intelligent engineer would have it. I got some small handed vietnamese kid to put my bulb in without having to do all that BS, but you will have too, trust me. Enough about my issues... This light is simply brilliant and bright, as you would expect from an HID rated bulb. Oh, and they LAST FOREVER. Well not forever or obviously I wouldn't have bought a replacement bulb. But my car drove about 130k miles before having to exchange one. The other one is still burning bright! WILL BUY AGAIN!
B0006IX7Y2|2|I bought this and used it once. Setup was a breeze. Had it running under the motorhome. Then it came time to move it, and it broke at the cheap plastic hinge in two places. The hose was empty and not even on it. Not real impressed. This was bought somewhere else brand new, and was not it the sun at all. You get what you pay for I guess.
B00062YIQO|5|The average price for this filter at any autoparts store $45.00 to $60.00. I got 3 of those from amazon for less than $40.00(on sale)  I'm a big fan of this filters. I have a 09 Tahoe, 91 300zx tt, and a 97vw cabrio and they all have a k&n air filter. For one it pays for it self, the average replacement filter runs Arround $8.00 to $15.00 dlls.<br />So, when u clean this filter for the third time it's already paying off, and they still look great. I don't use them for the performance, but for the gas saving purposes, every little helps. The one that benefit the most was the vw cabrio, it went from 380 miles on a full tank(combined city and high way) to 420.  the Tahoe does great on long trips. I strongly recommend this part.
B0002MAFYW|4|Nice and bright, but they have a sharp cut off. My projector lamp ass. in my other car are like this and I do not like. But they are bright and have good coverage on the sides. For the money not bad, but like the ones at advance for $50 each better. But that's allot for just one lamp. So if you can live with the sharp cut off. Buy
B00HYHW500|5|These are exactly like the &#34;expensive w.t. brand&#34; excellant fit & quality at a fantastic price! Deffinately recommend! I got these for the hubby - 2 fronts and huge back passenger row mat for our 2009 Ford F150 super crew cab for the price of the &#34;others&#34; front set only.
B002MQAWOY|5|My husband liked it a lot. Easy to wear and wash. he is big guy with big head, but it fits perfect.
B003CR2BQO|4|This was a very good fit - no problems with the installtion. Definately recommend this product. My application was a 2005 Mazda 6 - 3.0 motor
B00P922Y58|5|This is my first review...but to for all the fellow jeepers out there looking for an aggressive looking grill this is perfect! It's exactly what it looks like in the images and don't let the shipping time deter you because mine came in the mail via usps in like 5 days! 5* for sure !
B00CFLBKJ2|3|The one that worked was very bright. Unfortunately, one came DOA and I had to send them back.
B000H0P9NQ|2|I needed a ramp that I could use to get my Honda PCX 150 scooter (about 300ish pounds) up on the curb of our parking lot and gave this ramp a shot. Unfortunately, the ramp just wasn't heavy enough to handle the initial climb with a little hutzpah and would get knocked to the side every time. I was hoping that the ramp would have some really solid feet or enough weight to stay put, but it wasn't the case.<br /><br />I tried it from different angles, but because the curb height was at the very top of the ramp, I couldn't take advantage of the little lip shape and the ramp got pushed out of the way every time. If you're trying to use this for a heavy vehicle and a curb that's at the max height of this ramp, I'd consider looking at a heavier ramp. If your curb is shorter, you might be in luck using this!<br /><br />That being said, returns were good and I ended up finding a product that suited my needs.
B0006JLW84|5|Easy to install, durable.  Time will tell for how long.
B0093XLGVM|1|shipping was good.  the bulbs are much dimmer and won't pass safety inspection.  save your money.<br />very poor product.
B000E4LN62|1|This is the last time I'm buying these. I replaced these twice, they are cheap and will break almost right away.
B002R06W5I|5|under constuction
B002HZL35M|5|I do not have a lot of experience with vehicle decals, but this one seems nicely made with vivid colors and was very easy to install on the cowling of my motorcycle without bubbles or folds, even though the cowling had several curves where it was appled. Nicely done!
B0081STB7Q|5|solved all my weak battery problems, great price, fast shipping
B00QGEHS2C|1|did not fit
B00K0QW75A|1|These are crap. The knurled brass piece just slides right up the inside of the rubber well nut and stays there when you tighten it rather than causing the rubber part to bulge and release when you loosen it.  They were also considerably smaller diameter than the windscreen holes I purchased them for.
B004SFI8N4|3|Really nice look BUT,<br />After the first rain there was condensation in one and water infiltration in the other one.<br />I had to put silicone all around to seal them correctly.<br />Now they are perfect even after rain.
B000NPS086|5|Searched all over for EGR slimline window visors for my 2010 Toyota Tacoma . Amazon had the best price and recieved the window visors very fast. Great fit and looks great.
B008DVQA02|1|Fantastic cover.  Easy install and operation.  Looks great to boot.
B0096BH86I|5|high quality product fit 100%
B00KTIUG5C|5|Worked flawlessly!
B0002JN2EU|5|Great Buy !!!
B001DX7KMY|5|Great product, no issues and easy to install.  No burnt LEDs and great support from AEM when I had questions about installing the harness through the firewall.
B003VZLJFG|4|It worked just fine all you do is follow the instructions.
B00BITJI78|5|Fit perfectly.  I would buy from this vendor again.
B00J3DDGV0|5|great product
B00H34DMME|1|Too strong for my indoor leather
B004I4L9PY|5|It was just as advertised, a replacement for the broken one from our honda 2000 crv. The programming sheet came with it and was easy to use. I had to call and get the code before ordering from honda to make sure we ordered the right on.
B000QR6XJ4|4|Scent stays forever and covers odors nicely.  Very nice lemon scent, not a NATURAL lemon but still very nice.
B000F6DNMQ|4|Does the job - I suggest getting two of these for better parking judgement.
B005TWZV80|5|Bought this for my car to replace the apple sticker that was on my rear window. Not only did I get this really great quality sticker but the seller added a few extra stickers in the box as well. What a great deal.. Fast shipping as always with Amazon.
B005CGN2Z2|4|Been looking to replace all my lights on the boat with LED's.  Very low volatage and cool and very reasonably priced.
B008OAD1UY|4|Nice product for a DIY sink project.
B000WJYWG2|4|Right fit. Came fully charged and my bike fired right up. Best $$ I could find..
B000EBKG9A|4|I loved how easily I was able to apply this to my window with soapy water and a squeegee.
B001FC98X2|5|Exceeded my expectations
9539751047|5|I've had this sticker on my car for about a year now and it still looks great. I definitely recommend buying this brand.. Great quality!
B004DS7X28|5|Great product! Fast shipping!
B002HY07J6|2|Did not fit my RAV4
B0052UIOCE|1|Super thin and warped on arrival. Probably worked but i also used copper rtv gasket maker in conjunction so who knows.
B001O06JMS|3|They would have worked but did not fit my custom rims
B006X8COKC|5|The reasone for the grill was to cover up the big mouth hole in the bumper ! All it takes is a small object of any kind to go threw that hole and give you a bad day and cause a hole in the oil cooler or radiator! Easy to install and the price was great!!!!!!  I am a cert. G.M. Teach and this is a great product for added protection to your truck!!!!!!!!!!!!! IF INSTALLED PROPERLY
B00KNNPYPK|2|Color matches really good, product arrived on time. However, no instruction nor pictures provided on how to install. Seemed simple, but with much force, could only get the cover on about 80%. Asked for help and vendor provided a TIP to place a plastic bag on the arm first. This did not help. Asked again and another TIP was to add vaseline.  This also failed and actually the cover ripped this time. Understand this cover should fit tight, but one has to get it on and if there are tricks, that should be know up front. Original package should have contained TIPS and maybe pictures. After a week of trying, I asked for a refund and again, Amazon responded positively.
B0009YDQEO|5|Not original equipment quality, but you can't beat them for the price. I am happy with them and I would buy them again.
B004NFW5EC|2|The &#34;rain shield&#34; disappeared after 2 weeks on the car windshield and in less than a week on the shower stall door.  The applicator is cumbersome and difficult to use and the product applies very unevenly.<br /><br />I'd use RainEx before I buy this.
B004BTL5DW|5|Great product for the price shipping was super fast
B00HWI916M|4|Good product.
B000NMDFNY|5|I scratched the top of my car when I placed a box on it. It left minor scratches and swirls. This product didn't erase them completely but they are barely visible after using it. I applied it about three times to get the look I was happy with.  Now I won't be kicking myself every time I look at the top of my car. I also used it under the door handles where finger nails leave scratch marks and they are completely gone. I tried it on some deeper scratches and it didn't really help, but the product only claims light to medium scratches. Perhaps if I gave it a little more elbow grease it would work, but I wasn't in the mood for it.  I bought it at Wal-Mart for less than $6. Totally worth a try!
B004XESPFG|5|I got this lanyard because i have a Honda civic hatchback DX & i love that car. this lanyard is very nice would be better if had print on both side though.
B007KOC19C|2|I was hoping this cereum oxide would be just the right product for polishing cabochon stones.  It Will work, but it takes a great deal of time and lots of product to make stones shine at all. I remember using a similar product years ago with great success.  I hope I can find another one just as effective. One additional insight: I found that using cereum oxide nearly dry gives the best result.  I spray the polishing wheel lightly with water and then rub the oxide into it until it forms a paste. Then I polish the stones with great pressure, being careful not to let the stones get hot.  It worked for me.  Good luck.
B0000AXY5A|5|I really like these hitch covers. They are easy to install and fit perfectly. I suggest the use of a locking hitch pin or a bolt with a self locking nut. My last one was stolen in just two days.
B008Y3Y01U|2|My wife absolutely loves how well she can see down the road with these lights.<br />This is particularly important in the deer laden back forest roads of NE Pennsylvania.<br /><br />The good: Bright for 3 months and could see deer farther down the road before the BAD.<br /><br />The BAD: Short lived bulbs!<br />Hardly a 10 year bulb!!<br />They should last longer with the exotic inert noble gases being used in them!<br /><br />OK, 2 days after replacing the driver's side bulb, the passenger side just burned out!!!!<br />Also less than 3 months!!! &lt;grrrr>
B003FCNX2C|5|These lights are awesome and are very bright. I'd highly recommend to others.
B002DQIYRK|5|After getting the wrong one, High End Motorsports corrected the situation and I received the correct one quickly. Fits the window well, mine was for a 2014 Super Duty. keeps the interior cooler and protects the dash from the sun, good price!
B001UEHLV6|5|Exact fit for my SC300.
B004D3CD2S|5|We've used this tonneau protectant from day one on our Extang tonneau cover.  The manufacturer states that using Armor-All type protectants will cause the cover to shrink and damage seems, etc.  This would void the warranty.<br /><br />While considerably more expensive, this protectant does an excellent job of cleaning and protecting the cover.  Really keeps the cover looking better than new.<br /><br />One thing I do like about this product is the dispenser.  It delivers the protectant as a light mist, rather than a spray.  This really aids in the ability to apply only the amount of product necessary.
B000C2WF9A|5|This product works exactly as it should.  Sometimes it can be a little difficult to unlock the cap and twist it off, but that just provides me with more reassurance that my gas tank is safe from vandals.
B002J7VX4Y|2|Has no resemblance of a &#34;New Car&#34; smell.
B003E26FW8|5|Perfect fit on my Acura TSX.  No squeaking.  Good brake feel.
B00E9SLB84|1|The shirt was way too small. I think the sizing is wrong in the description. Very thin material. Not what i expected.
B00B0CPPC0|5|Perfect fit! Very impressed with this carb... Didn't even have to adjust it.  Great product at an even greater price!
B00NH1LMWY|1|These &#34;stickers&#34; work perfectly to fix the problem but $40 is entirely too much.  I found these same decals elsewhere for less than $10 and that included shipping.
B003KWP2R6|5|Great product
B003COTFS4|5|This winch is a definite value.  Strong and well built.  It was a TIGHT fit for my Honda 420...I mean TIGHT.  But, It does fit.
B000CICYZ4|5|Still going very strong after 2+ years in my wrangler
B0042A0ZEU|1|cheap cheap cheap ripped on the install do not waste your time or money spend some more money and avoid these
B000BUTD9S|5|Nice product.  It even works well on steps with slight curves (I was a bit worried about the when I ordered them).
B000H7WAMC|5|I have been using Purolator Pure One filters for over a year on my car.The cheapest I saw it was at KMart for $5.30 plus tax.Here I can get it at a lower price if I buy two.Why pay more and get a Fram when you can get a quality filter with silicone anti-drainback valve with great filtering efficiency?
B00BPIHSX8|2|Brake lever went on well but clutch lever was too thick for my 1997 zx6r, I recommend going for the 40$ ones
B0026CG5S6|5|As always I am more than pleased with these visors, and I got them at an excellent price, cheapest price I could find on the net.
B009IFIGP4|4|fits exactly right, the only thing it is missing is the small icons that show it is a heated mirror, but otherwise it is great.
B00B1ZJAFO|4|I wish I had discovered the aluminum version before breaking two of the plastic ones.
B00L9NELES|1|Very poor fit.  Adjustment screws do nothing.  I'm looking to replace these with something of better quality.  Would not buy again.
B000GVH20E|5|It is a little large for every day use but it is good quality and good looking. It is good and would be good for a few days ride and with the roll bag for a longer ride.
B005JXH6YQ|5|These came quick and the quality is great. I would buy them again.<br />They would be great work gloves as well.
B006QZ7Z4W|5|It does what it states it will do.  Range is a little reduced due to height, and throw is reduced due to gain.  I use this for my 'local' antenna when trying to engage something within a mile or so.  This is also for my AIS receiver as in my case I'm mostly interested only about what is within my horizon.
B002BI86BY|2|I wanted headlight cover for a MDX, what I received was two plastic circles no more than no more than 5 inches in diameter. Useless.
B003YMSWX8|5|Was an exact size replacement for my old existinbg motorcyle battery. Good starting power and maintenance free.<br />Just need to keep trickle charger on it when bike is not used for a long period of time.
B00180P03I|5|Works great !! Very easy to use . Love the way to locking works !! Much better then my last locking gas cap design . Can't go wrong with Stant products .
B000CQDMNY|4|Good price, good value. I always keep a 10 pack of top post and side post terminals hanging in my shop. These are as good as what Walmart carries.
B0040R07Y8|5|Great fit
B000P0ZJDS|5|I use this for water and as expected it's holding up well. It has a very strong mist, which is all I need. I'm happy with it.    UPDATED: 09/03/11    It's starting to fail. Nothing but water was ever put in it. I suspect the spring is having trouble pushing the rubber part forward. I didn't expect it to last forever, and every other one I've tried failed far quicker. This bottle was used almost daily, by the way.
B0031ZDU62|5|Way cheaper than Ford OEM ignition coils, and have had no issues
B00G3EHX1G|5|looks good on my car
B008OYAIEM|4|went on good - no issues clamps worked just fine - factory boots last 4 years in 4 years I'll know if these are better
B000CF519S|5|Works just like it should.  I'm happy.
B0054RW0XO|4|This was my second pair of these gloves.  The first pair lasted about 7 years and were still quite functional, but they were starting to look pretty worn.  I liked them so much I bought a new pair exactly like the old ones.  They are not warm at all, so they are not good for cold weather, but they can be worn in the hottest weather.  Easy to put on and take off.  Not as skid resistant as leather but not as hot either.  Nice gloves!
B00BIKI83M|3|interesting that one has a regular thread, but the left side mirror has reverse thread. That would be something to add to the description. other than that they worked ok.
B002SFT3MG|5|Nice decal. Applied easily and was exactly as pictured. I used to have &#34;The closer you get, the slower I go&#34; but I got a new car and needed a new decal. I find this extremely amusing but I think some drivers are alittle too dense to understand it...My other decal actually had the affect of making other drivers increase the distance between the back of my car and the front of theirs, but this decal doesn't really quite do the trick. Oh well. I still like it!
B000HZFDPU|5|Product arrived promptly and as advertized. Carrying case is a better than a box. Have not used yet (meant for emergencies) but appears excellent and well made.
B0000BYEXO|5|fast delivery  great quality
B00KTIZK30|2|The case would not stay closed. It kept pooping open I had to duck tape it.
B000KKHO86|5|Purchased for my old Muncie transmission due to compatability with brass syncronizers and in storage sometime . I needed the GL -4
B006D1GJNW|3|Good relation quality-price.
B000E4RYLA|5|The door handle on my Dad's Camry was broken, and this handle was so much cheaper than getting one from the auto parts store. It felt just a little lighter than the OEM part to me, but it worked just fine.
B005HJ8B8M|4|Looks good the finish could have been a little better all and all it is ok looks cool we will see how the chrome holds up
B008RBSE5W|5|Beautiful
B00IAJW236|3|ordered four. One arrived broken. Cheap quality. poorly shipped unprotected.
B000ICNUK2|4|Although I normally use a PureOne filter on my bike, I decided to try these.    Purolator does not recommend the use of a PureOne filter on a motorcycle.  I cannot get a return call from them, after trying to determine why.    I'm almost at my oil change interval, so I'll pull this one and cut it apart to compare it to an old PureOne.    The PureOne is apparently made in the USA, while these are made in China.  If that is important to you.
B00KQ4ZMX0|5|These work with my 2011 Ford F150
B00OJEY57M|5|Nice very ver y nice
B000CB3DI8|5|Beck Arnley makes great parts fit my 1997 accord perfectly
B0013TM0Z0|1|My mechanic couldn't figure out what was wrong with my car's heat.  Brought it in 3 different times, he did everything, but couldn't fix it.  Additional measures that would cost $1,000 were not taken, so I was forced to look into these direct hook-up or backseat heaters, just so I wouldn't freeze.<br /><br />With that said, the hookup directions for this unit were so bad, that I had to spend hours googling and watching videos on how to do it.  It wasn't easy to find.  I finally was able to hook it up, and it wasn't even worth it.  It blows out air that's about 60 degrees (not even warm air), and it blows it out as slow as molasses.  I'd say this thing may warm up a car from about 32 degrees to 40 degrees, tops.  It won't make your vehicle warm by any means whatsoever.
B005ZS1VXM|5|Fit exactly had no problems
B00CK8VO4G|5|I bought this for my toyota mr2 spyder (which is all stock minus the stereo and upgraded headlights).  It looks great with the factory aluminum pedals and white guages.  It ties the whole setup together alot better than the factory knob without being too tunerish.  Looks nice and sporty and is super solid bc it screws right on the factory threading. don't waste your time with the 3screw universal ones.. a quick shift into 2nd or 4th and they come right off in your hand.  Get one like this that fits perfect.
B000C75NDU|5|Raybestos makes very good brake parts such as Master Cylinders brake hoses Rotors you can count Raybestos on brake parts only i used it on my 99 Villager and i am very happy.
B000NC0SA2|3|Replaced push rivits after replacing honda ac compressor. worked wel on upper grill etc but not so well under fender which requires a larger head.
B000CH8P62|5|Perfect fit set point set correctly to give correct low pressure cut out.
B0010E3JW6|1|I used FRAM's Product Application Lookup and it gave me the this product number for a 2002 Toyota Highlander.  However, on installation, this product is 1/4 inch short of filling the tray.  The implication being debris, dust, etc will slip by this filter.  I will not buy this product again.
B001QUHFQA|5|Hello,       I am only using one of the adapters out of the kit right now but it is working very well.  I am using it on a 1972 Honda minibike motor but both ends of the adapter fit and seal perfectly - one end into my obscure minibike motor and the other into my oddball compression check gage.       I cannot ask for much more.  The price was also low and the shipping was fast.    Rick
B000BQSIWK|5|I got this to periodically charge the battery in our cars to keep them in better condition. The charger is easy to hook up and  let automatically give the correct charge.
B00MMLJ0BU|5|My kid didn't have keyless entry...so I thougyt would give the dealer a call......to much money.  When I purchased these they have worked as billed.  Good product
B000SL0R9K|4|Good first-aid kit, a little bigger than you'd expect but I still made space for it in my Camelbak. I don't recommend hanging it off your backpack by the Carabiner, as 1) the Carabiner is cheap and will break easily and 2) the bag could easily be caught on something.<br /><br />Still, it's a decent kit and case-quality is solid. I'd recommend it!
B004JKKW14|5|Can't really go wrong with this one, comes with 5 pins and lifts my Triumph Daytona with no problems. Feels sturdy when it's in the air as well.
B000BZEHW6|5|perfect fit works great old one came wright out and no more check engine light . fast shipping best price anywere.hopefully it last as long or longer than originals.
B00C1453SM|5|great!
B004LBRCZ0|4|they are jumper cables nothing to get exited about unless your car doesn't start and you have no jumper cables.
B0068FX4LI|3|It is not what i was expecting, but I have to say that the helmet is high quality, but the size outside of it, its huge, I look like an astronaut coming or going to space, i really dont get it, they should improve their design process
B007P72VTY|5|All parts as described. Everything working now for 5000 miled.
B001BY0A2M|4|A number of people on the Corvette Forum have recommended this highly so i bought a case. It's pretty good, better than Windex I think. I have some other products I like better - and more expensive.
B004SRK3CG|5|It's always nice to place an order and have the correct part show up! It went in easily and works perfectly! It's nice to go through the drive through again! 5+*s
B000CKO30G|1|I ordered these as a replacement for the Smitty Built bars I've had for ten years since they were starting to develop rust. I assumed that they would be an even swap out and I could use the existing holes. WRONG! They have been completely redesigned, and for no reason. Also now made in China. I always say that if it's not broke, don't fix it. Instead of frame mounts, they are now mounted to the body, requiring more drilling and cutting away of the plastic wheel well covers. Now for the fit and finish...they don't! I had to contact the techs at Smitty Built twice and got no good answer or fix. I had to drill new holes in the forward mount plates to get them to fit and when complete they don't fit straight or come out as far making them only a toe step. In hind sight, I should have sent them back. You'd be wise to find another brand. Funny thing is, I sold my old set on line and the buyer wanted them because they were frame mounted and he couldn't get his set of these to fit either.
B005WXSHQ4|3|I like these gloves but for sledding they are a bit thick, i cant feel my controls at all..  I use them for a back up pair just incase the temps drop.
B006OSNUZE|3|looks great, good price but a bit on the small side
B002GOX3QQ|5|My sister just loves MJ. Perfect birthday gift! She just loves it!
B00407RRGY|5|I got a bumper for my 2003 Toyota Matrix XRS Lunar Mist, and the color is actually very similiar to it. Naturally a spray can isn't going to be an exact match especially after the paint has faded for 12 years now, but it's close enough where it works.<br /><br />Note: Spray very lightly each coat and MAKE SURE TO SPRAY FROM 10 inches away. Or it'll run easily. also make sure to tape things off if you don't want run off on other parts you don't want painted.<br /><br />Included pics of where i painted the bottom of my bumper from black to silver.
B003Y9A0OK|3|I didnt want to get a true degreaser but this is just okay.  i still had to do a bit of scrubbing when i mixed it 3 to 1.
B00FJXKE5E|2|For something that's backed by Y-Combinator and Andreessen Horowitz, I thought the app would be a lot more than just something that calculates my gas mileage. That's pretty much all I use it for, as their 'future updates' have been promised for 6 months without any visible changes to the app. Our other car has an MPG display, so I don't ever have a reason for putting it in that car. For the gas mileage feature, I do find it very useful and it would get a 5/5 if it was 1/10th of the price. It's nice that I don't even have to think about it or turn on my phone, I can leave it in my pocket and I can review my trips at the end of the week.<br /><br />it seems to me that they probably had some great product planned, but had a contract for production of the devices, so they had to release the product before the software was finished. They were probably pushed to launch the product early because of investors, but the fact is the product stinks in its current state and would still be in 'public beta' if they wanted anyone to believe that the app will receive future updates. I certainly don't expect anything except the product in its current state, and nobody should purchase their device based on a promise of future functionality.<br /><br />The 'Drive Score' is garbage. When it comes to actual gas usage, I often end up with higher MPG on lower scoring trips. I also love how it beeps at me for actually coming to a complete stop at a stop sign instead of rolling through it. I guess it would save gas if I never stopped....<br /><br />Basically, if you have a car that doesn't calculate MPG and you want to know what it is with any hassle, then it's a good product. It's up to you to decide whether that convenience is worth the price tag before purchasing this device.
B000C7VZGY|5|When I compared my radiator with this one this one is thicker which means better cooling. Installation was a bit of a pain but that had nothing to do with this radiator and had to do with removing the stock one. Once it's out of the way this one goes in pretty easily. Be prepared with new hose clamps if you're doing this on your only vehicle. Our stock radiators outlet was more narrow and the original hose clamp did not fit. Both the oil and transmission cooler attachment points came with adapters which I had to use on the oil side and didn't have to use on the transmission side. In the end this one cools much better than the stock one does, and all with no more leaks which is great!
B00062ZMPA|5|A great air  filter at a great price with fast shipping!. The item arrived in perfect brand-new condition and is an exact fit for my 2001 Suzuki Esteem, thank you!
B007ZGKKMA|4|Wow, what a good light for a good price. The flood light makes a nice crisp wide light, while te spot light sends the light out over 200 feet.
B005ZY9476|5|A Wrecking Yard wanted to charge my son $ 350.00 for this unit. I suggested to my husband to check on Amazon. He was amazed when he found the unit not only brand new, but practically for half the price. What a find. We ordered this product for our son with Amazon Prime. It arrived when promised  and we were extremely happy with the price. The packaging was excellent and the product was secure. We were suprised to see that the light bulbs were included too. A nice bonus. My husband installed the unit which was a perfect fit. But most of all when our son cleaned and washed his car we knew pride in ownership had returned.<br />Money well spent<br />The Happy Parents
B009Q8647A|5|My order arrived on time. Product like described, good quality, fit and works perfectly. I think this is an excellent choice.
B00527HGIU|5|Fits perfect goes with rs 8 red and black interior sweet could not ask for more even feels great in the hand
B003GX85R8|5|I applied it on the front of my golfcart, the &#34;BULLY BUGGY&#34; in which my two bulldogs love to ride. It's perfect.
B007MAKGXC|5|I've used these bulbs for close to a year now and I am so impressed!<br /><br />I've had these in my 2012 Ford Focus as both my low beams and fog/driving lights and they are a huge improvement over the factory bulbs. I tried Silverst@rs but they only lasted 6 months. Aside from the longevity, I'd say these are just as bright if not brighter than the Sylvania's.<br /><br />I drive to work everyday at 4:30am in an area with alot of wildlife and I can honestly say these bulbs have saved my butt and animals several times because the other bulbs are inferior!<br /><br />I'm buying these for my wife's 2011 GMC Terrain after I write this review as she had a factory bulb burn out the other day.
B00266Z8LW|1|Does not fit h11 connectors
B005CLP980|4|fit to my Nisaan altima 2003.
B00068OLEW|1|Does not hold up to exhaust applications. It smokes under the heat and became brittle and charred. I would not recommend using it for an exhaust manifold gasket. Will not hold up to as much heat as advertised
B005MZX0T6|5|Cool.  Love sharing awareness about Addisons disease. Sticks great on my car. I recommend this to everyone who knows someone with this illness.
B005ASY23I|5|It's everything everyone reports:  well made, fast, quiet.  Glad I saw this v. the cigarette lighter model.  Only suggestions for Viair:  forget the ball, etc. valves mount (it broke off during shipment, NBD), and yes, include a bag - and a spare fuse, and instructions (none in my box).
B006TXDCA2|2|TO LARGE FOR SEATS
B00G8QJ19Q|5|Love it
B00BMRZN66|5|Great product, takes the strain out of transferring gasoline from 5 gallon containers into my vehicles
B0046JNZ8A|2|WAS EXPECTING A LARGE SIZE.  THIS &#34;LARGE&#34; SIZE SPRING SUN SHADE DOESN'T EVEN FIT MY COMPACT TOYOTA COROLLA! NEVER THOUGHT I WOULD NEED AN EXTRA LARGE SIZE FOR A SMALL CAR! NOT HAPPY.
B003NHEPEE|5|My husband just replaced a broken strut on the rear hatch of our 2011 Suburban LTZ.  The door had stopped opening.  Replacement was simple and only required a small screwdriver.  Doing it ourselves saved hundreds of dollars.
B00A05AXSY|5|Great quality.
B00206I1Y4|1|Build quality and materials not suitable for the job. First time I used it to connect to my motorcycle, cracked.
B000B8WMAW|4|It's fairly comfortable and I'm sure it will work just fine for us.  I like the fact it folds so if we need to store it we need to.  Thanks A lot!
B008HIVIV2|5|Good quality & looks GREAT!<br />Beauty Browne, EMT
B0031OX4P0|5|Great Product, I replaced the ones that came with my RV which were plastic with these.
B000CPI5XW|5|I can't attest to this stuff working miracles, but since you are only recommended to change this fluid every 20K miles or so, I thought it was worth it to spend the extra cash.  Shifts are smooth, but not necessarily any better than before.  Finding neutral seems easier though, but also could be all in my head...
B0031WEN5C|5|I have to confess, I AM ADDICTED to these blades! Rampage is the only way to go. I would never, ever consider buying another wiper blade to install on my vehicle. I highly recommend this brand!!!
B00E63TI32|5|Durable and the double insulated design keeps my water cold all day
B007KPTAH2|5|Nice T-shirt.  Arrived as expected.  Was not disappointed when I received the T-shirt, nice quality and light weight.  Great shirt to wear when riding
B00KWNUFFA|5|Excellent fit. Comes with extra parts as well.
B00DHGPVKI|5|Works great I would recommend it.
B000CQI0W2|1|Cable broke the first time I used it. Not a happy camper.
B000Y7YSGQ|5|Item bought fits perfect and looks like it is a fixture on my boat so it blends in well.  I have a closed door head with sink and decided to go with a porto pottie for ease of use and removal for cleaning after a long weekend trip used by me and my guests.  Makes a long fishing trip with my gf much more user-friendly and comfortable for her too.
B0054T8XE2|4|SO FAR SO GOOD
B005FA5W26|5|It is a very good quality decal. Everything you would expect out of it. I took a risk and put it on my front windshield and the wipers don't bother it at all. Just follow the instructions and you'll be good. A technique you could use is to spray windex on the glass and then put the sticker on and you can move the sticker around to exactly where you want it, but this makes it take a while to dry and stick in place.
B001JT0IK8|4|k40 doesn't make the weather cap anymore. i had one years ago and it fit very snug but the newer ones are loose for some reason. they can be fixed with a little modification though. i recently bought six of these from different places and they all fit the same. loose. i called k40 and the rep told me that this is the reason they discontinued the caps. as fine of an antenna the k40 is they should have fixed the problem with the caps instead of stop making them.
B00062ZNEA|5|This is a replacement element for the Cold Air Intake System that I installed on my truck some months ago. It is a duplicate of the original. This way I can clean the original at my leisure. It is new and just like the original. Everything is just fine.<br />Howard
B00KLZ65GM|5|Love it!
B000CRCWES|5|I bought 2 of these, which are interchangeable. The original engine mount on the driver side was completely snapped off and the other was cracked all the way around.<br /><br />Was half the price of O'Reilly and Napa even if you include shipping.
B000182F18|5|Shipment was prompt, easy to install (I've done these before on other vehicles). The AVS brand fit perfectly on my 2000 Blazer. I used another brand on another vehicle & didn't fit as good as this one.
B00BFLW6HS|5|Easy to fill and charge. Using on 1982 Honda V45 Magna.
B000C16XU8|1|I think the motor probably still works, but the assembly somehow binds-up.  Maybe that's why people replace the whole drive track, etc.  Needed to drill holes in the door to remove old motor.
B00DK8GKKI|2|I have to jiggle the lid and prop it with a stick for the fan to work. Very poorly made. Wouldn't buy it again.
B009XIXDCM|5|These really provide so much more control than without. Without these, I would slide all over the tank but these provide so much grip, it's almost too much but I'm not complaining. I'm just glad my balls aren't banging against the tank anymore. My only gripe would be the price is a little high but I guess justified because the quality is there.
B00CGFPW64|5|I do very little auto interior work, but I needed something to remove the dashboard panels, etc while replacing my in-dash navigation system.  These tools made the job A LOT easier.  The job was completed without any scars on the dashboard panels, etc..
B0049IFX56|4|I needed a tach to diagnose and adjust idle settings on my outboard boat motor, it has to be used or mounted within the reach of the sensor wire which is about 5 1/2 ft. long
B001TI5IIQ|5|Does exactly what it says it will do.  We are very please with the results and will use again if we ever need it.
B0067ECOZW|5|Great brand and great filter!
B00F0MBFY8|5|Perfect fit for my 2012 Nissan Frontier S King Cab
B0041HN1HM|3|Good price, but 1 hit with a hammer, and it's off.
B0080AWJQA|2|Very flimsy and when I put them on they bent very easy.<br />I would NOT recommend to anyone  DONT BUY!
B0007O8S58|4|I installed these on my 2001 Jeep Grand Cherokee (WJ) so i can see better off-road. I haven't taken them off the pavement yet, but have used them on a dark road and am really impressed. the only thing i'm a LITTLE bit disappointing is the wideness of the beam is dimmer than expected. you can still see off to the sides, just not as bright as where the beam points. and i thought it would be the same brightness. i don't like the yellow smiley face covers either, but i'll be picking up the stone guards real soon.
B0049DSVGY|5|took about a half hour to put in. make sure to take the old one off it will make things easier. the only problem is my daytime running lights do not work.  but who really cares because now i can drive at night.  had this hooked up for a few days now and not a problem.
B0094JHK88|4|Excellent product...
B009SDC46S|5|I installed all four lights and they look great in the BRZ. The lights for the door was a little tricky (the plastic part around the stock bulb) needs to stay around this replacement bulb. I had to remove the top two LEDs to make the plastic part fit.
B0002L6SEY|2|I purchased this for my now ex. At the same time, I purchased a heat shield or window shade from another vendor for a BMW that was slightly more expensive. It is now more than a year later.<br /><br />This Jeep window shade does work. Unfortunately, it is flimsy and thin. So with usage, it has several creases and flops over if not installed just so. The BMW window shade is at least three times thicker and with a felt-like interior, reflective exterior. Its cardboard like construction allows it to stay in place with careless installation. Its thickness contributes to a cooler interior.<br /><br />While the Jeep \\"heat shield\\" does reduce interior temperatures somewhat, in comparison to another, it is not nearly as satisfactory.
B000J41X0S|2|For the price and other reviews, I expected a lot more from this. I purchased the one specific to my car (2004 Mazda 3s sedan) and was initially impressed, but after a couple of weeks, I noticed that the material would crease and not fit perfectly. I think that in its new state, it fit without having to put the front driver and passenger shades down to stabilize it, but then later it had rather large 1-1.5 inch gaps on either side of the glass. I thought it was made to fit seam to seam?? Again, at this price, I would have expected it to. I ended up returning it.
B000AP8EQW|5|Works great with 300C HEMI :-)
B000C02FQ0|5|The Carter PD1 works just like it is supposed to and was easy to install on my fuel pump with the included installation instructions. This part cannot be obtained from a car dealership, they want to sell you the whole sending unit to get this part at a much higher price.
B00E1SO9PO|5|All parts fit and work great , speedy delivery, happy purchase
B0016LEB70|4|Decent enough quality 2 stroke oil.  works well for those 2 stroke weedeaters or snow blowers or lawn mowers that you have.
B001LHVOVK|1|Worked for a month and then it stopped. Now when it is hooked up to a car it CAUSES HARM to the car. Flashes all the dash lights and throws Security and Service Traction Control warnings. Thank god unplugging it quickly made everything go back to normal... hopefully nothing was terminally affected. Hooked up another brand of saner and it worked fine at checking the codes. Buyer beware and use with caution.
B00IEA8R76|5|This is exactly what we were looking for and the price was right!  Saved us a great deal of money.
B000EH0ORI|4|Have been using this siphon for filling our cars. We like to have at least 10 gallons extra fuel at home for just-in-case emergencies.  Works so easy, just shake so gravity then siphon starts to transfer fuel. No more pouring using funnels.  Out of the package it had 3 kinks in the tubing. I tried to squeeze the kinks out of the hose but they are still there. I think the flow could be quicker if they were not there. I am removing 1 star for the permanent kinked hose and for restricted flow.<br /><br />I start with a full 5 gallon can placed higher than the fuel filler on the car. I first insert the clear hose into the car tank, then I insert the metal valve end into the gas can. Shake the valve up and down a few times until the flow begins toward the car.  Simple and easy to use.
B00KBBL4H6|1|Junk, used it once and it was VERY inaccurate. By the time I used it on my RV it was to late to return so I am stuck with a non working gauge If I could return it it I would give them another chance to prove their product and improve this review.
B0056ODEP8|5|I needed to fit a new 200,000 BTU Camco propane hose to an existing two-stage regulator but the regulator has a 1/4&#34; Female NPT inlet. Lowes as no-go for finding the right brass fittings (I should have known better than to waste my time looking!) so I went back to Amazon (PRIME!) and ordered it with free two-day shipping. Done. Installed. Works. No leaks.<br /><br />It isn't cheap ($7 for a little tiny brass adapter) but it gets the job done. Simple.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B008M7SVBS|5|I had gotten the full black topped Mercedes emblem caps before and loved them. I decided to try these for the price, and they worked great! No issues what so ever.
B000CO9QBI|5|excellent supplier recommended
B00AOA9WV4|5|Very good quality I will recommend  to every one this floor mats fits perfect my Toyota fj cruiser 2010 and also look great Thanks weather tech
B00J5SY4NW|5|Only took 30 minutes to remove the *$1,000. defective one and replace it with this one! My 2001 1.8 turbo beetle is running like it is brand spankin new!!!!! I love it.
B00VJ2WCAO|5|This is a great garbage trash can that is neat and simple in design and very easy to install. It comes flat, but expands quite a bit to hold a lot of stuff. We eat a lot in the car and there's always tons of trash. This trash bag makes the car look cleaner. The bag is very durable and made with high quality material. The best part is that it looks very nice and can be emptied easily.My son always use to put down his used juice tetra packs on the car mat so we started using grocery bag to keep all our trash but we were not comfortable with that arrangement. Since this Logiclux car garbage trash can is waterproof and leakproof, we are able to trash juice pack or water bottle without any fear of<br />leakage any more. This bag has dual mesh pockets one on each side and holds cups, soda tins, bottles etc perfectly. It’s a good value for money. I would highly recommend this to any vehicle owner, especially for those with children.I had received this product in exchange for my unbiased reviews.
B002DQJBJK|5|I run this in my motorcycle and it suprisingly lasts the whole tank- not much is required per tank- overall a good product
B008Y4NNXA|4|Worth the money. These are made out of plastic and are easy to paint. I painted them black to match my wife's new rims and they look great.<br /><br />We placed them on a 2013 Toyota Prius.<br /><br />So far, they have held up great (1+ month of use)
B000BUU5WW|4|Works well but the plastic is flimsy so you need to be careful.
B001S0EIK4|1|At first glance this appears to be s sturdy piece of metal, but trust me the looks are very deceiving.  It is extremely brittle, and snapped apart on me before I could even get the thing fully attached to the battery.  Just look at the pictures I will be adding shortly.  They speak far louder than anything I can type here.
B007Q4Y04K|3|It's very cheaply made, lacking OEM quality.  It is easy to install and does work after adjusting the length of the actuating rods.  I would not rely on it for any amount of security, as it can easily be pried open, keeps the honest people honest.  Perhaps the chrome version is of better quality.
B000E302L0|2|After researching other aftermarket sites and reviews here, I took the chance at getting these. Not the best choice. The product seems a little &#34;cheap&#34; when holding it and after installation  I found that I had to adjust the mirror all the way inboard just to get close to see the rear and side of the car. The factory mirror had a lot more inboard adjustment to it. I would recommend others to spend the extra money and purchase these from another manufacturer.
B004Z27FZM|4|I just received my keychain after 3 weeks, the first 2 I waited and waited and never received it, so I contacted them and they were really good about emailing me back and sent out another one right away!  I gave them 4 stars because I loved the product and the person I emailed was really nice, the down side was I had to wait so long time for a keychain....
B00ELJD0BW|5|Sweet hose!
B00G009VUY|5|I am using this as a nitrogen gauge for off road shocks. It works well as a gauge. No leaks or other bad thing have happened
B00C5T1NIW|2|Ordered the correct model for truck and the product would not recognize my key.  On the positive side it was returned and I was refunded money without a problem.  I also ordered a lock for my trailer hitch at the same exact time and this has been working out fine.
B0016KGZ6G|5|only took a few min to install got it at a great price cheaper than most retellers and looks great also recommend
B00O4BNGFC|3|Came on time and as expected but does not fit. Either part number is not correct or my info on wheel is incorrect but ordering and shipping was fine.
B000E4PNDG|4|Super fast delivery, thanks! Item fits well Alero 2004. The only thing is that the up & down electric connector is backwards, but not a big deal.
B0006IX7V0|5|Simple and solid construction.
B0045FQB9U|1|I bought this product for my son' s GMC truck and he installed it, but it never worked and couldn't be returned or refunded because it was an electronic product.
B000CQSKV8|5|used it in my pick up.  did the job.  very easy to install.  no problems at all with this product
B000O846UI|5|I already had broken one socket from another manufacturer while trying to remove the rusted and  bolts. This did it without a problem. OTC usually makes great stuff and this is one. You need this special tool to remove the bellhousing bolts on many GM auto transmissions.
B00652ZAMK|5|I have been looking for something like this for a long time. In school we had \\"Chiltons\\" and though it was 1000 pages or so, it covered all makes for a 10  year period. With illustrations detailing the year to year body style differences and options and plenty of \\"how-to\\" photos. You could easily put one whole book on one CD. and that would be worth $37.00. One disk per year and of course these are not Chilton. It's a lousy deal.
B000B5QFE4|4|I paid 38$ us for these, they were 80+$ at the camp store, they work great for towing my camper, it's not the best setup out there but for what I do, it works great. On or off in about 1 minute. Can't really complain. I'm happy.
B00CIVM0AC|3|The cans appear to be sturdy and well-constructed, and I would rate them 5-star in that regard.  The photo though seems to indicate that the spout is centered in the top of the can, and therefore is covered by the locking arm.  Unfortunately, this is not the case with the cans I received.  Fortunately, I have other applications that do not require the spouts to be locked, and I can use these cans there.
B00KTIYXLU|5|Simple to program, and works 100% better than our worn out factory remote.
B002MQ14B4|3|The boots looks good, but runs really big. I ordered in my size 7 and really feel like 9. I ordered the same boots for my husband, I hope those runs ok.
B004IARGLO|5|This is my second truck to install an Airaid on. I love the sound and the money it keeps in my pocket.
B000NS1LXY|4|came on time, was what i was looking for, fits, good quality
B005MKDJ2Y|1|The instructions were a poor photo copy that we couldn't read and therefore haven't been able to use this product.  We haven't had the time to contact the seller so they have just been sitting on our kitchen counter.  $20 for 4 pieces of cheap plastic could have at leasst had better instructions that are legible.
B000C30J3I|5|Other reviews stated that this is the perfect solution for belt noise. I installed this belt on a 2002 Chevy Blazer that had a horrible click. The important thing to note is that there is still likely a problem, such as a crooked pulley, but this belt quiets the noise until you get the problem fixed, if you choose to do so.<br /><br />Installation was simple and the noise is gone!
B00NGFP5S8|4|Installed perfectly. After a few days, the joints really started squeaking bad. Nothing a little WD-40 couldn't fix though. I am happy with these. No more bumped heads while trying to get groceries in the back.
B00OFQFZVE|5|Great quality, and LEDs got here when expect it.
B00JEUHVTU|5|Second time around and they look great
B0012ILZAS|5|The horn was easy to install and it sounds great!!  Looks good too! The wires are not marked for positive and negative so just test it yourself before finalizing the instalation
B000TM7HXC|5|I purchased this device to scan the walls in my house and see where the insulation was weak.  It works like a charm.  I'm sure I'll find other uses as well.
B004QPCLC0|5|Color matches and fits as it should.... Used youtube for installation guidance. Prompt delivery.
B000C59SMY|5|All Terraza have independent rear suspension, When ordering shocks tell them it is all wheel drive even for frt. wheel drive vehicle and you will get correct MA 826. The top of the shock has a sleeve in the mount. The bottom mount has a larger diameter then the MA 824 shock. I originally ordered MA824 which is for frt. wheel drive model. MA 824 does not fit so I called Monroe and they didn't know about issue. I took a chance and ordered shock for all wheel drive, and it is a perfect fit replacement on the frt. wheel drive model also
B00C0SQ9IW|4|Work well
B001TJ1WB2|4|the best set of floor mats i have seen for under 100. My only complaint is the mats in the front have trouble staying put because the buttosn dont match up on the floor so it cant latch in, otherwise its a great mat and easy to clean with a hose
B001HJJWQQ|5|I have a topper on the truck and with out this lock the bed is not lockable.  Install was not hard but not easy either.  The directions were good and helped as long as you read them.
B00EE56UAG|3|Its ok
B005JU5XE4|5|Safety for our family is the number one priority.  These blades work wonderfully and do not squeak at all.  I make it a habit to change the blades every January (annually), as recommended by blade manufacturers.  They are easy to keep clean and look great too.  Tried other brands of wiper blades and the Bosch ICONS are the best value, in my experience.
B0013OFIJA|5|Still looks new after over a year of use
B005A3YIOQ|5|I looked at local auto shops who told me it was. Dealer only product, so I called the dealer who quotes 200 plus 60 for labor. I payed 1/3 if the price, and it was PERFECT!
B00EPQ7S14|3|Harbor Freight has the same sling for half the price, less when It's on sale. It's even the same photo.
B005IC2SNW|5|Good fit, no major issues
B000ILHSFQ|1|I bought this for my 2005 Dodge Ram 1500 regular cab - received the window visors which are designed to fit on a quad cab and DO NOT FIT A REGULAR CAB WINDOW.  According to the listing it fits but does not in actuality.  DO NOT BUY THESE UNLESS YOU ARE DRIVING A QUAD CAB.  Guess I'm out $22.00 since it's not worth shipping or the effort to send them back...
B0015DLNDE|4|Good
B00AWN3QX8|4|Would really give 4.5 stars.  Fabric is a little thin for a seat cover, but color and print are as pictured and it fits SUV seat very well.  I bought for my daughter as a present for getting her  driver's license and she is very happy with them.
B0015KROXU|4|I tested this product out in a few different ways around the house:<br /><br />The backsplash behind our stove. Grease splashes up there while cooking, and it's always a pain to clean. I sprayed this stuff on there, let it sit for a few seconds, wiped down, and the grease was gone. This was definitely easier than any other method I've tried in the past. I also used it right on the stovetop while I was at it, and it worked awesome there also.<br /><br />For the big test I got out the grill. We cleaned our grill big time when putting it away last winter, but use it a lot and haven't cleaned it yet this summer. This task was a little more difficult, and took some major scrubbing to get some of the greasier parts clean. This isn't really surprising, since there was a lot of grease to remove - but it wasn't a quick spray/wipedown project like the stove was. Still though, it worked great.<br /><br />This Grez-Off is a great all-purpose cleaner, and I'm going to be using it a lot moving forward. When it runs out, I'll definitely be buying another bottle.
B006OQ35GU|1|Too short
B000VE1G26|5|So far the item has endured the weather and is bright and shinning as the day I received it, thank you, because my order from sgt grit both times the plate faded.
B003LT9I64|5|It works great for my 2000 Ford Expedition. no problems
B00AZOGYRE|5|jeep repair
B000YCAM70|5|Great idea!  It makes an unbeatable system when paired the cargo containment system.
B000NVW1LM|5|Great stuff.. I used it to on the dry cracked rubbers on my car to get rid of the squeaks.. works greatt
B003UZ05CA|4|Fits easily on my quad, and now I use it for the lawn mower.  I'm not a big fan of the anti drip/twist and push spouts, but this one works okay so far.  Should have bought the second mounting bracket to go with it.  If seen people mount them to the wall in their garage.
B00AANKLC4|5|So far I wish that all adjustable so we're put together this way!<br />Rubber joint covers are amazing vs open air adjustables. Good solid coat over the steel.<br />Solid design I stand behind these!
B000AL2RI2|5|Excellent product..!!
B00DQJ8T00|1|Does not fit, does not work at all.
B00JW1W4ZC|4|Looked up prices comparing OReilly, Autozone, and Amazon.  This same part is a midprice part at Oreilly costing $40 more.  So although it was the cheapest option on Amazon, it is not truly the cheapest option in the industry. Just a very solid price for a mid line product.  Upper end product would be the OEM motorcraft part, really as long as this one works no reason to pay $130 for that.<br /><br />Installation was simple, just a word of advice. After you install the new part and try to see if your new part works.  Make sure you start the vehicle.  Thought that I really screwed something up, only emergency flashers worked.  Then started the vehicle and everything worked.<br /><br />Installed on 2000 Ford Ranger.  Box said multi switch fit 1999 - 2004 Ford Ranger.
B00418RSF2|5|Nice
B0006HOJ9A|5|Its rated slightly higher than the OEM. If you have the factory towing package on your truck you will have to make your own bumper mounts with holes 2 inches longer from the Fey mounting holes. The OEM towing package includes a part that will interfere with the Fey bumper.
B004TRKBOK|5|I have unfortunately been at the scene of two accidents where one of these have made a difference in someones injuries (or saving a life).  I am glad I stumbled across these, you never think about them, until you need one.  These should come in EVERY NEW CAR SOLD IN AMERICA!!!<br /><br />Very well made durable plastic, nice weight, simple size for most hands, and can easily pack a punch when needed.  The blades are definitely sharp, went right through a piece of cardboard like butter.<br /><br />I have not had to try either one of these in a real scenario, but as a retired military fire fighter, it is built like the more expensive ones we bought through the Government, at less than 1/10 th the cost.<br /><br />Do your fellow travelers a favor, and just put one in each of your glove boxes of your vehicles.  You could one day save a life.....<br /><br />Going to purchase a two pack of these for every guy in my family for Christmas.  That way, both theirs and their wives cars will have them.
B004GCKPH6|4|Worked well and fit 99 Chevy S10
B005TC9VTU|1|I installed the emblem and within a week the white parts turned yellow. DO NOT BOTHER WITH THIS PRODUCT! IT IS NOT GENUINE!<br /><br />It is a cheap knock off. You're better off buying a real roundel from somewhere else.
B00K8CPSIY|5|Sold vechicle
B00ITYPKO0|5|Don't buy the single one replace both. It's amazing how crappy the one that I thought was good looked next to the new one.
B000NU0HVY|5|Be aware that the struts are OEM replacement, so their rebound is as soft as OEM. The springs lowered my Civic just over an inch front and rear, making it look less like a 4x4 and more like a proper sporty car. The gap around the tire is now even all the way around, so that's an improvement.<br /><br />I'm still running stock 13&#34; wheels and tall tires, which work in concert with the soft struts to dampen impacts on bumpy roads. If you also share the car with other drivers who aren't keen on firm or stiff suspension, this setup is the perfect compromise.<br /><br />Whether taking a high-speed sweeper or shorter, tighter corner, the car corners noticeably flatter (much less body roll), giving you much more confidence since the car is more stable and level.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you're ready to replace your worn struts and also want to put some more fun back in your drive.
B005ZTQ25I|5|Perfect
B000CPI5Y6|5|Perfect for my Alfa. Just like the oem.
B000XTHUHE|5|Great transaction.  Product worked great.  These Rain-X wipers are very will made and have worked perfect so far.  I would recommend them.
B000GTUM9O|5|Excellent! Looks great on my Kawasaki Sherpa. Good quality hardware and shield. Instructions were easy to follow. Makes riding at highway speeds more pleasant.
B002DTDCKQ|5|AWESOME Exhaust!  Well build, great product.  Sounds awesome!  No drone on the highway, awesome growl at start up and when you get on it!<br /><br />If I had to find one thing, I didn't like that it came with saddle clamps instead of band clamps.  I picked up some stainless steel band clamps locally and used those instead.<br /><br />Awesome overall, great quality, I'd highly recommend it to any denali or escalade owner!.
B0097C9UNU|1|It did not work Paid $16 for it did not work so now it is just the toys for the kids can play with
B003OXIKFW|5|Ordered this after my mirror was destroyed by a runaway shopping cart in a Target parking lot.  We found instructions on installation on line and it took about 5 minutes to replace the mirror.  Perfect fit and now I can keep an eye on those cars on my passenger's side.
B00370N1UG|5|This stuff works very well, just remove oil, grease and large amounts of dirt and the rust is gone! Beats blasting everything. Will buy more for larger jobs in the near future.
B007VXTR58|5|Good tow hitch. Very affordable and well built
B002TZSKO2|5|Excellent quality. Very fast shipping.
B000ALG86E|5|Car cover was as expected. It fit perfect and stay's on in the wind. There are tie downs to secure it as well. The material is strong and the price was great.
B0004ELKC4|5|Great stuff
B00AR7KBB4|5|Good PnP
B002L29FEM|2|I wasn't very impressed with the product. I was hoping for better results and the polish didn't perform. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless all they wanted to do was remove water spots.
B000C17G6S|1|Bracket didn't fit.  Bolt holes didn't line up with original bracket.  Noticed Dorman doesn't even list the part number on their website anymore.
B001CSKEOQ|3|I like it.. it Was a gift for My girlfriend 4 her Car..
B00NLM3SOO|5|It looks awesome and it fits perfectly. It was used in a 2013 Hyundai sonata
B005SUXT6E|5|Great item. I put 3 of them in my enclosed trailer, 2 on the outside to pull the bikes into and the third backwards in the middle near the doors. With them being recessed, I can roll the center bike into the trailer without having to go around a chock. Once I get it back far enough, just lift up the lid and roll the bike back into the chock. Super simple.<br /><br />Bonus is I can use the trailer for other things without having to worry about the chocks being in the way. Or just fold them down so I don't bust my shin on them while walking inside the trailer.<br /><br />Would definitely buy again.
B000760FX4|4|Light and easy to use. The cast aluminum is deceptively strong and the screw jack is easy to quickly adjust and tension. Overall a good value.
B000BZEHW6|5|Recieved unit new in box, more than half the price of local auto parts store ! I installed the unit and I'm totally saticfied. No problems!
B000C9IJKW|5|very good product
B000GV6M96|5|I received my freeway bars sooner than expected, even though they were delivered to the incorrect address (it happens in my area). The bars fit and look great! And several fellow riders told me prior to my purchase that these protected their bikes when they accidentally tipped over. Very pleased and as I was told...a big fat cruiser needs big fat bars to protect it!
B00B1G8GDA|3|Comfortable and look nice. Quick shipping. Video was fairly helpful. The only problem is it doesn't allow for rear seat belt placement and the videos I viewed did not go over this either.
B00BH2YW7C|5|Excellent fit. Easy installation
B00IESAA9Q|1|Received two, both were defective. Had to take vehicle to dealer to have a factory CPS installed at a cost of $500
B0068C7412|1|Just didn't work at all.<br /><br />Key bent at the first use.<br />Soft materials like clay.<br /><br />Don't buy it. Even if it's a gift, just throw it away...
B000BGM2XG|5|Was what I wanted and the price was cheaper even with shipping than I could get it where I live Thank You  George Earl
B002MQ2S6E|4|This is great protection against the elements. I wore it through the late part of Fall and early Winter (Winter with sub-freezing temps) with a mesh armor jacket underneath and was plenty warm. This warmth is because it won't breathe. Not a big deal but yet not something I will be able to wear in Summer rain because then I'll get just as wet with sweat.
B000DT7SZ8|5|I was giving one of these years ago for Christmas used it for 4 years then left it at a car wash. I tried several other wash mitts, one only lasted for about 5 washes. I was happy to find the Carrand here on Amazon. The moment you handle this wash mitt the quality is apparent, will not scratch your cars finish. Love it.
B00MXF4N8U|3|Have to share with everyone....my car has 117K miles on it, and just has begun to have a Cat.Conver. issue.  I used one bottle which immediately turned the light off, and somewhat had some improvement.  However, the light came back on soon.  Tried again, same thing.  Light went off for a short while.  I am merely trying to clean out the gook in my Cat Convert and make sure I pass emissions test.  So, it works...but not a perm fix.
B001IWLCGU|4|Driver's side of VW Jetta,  a little pricey but very easy to install, noticed difference on previously streaking windows. Time will tell how long they last
B007F1FMIC|5|Very well made!
B00AYVQ01S|4|I absolutely love this piece! It is heavy and strong and looks as awesome as it is. I had to drill out the holes on the truck frame for the bolts to fit properly but not a huge issue. I did have poor luck buying through Amazon. The seller was not manufacturer approved and originally sent a mount for a Ford truck. Eventually they sent the correct piece but it was a hassle for them to admit the part was wrong and ultimately arrange for pickup and correct delivery.  Each time a mount was delivered it came with minimal cardboard protection or none at all. The mounts were badly scuffed and scratched. I bought rattle can color match paint for my black truck and painted the mount and clear coated. It looks amazing but had not planned on the extra work. Additionally I never received a complete kit or instructions. The Dodge mount has two arms and hardware to complete the install that was never sent by the seller. Finally Fab Fours got involved and graciously filled the balance of the order (3 shipments of varying completion). I'm fairly confident that my issues were unique and not what would be expected but points out the danger of non- manufacturer approved sellers. All said and done, this piece is amazing!!!!!!
B00Q4YQBGI|5|great quality , worked awesome
B000GGURLK|5|Excellent performan, eassy to install.
B00COOQP6I|4|8/30/14 hook up first day so far so good very eazy hook up with rite car will report back every month for six month for review thanks
B0087NB088|5|Nice Headset, Easy to Setup and Use, Great Sound with my Motorola Droid Maxx. I even paired it with my 2nd Generation IPod Touch for streaming Music. Am A Fan of Sena!!!
B003P6I5KS|5|I uses this 3M product for my scale modeling hobby needs for many years, first as the now out-of-production Acryl-Blue Glazing Putty. Happily, the Acryl-White is the *same* formulation but just without the blue tint!  I find this putty has the perfect spreadability for filling both tiny seams and for minor contouring work (less than 1/16th inch thick) with minimal shrinkage.  It sands easily, adheres well - both chemically (to polystyrene) and mechanically to slightly roughened surfaces - and has excellent 'feathering' performance.  The set hardness supports clean engraving without flaking (unless laid over softer substrates, so avoid applications over less tough materials such as the 3M 'Red' glazing & spot putty...)  It can be polished to a finish compatible with the plastic surfaces I work on with little effort and so will support any type of finish I might need.  It is also very economical when compared to 'hobbyist' brand putties (Tamiya, Squadron, etc.)  Does require proper ventilation since it is VOC based and is not a substitute for where epoxy putty is best, but otherwise is my &#34;go-to&#34; product.
B0080N3C22|5|It's a nice product... but it really doesn't show up well on the back of my cruiser.  It kinda blends in with the license plate.    UPDATE on 5/12/2015... I moved this to a smaller bike and it really looks Great!
B00ZBK2LNS|5|Excellent
B00EYC1VA8|5|Fabulous roducts. Have used them for over a year. No problems. Very useful, effective, efficient.
B008P448U6|1|Not great quality with poorly fitting mask.  I was bummed as I thought this would be better.  It also does not fit over glasses.
B00APM0AKS|5|I was missing a couple of the tire caps to my truck and found these at an amazing price. you get a whole lot for the $$ and the caps are of good quality. Now I have extra just in case I may need in the future.
B006GV7UKK|3|Better than the carpet mats and easier to clean but was disappointed on how much area it doesn't cover.  If keeping the vehicle clean is a huge requirement then I'd suggest looking into 3rd party products.  Probably be more expensive but will do a better job.
B00551DZ3S|5|seems to do the job
B000TYQ9GQ|5|good
B004Q86JJ8|4|After one month my 1979 Ford Pickup being stored in a lot started up on the first click as if it had been started and ran the day before.
B005PZMKZI|2|back seat of my pilot has 3 (three) head rest..  This only come with 2 for the back seat.
B000TYGCXQ|3|This product doesn't fit too well with the reminder cable I bought so I don't use this as much as I would like to. It does offer a great sense of security when I leave it outside in the city. The carrying case is a nice feature and the extra keys were a great bonus.
B0045SZYNQ|5|Super soft and good leather, cute look, and they fit perfectly!!  I love my new riding gloves! A+ on quality and look
B00546A92E|5|Excellent quality and great fit.  After all, it is a Toyota product.
B005XBGVW2|5|Worked great, solved my sticky acceleration and made my sportsman 500 come alive again. Happy happy happy is what my trusty camo polaris has to say about this.
B00E9FS3QK|5|Fits perfectly. It didn't take a long time to arrive either. It was easy to install and no hardware was needed to attach it.
B002GQQ8WU|5|I was so upset thtat I had accidently thrown out this peice when it was stuck to the bottom of a cup. I called BMW and they wanted to charge me anywhere from 50 to 300 dollars to replace the entire cup holder. I found this item and when it arrived I was very pleased that it fit perfectly!!!! THANK YOU!!!
B006WQSEYA|5|I had these installed about 3 weeks ago. My old ones had about 180k miles on them and were so bad that going down the road at 40MPH you felt like you were sitting in a massage chair. (yea, I know, should not have let them get that bad but they were no where near not that bad before my trip from Erie, Pennsylvania to Gatlindburg, Tennessee) Needless to say, a welcome change. I have taken a trip that was about 2 hours away and had the car up to about 70 most of the way, and so far, they have held up good. The bearings were for a 4 door 2003 stratus. One fair warning, if you plan on putting them on yourself, get ready to use a sledge hammer to break them free. Mine were so rusted into place that it probably took me about 30 minutes of constant pounding on the old one to break it free. Also, if I remember right, the socket to get it off is a E14 or a 14 mm external torx, the kind that takes the end in and looks almost like a stardard socket, but is a torx set instead of box set. in the package it was mailed in, there was not a lot of extra padding, but to be fair, it does not matter what kind of packing you put in it, the packing material would have been crushed. I bought 2 of these and the weight would have crushed any kind of packing, but the box they were shipped in was not much bigger then the 2 inside boxes with the bearings. So in a case like this, smaller is better. If anything happens, I will update but hopefully dont need to.<br /><br />Update: June 22..<br /><br />It has now been 7 months since I got them put on and so far, everything is still as good as the day I put them on. No problems.
B007UHPSCQ|3|I purchased this to help dim headlights. New types of headlights that depart from traditional Halogen lights cause too much glare and I find myself almost totally blind to oncoming cars so equipped. This does dim them sufficiently for me to actually see what is going on again although it is darker than I would have hoped. It does the basic job though.
B009VZ5SPC|5|Great product.
B002P8DFPW|5|Easy installation (look up a video on youtube if you need steps)- 15 mins tops!!  and it looks OEM. Great!!
B000COUSK6|3|The drawing is too small to show, but these tapes don't go all the way around the balancer.   I'd hoped to use one of them to time the cam on an engine in the car, but they are a bit short for that.  Be OK for setting the distributor, if you've got an older engine.  Not sure how long they'd stick to the balancer though.
B000C30J6K|3|It was what I needed tooke time to figure out how to put on but I did it. I rated it a 3 star because I believe they could have made it to put on in a better way.
B0002Q80GS|5|Easy to install and works great
B001O99GC4|1|I received these and they looked like good replacement rotors. I have had them a couple of months and they are the wrong size. they are way too small for my Audi S$. I used the tool to check and got the green tick mark saying they were for my car. now I can no longer return them as it is over 30 days. this sucks and I'm out hundreds of dollars!
B001C90XP0|5|Great brakes. I replaced my Challenger RT stock warped front disks with a set of these and they are awesome. I highly recommend it.
B000EBKG9A|5|Double covered an east facing window to block out the morning sun.<br />Used water as suggested by another commenter - works great
B0017OANWI|1|The website said it would fit my car but they did not. Nice looking lights though but I haven't seen them work.
B000BN3A4Y|3|This is a good product, and would be essential to have in an emergency, however, it is supposed to be attached to the inside of your car using Velcro or double-stick tape.  Are these key elements included in the box?  No!  Now I have to go out and buy something else in order to install it. I gave two of these to my children at Christmas--they are in their 20s and it's unlikely that they will take that extra step until I provide them with the needed materials.  Dumb.
B006X2SEY8|5|Have both the dual controller and the on off controller, on off controller works fine  if you just require a blast of heat for a 5 minutes or less.
B000CI6YF0|5|Truck runs like new
B000IXSF7O|5|love it
B000GU23WW|4|Would be better if they have a digital copy, that'll make searching easier. Color and better quality pictures would be awesome.
B001FMPP8O|5|Great Job
B000C3XDAY|5|I run K&N oil filters on all of my vehicles. I own everything from older muscle cars and trucks to newer vehicles. K&N oil filters are high quality and work well. They do require that you tighten them down about 1/2 to 3/4 per turn past hand tight as they have leaked on me if not.
B005IWQM0C|5|My husband wouldnt use anything else
B00480FHJC|5|So far so good.... Installed it and it fit correctly.
B002A3E3HQ|5|Works great and easy to clean.
B008Y3NZ0W|5|Did what I needed it to do. Priced right and works well on a mild to stock engine with close to stock compression
B0016O9LUE|5|A+
B00068OOSK|1|read the label when it gets cold out you need to double and sometimes triple the amount used, this gets expensive. I've switched to Penray 202032 it treats a full 250 gals.
B007V2EET8|5|This is the 3rd Covercraft Heat Shield I've owned.  Just as the others this sunshade is the best you can get!<br /><br />Yes, you can find a cheaper sunshade but none that are as good as this.  It fits like a glove which I believe is one of the reasons it is so effective.  It will cover your windshield end to end and top to bottom with minimal gaps. I live in Hawaii and the sun can be brutal.  We are allowed to have window tint at 35% legally but tint is not enough on a hot summer day.  This product combined with window tint means no more jumping in to a hot car only to have your legs burnt once they touch the seat.  It is also well built and very sturdy. It looks expensive and is a nice addition to a beautiful car.<br /><br />The one downside is it takes up some space when not being used. Unlike those cheaper pop up sunshades that you can squeeze between your chair and center console this will fold up to be as tall as your windshield and a out 8-10 inches wide. In my opinion well worth the sacrifice for a good product that will keep you cool and protect your dash from the sun.<br /><br />If you are looking for a sunshade for your car, cough up the extra bucks and you will not be disappointed.
B000IZ4AD0|3|I got this Power Door Lock Actuator for a better price on-line than at my local auto parts store. The drawback was I had to wait for it to be shipped, but the much better price made up for it. The actuator was the right one for my application, but I had to do slight modifactions in order to make it work right. The actuator came with a weatherproof protected boot, which I liked, that was not on the OEM actuator. I now have working power door locks again.
B006B7YLPG|5|Great fit as expected.
B00AQ29G4I|1|They came off first week, and made my tire flat twice!
B0091HCB0U|5|Put on my gytr exaust so I could ride on the forest. Seems to do its job.
B000VKTUE6|5|Excellent fit. Fast shipping.
B000AMD6CC|4|Arrived in no box/container or protective packaging.  Some cosmetic damage.  Battery is excellent for the price
B000GU3KHO|4|Item is just as expected, fits well on my 2-seater without having to force it. No complaints here so far.
B000HE6H6K|4|they work fine
B00B1PNIO8|5|very good blades
B00EC0YNLQ|1|it didn't fit.  sent it back
B008G28DSK|5|work great-- and fit nicely, hard to tell from original-  mike
B004HCM9H4|5|This stuff is great on black cars!!!
B00KTIAREM|5|Received on time. Programing instructions worked well. Remote quality not as good as OEM, but should last several years. Overall happy with items.
B007PP26RI|4|I used this product to apply to threads of a 1&#34; NPT threaded pipe, Lawn mower engine exhaust port threads were damaged.  Used mower one time, so far so good.
B002DZJQ0A|5|nice to have
B009M8LCTE|5|This fit my husband's Yukon truck perfectly....he installed it right away and it was easy to do. Fast shipping too!
B0024NWYZU|5|So far so good even tho they are a pain in the ass too install but that's because I had missing screws in my headlamps already but I got them in with the help of 2 additional drilled screws on the top too keep them tight.. I installed my h7 aftermarket 10000K hid bulbs in them and they look great
B001EOYK98|5|Works perfectly. Remember that the 4 inch drop is measured down from the top of the insert.
B008MISDEC|5|My Victory motorcycle requires a 20W40 Semi-Synthetic oil. I have not been able to find this oil at any retailer. My local dealer has it but at a cost of $12.95/qt.  After many months of searching I found my oil at Amazon..but the best part was Amazon's cost was $5.53/qt. My calculations show this to save me over 200%. Awesome is not a big enough word. Plus it was delivered to my door.  You rock Amazon!!!
B008ZOUROC|5|Love them they arrived early and were just as described
B002ZBWKAU|5|I guess I am assuming a great deal with this item, for I haven't actually used it yet.  I purchased it and it took forever to get it, but I wanted something that I could carry in the back of the trunk to inflate my tires if needed.  I hate using those stupid items in the gas stations anymore.  NO one keeps them working or maintained anymore.  There surely NO service in service stations anymore.  All they want to do is sell you over priced gas and junk food you don't need, at least my waist doesn't.  So I guess if my tires need air then I will pull this thing out of the back and hope to God it works!  I liked the feature that you simple set what pressure you want and it fills to that pressure and stops.  It has a light so that is always a good thing.  Hopefully the cord is long enough.
B000NPIYDC|5|The TIF combustible gas detector is outstanding!    I'm a third generation HVAC installer and service technician. I've had one of these units for about 12 years now and it is every bit as accurate and reliable as the day I bought it.    It is capable of measuring tiny gas leaks with astounding accuracy. The probe is flexible, which is extremely handy (and pretty much a necessity).    I laughed when I saw this one on Amazon because it looks identical to the one I bought 12 years ago. I would have imagined they would have updated it. Then again, if something isn't broken why fix it?    It is durable, easy to hear and holds a charge for a very long period of time. It is adjustable and can be set for small or large gas presence.     For professional or DIY use this is the meter to buy.    The only downside is the battery pack. They are not common and cannot be bought at your local hardware store. You'll have to buy them online. They cost around $20 for the battery pack. They last about 5-6 years with constant use. They are rechargeable, but like all batteries they eventually need to be replaced.
B00WWCIUM4|5|Thankfully, they have not expected to utilize it yet but rather they cherished it. Mother called Christmas day to say thank you and said that was an incredible blessing because of that actuality that they move trucks down mountains. Precisely what I had in mind. It is little and fits well in center comfort or the little pocket thing in the entryway. Best keep it close. Try not to need to need to search for it on the off chance that you truly require it. I purchased 2 more for mine and my spouse's autos.
B0002NIF70|5|Really good looking tag, best part... MADE IN USA!!!!
B006NSN7OE|5|AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME!!! Top Notch quality sticker and design. Service was super quick and super easy.<br />I found this item else where for far more $$. So this was a great sticker for a great price!
B00BITJF0S|5|Quality product at a fabulous price. Operation is smooth and looks exactly like the original handle I replaced.
B00KQXKG46|4|only thing i can complain about is the brackets that are sent with it. comes with the ends on it already and a longer cable than i'm used to. but the brackets will be replaced. it is very bright i'm content.
B00H7LPKKU|5|Awesome
B002D3KR4Q|5|Nice fit looks great !
B005Q0NSJO|5|I especially love Zero, my favorite character from the movie, and then to get Jack and a tombstone, total jackpot
B0009IQUOS|3|Not as good as a Mann Filter. But it still does the job.
B0002U6JJ4|5|This bumper sticker is hilarious for two reasons: <br /> <br />1.  It uses sarcasm to tell the truth that Islam is not a religion of peace. <br /> <br />2.  It makes idiots like the other reviewers of this bumper sticker come out of the woodwork to show off their monumental ignorance.
B002X9PPHE|5|Simple directions,easy to put on!!!love my decal:)I would recommend this to anyone that is a true sons of anarchy fan !!!
B004YEJ7KC|5|The people giving this bad reviews most likely do not follow instructions. I've had mine on my truck for about 7 months now and it looks like it did when I took it out of the packaging. The edges will not peel if you thoroughly clean the application area with a detergent (windex), rinse with water, dry with a microfiber cloth, and remove all air bubbles with a credit card/ID/straight, flat edge.
B000C5G42G|5|Fit my pedal perfect!! very pleased with this product highly recommend.Was easy to instal I am a female and did it myself...not that that means anything.
B000VEHNR8|5|Had these for almost 2 years now and still work great!
B001MX9VGS|5|WAS A PERFECT FIT AT A GOOD PRICE.
B00113YVPA|5|cool
B003B32V5U|5|Awesome product. This part worked perfectly in my son's 2000 Monte Carlo SS. This is a great alternative to replacing the entire fuel pump assembly when there's nothing wrong with the pump. If your fuel gauge isn't reading right this can save you hundreds of dollars. Shipping was great, part install was easy, and part works perfectly. Extremely satisfied customer.
B002OUMVWY|5|product is as advertised
B001JEK4KW|3|I was able to get rid of the stench after washing.<br /><br />I don't use these for seat belts - I have two of these which I use on shoulder straps on bags (which we stuff full of heavy items).<br /><br /> It's more comfortable than having no padding, but I wish it were a bit more cushioned.<br /><br />The first one I have was fine after washing and somewhat reshaping, but the second one got very much twisted in the wash.<br /><br />I ended up cutting a slice of one of the seams (one of the end seams that doesn't need to be as strong/won't get constantly pulled during use) and using a pencil end to unfold and maneuver the inside fusion to lie flat as it was before I washed it.  This worked pretty well. Then I just stitched up the cut/seam.
B00KTMRS86|5|Works great!
B005KOZ25Y|3|can't update it at all so I can't give it a better rating but works ok as is
B000C5GL3I|5|Thanks
B005FL5HFW|5|These were for my wife's Honda Pilot. If you are unaware, pilots are notorious for warping front rotors, this full set is awesome. Stops better than when it was new and no brake dust!
B00979N8MW|5|love them, I too also received only one set, I called amazon and they fixed the problem : )
B005INZ7Z2|3|It's a nice tool bag, but the spinning/locking lug just disappeared one day, a couple of months after I got it.  It seemed like with the zipper flap, and then the over-flap, that it would be somewhat water resistant, but sadly, no.
B000C57YMK|5|I bought two of these for my truck. The price of $8.64 is an awesome price. None of the local auto parts stores near me could come close to this price on Moog brand parts. I couldn't even find a &#34;bargain brand&#34; part priced this cheaply. Nowadays I don't buy anything without first checking Amazon.com first.
B001RIAV6M|5|Exactly how we feel!  Prompt delivery, product bright & sticky..what more do you want?
B0007A2AOC|5|Purchased and installed this spacer in my 2006 Dakota with the 4.7L H.O. installation wasn't bad, if you're mechanically inclined. Directions could be better and have better pictures. I've only had this installed for 3 days now. Slight whistling upon acceleration, helped boost throttle response time. Haven't had it on long enough to see how it effects the fuel mileage, only 5-6 miles driven. Combined this with a K&N cold air intake and MBRP exhaust, definitely help make this engine come alive.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Bright lights! !
B0040WK2F2|5|It's exactly what I wanted, nice quality, and excellent customer service from the seller.
B001U04N4S|4|projects...I bought two of these for my windmill. I have a 24v windmill goes to two batteries thus invert to ac current. My lab top went crazy once in a while and the mouse got really sensitive. So I use them for lighting and radio or hopefully to charge my ev car in the future.
B006B20HBS|1|this kit does not work for a 1988-90 Kawasaki ninja zx 10 steel plates are too thin.
B006G14FK8|5|CTEK is the only brand of battery charger worth owning. I put up with lesser brands for too long. There is a reason Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Alfa Romeo etc. use this charger as factory chargers in their offerings. They will charge you twice as much for a relabeled product. Since I had a number of other connectors already installed on my motorcycles and cars, I simply soldered the cheaper plug onto my CTEK. 4.3A is plenty to maintain batterie banks of up to 180Ah. It will also be gentle enough on my motorcycle batteries using the low setting. If you value quality and great engineering, this product will not disappoint you.
B000GBGNO0|5|I installed it in my Hyundai Elantra. It has been a year and I had no problems at all. Easy installation.
B004303LMC|4|I am very satisfied with the product and my purse looks like new.
B0002JMIEK|5|Polish it then wax it. Gr8 shine
B000CNHOKE|1|I had read the other comments but ordered them anyway.  I got them for 2005 Mustang.  They simply do not fit.  You are warned when you get package that if you modify them you cannot return them but they simply do not fit if you do not trim them.  Even after trimming they did not work well.  Obviously NOT a fit for the car even though it showed to be a fit on Amazon.  I should have trusted the other feedback.  Do NOT get these for a 2005 Mustang!
B00F4PL2GM|3|Got a tear in the palm of one pretty quick, but it held up during a 20mph slide out around a turn. Saved my skin so that's all I care about. I'll probably purchase something different when I get new gloves though. I do like the carbon fiber look.
B00068XCQU|5|Great battery charger. Works as described. Delivered on time. No brainer for bike storage or just to top off battery charge.
B00180OS7M|5|Ordered wrong ones  easy return!
B0099V02EA|5|Works great!!!
B0066QQWA4|5|nice replacement for the plastic one that broke when the water pump went out.
B004TB3DZA|5|Great price, even had a rebate offer from Goodyear to make the deal sweeter.  As always, fast shipping so I had more time to drain the system and install.  Fit was &#34;on the money&#34;.  Outstanding!
B003CJK3M6|2|The windshield itself is great, but they did not ship the one I ordered.  I ordered one for tapered forks (for a 2007 Triumph America). I had to contact the manufacturer to get the right clamps for tapered forks. The installation was somewhat difficult.  If I had received the right hardware I would have given it four stars.
B000TYVKUQ|5|This sure beats going to the dealer. 50% cheaper. So easy to look up parts, I never thought of looking here but not any more.
B009ZIMXLW|1|I wish I could go lower than 1 star. These are horrible. The letters finish is very bad and they do not fit the indentations.  They also took 2 weeks to get them. DO NOT waste your money. Look at the size of the center bar of the E in the picture. It does not fill the indent. This is very obvious when you look at them sitting in the seat. The corners look horrible. I
B007X48RV0|3|cute, but definitely will not stay attached.
B000BN74VY|5|This product fit and finish are as advertised . Glad I spent the extra money to buy this product verses the less expensive one. Looks great.
B0097K3M2M|5|Great quality!
B0095RSHF4|5|Hey, I'm impressed. Popped in my H22A figuring that the worse that could happen is I might have to return it, but it worked fine. Definitely beats paying a $100+.
B002UX5CHG|2|the product did not fit my car 91 geo metro bad info. double check to see if things work before you buy.
B002W27Y6C|4|works perfectly for pouring fast but no connector for end cap I cannot ever remember where I set it  should have some kind of connector to keep cap with spout
B000C9VUYO|5|I put this on my 1970 nova 307, it looks like original and plugged up fine, you should order the small condenser located at the bottom of the VR , when you order this VR. It was a great price for a ACDelco, check around and you will see, dont buy the cheap stuff.
B004IV8NBU|4|It is something different, have not installed it as yet, to check it out. But then I have the curve type muffler.
B00PT18QAQ|2|No valve stem bleed nipple, oop's.
B00JE3998S|2|The pictures of the item on a 350Z looked to cover the whole rear quarter panel and the second car showed the sticker covering part of the front quarter panel and hood. The description said the decal was 6' which had to be incorrect. I kepy the decals for use on another part of my Altima GTR. It took over a month for shipping from China. The sellers need to know about misleading advertising here in America.
B004YJP8CS|5|My son installed this himself and it works great
B007AEREI0|5|love the ease of pulling the clutch!
B0000DYVN9|4|Good electric blanket.  Works great in my truck and keeps the dog warm and cozy! I would recommend buying it.
B000AA4RWM|5|Worked perfect for my trailer; put one in the front, and one on the side, real easy to view.
B00539L3VS|4|These mats are heavy duty and fitment is pretty good but not perfect in my 2000 Silverado.  After trimming pieces off, the fronts fit pretty good.  The rear mat is not wide enough to go from door sill to door sill -- there is about a 3/4-inch gap on either side.  I would have liked it to reach or almost reach the door sills.  Also, the middle section of the rear mat is not wide enough to cover the entire hump in the middle.  That leaves the left and right floor portions of the mat starting on the bottom of the hump as it flattens towards the doors.  I would have liked at least two inches more in the middle section so the floor portions are centered in under the outside passengers' feet.
B000I1CCCA|5|Don't bother with plastic oil filter wrenches.  This is THE best to remove a Mercedes Filter cartridge.  I ruined two plastic ones and finally bought this out of frustration.  This will last a lifetime as will your Mercedes.
B00AOG1OQ4|5|Great product and easy installation!
B005HF2F24|5|Worked Great on the side of my truck!!!  Sticks really well!  Easy to apply with a little patience!!!  Even stands up to wash and wax!!
B000O3U2UQ|4|I have used this to test several batteries that I was having a problem charging.  I can charge a battery overnight and then use this load tester to see if it is taking a charge. If not, out it goes.
B00427MIFC|5|Fit perfect in my 2002 Audi A4 Quattro 1.8L Thank You..
B000RFUF12|4|Prior to purchasing this product, we had to jury rig a hose/funnel combination to fill up our RV batteries.  This allows us to keep from overfilling without resulting to contortions.
B000C75NYE|5|Great quality product. Fits Mazda MPV 92 just perfectly. I was surprised to find a brand new Master Cylinder, which is sold for the such a low price, comparing to what some stores charge for refurbished items. Raybestos quality is great, at least for their products I've used so far
B00850IS88|5|Really worked well, thank you
B001D27W32|2|Seems fine.  But the &#34;doe's it fit my vehicle&#34; feature is totally whack.  My cabin air doesn't blow as much air as I'd like so I looked up my 4runner and it said this would fit my vehicle.  Turns out my 4runner doesn't even have a cabin air filter.  So I wasted my $$$ on this.
B00DCULNXS|5|I install a pair of this load resistors for my rear turn signal since I put a pair of LED lights.<br />you don't get instructions, but you can look it up on youtube, and its not complicated, the black cable is always the ground, and the red, brown, or colored cable will be the positive. They work great no more hyper flashing and im ready to rock my turn signal lights.
B000S2SKIY|1|It fits the vehicle it was ordered for.You do need 5/8 hose and clamps.It is cheaper than auto supplies in Canada. 1/2 price with usps.It worked for 2 weeks then quit working.They will not take the part back.It is a poor quality part.
B002TTSDGI|5|Great parts no issues can't see more.
B007GCDM46|5|This Item is the perfect replacement, thanks.
B000CII5W0|5|Whistle is there some ppl may like it some may not but I did,, power wise didn't feel much of a difference but the response when I step on it was there so much better than before,, 99 f150 4.2l
B003E28RME|5|OK
B001IF3XR8|4|I have a 2014 Escalade Premium Sport (which changes the trim a little), but these fit do much better than the old in-channel I had on my 2007, it's night and day. So much sleeker and I'm not worried that I can't roll down my back windows and drive down the road, and have one come detached. That said, I did have to get out my Dremel and adjust a spot on the rear passenger window to get it to lay correctly. Super easy fix. Just a heads up to check your fit first!!
B00FLH4MJC|1|The magnetic is so weak, never worked in snow with wind, usually snow always coming with wind, the cover always blew away by the wind, the cover almost never does its job
B002PQOBCA|5|Identical factory replacement at less than a quarter of the price. The only tool you'll need is a 3&#34; long 9/32 box end wrench. I changed one side, stop to drink a beer, did the other side and was done in a total of 25 minutes.  I would recommend putting a little WD40 on the screws before replacing them. This is a great deal and a piece of cake to do yourself and save considerable cash. You won't be disappointed.
B0013J9EFY|4|Anyone considering this brand of bulb is making a good decision. However, there is one major, drawback to these headlights: you must check to see if they are legal in your municipality. The bulbs themselves are excellent, with a bright-yellow light output that lights up the road - especially reflectors and road signs. Very safe when shining on white surfaces like road lines and road reflectors. Gets you SEEN by other drivers, however, this is not always a good thing. Aesthetically, I liked the way they contrasted at night against my pearl black paintjob, and in the rain and snow it was easier to see road details. But I found out that in Washington state, any non-white / HID-style bulbs  headlights are illegal for use in a motor vehicle. So, I am regrettably forced to revert back to the boring stock-white color. I got a \\"fix-it\\" ticket recently from my local police department for having these headlights in my 2005 Corolla XRS. That basically means that I have to remove the yellow bulbs and return to white light bulbs. I did notice there was a bit of break-in time for your eyes, adjusting to the yellow light, since it will be a dramatic departure from white bulbs. You'll most likely also get commentary from keen-eyed passengers.<br /><br />If this cautionary tale doesn't bother you, I'd say purchase these bulbs, and I wish you a bit of good luck in driving with them. It's only a matter of time until that one tightwad officer pulls you over for something so trivial. Maybe I'll see if I can find these for my high beams, because they are amazing bulbs for the money.
B0061F2K1U|5|Looks badass and very happy with the brightness! Fits perfectly in the stock socket holder very nice and would buy them again!
B0018YGMC2|1|After having these shocks for a few weeks the seals blew out. Knowing that Rancho shocks were made in the US I expected the customer service to be much better. I contacted Rancho customer service and I was assured that replacement shocks would be sent out due to the bad ones I received. That was 5 months ago and I have not received any replacements and the rep that was supposed to be dealing with my issues retired so now I am back at square one. I keep getting excuses that they are out of stock but that makes no sense for this product and such a long time. I had to buy stock shocks to put back on my truck because it was undrivable with the bad Rancho shocks so now I am out the cost of the Ranchos plus the OEM ones.
B004IA45B8|5|Very pleased with this relay/solenoid, exact same physical layout and pinout of my original (2002 F350 SD). Takes all of 10 minutes to replace, just make sure you have deep well sockets because Ford used long mounting studs for it.  Will buy again if I need another one.
B00AZPP0Y6|4|Installed the light and then went to wash up the Rhino and with just a simple water hose with no added pressure, water got inside the housing some how. Other than that, everything lights up bright for something so small! For $40 I'd buy another one!
B00170J0YE|5|just what I wanted
B0007VEHLU|5|The hitch itself is just fine, no complaints at all.  Everything was perfectly aligned, and FedEx didn't mangle the packaging too bad.  I expected something more than 60 pounds of steel in a box.  Some padding would have made me feel better, but it survived just fine.<br /><br />Mounting was a huge PITA.  The threaded holes in the frame were pretty grungy.  Compressed air, solvent, a wire brush, and a tap solved that.  Pretty simple from that point forward...
B00L2G43Q8|5|Fit my 2009 Buick Enclave perfectly. I wanted one that were not stock, as the stock ones only lasted 6 years. These seem great. Simple clip to remove old ones, new ones snap into pace. Really simple. I cycled the hatch several time to verify function. I then left the hatch open for at least an hour to see if it would stay, or someday bonk me on the head (again). The hatch stayed open the whole time. It has been a month and they still work fine. This replacement is so easy that you would be a fool to pay the dealership hundreds of dollars to do this. If you can change wiper blades, you can change this cylinder.
B002XL2HVO|5|Perfect size for our camping trailer drawer!
B000GU07KW|5|its a fender. and it fits my bike. that's 100% of what I wanted.
B00480J4KA|5|The dealer tried to charge me $237 for one headlight bulb ; this model exactly fits my car and is the exact same one that was replaced.  Thank you Phillips! thoroughly impressed; economical, I bought two so that my headlights could be replaced simutaneously on my 2008 Nissan Altima
B00LBBDWY8|1|Did not like the way the product sticks. The rubber separates from the adhesive.
B001AZT70S|1|\\"One free from prejudice or narrow thought.\\"...unless your political views are different in which case negative stereotypes and bigotry are perfectly acceptable.  The ends justify the means right?  Hooray diversity unless it's diversity of thought.  This product is an embarrassment for anyone truly open minded.
B00GI77E2Q|1|These bulbs are very dim compared to the standard bulbs and they say they are CAN bus so you won't get rapid flash but you still get rapid flash. They do look nice in a clear housing but the dimness is bordering on unsafe. Very disappointed.
B000UT9UJI|3|I bought mine at Costco as well a couple years ago.  It worked fine for a while and then started blowing the fuse in my truck.  I put it in my wife's car and it blue the fuse in her car as well.  The fuse in the unit was fine.  I think I might try returning it to Costco.<br /><br />I was never able to get the USB to power anything either.
B001EOV45G|5|Good looking and works as it supposed to. Seem like good quality soft rubber make it easy to go on the hitch and to cover the tube receiver.
B008XB9BJY|5|I agree with many of the positive ratings on these lights.  I have replace all my 5th wheel lights with these so that we will use little battery power when dry camping.  To be fair, I won't totally test these until next summer when we are out, but they work fine, are the right brightness and fit all sockets perfectly.
B0093LYB20|1|These mirrors worked and looked great for four months.  Then they both fell off my truck within a week of each other.  I cleaned the mirrors very thoroughly before applying them.  The way they stick to the mirror is with a foam pad, with adhesive on the back.  The adhesive stayed stuck to the car mirror, but not to the foam.<br /><br />Because the mirrors are glass, they both broke when they fell off.  Don't waste your money.
B00DSD65ZU|1|Cheap product . Very small and the quality is a lame ! Waste of money
B008L4XW9I|5|These rotors are great. They fit like OEM and I stop on a dime. I would definitely purchase these again.  **UPDATE 9/15/15** Over 2 years later and these are still working well. However they are not coated so the hub area has turned to a light rust color.
B004XONTD4|5|Well made, in America. 2000 track miles and 15000 street miles in my 170hp 4age powered AW11. Going strong.<br /><br />I recommend sealant between the retaining nut and housing for minimized bypass leakage.
B003EP52I8|5|it work like i want it too and it was a great price for the product and would buy it a again
B00K3978A8|5|This is a good product and it works very well!
B00342B4II|5|I hooked this up to my 2011 Camaro SS and what a difference. Only problem was the whole for the mass air sensor didn't line up. Fixed it in 20 seconds and on it went. Very easy to install and works great. When the hood is open, you can feel it sucking in the air.
B004W4OQBE|4|took about 3 hours standing in front of O'Reilly's to get these installed but once installed they look fantastic. Would be a 5 star review if not for the complicated install procedure.
B000C8R9PO|5|Great product.  Great build quality.  Fit perfectly without modification.<br />Great seal when tightening down the pan.  Great gasket.<br />No issues after over 1K miles.<br />Highly recommended.
B00D7LETMY|5|the wipers work like new, and better than expected.  I think they're a great buy and they arrived quickly.  Installation was easy and it's much cheaper to buy just these blade inserts than new wipers.
B001CF3S60|1|Very cheap,zipper pull tab broke first time I used it.Did not fit very well and poor quality.Do not buy this item.
B009FNX492|3|I bought these for my 2010 Ram 1500 and just installed them today.  I wasn't looking for anything too fancy, just wanted something so my 4 and 5 year old kids could get in and out of the truck easier.  It took me about an hour and a half to install but for the first 45 minutes or so I was also watching the kids outside and had to deal with a bike wreck among other things.  I could easily see getting both sides fully installed in less than an hour without other distractions.  I also did it all very easily without a helper as suggested by the install instructions.<br /><br />Pros:  Easy to install and great fit with existing mounting holes.  Absolutely no modifications needed.  Mounting brackets stamped with location to aid in install.  Look good on the truck when all is said and done.<br /><br />Cons:  Very easy to scratch the paint.  Description said they were powder coated but it sure doesn't seem like it.  I was very careful during installation and still scratched both sides.  They still look fine, but it leads me to question how well they will stand up to normal wear and tear, rocks, etc.  Metal is pretty lightweight.  Again, they seem pretty sturdy when fully installed but not sure how they will do over the life of the truck.  For the price point if I can get a few good years use out of them I will consider it a good deal.  Only other complaint was with the marking of the bars themselves.  They were color coded on the packaging and also had stickers to identify which side each bar went to.  Problem was they were backwards - driver side marked passenger and vice versa.  That cost me probably 10 minutes trying to figure out why the fit was so bad before I unpacked the other bar and discovered it fit perfectly.<br /><br />At the end of the day I do think this was still a good buy for the money.  Would have given 4 stars if the paint didn't scratch so easily.  If you are someone super concerned about a few scratches I would step up to a stainless set.  If you are like me and just looking for a set of step bars that perform their function well, these should do the trick.
B003K5S4NW|3|I used it once... and I'm not sure if it is me or the tool.  Yes.. the angled head makes it possible to better clean my sloped front windshield interior. The cloth may not be the best choice... or I may no be using a good window cleaning fluid.  I'll keep trying... I hope it improves.
B004QU6R6G|5|If you need traction, you will get it with these chains. My drive is 12% grade my ATV does great until we get ice with several inches of snow on top. Then its chain up time. If you price your concrete drive don't spin your wheels when you push snow into a frozen pile, just stop pushing are you will see what traction is when the snow is gone. Also they have a great Service Dept. they don't get much better.
B00HNKT7ZY|5|Fit well,looked very nice.<br />Fast shipping.
B00G1Y3QCI|5|Excellent motorcycle levers.  A huge improvement in the OEM levers in looks AND performance.  They feel better and more responsive over stock levers.  The build quality of these levers is excellent.  I've installed them on 3 bikes so far.  Perfect performance on all three.
B004CGOGFS|5|Purchase this tool. Works great,. dont wast your time pounding and pulling your rotors. Heavy duty tool easy to use
B000C5BN2W|5|My application is a 1996 F350 7.5L<br />You should one of these numbers stamped into the sensor body.<br />F48F-9F472-BB<br />F48F-9F472-BC<br />F48F-9F472-BD<br />F88F-9F472-BA<br />F88Z-9F472-BA<br /><br />It would be useful if these were included in the product description.
B00J994K90|5|I wish I'd had something like this years ago. I use it all the time to see how much juice things are getting. My Nexus 7&#34; tablet for instance draws power at .85A, much less than I expected, but my Galaxy S5 phone will draw about 1.25A. A wireless charger I bought was only drawing .55A so now I have quantitative data to explain why I'm sending it back. I may pick up a few of these so I can leave one in the car and have a few around the house.
B001P1MQ50|5|A perfect fit. Now if only bad drivers would stop smashing into my front bumper when they pull into nearby parking spots...
B009UZ1AZK|5|Ordered here to simplify the process, and it is the same hat I would have bought at the dealership (in fact the guys working at the dealership wear the same hats).  Good price, good product.  I recommend.
B000OWBSBY|5|I WILL ORDER AGAIN , VERY GOOD DEALER
B003NTPE9W|5|This product was applied to the interior of the frame of my 2009 GMC Sierra.<br />This stuff seems to really penetrate deeply into whatever it hits.<br />It came with about a 24 inch extension spray tube with a special brass tip.  The tip pattern disburses the stuff everywhere.<br /><br />The application was not too bad.<br /><br />Only time will tell if if does its job.
B004AFGKLE|5|Used this line when converting from a engine cooling fan too electrical cooling fan had to replace the fan shroud and the original oil cooler lines would not fit so instead of cutting the original lines and using rubber hose i looked at the 20829009 oil cooler line and looked to be what i needed . Received the oil cooler hose assembly promptly and it was to the shape of what i was needing installed and worked perfectly oem fit and finish and came with o'rings and attachment hardware.
B0096R072Y|5|A+
B000CNHFNA|5|Works well so far, GREAT price !
B0045LXI0Y|5|Very simple and easy to install.  Took all of 1 minute.  Would recommend it.  Comes with extra wiring if you need it.
B0054KSFI0|5|Bought as a gift for my son. He loved the bars. Cost fraction of the price of Yakima. $30 vs $ 230! Cannot carry same weight, however, but very light. Easy to install on Jeep Liberty.
B000M61KTC|1|I used these spring compressors on a few vehicles and I can only find one redeeming quality.  The hooks themselves are very low profile which works well for grabbing onto the upper most coil, especially on progressively wound springs with many coils near the upper or lower perch.  Other then that they are junk.  The big problem I had recently was that to make these cheap they made the shaft out of a threaded rod and spun a nut onto it, drilled through the nut and staked it with a pin.  That pin takes all the force when turning the shaft to compress the spring.  While doing struts on an outback this weekend that pin sheared off on me.......leaving the spring stuck compressed.  I had to go find a neighbors car to borrow and head around to auto parts stores to find a loaner set of compressors.    Next time I will spend more money to get a properly manufactured compressor which uses one forged steel rod instead of the cheap nut with a pin construction.    For rare to occasional use these are ok........but if you're not using them regularly why not just get a loaner compressor for free from an autoparts store?
B000A8OVHU|5|You can use an NGK Iridium plug or you can use these NGK copper plugs. I'd stick with what the car came with, so I went with these NGK copper plugs. They don't run as hot, so if you have a car designed for copper plugs, just don't use platinum, mmkay????? The NGK copper plugs work great in my 99 Subaru Impreza and my 2002 Honda Accord. Last time I put iridium NGK's in the Accord. They're only half-worn-out so I saved them to use later, since I had already bought these copper ones for the tune-up. Both worked fine.
B00QR8HI2W|4|The console is a little tough to work with this cover on it, but, it's keeping the dogs from ruining the console.  And that was the whole purpose.
B000ZZUSBG|3|I was hoping I'd be able to leave my XTerra in the driveway & free up a lot of space in the garage.  I should have foreseen that since the XTerra is a large vehicle it would take a LARGE cover.  The cover works great for keeping out the rain and bird droppings, but takes a long time to fling over the car & arrange properly (plus then you get whatever dirt is on the cover all over yourself).  If you are storing the car for at least a week at a time this cover should work out fine.
B0089DY4Q6|4|As described worked as good as the other one
B005ASY23I|5|Its the first time I owned one of these compressors. Works so much better than those crappy gas station rigs.
B000T28GBO|4|IT WORKED
B009AAJJ3A|5|It was a great product. Fit perfectly in my car. Was sent out quickly. It arrived 3 days later. I was so surprised.
B005345DBY|4|With a set of tactical googles your face is balked out, it is very easy to breath threw the thin flexible material
B00COOT7HM|5|Exactly what i wanted and with fast shipping
B000E7YP82|1|Flew off my car terrible product!!  Stick with a thule, pricier but you will not have to worry about it flying off on. Freeway and killing someone.
B009LMN7WG|5|Installed on my Duramax lb7, great I like it
B0058ORI3K|5|They came cut perfectly and was so easy to install.
B00CSWEJZU|5|I had the opportunity to use the Microfiber Drying Towel today and I loved it!! I really did not expect such good results. I need something to dry off my windshield in the morning since I drive into the sun every day. Regular towels just do not do the trick.  This towel dried the windshield with no streaks. Thank you for selling such a great product!
B0073J970U|4|Worked great, a wiring diagram would have been nice!  Look it over carefully.  Had to flip it around opposite the way the old one was installed.
B00GGGWRO4|5|I got one more than I wanted but they peel off good and stick good too.
B000CBXIDS|4|The first one I received was slightly warped and would not fit. Contacted the seller and after sending some pictures of it they sent a new one out before before I received any of the other things I ordered from Amazon. They were on the ball and that's 5 stars. The only reason for the 4 stars is because the low profile doesn't really block anything, but I'm still pleased overall.
B00030DLEE|5|We bought two of these, and we are so glad we did. Two different food items to cook at one time.  The 2 lb loaf pan are just right for this product
B00AAMHA9W|2|Not as bright as they make out to be !
B000C1OWXS|5|These are excellent pads! The installation was simple (assuming that you are mechanically inclined) and they stop my Trailblazer smoothly.
B006C0P8LS|5|Quality product, fast shipping would recommend to others
B006TILZ56|2|The product has no defects. It is very light, and i regret buying it. It is just another piece of nice cloth in the house, It serves no purpose to me. I wish i could return it. Let me know if you need it, i'll send it to you, just pay shipping cost. Ive not worn it..haha
B005NLQAHS|5|Great product! I'm a mechanic with decades of experience. Son is also mechanic. Looked for replacement for old simple scanner and found this. I agree with other raters. Get this one only. Paired with App \\"Torque Pro\\" is an awesome tool! This thing will tell you all you'd ever need to know about all the sensors and codes. But it also gives you a wide range of other useful info. It has a real time mode to allow collecting data during a race or everyday driving. Sometimes that is critical for trouble shooting. It will also add speed, acceleration, etc. data to your video. (For those of you who make videos of your runs with a dash cam.) Also reports GPS data. Hook this thing up before your kids take your car out for the evening. You'll be able to tell if they unplugged it and it will tell you where they went and how fast they got there. The cost is low even when you add the app at $5. I have a friend who goes to car auctions all the time. He now uses it to screen cars quick and easy. The company I purchased it from was quick and responsive. Thanks.
B0018EO60C|3|Nice add on.
B00AZOIBNO|5|Gave it to a friend of mine that has alpacas. Love love love the sticker exactly what I wanted thank you
B00029JFH8|5|Just what I needed. Holley OEM part.
B000EDSSKW|5|These are really nice and catch a lot of stuff off shoes that would be in my fifth wheel.
B004K6NKNY|5|If wired properly this freaking thing worksssssss. Great . I read a bad review on it I can see why the person had a hard time you need to actually take your time especially if the port in your Car is not numbered  . So please make sure you check twice before crimping on the wires .
B00684TAYY|5|Look great. Work great.  Just like OEM from what I se.  Programmed on first try using the inclosed instructions.  Worth $7.99 shipped.  Buy it if you need it!
B003848C4G|5|Install it yourself...  paid an indy shop to do it and as simple and straight forward as it is, they messed it up and I ended up completely taking the frontend apart myself and fixing it.
B006V7TBBA|5|Ordered these for my husband.  He wanted them for his Jeep Wranger.  Easy install!  They work great!
B001B3UUB4|5|Fit right
B001GH5PDI|5|put on my 2002 Toyota Tacoma trd for a temp tift  until I could got my eibach/bilstein lift. got about 1.25 inches out of the lift
B007P2F786|1|TOO CHEAPLY MADE I WISHED I HAD SPENT MORE FOR A BETTER QUALITY.
B003Z6B4O2|4|I thought it would have been heavier but I love it.
B000Q754E4|4|This cooler keeps things 30 degrees cooler than the outside temperature which at 80 degrees is 50 degrees not bad for a 12 volt cooler. I got the AC adapter and use it at home as well. Save a lot of money on the road by passing up the fastfood places and pulling an ice cold soda out of my cooler to have with a nice homemade sandwich and potato salad. Keeps the kids happy longer too.
B004RNOVTM|5|This is a great hose!  I have four 10-footers and one 25-footer and the work well and last a long time.
B004TC1M5C|5|Works like a dream. Haven't had any problems installing it.
B003T3273S|5|Dealers wanted $120-140 for this item.  At the Amazon price, I bought 2 and had them both programmed at a dealer at once to save on the half hour service charge. Works fine after 2 months.
B00S4OWN6S|5|These microfiber cleaning cloths are unusually plush and heavy, with close rows of tiny loops on both sides. The colors are lovely pastels, green, pink, yellow and blue. The edges are densely serged with matching thread. They measure about 14 in. square.<br /><br />In testing, they weigh approximately 50 g dry, 275 g soaked, and 125 g squeezed out. This means that they can absorb 225 g of water or over four times their weight total, and 150 g or three times their weight can be effectively absorbed and wrung out repeatedly under continuous use.<br /><br />That effective absorbency is very impressive and it demonstrates that all microfiber cleaning cloths are NOT alike in actual use. These are excellent cloths for use on electronics, windows, mirrors, automobiles, fine furniture etc. to remove dust and smudges, as well as for general cleaning.<br /><br />The fiber content is the typical 80% polyester and 20% polyamide (nylon). Microfiber should be machine washed in cold or warm water without bleach or fabric softener and hung to dry.<br /><br />Yepal provided cloths for evaluation and review.
B005GHB5U6|2|fogs up the glasses when riding,
B0002H3364|5|Very nice jack for the price. I bought one for each of my vehicles after struggling to use the piece of junk that came with my Ford.<br />It does the job much better and faster than the stock jack.
B002ZTK73O|4|Great quality, kinda expensive but worth it if you value your carpet.  You can transfer them to other vehicles if you don't get the custum versions.
B000XV4EI0|5|It has everything. This was a gift for my son who just bought his first car.  Feel safer knowing he has it
B000UNPVPG|5|I received the chains and was surprised that they looked so great.  In a nice case, with easy instructions to install.  These chains are top of the line.  Very well made.  When I purchase them I wanted chains that wouldn't ruin my shiny aluminum rims or break.  We tried them on our 2010 Town and Country before we got on the road.  They went on so easy, and had self adjusters.  They do not touch my rims at all.  They are GREAT!  Drove around the block to make sure we wouldn't have any problems.  We check the chains when we got home and they had self tightened around the tires.  Very low profile,  they fit the tires perfectly.  We'll we went to Tahoe and did not need them on the trip.  I sure was glade that we purchased the Thule brand.  If we would of needed them, we had chains that I felt comfortable with.  Piece of mind, I knew they would do the job and my family would be safe.  I will be using them soon.<br />Mark
B0083H3YX2|2|Look dimmer than OEM incandescent T-10. They get very hot fast. Lights are different color temperature (one is greenish and the other one is purple). One is also brighter than the other. I'm returning my order.
B00P30O1XO|5|Nice work perfectly in my car
B00XV4W686|5|Bright, work very well on VW Jetta 2.0 T FSI  (front turn signals) Not listed as CAN BUS friendly however work fine in 2008 VW Jetta Wolfsburg
B00O0SRA7E|2|The connector coming out of control box was no good.. The ground wire was not connecting.. So mine don't work
B005N53CBQ|4|I read all the reviews and product description, and went ahead with the purchase, even though I thought it proabably wouldn't work in my 2014 VW Jetta sedan. It's only $25, prime shipping, and I liked the look, so I figured it was worth a shot.<br /><br />It works fine! Not five star worthy, because obviously (photos attached), it isn't a super great fit. But for the price, it's totally fine for what I needed, which was a cover for my backseat so my dog wouldn't scratch and dirty up the leatherette.<br /><br />If you need one for a similar purpose, it will probably do.
B002EOVDII|1|Quit working after five charges dont waste your money!!  Very chinsey did not fit into the phone from the start!!
B0085OLNP4|5|Great gift
B000COVO6S|5|have ngk iridum plugs, these work perfect
B00BVB7XK2|1|This switch did not work with the rear windows.  After hooking them up, the windows rolled down automatically without me touching the control button.  They would not roll up at all.  I had to replace them with bad switches and hold the &#34;up&#34; on the master control and the rear window controls at the same time to get them back up.
B001IE8FQI|4|The quality could definitely be improved upon, but then again, it was at a very cheap price.<br /><br />We placed this above our back door (obviously facing out) not to cause any harm whatsoever, but because our relatively new neighbor's yard was absolutely a disaster in every way.  Can't say it was because of the Bagua mirror or not, but within a few weeks of placing it above our door, low and behold, she had an entire crew of landscape folks in, they did a lot of work, landscaped, etc., and the yard is a huge improvement compared to how it looked.
B00JLUDA84|1|Looks great. Wish the key came with it.
B00DM8NBV2|1|comes off easily
B00HDERBLC|1|this pile of crap didn't last 25 minutes before it quit working waste of time and money
B0066PI154|5|Great price, works awesome.  I'd buy it again in a heartbeat if it's something you plan to only use in your garage.
B0016HNQ9S|4|The part was the same as the original for much better price than the dealer.  The only trouble we had was that that gasket seemed to be thicker than the original so we had a hard time getting it installed in the tank.  The label said to be sure to replace the gasket so we made it work.
B00CMF2FEU|4|My nephew liked this t-shirt since he's a WRX enthusiast, but I did not care for the fabric being so thin.
B001KQ3JCO|5|Great Product.  it fit my truck to a  &#34;T&#34;.  after about 30 minutes of installation,  I  can  finally  open  the  door again!
B00ABXW3LK|5|Rotors are holding up well.  We'll see in 20k miles.
B00017YYI6|5|Works great! Easy to use and easy to install!
B000HZT89C|5|This model is convenient and very helpful.  I bought one for my daughter and her husband asked me for one also. . . Good quality, durable
B009X23B2U|4|Installed easily, looks OK, no issues.  You can kind of see it in the center-left of this picture.
B00466AJ6Y|5|love them they are perfect
B00OBQVDIC|5|Looks great
B000CIQLBM|5|If I had one bit of advise it would be to go purchase a quality installation tool set for this item.
B00A30W2OO|5|Just as described. Fast shipping.
B00CI934QS|4|The many loops and bends in the design make it hard to apply perfectly. mine got screwed up and i cant remove the decal and try again without destroying it :(
B00JIGZXMC|5|Very bright compared to incandescent!
B000FJS4MW|5|Excellent<br />Was the arrival of the consignment deadline<br />Experience of the product is fantastic
B000NJQXYK|4|I bought these boots shortly after I bought my bike. I was in need of some high-ancle and sturdy boots for, safety. Thes are great quality leather boots. They are sturdy, yet it's easy to shift gears and use the rear break with them. The two zippers allow for eassy slip on and off. I was able to walk comfortably with them.  This is a great buy!!  Edited on 2/3/2016: to fix typos and to add the following. Still a great buy! After some use, the leather became a bit more flexible. Allowing for a better walking experience (I'm not a boot kind of guy).
B007TG7HV8|5|The best wiper blades for the money. These work great and you never have to worry about missed spots or horrible screeches. These will be the brand and model I buy from now on for all my vehicles.
B000CN58R0|5|These worked amazingly well. Incredibly easy to install.
B0013REXO8|5|Makes my 2015 jeep look a little rugged. Easy to install and happy with the purchase.
B00AQ29ETK|5|Prompt shipment of the product at a great price.
B000C580QY|3|Incorrect Description - K90467 is the bellows for the REAR strut,  K90463 for the FRONT.  Please check the listing in the online MOOG catalog...
B00NQGCDC8|4|I don't have a basis for comparison, but this worked excellent.  I assured down each of my tires from 44 psi to 16 in about 20 seconds.  It was very easy to use.  The gauge is big and easy to read, and the materials were okay.  I was worried based on the other reviews, but I am not disappointed in the quality.  If you are borderline on one of these versus the valve stem screw ins, the screw ins are quicker if you have all four. (One for each tire.). I personally like more control with my rig.
B0002NIJ6M|5|great gag
B000TRQQYS|4|Bought to remove oil filter cover on a Mazda CX-7. Doesn't look like the picture, it's stamped steel. But, you shouldn't put enough torque on it to damage the socket anyway, I was just expecting a heavier wall..
B002P8QWOS|1|I ordered this and later found out that connecting plug is not same as that present in my car.<br />My car is Japan made and it has straight pin. This mirror has L shaped pins.<br />This seller should put atleast one message saying that it will not fit japnese model.<br />I called this caller twice on the number provided in Amazon website. On both the time I was not able to get to the operator for more than 15-20 min.
B004FKWUT0|5|The jacket is excellent for summer riding in hot climates like East Texas.  It is well made and provides a nice breeze, especially with just a t-shirt underneath.  I normally take a large but my experience with Italian clothing is that it is typically very tight when I order my normal size so I ordered an XL, which fit me perfectly and no binding under the arms.
B008FCE6KK|2|I trusted other people's reviews on this item. The vehicle I needed to install these on is an 08' GMC Acadia. One of these cross bars was about 6&#34; too long. Unfortunately I didn't have enough time to ship them back, as we were leaving on a trip the next day. I had to take the longer one apart, cut it down, drill 2 new holes in it, put it back together, and then install. If you don't have tools available, and aren't very savvy at modifying things, I wouldn't recommend buying these for an 08' GMC Acadia.
B00RCKN97W|4|Good quality but 4 stars because the back plates should have been longer.
B0049MKQD6|5|Pretty easy to install. Directions are clear. Lead wires twice as long would be nice though. I bought this to replace an older VERY similar unit that was sun bleached and started to fall apart. I don't believe the older unit was UV protected. I'm hoping this one lasts more than 2 years.
B000FPYHOU|1|I don't like this clock at all. The buttons to set the time stick out so much that they are constantly being hit and changing the time. Horrible design. Don't recommend.
B00BVEI8ZS|5|Great decal i love it, 5 stars all around.
B0015PK3AG|5|Worked much better than my large vice grips (!) and it's sturdy, well made and not unattractive.
B00842A7F4|4|Product fit very well on my Honda Civic, they break very easily, plastic too hard. Have to be very carefull when you take them off the car.
B00DTLQ5EC|5|Perfect fit.
B000E24APU|1|it was not what I expected to many steps not enough material. you could possibley do more damage than not
B0097CDQH6|2|Plastic on housing is far to brittle, resulting in cracking around the edges after a short time.
B005JCS1ZU|5|Works great
B00CS9G3YS|5|I think this product is really great and I haven't had any problems with it since I ordered it, I would recommend this product to others.
B004ZF3YD6|5|Excellent and it seems to be built with quality especially compared to eBay or other knock offs.
B00F5MUB66|5|Love this in RV. Installation was a breeze. Water pressure is great. Love the extended and angled head.  True it has small trickle when the shut off switch is used, but not enough to be concerned with. Do I wish it did not have this leak, absolutely, but the many pros outweigh the one con.
B00O83LZ9A|5|Very sharp looking, fit perfectly and took about 10 minutes to install. Lights feel very sturdy and well built and defiantly worth the investment.
B00757KJTI|5|Nice sporty look.  I don't use my radio often as I have Sirius Satellite radio, but I tested the sound and it seems to work well. I chose this antenna for the look and ability to go through car wash without the worry of my antenna breaking. Very easy install.
B00PYZKT70|5|Sturdy, attractive, and a great price
B000CITK8S|5|I bought 3 of them.  We have an RV and two collector cars.  It's nice to know that you can go out any time and find the battery fully charged.  More extended life for the battery too, because it is not going through repeated charging cycles which reduce the life of the battery.
B004HQRC1I|5|Did just what I needed!  Programmed it myself in a few minutes and worked perfectly.  Hope I never lose one again...
B003IS3HV0|5|I've tried several leather conditioning products (my closet is full of old bottles) and they never really provided what I would call satisfying results.<br />I tried Leather Honey and I'm so pleased with how well it does in bringing suppleness and brightness back to my leather goods.  I use it now on all my leather products (shoes, bags, furniture, etc). I'm so happy that after years of stumbling around with other products that were hit or miss, I've finally found one that hits every time.<br />Highly recommended.
B000FCH1Y6|4|Does the job, don't know why the price is what it is, however it fits just fine...if you had the patience, you could go to a local auto shop buy a huge one and trace it to your windshield...
B005OVJ9XE|5|Looks the same as GM original. Does not come with the foam surround, but the original can be reused. No leaks.
B000JQQQKS|1|Well after using Amazon for YEARS I am finally caving and going to write a review.  I am only writing this to completely vent how pissed off I was when I started using these bungee cords and I am still pissed two months later after using them.  I purchased them to simply attach a tarp to a camper. I was quickly let down though, they are very thin and they do not stay attached to the hook. The crimped on little piece of metal looks like the quality of what a child would do in a kindergarten class.  On every single one of the cords came apart from the hooks and resulted in me just tying the cord to the hook which worked but essentially shortened the length.  I would be embarrassed and sick to my stomach if I worked at this plant that produced this awful product.  I would not recommend them to a friend. The only use I could recommend for these would be to use them as props in a play or theatre where they would not have ANY practical use at all.
B001FE3Z4I|5|Exactly what I needed, great quality and great pricing. The package shipped reasonable fast as well. Thank you very much for a reliable service!
B003DUJ9V0|5|Fit perfectly, looks great!
B000CIR3UA|5|Great Sound but not over the top of being loud.<br />installed on 300 cubic inch Ford with Eldebrock<br />4 barrel (360) intake (Holley 390) carburetion and Headman headers<br />Lots of air going through these babies.<br />Sounds great! mounted near headers then added tail pipes, all 2 inch diameter.
B000EJ4WME|5|i have performance friction brake on 3 vehicles .one has same pads for 6 years with 70 thousands miles and more miles to go.have ordered in mail pads for my nissan xterra.great pads that will not fad out.i hope amazon continue to sell performance friction products.
B000ONZTS6|5|Pretty decent quality, have to say I am happy with these. Good fit, I have the oem of these and they are hard to tell the difference.
B005DX6BKW|5|These lights are well made and they look like they were OEM.  The installation was relatively simple.  You do not need to worry about disabling the Auto Light On feature as the instructions recommended.  Depending on whether your car was preset to run a DRL, you may see that the LED lights will be dimmed when the headlights are on; otherwise, they will stay on bright when you turn on the headlights. As one of the previous reviewers did, I left mine on bright and did not want to spend $300 for the dealer to make them dim when the headlights come on.  Make sure that you are satisfied with the location of the light frames before you click the lights into place.  Otherwise, you may have to use a jackhammer to remove those light again from the frames.  For my installation, I used 3M double sided tape all along the lights and did not bother with screwing in the frame to the body of the car.  I hope these lights last.  I previously purchased two LED lights, and I was disappointed with their performances; I hope these are the last ones. I like them so much I purchased two sets just in case these burn out prematurely.  I will strongly recommend these lights to anyone looking for an aftermarket LED that is not blueish and is well made.
B00JWG08QY|3|Good
B00ECHQIDK|3|Doesn't fit all the way down on the handle bars, but it does tell time and looks pretty sweet. Awesome for the price though, a harley davidson clock is 5 times the price. Easy to install
B00BUZDHYA|5|Great LEDs, Bright green color (not like a spring green, the green is exactly as reflected by the plastic wedge part.
B00JG3OIFU|2|Used it once and was so impressed I forgot I had it.
B00CG5RYEW|5|They obviously didn't say f it when they made these stickers lol!  Great quality and look awesome!
B001AWLTX4|5|This item came quickly and is exactly as described in product overview. Great for windy winters, and blizzard snow. If you tuck it in your shirt, while you breath the heat goes down your short and keeps you warm, snug, soft, and comfortable. Best winter item I have ever spent money on.
B008VC8NNA|5|Great guards, easy to install.  Got the items very quickly and had them on in a little under an hour.
B00K1C1WC2|5|What's not to love? I mean, it's a wheel chock.
B001HZQW0Y|5|This wrench set is perfect for what I needed. I have a pneumatic sander and I needed to change the pad on it and I couldn't find a wrench that would fit until I tried these wrenches, they worked perfectly.
B002XEP57E|2|First of all I was really undecided about one or two stars.  I finally decided to be generous and give it two, based on appearance.  It matched the original perfectly and there was no telling the difference.  It also fit perfectly with all holes matching up.  The problem is that it must be made from weaker materials, which results in vibration, and lots of it.  When I first started the truck and it sat idling, the mirror was vibrating.  Not a lot, but still it was vibrating.  I got out and wiggled it and felt some slop, then I went over and wiggled the passenger's side, which still had the factory mirror.  It was rock solid.  Once I got moving it got worse.  Obviously it's going to depend on the type of road you travel.  I wouldn't even consider this mirror if I was driving on gravel roads.  When getting up to highway speeds it was vibrating due to the air hitting it.  Don't get me wrong, you can still see good and drive safely using it, but it can drive you bonkers.  I don't drive my truck much anymore and when I do it's on short hops with good roads.  If it were anything else I would have returned it and went and picked up a used one at a junk yard.  I suggest to anyone considering this mirror to do just that and go find a cheap factory mirror at a junk yard.
B00AUKDFIY|3|From looking at the photo I had anticipated this would be a thicker mat.  It's really thin (flat really) so it's good for decorative purposes but that's about it.  Doesn't seem sturdy enough to last very long.
B00008RW9U|1|I bought this for my black 2010 gt mustang and it scratched the hell out of my paint do not buy if you plan to use on black vehicles
B00GU0OIBG|5|:)
B0041CC7IQ|5|They work great.  Nice to communicate when we are riding.  The charge will last on our all day rides.. Love it
B007PLZ5RA|5|Good stuff. Still sticking after over two years.
B009XL0KKW|5|Thank you
B00JH6KUTY|5|Awesome installed in my fog lights and they look amazing will be doing my headlights very soon.
B00CBZ3D1K|5|Better than I imagined!  Looks great on my Suburban!<br /><br />Will need to find more items to advertise my favorite dog breed.
B000FPX5M0|5|This product blew me away; Prior to installing, when I throttle the car (a 2010 Dodge Challenger SRT8) it would hesitate then pickup and go. After installing the CAI, there is no more hesitation. The throttle response is amazing. Not to mention that I noticed an increase of about a 1 gallon per mile improvement in efficiency.<br /><br />This is certainly the best $200.00 bucks I have ever spent.<br /><br />PS<br />Very easy to install; A novice can do it in an hour.
B0023UR6O8|1|Hardly any smell comes out and it drains your battery, it stays on if you don't unplug it when you leave your vehicle.  If you are looking for a red light, then buy it lol.
B00JL6MWIW|5|These were exactly what I wanted. There are beautiful on my truck and my wife a can get in a lot easier.<br />They look factory installed
B00EI6CKVE|5|When I first saw this sticker on a passing car, I just had to have one! Stickerciti had the one that I wanted. And the price was right. As it turns out, they are a local business so delivery was real fast!!!!!
B00296KGAC|4|Took a few coats but I liked it......
B00480N0GE|5|Works just like the original did, no issues just remember not to touch the glass with  with your hands, ok.
B0047DEVRE|5|Should have converted sooner! May actually ride better now......
B007XZJTCK|5|Looks great/works like factory. Not an easy install without any instructions. I had to watch a few installs on you tube.
B004RZS6LY|5|love it
B003TPQYPI|5|I liked that this separates the grit from the water.I used two bucket method and this really helped.
B0013OFIY0|4|I arrive on time, and quality, hope it's good.
B00CYNTPK2|3|Nice Trailer, Though tolerances are a little too tight. With a Little effort this comes together as a very nice trailer for your bike. Some straps missing on bag, but otherwise very nice. Contacted distributer for adapters to non-Quick release Trailer Mounts and could not be given a date as to if the would ever receive them. Maybe should've paid for the Bob Trailer as they might be more prepared in customer relations/repair/replacement issues.
B0069ZQYF0|4|liked it very much have had several people ask about it - wished i'd gotten a bit bigger size - fast service very nice
B004LFAEBK|5|I am in the automotive industry. I use this in the shop.  I also use it at home and have a couple in my truck.
B0000CBIK5|5|I had my old pump for 30 years. I did not know I could replace the flexible stem. I was concerned that this would be flimsy.  It appears to be the same. I can use it w/ ease! I recommend this to anyone needing to fill bike tires or sports balls.
B00HKE622E|5|I have a F350, and this work really fine.. i think it worth the money.. very nice product for sure..
B000F5DQWY|1|This horn worked really well for nine months then it stopped. I don't think that it is suitable for use on a motorcycle it is simply not robust enough.
B007TG7HXG|3|These work well enough. I've had them for threem months and they are starting to get a little streaky, especially on the bottom. I've had better...I've had worse. For the price point not bas
B0007M30BC|5|Perfect for trailing my 18ft boat.
B000GV1KIY|1|I had this installed by a professional shop, they said that they have ran into this problem before that it was not going to be long enough to clear my windshield and they were right. They had to do a lot of extra work to make it fit. I looked up online and seems this is a universal problem most people saying they have to make there own. So I would not recommend this extender.
B00K7H1HSA|5|Three of the four installed perfectly. One of the spacers spun a wheel lug when I torqued it up. I used a properly calibrated torque wrench, and followed the instructions. I took my time and did not use the gorilla technique. I hope the manufacturer will honor their lifetime warranty statement. If so, then I will be happy to upgrade my rating. If not, then I will be just as happy to downgrade the rating.<br /><br />UPDATE! I contacted ATV Engineering and Karl replied within a couple of hours and stated that he will send a replacement ring today! Rare and great customer service. Very much appreciated!
B008KKNTPA|5|Great product quite and stoping power fast shipping to
B000WK6QME|5|c  c
B001DDI3E8|5|I bought two. Helps when I back in the garage or running trails.
B00DTEESTI|5|Fits a PM Racks left side solo bag mount that is mounted on a 2015 triumph scrambler. Bag is very durable feeling and should last a long time.
B003SWNVI0|5|This vinyl cartop carrier did an awesome job of keeping a huge load of luggage and Christmas gifts DRY and TOGETHER from South Carolina to Texas during a sloppy snowstorm, with lots of snow accumulation accumulation on it. Then on the way back, the heavy rain did not affect anything, either - \\"snug and dry\\" should be their motto. (Our only generic complaint was that using a cartop carrier caused a big drop in auto mileage (almost 6 mpg). We know that the wind and the extra weight being hauled (2 families' & all their stuff) contributed a lot, too.) We HIGHLY recommend this product.  (re: Highland 1038900 Black 15 cu.ft. Rainproof Car Top Bag, purchased on 12/17/2010)
B0086ZNB4S|1|Piece of junk! Fist clip broke when I was trying to open it before mounting on a seat belt. The second one stop holding in a couple of weeks. Stay away from this product. If I could, I would give no stars at all.
B000BFR6TM|5|Easy installation and looks good.
B00332GN8K|5|After purchasing and installing the Wade in channel wind and rain deflectors I am very happy with the looks and the way they work. They were very easy to install (just minutes) and fit my truck perfectly. I would recommend this product to anybody who is looking for function and style when it comes to deflectors.
B004EIAADG|5|So far, I really like this unit.  Knowing the % charge level is great and I can monitor how much power I'm using.  I've only used it once for a weekend camping trip and it passed with flying colors.  Charged 2 cell phones and inflated 2 beds.  Plenty of charge left when I got home (76%).  Not bad!!!
B000CMFS3U|1|passenger side fits well,but driver side mat is to wide.the material is not as durable as they make it out to be. My advice is to spend the extra money and get the weather tech or something with better quality.
B00CYL8D2U|3|Doesn't include a fuse like shown in the picture, just the wires and car plug-in.
B001PB3IFM|5|They fit perfectly in my 2012 Ford Escape (Limited) & will protect my carpet for many, many years to come. Love them, how easy they are to clean & vacuum
B003CJVWV2|5|Easy to attach to helmet. Seems durable and my kids like the colors. Only thing is that detaching side is on left so if you put it on other side its upside down.
B004GSPEKI|4|You get what you pay for. The odor is a bit strong when your car is in the hot sun but other than that this is a great deal and good buy.
B0002NIMGE|5|Wow! fit a camaro steering wheel.
B000IYNU32|3|The radiator fit the car correctly but the New OEM Radiator cap would not seal correctly in the neck, preventing pressure to build.  The radiator cap had to be modified widining the o-ring at the bottom of the cap.
B0000AY65X|5|Seems to go on easily and buff to a durable hight shine..
B004IV58AY|5|Used it a few times already to assist with my 2008 Chevy Cobalt and my Father's Ford Five hundred. Very basic tool but you get the error code and research the code online.<br /><br />For me its been a very cost effective device versus purchasing a higher end reader.<br /><br />Example of my car was it read a Fault Error of P0128. Looked it up and mentioned this is in regards to the Coolant Thermostat. Checked the thermostat and sure enough it popped a rubber seal inside the thermostat. Replaced and good to go now.
B00533Y6C2|5|This is great jacket. It is an actual motorcycle riding jacket, not a 'go to the club and look like you ride' jacket. Made of a good weight leather. The gussets at the shoulder make it comfortable for riding.  It is not too big in the stomach for the length.  I like it.
B00JF6XH4G|5|arrived securely packed, was clean for a used starter.  Installed in my van and it started just fine.  Less than half the price of auto parts stores.
B007RVNLME|5|Works great and didnt pay dealer price. Highly reccomended :-) Dont waste your time and just get this for your fob replacement
B000CRETBW|5|I did a timing belt replacement on a 2003 PT Cruiser Turbo. Figured I would replace the mounts while it was apart. This part fit perfectly. Time will tell how durable it is...
B005NLQAHS|4|This works well with the torque app on my Droid Mini and 2003 Nissan Frontier. I had tried a much cheaper (and smaller) version of this device before and it would not sync bluetooth. This device worked flawlessly. My only gripe is that it is so damn large. In my truck, it is easy to catch my toe on this thing when I attempt to activate my emergency brake. Being a stick-shift, this is essentially every time I park the vehicle, and has been an argument for me to not use it a lot of the time.
B000GV7H0O|5|I really like the flexability with this w - shield. Just got to watch & Not use soap with ammonia & will cloud it up.
B0064RD6PY|5|very pleased
B001LQHUBE|2|It looked 'cheap' on the car. My opinion, bright chrome against a dark blue car doesn't work for me. Maybe I'll try to find a pewter frame??
B001RKH7FS|5|AS FAR AS I KNOW HE LOVES IT. IT WAS A CHRISTMAS GIFT FOR A TRUCKER FRIEND.WHO IS ON THE ROAD NOW USING IT.
B000TYQ9GQ|5|100%  Excelent!!!!
B000E0Q3ZW|5|2003 Silverado handles way better than new.<br />The original shocks were still okay.<br />With these installed an amazing improvement in high speed mountain<br />curvy road driving was obtained.  The truck held the road as well as my new Audi.
B00ELJLU3W|5|Very nice
B001GRQVHM|5|Great floor mats!
B003XX5U6U|5|Great product. I have them on all my bikes. Necessity if you are going to the track.
B004QEH16M|5|Fits the size ball and keeps grease off your clothes.
B007QBJ9J4|5|fit perfectly
B00DWL06F8|5|Great and reliable product
B001LQL5UG|5|works great. 09 silverado had NO oil pressure on the guage, STOP engine light came on. I'm a bit of a backyard mechanic so i drive it 30 miles with the lights / buzzers dinging.....i KNEW i had oil pressure, the lifters we not ticking etc.... On the 5.3 litre GM engines, BEWARE there is an oil filter screen directly below this sensor.  REMOVE IT and throw it away.  It is meant to filter oil before the sensor , but mine plugged and i cleaned it a yr ago with carb cleaner, but plugged again. I removed the screen filter with a pick, and installed the sensor approx 6 months ago--still works fine. Filters havent been around under the sensors for 50 yrs but im sure that its there for a reason.....but i was tired of dealing with it.  Sensor can be installed without removing intake plenum, just use a socket and a u-joint swivel and you can access the sensor- its a 30 min job.....i can do it in 5 min now that i know how to do it. good luck. remove that oil filter screen under the sensor!!
B002P8JMDQ|5|5 minute installation. Nice.
B00CMX20H4|4|Great horn, but it has a horrible mounting bolt/system.  Design needs to be updated!
B0087PZHFI|5|works fine!
B007HNYTZU|5|In regards to the last review I left. The seller was quick to resolve my issue when the magnet did not show up. Was super polite and shipped another one for me and I got it right away. It was easy to put on my car and the reflector works great. Thanks again.
B007KCYG6A|4|very nice product just like OEM and I can see great in the night now!
B00JRHQZC4|1|Bad quality
B0009IQZMA|5|How do you review a chamois? I've had this over a year now and have used it many times.  It is still sturdy, hasn't ripped and works great.
B004D676GS|5|I use it in high beam for my 02 DTS the color is cool and perfect and I hate all halogen lamp.  This kit is having highest quality.  I recommend this kit for every body want's to upgrade his headlight.
B000VKYRQ2|5|This item actually comes in a box with two separate filters even tho it says pack of 1, so you don't need to purchase two like I mistakenly did. I am not sure about the other listings or brands tho they may only come with one.
B000BSYZQQ|1|I bought two of these to use on my tow dolly with my Ford Escape. The car has factory wheels and tires that aren't that big, I believe its a 16\\" wheel. These won't even reach the ratchet. Useless.
B00BT1GTM2|5|It was a little work taking the door panel off, however the fix worked and saved me money in the long time
B0002ZPBKW|5|Had an issue where the switch was sticking read bad.  Apparently the exact replacement part has been discontinued.  What a joke.  Anyway i got this one and broke off the copper colored prong because it was in the way.  Works like charm.  The switch does not light up but I don't care.  Maybe it doesn't light up because I installed it wrong.  But like i said, i don't care.  Switch is silky smooth.
B007XZK5XW|1|Plastic lock ring that holds the bulb in is kinda cheaply made. I broke it just trying to install the bulb the first time.
B0002MA056|5|Great product, works well. I use it in my Suzuki Samurai for off-road rallying and it is great. The light does not shine into the driver's eyes and is very bright for the navigator.  It is so good that I purchased another one for my side!
B00G620ZVU|5|Very bright, stays cool to the touch
B0009IR056|5|better than B&S filter
B000XEBI9K|5|Great product. WIsh I had bought it sooner! It provides a sense of comfort knowing that there is protection in case someone hits your car.
B004UTD0RW|5|Great product
B00DLMNQ1E|5|Just installed this hid kit and i love it great view and easy install takes no longer then 10mins recommend  to anyone
B000F7VKD4|5|This is a very good product. Just use sparingly, a little goes a long way. If you upholstery is very dirty apply 2 or 3 times instead of 1 heavy coat. The conditioner is excellent and goes on easily.
B00FFDDGB2|5|The rebuild kit contained all of the gaskets and parts to rebuild the 4 barrel Holley carb on my 1993 Glastron boat that is powered by a 4.3L Volvo Penta I/O. From reading the instructions that came with the kit and watching a few Holley carb rebuilding clips on YouTube the rebuild went very smooth with the exception of needing a clutch head driver insert to remove the screws holding the plate on the secondary side of the carb. Luckily the local AutoZone store had a $10 dollar driver bit set on the shelf that contained the clutch head bit that I needed. I'd recommend that you watch a few of the video clips to ensure that you have the needed tools before you start the rebuild of your carb.
B00CXKC72Y|5|Very quick delivery and totally satisfied with the product and price.
B001J8M3CA|5|Love these boots. They took a few rides to break in, but after that, they're exceptionally comfortable and my feet feel good (and very well protected) in them on any kind of ride, around town or across state. They're even getting easier to just walk around in... I wear a 7.5, got an 8, so I have the option of wearing thin or thick socks depending on the weather.
B0002KRC5O|3|This product is well designed and constructed. Getting the wires around the screw connectors is difficult and fussy. It I were to do it over, I would have purchased the same item and used solder.
B00F7GZSDG|5|Not only does the sticker look awesome on the rear window of my 1981 F150, it also lets everyone know the owner of the truck is more than likely armed.
B00CO85970|5|Looks great.
B0093XLGVM|2|These lights look good and perform as advertised. Problem, they are very weak and are not good for nighttime driving. They are very dim and unsafe as far as visibility at normal distances. If street lights are on they are adequate. High beams will put out light equivalent to low beam light. That having been said I still like them.
B003Z9UUUS|4|Good quality. Easy install - about 20 minutes. Price was excellent<br />Had it about one month and am quite satisfied<br />I highly recommend it.
B0056NUTMA|5|Drove both the V6 and V8 versions of the 2012 Jeep Grand Cherokee.  Decided on the V6 for fuel economy reasons.  After installing the AirAid CAI you couldn't tell it was a V6 during acceleration with no hit to fuel economy.
B0076PKXWC|5|I got this for my 2005 Pontiac Vibe after breaking the stock mirror on my garage cabinets.  I went to a repair shop (dealership) and they quoted a couple hundred dolars to repair (of course, this would have included matching paint).  Instead, I found this, went on youtube, saw how easy it was to replace and had it done in probably 20 minutes.  It's black vs my car being silver, but the car is almost 8 years old, so I don't really care.  Otherwise, everything is the same as it was new.  Power controls work, seals from rain water hasn't been an issue.  Well worth it to do you yourself.  Super easy.
B001DBXPEI|2|This is a low quality looking china import brand evaporator. I started removing my Honda evap, and realized it wasn't where the leak was. After about 10 years of use and being wet for long periods of time (we live in Houston and AC every day) the OEM evap looked a LOT cleaner and better condition than this one out of the box. I left the OEM one intalled and didn't use this. I was not very impressed. Looked to have some galvanized coating or something on it, which maybe a way of dealing with lower quality fin and tube material corrosion. I'm going to sell it and not go this direction again. I give two stars and it would likely work, and fit the intended use, although I don't think its made very well.
B002X1NLOQ|4|It works great, and I am happy to have it to replace my original broken one. The missing star is --- the feeling of the handle is not very smooth. But most important, it works and works great.
B00029J4G0|5|OK!!
B005HJIX1C|4|Great gift
B0007XS06Q|5|Worked as advertised
B0087NB1IW|4|Love it.
B0024GW17I|5|I love this tried several on wasn't sure if it would look cheesy<br />Very pretty fits secure and It makes me feel like a girl!! Which is what I wanted  love the art work.!!
B00183SMU8|4|Not super thick or heavy but works fine. Bike lives outside and is put to bed with this every night. Like the chain and lock for the bottom of the cover. Holds down in wind and helps discourage curious kids. Use the Fugetaboutit lock for security for the bike. Cover is for protection from the elements.
B00KRN40FG|4|Looks good and fit good on 09 fz6r but they are not sealed to good gets some water in them when I wash the bike but they seem built better than other aftermarket lights I've bought
B002XLHUQG|5|These things not only secure your camper, they also stabilize it. I was shocked at how much difference it made when walking in the camper. It was almost like I had put the camper on blocks.
B000RXNLK6|5|Easy to use, gets those little things off with ease!
B000E322WM|5|This came exactly as described, and works great. It has sufficient lube on the tracks, and buying here saved me about $50, rather than getting it at an auto part store. My mechanic was able to easily install it and didn't have anything negative to say about it whatsoever. If at any point my opinion changes, I will update my review.
B00KSXVUXA|5|Perfect fit and arrived on time ...
B0041G1C0Q|4|We bought a used truck with the Toyota bed extender already installed.  However one of the latches was broken.  After some research, it turns out these are the same brackets as the Toyota OEM bracket, so I ordered a set.  They turned out to be exactly the right size, but the screws on my OEM bracket were larger, so I was not able to use the screws in this kit.  However I was able to reuse the screws on my old brackets, so we were able to get it installed OK.  The bracket works great with the OEM bed extender.<br /><br />Oh - as a tip for installing these, you can access the area on a Tacoma after removing the taillight assembly.  It took us a bit of fumbling around before we figured out that was how to get to the backside of the bed in that area, but once we figured that out, it went smoothly.
B000JFJM14|4|Mityvac 7400 functioned better than expected for removing transmission fluid and power steering fluid from vehicles.  I would give 5 stars, but still have to pump it.
B001O9W5Q8|5|Nice fitting item. If you can test the finished job, by filling the gas tank with water before you install gas tank do so. As it is a tough job to do after you top off the gas tank and find a leak.<br />I bought new ,made in Canada fuel tank. then had the new filler neck welded on. When I installed the rubber o ring that came with the new tank it didn't seal right. Even though it was on all of the way tight.<br />So this new part sealed the sending line / fuel tank.<br /><br />Thank You.
B0065RMSRK|3|Item arrived on time and as described. However when I spend money on an item I would like it to fit as advertised.  Of the many online merchants I researched this item was priced most feasibly.  The seems didn't line up as they should have.  I didn't complain to the merchant as I purchased  the panels for both sides for less than the price at which some merchants sold a single panel.<br />Moral of this transaction: \\"You get what you pay for!\\"  (Low Bid)
B00902FV5I|5|easy to install and it worked
B00DJ5KE9A|5|Not as shown in picture, but works all the same. Handy to keep on bike!
B00032KBFE|4|Good quality.
B00029WR9G|3|ok.ok
B004Q86JJ8|5|Worked well for 2 years, then some flaking, they replaced under warranty.  Shipping back was expensive.  Kept a 12 V Elec Boat Battery charged very well with 1-2 days work a week on the boat.
B000E4HIZ2|5|Window regulator and motor combination, was a perfect fit. It was easy to install, and cost less than motor itself.
B0022UP8XA|4|cool cover
B00JR4D7AA|5|Great for led strip lights on rv
B0015YE3QC|3|We ordered the correct size for our RV but they are too big. Otherwise, they are fine at protecting our tires
B0007N20H6|4|It was the perfect fit for my sunpass which is the original slimline nearly identical to the one in the provided picture...You cant really see but on the lower left area it a section of the holder made to keep the sunpass in place so it doesn't rattle or slide around or out... If you have one of the slimline sunpasses or a similar device shape i would definitely recommend this one and as usual amazon prime eligible gets it delivered fast...
B012N2NMSE|5|Product installed very easily – 45 minutes from unboxing to driving. It will help you to assemble everything with beforehand, such as cutting the trim pieces and fitting them on the heat shield. Also, be sure you have the tube through the shield and filter fitted before popping the hood. A little WD40 helped the tight rubber fittings go on perfectly. It's much easier to attach the rubber coupler to your turbo inlet first, then you can move the intake tube into place before fastening everything down fully. Very clean install.<br /><br />There's really only one thing you need to know about this intake aside from the HP addition...it sounds AMAZING. This thing really brought the factory blow-off valve to life, as well as greatly increase the turbo sound. At full throttle in Sport Sharp mode, this thing makes your '15 STI sound like a 747 taking off. Then, when you shift, a very audible &#34;PFFSHHHHHHHH!&#34; from the BOV...it sounds like I have an aftermarket blow-off valve, but I don't. You will absolutely turn heads with this intake.<br /><br />This unit is built extremely well with red crackle powdercoating to match your STI manifold, and has perfect fitment of heat shield. Performance wise, my butt dyno detects better turbo response with decreased lag and more top end power. No complaints whatsoever, no check engine lights, no hassle. Just a great intake that brings HP and great sounds to your 2015 STI.<br /><br /> Important to note that this one of the few intakes for the 2015 STI that does not require a tune. It could benefit from a tune, sure, but it will not make your stock STI throw a CEL or run poorly.
B00651CLCS|5|Fit my jeep perfect. It would bend during long trips on the highway, but straighten out after car was parked for a while. Did not experience worse signal than with stock antenna.
B0006MQJ1G|1|Way below expectation. \\"63\\" piece ad is a deceiving trick. Bad. They count a single band aid as a piece to make the whole package a 63-piece item. It is like an illusion. I felt cheated.
B002692308|5|fits and good quality for the price! easy to put on
B003M10WLG|5|looks & works great!!
B008FZCA7S|1|Not sure if this thing works since it did not work for what I was trying to do :( so .....
B00COOSGBU|5|TO ADD A CLEAR VEIW THAT EXTENDS WELL PAST THE STANDARD LIGHTING. I AM ABLE TO SEE EVERYTHING AROUND ME AND EVERYONE CAN SEE ME ALSO.
B003CRUI96|5|Good top!
B0002TDUW4|5|It was easy to apply and it looks great
B008I62UE2|5|Great product.
B00DQJB948|5|Awesome Product. Quick and easy to install. Great signal and enhanced overall look of truck!
B00514AMEY|4|Arrived on time.  Easy to install in my motorcycle.  The sound could have been a little bit better.  I expected more from Kicker.
B000CHG0J6|1|package was heavily damaged, injectors are just as bad as the ones I replaced this with.
B000C2LX1Q|5|Bendix: brand brakes are a great product, very well pleased.
B0016J7MIM|4|So far so good on my 2005 GMC Sierra  Z71. Noticeable difference in stopping power and smoother braking. For best result, install new rotors as well and avoid doing a simple pad-swap.
B00C8CD77G|5|this helmet is very comfortable. not only does it look good and the design stand out, but the main thing is that it will one day save my life. so thank u IV2.
B0028R1IIG|5|This decal is really nice quality. Very detailed, very pretty and quite unique. Seller was super as well; no issues there. Recommend this sticker for anyone who wants something high quality and different.
B000CDAELA|4|Just put these blades on yesterday and today it rains. They work great. Very smooth and quite. Wipe the rain away real good. That is why they are a Consumer Report best buy. What more is there to say about wiper blades?
B002E0DW9K|4|This table is perfect for my children. We love it. I was looking for something we could take with us while traveling and staying at hotels so that they can have a place to sit and eat comfortably. We have been using it everyday for the past few days and my kids are so happy to bring it out when it's time to eat... I haven't taken it outdoors yet, but it has a hole in the middle that holds an umbrella and that will be great for shade. They will have a place to rest while playing at the park in case there are no tables or benches available. Overall it's perfect for them. I'm really happy I found this! The other thing I really like about it is that it folds up and has a handle to carry it. Both benches and the 4 leg attachments fit right into the folding table so that it can be carried easily and all at once. It's wonderful!
B004AR360K|5|It working good ,price okay ,I&#34;ll will buy more different item
B00HJ1592C|5|Love it! Only wish the shoes came in different colors!
B002L7A64U|4|im glad I went with these billet aluminium bow ties instead of the cheap vinyl pasties. front looks awesome. rear is a bit hoky because 1. my rear emblem didn't utilize the guide studs and I had to eyeball it. 2. much less adhesive than factory bow tie and isn't recessed much so it sticks out a bit from the tailgate. notable gap up close. otherwise great looking product. and great contrast that I needed for my lame silver color hah.
B002P8HB3O|1|Fits good looks good, the mirror is warped and the reflected image is very distorted.<br /><br />Update.  January 15. After 4 months, the stainless steel is now rusting.  Buyer beware.  Really low quality Amazon shoul drop this item and manufacturer/ vendor.
B000NWA6TU|4|Last time I bought these was 85000 miles ago still running strong but wanted to change them now, highly recommended
B00480J4NW|5|So far so good. Bought these after having several silver stars go out after just a few months.  The bulbs are bright. I have had them in the car for almost two months so time will tell on the durability.
B008DJ6ZR2|1|they send you a link to youtube for installation but they skim over the part about attaching the hose to the chrome air intake tube.  The video shows 1 port to attach the hose from the valve cover to the intake tube.  the intake tube actually comes with 2 air ports.  try to figure out what to do with the extra open hole in the intake tube?<br />--------------<br />after several emails:<br />buyer beware.  It is posted they have stock.  I get the wrong product.  I suggest they send me the correct one and i will send them the wrong one.  they reply \\"don't you understand english\\"? we don't have that in stock.  Well the site says you do so I do understand better than you!<br />I had to jimmy  the car for it to work properly.<br />car works.  looks bad<br />would not buy from them again
B001EP29AY|4|This is by far the sturdiest rack out there.  I have used several and this on doesn't dip or sag with weight.  I have had a ton of weight on it and it doesn't bounce or shift.  It's pretty heavy, but easy to slide into the hitch.  The tilt up feature is great.  Easy one pin removal to rotate the cage up.  Only downfall is that when its down it sticks out a little further from the bumper than others.  But it allows you to access the trunk as well, a plus and minus.  I have it on my 4runner and it works great.
B00JGQLQAM|5|Great price, Great Quality and fast delivery thanks guys
B001S7URMK|3|I order this part and it came in a panavise box with part# model  809. I looked it up and it's about half price  of the innovate 3814 .
B0068QC5EY|4|The connectors were used in my son's 2001 Ford Focus.  Made install of his new Alpine stereo easy.  However, extra instructions would have been nice to explain the purpose of the third smaller connecter connected to the OEM Radio and why this kit did not contain the third connector.  Otherwise I would have gave this product  5 stars.  But a brief check on the internet explained the purpose of the connector and that its' use was not necessary for most aftermarket stereo installs.  Overall good product.
B003PJOMEI|5|This bell housing is tough as nails and has a current SFI certification. It fits nicely on a TH-400 and has a provision for Buick, Olds and Pontiac.
B000I8TQD6|5|Just what I hoped for.
B000CINJOY|1|Too general and not useful for the car I bought it for. Not effective as a tech manual. i would not recommend
B003BMCL4M|5|Havent had a chance to custom configure the Box as yet.<br />Battery LED Panel works well, and this unit is well made.
B0022ZXO40|4|Tiny tiny tiny and not very stretchy.
B000HBNU9K|5|Once you let two surfaces with this adhesive on them dry and stick them together there is no way at all that you get it off! It is very permanent, though does get loose at high temperature (greater than 90° F / 30° C).
B001TK7CYM|4|I hate needing to wear them for my dry eyes but they're a huge bargain IMO if you need them.
B004NV1XTY|5|very good compra para el taller de mecanica y en general casa y servicios al consumidor ymas ymejor ymejor todo y para  amason
B00QXAIUFI|5|Perfect...
B000H8VYXM|5|Just received the driver side in the mail today, I got it to replace my old foggy one, fits great and looks great. Will update this review to see how well they wear from the weather. They look really black in the photo because of the lighting but they have that true smoked look to them.  ***UPDATE*** 3 months later and still looks brand new, no fading or condensation. They have held up really well so far this summer.
B004C5P50Y|1|I purchased this product not once but twice. It was returned both times because of defective workmanship and poor function. The product didn't stream audio from my IPhone in stereo and the static was horrible. Also the &#34;2 hour&#34; charging time is a bunch of crap.....Never did indicate a full charge on either unit. I would never recommend this unit....
B000C3XD90|5|I purchase this oil filter for infiniti M45 and infiniti G35 and have used them on the civic Si, Rx-8, and nissan 95 240sx with a sr20det s14 VTC type. I keep them around because they work on a plethora of engines: honda K20/24 & J30 V6, Rx-8's rotary, Nissan S14 SR20det, VQ35/37/40, VK45, VR38DETT, mitsubishi 4b11 (evo X) and 4g63(evo 8/9/ eclipse) and many more.<br /><br />The nut is a life saver in tight spaces, and especially on the new 2006+ civics Si which have a very tight and confined installation space.  As for filtering i've taken an old one apart and noted the filter media is very high quality i'd say as good or maybe better than most oem filters.<br /><br />I recommend it, it's a good filter just to keep around/ have since it works on just about anything my friends have.
B004ANBE1W|5|I have used lots of different spray guns out there and this gun works the best by far sprays better then every sata I have used it lays clear down like glass and the price is great on top of it
B00H02D35A|5|Worked great for my new engine
B00HRSTP1S|5|Very impressed with the quality of bulbs...
B000CP8GKY|5|Exact fit for my 2007 dodge ram 2500 4x4 diesel. Quality Rancho product at a good price
B000BUOSC0|5|This was the perfect product to extend our automatic dog water bowl from the tap to the patio. It s a high quality hose and was a great price!
B00PWYLIPK|5|The switches are well built and work but they are NOT waterproof.  I have them mounted on an angled part of my boats console.  A heavy dew was enough to turn on my lights and today after a washdown the LED light wouldn't go out.  I bought a pack of six so I will try another one to see if this fixes the problem.
B0013I2GJQ|4|I purchased these bulbs for my low beams in my 2009 Mitsubishi Lancer cause i wanted HID style lights without the HID price.  I have to say these bulbs look great.  A much whiter light, almost with a blue hue to them.  It gave my car exactly the look i was going for at a fraction of the cost.  The only downside is that they are not very bright, about the same or slightly less than the stock bulbs.  So if your looking for a HID look but not a super bright light then these are a GREAT buy.
B00466V9AY|5|just got it yesterday and went straight to my 2008 ford F150 , i followed the instructions and bingo my truck now is keyless entry remote for less than 8 dollars including shipping fees instead of $150.00 at the dealer :)
B00DSCZ0U2|5|Easy installation and delivered quickly. Thank you!
B00DJ4FIMO|5|Great price
B001INIAFA|5|I was expecting this to go in the corner of the rear windshield, but It works great as a centerpiece.
B002ENZCH2|5|I've had this installed on my 2012 Mazdaspeed 3 for about 3 months now. It was a fairly straightforward install, kind of a pain to work around the exhaust trying not to scratch it. It bolted right up, and I bought a carrgo carrier the next day. I really don't have anything negative to say about this hitch.
B00JH2GMMC|5|Worked like a charm! A friend of mine has a similar truck and replaced his as well after hearing my success story. Saved a lot of money compared to what a dealer wanted. The tricky part was remembering to use the latch again after not having it for so long!
B003QJKIAE|4|Update: I never returned it.  I've used it a few times.  It's not the best, but it has worked sufficiently for the price.  I wish the hooks didn't have so much play as I'd rather it fit snug edge to edge. I'm often afraid that stuff will just blow around the uncovered sides.  All in all, it's not bad for the money, and I'd buy it again.  Old review:  I bought this at WalMart for $21.00.   When I opened the box and examined the net, it really seemed to be made of very low grade netting. (even cheaper quality than what I expected for the price)  The grommets are cheap looking and tearing away from the net edge.    I'm going to take this back and look for something a little more rugged.    I just can't see this lasting more than 2 uses before it tears at the grommets, rendering it useless.
B000C46N7S|1|Does not fit Toyota Rav4 2000.
B001G7OBWO|5|When I received this part I was very surprised not only was it original Mercedes part but arrived early and quickly.which for me is a big deal. I live in Hawaii so parts are not always readily available or the best quality. So needless to say I was thrilled with both the quality, price, quickness of shipping.Very happy customer.
B000X205M8|5|Perfect fit in the cargo area of our C-Max.
B00B50JCV2|4|fast delivery, great product, but i received bronze color instead of silver
B00QW3I8Y4|5|The door handles were fine and fit my car--that is all that was needed
B0040HOMVC|2|These added to much around the cards, not a nice fit, making it difficult to fit in many wallets
B007M7Z8ZQ|5|Exactly the helmet I expected. Already had one so this is perfect.
B001UC9QQ6|1|Sent the wrong pads.
B0076D5NVK|5|Worked well
B006K8YQYW|5|I liked the first one so well I ordered a second one for when I need it.
B0089NU95Q|4|not bad for the logo! I ordered it. took around 5 to 6 days. its smaller but its nice and i like it for the money.
B005XZQHA4|5|Very solid lock strap.
B003RYUB00|3|Look nice but kind of flimsy for the price.  Headrest covers are ugly and fit very poorly.  Will probably purchase Costco's high quality  Neoprene covers at $15 for the pair.
B00BG8O68M|5|Second one I have owned, love it and would highly recommend it.
B000CMDNNW|5|A high quality product must buy it. Already his experience, his performance very high.
B001ADA13W|3|The underseat storage bin is a decent use of space...it's deep enough to hold things on both sides of the tunnel and thin, flat items on top of the tunnel as well. Just don't count on the dividers to stay put (they don't snap into place at all) or to do much in the way of cargo retention. I think if you want to carry fishing poles or golf umbrellas or long guns, the dividers might be OK but they don't stay put well enough for me and I really don't like the two-piece construction with a separate foam piece and hard plastic support piece.
B00E83JXEE|4|The fit is good, and it was easy enough to install.<br />BUT:<br />I was so intent on getting them mounted correctly, that I didn't notice that the front edge was chipped off on both pieces.<br />By then they were permanently glued to the car, so I'm stuck (pun intended) with them.<br />I don't know if this was a fluke or if they sell seconds online.  I can live with it, but for that price, an undamaged product would be nice.
B004TD3042|4|Fit like the original
B000NTX2TO|5|This is the Original OEM Fuel Valve equipment as stated in the listing, which is an original replacement part from Ford.
B001N47RIK|5|I like this because it is just the right shade of darkness to block the sun and reflects the sunlight well enough to stop eye strain.
B002LAUZ70|5|Great product
B001N72FES|5|I needed a device to isolate the battery of my truck. I leave it idle for far too long and felt I needed a device to protect the battery and descourage possible theft. This looked good and reliable and was cheap. since I purchased and installed it this disconnect switch has worked flawlessly. In fact it has worked much better than I expected as I couldn't, when I looked on-line. determine the method of disconnect. Only drawback is I have to manipulate it from outside the vehicle to connect and dis connect.  For the price, Its great.
B009AH2C5A|5|Cute and good quality!  Love it on my Jeep!
B0066RKVL4|5|ARRIVED ON TIME / GREAT VALUE / EXCELLENT PRODUCT
B001O0VO5U|5|Inexpensive pads, no noise heard what so ever. little to no brake dust keeps the wheels clean.
B005EY2X16|5|Just as described. Fast shipping.
B0055EBPQE|5|very pleased
B005OK5DJO|4|They should put these on the Victory CCT stock! They are just right for the average rider and I have tested it out with friends as well. It is nice to have the option, even though a little more pricey than your average bar and being such a pull back they have a little more flexibility that your average bars. For normal use that is not a problem with these, but if you were to use it for a leverage point to pick up the bike, I would wonder if they would bend a little. Holes are predrilled perfectly and everything is in place for an easy install.
B00C5RB03W|5|good replacement
B004XOQ0GM|5|Great if you have the space under the hood for mounting it in the upright position otherwise a mess will ensue the replacement of the filter.
B000A8JNF0|5|Worked great on my Z3's canvas top.  The toughest part was waiting for the cleaner to dry overnight, but it was very quick work.  Two thumbs up.
B0009IR0HE|1|Extremely thin metal, I have paper clips at work tougher than this. Plus the so called &#34;polished&#34; aluminum had several scratches and cheap black overspray.<br /><br />Spend a little extra and get something more heavy duty, this was sent back the same day it arrived.
B000C53SKW|5|This is a great strut. They give my 1998 Toyota Tacoma Xtra Cab 4x4 a solid ride at all speeds in all conditions. They are stiff/quick rebounding yet smooth. Overall I am very happy with them.
B0099IIHQ8|5|I received these in about 3 weeks as they are shipped from China, as I expected... They work very well..... I'm using them for an outdoor lighting application that uses these wedge type bulbs..... They are a bit longer than most standard bulbs, but that was not a problem for me. They are quite a bit brighter than the 5 SMD bulb which is what I wanted. They worked well for me in that they use 1 watt or less power. They provide a bright white light...... At this time I'm re-ordering another set or 2 just to have around. At $1.00 each they are a good buy with free shipping............ Of course Amazon is the best online retailer to do business with as well...........
B006LPOCHA|5|Have went thru two dusters already. These are the same. Great
B000GAPCJI|4|so good
B005OK402K|2|The sides get slouchy as you add items.  It holds items but not like it's pictured.
B006CRT72W|5|Bought this for my brother and he set it up in minutes and works great!
B002Z37ENQ|4|this is a great product, my only problem is the starps are really long. other than that its really nice to have
B0007M3WGU|5|As good as you can get an overweight steel barge to handle.  Seriously though, I slapped them on my 86 K5 blazer and the handling change was amazing. Absolutely stunning difference and you owe it to yourself to try a set. Most likely your shocks are blown already so anything is better than nothing, but these are way better than anything else you are gonna get.
B0081SAFG2|5|How do I write a review about such a mundane product?  I needed one, I ordered one, I got one, and I installed it.  Works so far.
B000O0U1G4|5|Very nice Compresdor
B00BTV2OSU|5|This product totally performs in the way that it is described.  Spray it on lightly, let it dry to a haze, then wipe it off, and it cleans the surface, while imparting a gleaming coat of wax.  I have used it twice, and the can is almost gone, so I will be ordering another one. If there is any negative, it is that you are not going to get more than three applications from the can.
B0042VTYXM|5|I read a story about a local family that had children drown in the mini-van because they couldn't get them out of their seatbelts. Most cars have electronic windows which may not work in an emergency; so I bought 1 of these for all the family drivers for Easter. I hope we never have to use them.
B00IQXKB98|5|this vest looks great, the size is perfect, I would recommend this to anyone.
B003KXFXSS|2|I ordered this subframe connector thinking it would be easier than a weld on type.  The instructions tell you to drill a few holes through the subframe and floorpan, then you can bolt them through the hole!  I rather have someone weld subframe connectors than drill holes through my floor.  Save your money and buy a WELD-ON type!  I am probably going to weld these on instead of returning them as return shipping will be a hassle from Hawaii.
B000CB3Z54|5|It was exactly what the discripsion said
B001O0AMNK|3|The paint on the acorn lugs is easily scratched even while using the utmost care during installation. The paint should not chip so easily during installation with the included tool.
B0007LVJ2A|5|Would buy again if ever needed
B00B0DGRF8|5|excellent
B009AQTOP2|2|These are not waterproof. I had water in these lights after a rainstorm.
B000I1CCBQ|5|This wrench is a great fit for my application.  You see my car needs this wrench/cup to remove a cover which holds in the oil filter.  My advise is to use a torque wrench when putting the cover back on,  Over tightening can ruin the wrench even though it is metal made.
B004LUIDJ0|3|... but frankly, we couldn't get the decal to stick on our car window no matter how hard we tried. I followed the included instructions to no avail. I asked a neighbor who has several decals they've put on their car windows. Nothing worked. I gave it a three because my daughter slid it into the front of her binder so she as least gets some pleasure from it.
B003AYY27U|5|It gets the job done although the bottle looked a little old, its not a problem though because it still works great.
B006ONOR74|4|This was a gift for my VW owning daughter. She picked this design because she would love a Wolfsburg GTI!  It's a VW thing I guess.  :)  price is a little high by my standards, but it was what she wanted.
B0013CXCYK|4|I loved this bumper bully until it was cut right off my car.  I now have the one with the steel cables in the hanging strips, I really miss the impact pads though, they definitely made a difference.
B00E9HWRK6|4|Not the right one for my Toyota highlander but still well quality for the price .
B00407WNE0|5|Great replacement for the OEM fuel cup.  This adds a good look to an already stylish Jeep.  A must buy for every Jeep owner wanting to keep mud and debris away from the fuel neck.
B000C9201G|5|much brighter than oem- very nice- plug and play, big improvement! wear some gloves while installing or they will quickly fail....
B000CGZ1ME|5|I prefer energy suspension products and this didn't disappoint. Replace your old hardened worn out bushings with ES and restore your ride quality. I think doing the front and rear sway bars reduced body roll slightly, and that was my goal. Measure your bars before ordering because mine were larger than listed  on the ES catalog.
B001ATBEK0|5|I just love this stuff. This is the best & the safest degreaser I have ever used. It may seem a bit pricey, until you use it.  You will find that it works on eveything, the boat, car or bar-b-que & washes off with water.
B000N3W8J0|5|Keeps the dirt trap. Only get this if you wash your car using the 2 bucket method. If you only use 1 bucket to wash your car.. you are doing it wrong and this item will not help you much.
B00L4NHW7Q|4|Good product. However edges of the mats I order had some defects and cracking rubber on the edges of the mats. The main primary areas of the mats were in great condition. However, I would of expected the entirety of mats be in excellent condition ordering them new. Still I can say they are good product and this might have been a unique instance of minor defects in manufacturing.
B002OOE51K|5|Do what the voices say to you. Buy it. Its perfect for us. We all agree yes you must get it.
B007GR60TK|5|Lo estaba esperando por que tenía una competencia y lo necesitaba, llego justo a tiempo , el acabado del producto es muy prolijo, se lo recomiendo ampliamente a todos
B000C2Y1JM|5|Perfect fit for my 1995 Jeep Wrangler 4.0L.  Received on time and was as described.
B001NAP2E0|5|Fast delivery, could not find filter locally, exactly what I needed!  Fit perfect, works great...I like K and N products.
B009E9K5QM|5|Love it
B0070Y35GU|5|Product is very nice delivered very fast the precut sheets are perfect size for the window I got a set for my 90 Honda Civic and it works amazing no problems even came with an applicator squeegee it was really nice to have to cut the size of the window and it was already all perfect definitely using this next time I want to tempt my car there's no point buying it uncut rule when this is $15 so worth the money
B000MDZLQ8|5|The fit is perfect. The quality appears to be very good. Will see how it hold up to the sun.
B007TR03VI|2|They where ok they just keep falling off
B0093AA5KI|5|Great sunshade and perfect fit for my 2015 challenger!
B004P8ABOI|5|Does the job! Easy to use...
B00KY8LRH8|5|prefect fit
B000KZ1XVK|5|I have a habit of destroying these fobs and have been satisfied more than once with this product thank you
B00MI1JGB8|5|Ordered one as a gift for a friend and it did not arrive. Post Office delivered to someone else but was unable to say who or how. A new Keychain was provided quickly and arrived promptly enough. Very cool. Larger and heavier than expects. Great sounds. Feels robust and substantial.
B000CRKOHK|3|Had a hard time fitting this on my 2008 Jeep Patriot, eventually got it on - but it took at lot of work.
B00DJ5VZE8|5|battery replacement for outdoor lighting motion sensor and solar cell panel charging circuit.  Would buy another if needed to replace.
B006S4FR2S|1|Sorry item didn't work  will be sending it back
B001INL9JE|1|Sticker did not come off the clear sheet which ruined the sticker. Vary good design tho. Would not recommend unless you plan on not sticking it on something.
B006CRT7IQ|5|works grate and easy to program and comes with instructions to fallow the best got a yellow cover to go with it
B0030GF2LI|5|great magnets. average size. its stays on even after a rain. brought 4 of these just in case. recommend it to everyone.
B0002UHVAA|4|It is very helpful to see the waste water as it leaves the tanks...but the hose attachment is only partially effective because of my units discharge pipe angle.  It is still a good value, and worth the money
B002VF8284|5|I used this to replace the stock air filter on my 2010 Nissan Rogue. Fit is perfect and price is good. The cabin smells nice and fresh again.
B004ZF39T0|5|Lights look good. They are very bright and give me exactly what I needed. I have put these lights on all the vehicles in my household.
B005CHT4W6|5|Used in my Mazdaspeed 3 every 3.5k miles. I love it. Did some oil analysis tests and this stuff holds up GREAT. Could not recommend it more.
B005PF9AUQ|3|Good
B00B1V7RGW|5|This fit perfectly in my Toyota Sienna without requiring any adjustment. Guided by a video on YouTube, this was easy to install.
B001F15ZDK|5|This was a very simple set up and install ALTHOUGH i swapped these in when i was changing out my coils anyway!  If i were to try and install with the springs still hung i feel that the &#34;simple&#34; task of deflating and rolling these into the coils would be rather difficult.  Plus drilling the holes from the bottom seems rather foolish but what ever.  The actual fell these are rather nice and combined with lowering springs these have changed the ride altogether.
B007SQUWQ6|5|Got a left and right one for each of my girls who are littermates ..  I don't hide the fact I have pit bulls or love them they are great dogs but need owners that know how to train and handle intelligent independent minded dogs with a lot of strength.  They are my babies but I know the breed having it over 25 years and I respect its strength and tenacity.. I like to educate people on the breed whenever I can.  Thanks
B00I8SJPPW|5|Definitely better than the stock exhaust. Sounds great, looks great.
B00RFZLMDW|3|Manual tone goes through a long tone not just when holding toggle. And tones are higher pitched than normal otherwise it's good for the price
B005EYV9O8|5|These are OEM carpet mats for FIAT 500.<br /><br />They are well made, from high quality tufted carpet, with bound edges.<br /><br />Embroidered &#34;500&#34; logos on the front mats lend a customised appearance.<br /><br />The mats fit well, as you would expect from an OEM product.<br /><br />It is important to observe that the front mats have locating rings which fit into retaining lugs in the floor of the car, so, once fitted, the mats will stay in place.<br /><br />Highly recommended as an attractive, stylish and practical addition to your FIAT 500.
B000KKLLX0|5|Works great !
B008FHWZOY|3|Quality seems good but it didn't fit a original equipment mustang wheel.  These alloy wheels has a deeper hole that required a smaller diameter on the part the mounts on the outside of the wheel.  This is the part that is needed to bolt the valve steam to the wheel so there was no way to make it work.  Quality of the product seems good but there is no way to tell if this is going to fit a car wheel without trying it.  I would recommend the wheel have a flush mounting surface since the a sunken mounting hole may or may not work.
B003P64XU4|5|Easy to install. Slipped right over my ABS plastic vent stack on my motorhome. A couple of screws in the side and done. Seems to reduce the odors in my black holding tank very nicely. I like it.
B007I75D8W|5|These have got to be the best back up reverse lights available. They are so darn powerful and SUPER BRIGHT.<br />I have tried A LOT of reverse lights and these are the best i've found.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS
B008EWPHZE|5|These light are a great fix for old crazed ones but the plastic mounts are made out of much softer plastic than the originals were so when adjusting them there were some issues. But as it turns out the fit so tight in the grill that they don't wiggle and they have stayed put. I would buy them again and Autoandart service and price is the best!
B006RIX95W|5|it works!
B004K9I25C|5|I bought this as a replacement for my Suzuki S40 which is known for a problematic Fuel Cock. Just cap off the vacuum hose from the carb.<br />Works perfect!<br />Screws right on.<br /><br /> -Scott
B0099Z4MJ2|5|Easy to use, well worth it
B000VKTUM8|5|Fit my 07 Xterra perfectly. Takes about 5 minutes to install. Just make sure not to break your glove box when lowering it out of the way. I almost did! You have to release the black cord and then push in the sides of the glove box to move the plastic stoppers out of the way. Once you do that it is really simple to unhook the black box that houses the air filters and then insert the new ones. The glove box will just clip back into place once you reconnect the black bungee type cord that connects to the glove box.
B002R0MXKG|5|ok
B00HAPRG1Y|4|I have not installed it yet.  though I will re tag this to I love it, when is completed.  thanks
B005C2ACBI|5|this is my second set, this is the best way to go
B000N9MTPC|1|I ordered this item thinking it would be as displayed in the picture. It is not even close.<br />This part will not work as a substitute for my application.
B00596QVHG|5|good product
B001FAGJAY|5|Great product, installed easily. I love how it looks no problem with locking. Overall very happy with product. I highly reccomended
B004HP19W2|5|Best filter I've ever had!
B000VLC6Y6|5|Well made and fits well
B003FBV8ZW|4|These glasses are clear and fit well.  They fit under my helmet well and they keep the air out of my eyes.  The only thing that I don't like is that the foam restricts some peripheral vision.
B0010HAKZ2|5|Works very well. I think it is cooler in the van than it has ever been. Thank you for a good product.
B00075XCJE|5|Nice looking heavy hitch. I have a Curt hitch on my 3500 Chevy too. It took two hour to put on by myself, a helper would be nice. Instructions ok but could be better, I had to enlarge one hole in frame on each side to make all the bolts fit. Well worth the trouble good looking heavy hitch.
B005KVLX50|4|Works great for hauling 16 foot material overhead in my Tacoma short bed.  I would recomend product to occasional haulers
B000RMT7UK|5|Fill and coverage werer great!
B00J7RB72M|3|I'm able to fit all my cds into the case, but the plastic sleeves are pretty cheap. The slots are too small to fit both the cd and cd booklet. It's flimsy and will probably break prematurely, but it gets the job done for now. The cheap price is one of the main reasons I gave it 3 stars instead of 2. I neither recommend buying it nor not recommend buying it. Blah or eh is how I feel about it.
B000COS07O|5|perfect fit, solid construction
B000CPJJVE|5|Helped stiffen the brake pedal.
B0088SKE3O|5|Easy install , my 1999 Tahoe looks killer now!!! Kinda took me a while to get used to seeing everything behind me but blind spots dont exist anymore.
B003BZQ8CA|5|EXCELLENT clamps.  Heavy duty stainless.  I tightened them with a wrench, not a puny screwdriver.  They seemed to scream &#34;MORE!  Tighten me MORE!!!&#34;
B00832N4BY|4|Great replacement lense. Just be careful with cleaning. Harsh chemicals can damage he protective coatings on the lense which is why I had to buy another one.
B00028FB8G|5|Got this since the one on my engine lift (2 1/2 ton) went bad.  When it came in, went to remove the old one, and this one had fit like a glove.  No problems whatsoever.  Perfect
B00JZR3IEO|5|Gosh, these quick connectors surprise me with high quality.  Only recommend to them is having a rubber cap.  5-packs make 10 connectors, with caps, will help the connector clean when not in-use.
B005MQXWVG|5|They look great on my UTV
B004TADG7Q|5|Great product, great seller.<br /><br />Nice fit and finish if you are wanting to remove the milk jug type of bumper ends.<br /><br />You will need your own hardware (bolts and clips) as they do not come with this package. I just used the ones from the milk jug ends I has no problem.
B007F1BUV0|5|Great deal.  All original Mopar.  Fits stock perfectly!
B002ZTNUW4|5|It is now a tradition... the first non-original accesory I buy for any car I acquire is a set of WeatherTech side window deflectors.<br />It is nice to be able to ride with the windows slightly down, leting some fresh air in and being able to hear to what happens outside, without worrying of dust or water geting into the car, and with relatively little noice.<br />Delivery is always fast, the pieces are very easy to install (after the first set you install and learn the tricks, it takes less than 15 minutes), the fit is perfect, and they add to a more sportier/off-road look (specially to SUVs, which is my case).<br />But the feature that sets WeatherTech appart from the other products out there is the in-channel mounting; i.e. the deflector insert (snap) in the channel where the car's windows runs.  Unlike the deflectors that mount using two-sided adhesive tapes, which eventually get loose, the WeatherTech deflectors stay put and never come off, no need to worry!<br />Definitely an excellent purchase!
B0002SRF7Q|5|I bought these as a last resort for my 98 Dodge Dakota. They worked great for the Brake Caliper Pin holes. They were easy to install as well.
B0085KGOH0|5|Super convenient/functional.  The Tote-N-Stor has made things so convenient for us, no more hauling the trailer to the dump site, just roll the portable container into the truck and off we go.
B003VKYXKO|5|I'm very happy with the claw, so far.  I used it to tie down my awning about a week ago and since then have had some winds in the 25 mph range with no movement of the legs or loss of tension in the tie-down strap holding the awning down.  It was very easy to install, much easier than pegs or helical tie downs.  The only problem I see with them is they are supposed to be used directly below the awning and if you are situated on a concrete patio you would have to move the claw out to open ground causing your tie down straps to reach them at an angle.  The claw is designed to work best when the strap pulls  directly up at the centre of the claw.  It  will probably still hold but not as well - time will tell.  I didn't see anything about that in the reviews or description prior to buying and it surprised me.  Fortunately it isn't a problem where we are currently parked.  I would still recommend The Claw.
B000VKTUD2|5|Saved me 40 dollars from replacing it at the dealer.  The install took about 3 minutes, and most of the time was unboxing the product and walking to my car to get this installed.  Will be buying this every year.
B002M3KSK0|5|Used this on our Volvo XC60 to keep luggage top on the car.  Worked great!  Good value for the money.
B00LJYYDDQ|1|I read bad I was expecting. Complete remote and only it was the case and take very very longer todelivery to bad
B000CLOOUY|4|These cylinders are a perfect fit and have worked as expected so far. Not sure if the rubber boots are a thick as OEM they replaced. Save your OEM bleeder caps as these one are thin  plastic.
B0032Z948O|4|I got these to replace halogen lights and it was like night and a brighter day.. It took about 20+ min. to install but after you turn them on you wonder why you didn't do this earlier. If you're looking for something brighter get these lights...
B009QF2E54|5|Very well made. They really stand out on the car. I will buy them again soon as replacement, although they seem like they will last a few years.
B000B61TPS|5|Works great with our RV when we dry camp.
B0023VKQ8K|5|Great experience--nice to be able to match exact part numbers and have a system that make sure you're getting the right thing!
B000E24APU|1|i mixed the colors to match my leather bag exactly (very light dusty pink color) and it went on perfect but dried into a brown color. it also peeled right off, doesn't work at all for a mending job.
B002ZBWKAU|5|Still works.  I use to check my pressure about once every three weeks.  No issue and the cord is very long.
B00NY4LWSI|4|These are very bright. Seem to built well. Haven't let them sit in the elements yet, but fired them up off my boat battery. Had to put some washers on the bolts to hold the light were it's aimed, cause without them, the bolt fell in slot, washers worked great, held fine. Surprised me by how bright they are. Will put them on after the winter is over.
B008K4BJSA|5|It was the simplest and cheapest way to solve the problem.  Despite that it worked as well as more expensive means.
B001GJ3DZS|4|Bought this brush to wash sensitive alloy wheels.  Brush arrived slightly smaller than I was expecting, but bristles are soft.
B00ATGGRMU|5|Perfect size, great color, looks just like the pictures. its perfect for my car and it stands out. thank you
B00JYMZ8HK|4|Seems to work ok. Used it through thunder and lightning, no surges so I guess it worked ok. I feel better having it.
B00EVVPQN0|5|Perfect fit, good price, easy to install, and was fully charged within a day or two of installation.  About a week later we had a power outage and garage door opened as promised.  Will buy again when my other two OEM garage openers batteries die.
B005NLQAHS|5|Works as advertised, including on '96 to 2005 Fords, (!) and has a completely different pc board inside than do the various cheaper units that look the same as this BAFX unit on the outside.  THE FOLLOWING ONLY APPLIES TO UNITS SOLD EARLIER THIS YEAR, THAT WERE ADVERTISED AS BEING BAFX, BUT WERE NOT SOLD BY BAFX: BAFX says those units were poor imitations of their product, and those other companies do not sell BAFX-labeled adapters on Amazon any more. Due to defective pc board design, those earlier units won't read the pre-CAN Ford protocol, SAE J1850 PWM, that was used by Ford and isolated others '96 to '05.  (Ford only makes a few cars anyway, right?) Must have slipped their minds when they wrote the ad copy.  They worked on everything else I tried them on, including a 2006 Ford. (CAN protocol is used on newer ones instead of SAE) If you are stuck with one of these earlier or other units and have a Ford, see talkford.com/topic/194099-elm327-interface-not-connecting-to-ecu/, towards the bottom of the page, but it ain't for the faint hearted or non-electronics inclined.  If you have a unit whose inside looks exactly like the pictures on that web page, get out your soldering iron.  This applies to many brands.  In researching this I found out this is very common, normal even, for the clone 327 scanners.  I thought the Chinese were better copiers than this.  I just bought a Ford, and was very happy with the cheaper scanners until then.  If you have an older Ford, stay away from ANY of those cheaper Elm327 units unless you are willing to get out your soldering iron and magnifying glasses.  After my initial comments about all this (painting all units said to be BAFX with the same brush), BAFX offered to send me one of theirs to check out.  They weren't fibbing, the actual BAFX unit is completely different inside from the imitations and it works as advertised.  -Beth's husband
B00FHSO6V4|1|The helmet seems to be well constructed, and is comfortable.  But there is a major design flaw with the latches for the chin bar.  In order for the chin bar to lock into the down position, metal plates on each side need to fit into slots.  I noticed when I closed it with the helmet off, that usually one of  the plates missed the slot.I tried several times to close it while wearing it, then removing the helmet without opening, and found that one of the plates in the chin bar was usually not in the slot.  So it seems that the chin bar is not usually fully locked down, so it isn't safe.  I still like HJC helmets, so I will be ordering a full face model.
B000CIADLG|1|however, for the size of 4 panels only producing 60W it seems absurd when you can get Renogy panels that are the same size and 1 panel is 100 watts and made much better! The stand for these is flimsy.<br /><br />You can't run much on 60w.  Go for at least 200w monocrystalline panels
B004L67L42|5|This Item works great with single or duel tires. Not to sure about the tires on RV pushers.
B00AS3TXWA|5|I highly recommend this if you want to keep your car floor brand new and easy to clean. This fits perfectly on my 2014 honda accord sedan. Its worth the money believe me. You will never regret buying this Floor liner.
B008V5OBF6|1|They didnt even work
B001NJ3H0C|1|Not even three months went by before these batteries would no longer hold a charge. Typically they can last for 3 to 5 years (or more); a 3 year warranty in not uncommon. I’m told the manufacturing of rechargeable batteries is not as precise as they would like you to believe. Some batches are better than others. The bad batches are sold off to be recycled although sometimes they are sold to consumers instead. A low price is usually an indication of such. Still, I was expecting these to last a couple years (or more). The warrantee is 1 year so I figured if they can last for one year they can probably last one more. Three months later the power failed and my UPS lasted for 1 minute. Usually it can go 60 minutes or more at that load. The UPS also reported no charge remaining in the battery.<br /><br />I contacted the company and they said to return the batteries for a refund. The postage to send the batteries back was ~$15, half the original purchase price. Together with repackaging and the effort to drag the heavy batteries to the US post office (UPS will not transport batteries) you pretty much break even. Thus most folks won’t bother. I was on the fence when I realized this might be exactly what the merchant is counting on. No return means no refund and the merchant keeps all the money. Si I decided to return the old batteries. I may not be coming out ahead but at least there is clear feedback to the merchant. If they are selling more than few defective batteries which are all being returned the merchant will not make any money and so will be discouraged from trying to sell more.
B0017KIZRW|4|Not really sure why others rate this so poorly.  Good quality for the price.  The foam does tear easily, but doesn't matter once its on, and difficulty installing is due to having to remove the seat belts which is not the product's fault.  Only modification I had to make was cutting some foam out to make it fit under the sound bar.
B00480J4PU|4|These are brighter and whiter than the stock bulbs replaced on motorcycle. Light output is white in color. Would buy again and recommend if longevity is good. Will see how they work out. So far, feeling good about these bulbs.
B00KJ17Y2C|5|I love it❤. The installation was easy and it's really bright 😃.
B005JCY7RG|4|Pros: easy to install; provide great strength for a tie-down, tuck out of the way when not in use<br />Cons: strength of bull rings is for pulling up, not down. Don't over tighten there as the bezel will split.
B00590WYN2|4|I cannot believe I got these at the price I got them at. I could not have got them installed at the dealer for that price I paid for them. Great Deal!
B004ZMCZUC|1|Worthless gimmick
B000CSD6RE|5|Exactly what was already in the bike, works perfectly for it. It being a Yamaha V-Star 650, in case you didn't get that from the title.
B004V71CP0|4|worked great
B000GU5IBU|4|Cover seems to be good quality and definitely repels rain, but as some people had said it seems to not breathe very well. Luckily I live in a dry climate, but I am not sure how this would fair in a more humid climate. Also, it seems to run a little small. I bought a large size cover for my 250cc scooter that has a trunk on the back, and it does not fit my entire scooter (too short in length from front to back), but I think the x-large would have been much too big. My cover fits on the back part of my scooter all the way to the ground, but comes down just past my headlights on the front. It covers what I need it to cover, but considering the back of it is already on the ground I figured an x-large would have been much too big, and I just deal with what I have now. It covers what it needs to cover, so I'm not too upset. It's also very durable, and totally waterproof. I have had a couple big rains and my scooter stayed bone dry! It also helps repel a little heat (I live in Albuquerque, NM, so the sun can get quite intense!), and makes it a lot better for me to sit on after it's been baking in the sun. Outside of the size department, and a possible lack of ventilation (but, consider the material!), this is a great buy and overall I am happy with the product!
B0002STSQM|4|I'm responsible for checking fleet vehicles' tires.  This device is simple to use and gives you accurate enough info.  My only wish would be to have a 'cap' or carrying case of some sort.  this is not a big deal, it's just that the end of the measuring tool sticks out and gets snagged on things.  Again, not a big deal.  If you need a tool to help with checking tire tread depth, this is hard to beat for the price.
B005VYOJCU|1|Although the rails are are described as being a part of this kit, but my order did not include them.  I didn't open the box until more than 30 days after shipment, so it was too late to return the order. I had to buy the rails twice.<br /><br />The brackets that were in the order worked fine, but I resent having to pay twice for the rails.<br /><br />Order the brackets and rails separately and open your orders as soon as they arrive.
B002TPRNFE|5|Great brush for removing loose dust on a vehicle. Mini brush saves time on the interior cleaning.
B004B68XGC|5|If you have av RV you need this!
B000BRQ0TW|5|JB Weld never seems to disappoint, it is one of the best products on the market for that quick fix. I recently used this to fill a hole in the top of the radiator in my car as a result of an accident, and within the hour the epoxy was set, and so was I.<br /><br />I've never come across any JB Weld product that I was not completely satisfied with. Highly recommended.
B00CEX46GA|2|i really don't think this item is worth its price, only two strips of tape, had to buy more tape to install it properly, also item is very flexible,would NEVER BUY again
B000BQWLE6|2|It looks like it takes up a bit of floor space in the photo, in reality this \\"trash can\\" might hold a waded up piece of paper, It is SO small.
B009FCTP5K|1|I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon. Love Amazon actually. This is the first item I ever ordered that I disliked.  First off it was poorly packaged, as it was spray bottles laying on their side the whole way. Well the vinylex leaked and was half empty when it arrived. Both the inner box which was laid sideways in the outer box, and the outer box were covered in vinylex. When I opened the inner box, much to my surprise it wasn't a 6 pack of vinylex but one bottle of vinylex along with a bottle of leather cleaner and a bottle of leather conditioner. I then looked at the inner box label and it showed a 6 pack of vinylex. So the box had the wrong contents. I've yet to try the little I have left but will change my rating if necessary when I do.
B000C40SSS|5|excellent
B00GXRFKYK|5|Parts fit and look great, and for half the price of the big name brands. Can't go wrong with these.
B0018YGATC|5|Bought these for the low price and solid reviews. I used this on a 2000 commuter (i.e. not performance oriented) Corolla whose rotors were warped and cut badly. As the piston side brake pad would engage first on the single sided caliper designs, the old rotors clearly had that side of the rotor worn thinner.<br /><br />The plates facing the piston is thicker on these rotors. That supposedly will compensate for the extra wear on the piston side. (photos uploaded)<br /><br />The surface is also polished/finished in a cross directional pattern that only requires a brake cleaner spray before installation. Some people don't see the need to remove the rust-proofing compound with brake cleaner as it will probably burn off with heat, but I just wanted to play safe and did it by the book.<br /><br />I've found no defects with these heavy rotors and they worked great with [[ASIN:B0016J7JLW Monroe CX741 Ceramic Premium Brake Pad]] recommended by Amazon's \\"often bought together\\" suggestion. It is very quiet and brakes well. I've not put it through performance driving as the car wasn't intended for that. However for a daily driver it performs very well. I'm very happy with how these turned out.
B000BQWNRQ|5|Beastly snow brush. Beastly.
B008XIQ5KA|4|Two out of the three items will be helpful. The one that was disappointing was a bottle opener and saw. Something I wished I would have paid more attention to when  quickly viewing  the items in the collection. The one tech computer guro in the family said the one tool will be very helpful working on different things. Semi pleased that I purchased this.  I had purchased three multi-function sets for the electronic, computer guro's in the family. The one  tin case was slightly dented on top. This was noticed when unwrapping the packaging the tins came in. This was disappointing to find. Being so close to the holidays, I can't wait to return this damaged tin casing.
B000TYOQVQ|4|These knobs fit my 2002 Pontiac grand am perfectly. The only minus to them is that the original knobs are backlit and the position indicator is clear, so the knobs look lit up, while the replacement knobs are solid and no light comes through. Very minor issue and really good price.
B003VZQYKQ|5|Excellent value for the money charged.  Arrived in good shape, very little to do to finish assembly. Study, and rolls easily, even with oli tank half full.  To empty is a simply task ... connect shop air, raise to highest point so as to be able to shut the valve, and the drain process starts immediately.  Built in pressure regualtor works fine & is easy to use.  Empties waste oil into a container or whatever means you are using to recycle the used motor oil.<br /><br />If you have a lift, this is a &#34;must have&#34;.  A true value for the money.
B000182ESC|5|perfect fit and fast delivery!
B007GQ4NKY|5|good quality and fast service
B004SNJPV0|5|Simple installation.
B00336XFK0|5|Fits my BMW perfectly.  Love it.
B00DBESPEK|3|accepted
B004NV4E2W|4|Fast shipping. Good quality.
B00GP2UPB6|5|20mph boost
B000CCM63K|3|Don't clean as good as they say. Tried it on black marks at a house we bought, and it wouldn't take it off. But Mr Clean did.
B003RX2QQ8|5|Both cases on the remotes from the dealer broke over time.  Saw this on Amazon and just had to give it a try.  We figured it would cost us hundreds of dollars to replace these, and when I saw the price of this, I was willing to purchase, especially from all the good review of the seller.<br /><br />Product arrived MUCH quicker than anticipated, which was a plus, and instructions were very easy to follow.  I will say this, though, do NOT try to program the remote with the door OPEN!! Sit inside the vehicle with all your doors closed to accurately do this.<br /><br />To find the programming instructions, go to the dealers website and find this remote from the free programming link on the top of the page.  The instructions are on the right side below the price of the remote (at least as of 11/013/2014).  VERY easy to do this, and very easy to program (once the door is closed!! :-) )
