B009UNGYHG|5.0|i really find the case not only convenient but also sturdy and worth the investment. I don't like to &#34;wear&#34; my bluetooth so the case gives me a safe place to protect my investment. I love it and glad I made the purchase!
B0053O89WY|5.0|I first started watching &#34;The Big Bang&#34; for a lack of anything on television to watch that night. Now I am a big fan. The four &#34;boys&#34; and Penny complement each other perfectly and now with marriage and Sheldon having a girl-friend (of a sort) the story line is getting better.<br /><br />The &#34;Boys&#34; are smart and yet so very unable to help s themselves in the real world which tends to be my experience with so-called &#34;smart&#34; people. Well worth watching.
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|My 3-year-old daughter has watched this I think 10,000 times since we purchased this blu-ray. (exaggerating, but not much) Blu-ray quality is great, and the movie is a classic!  We like having the dvd included because we don't have a blu-ray player in the car, so we can watch it anywhere!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was my favorite of the series and I can't wait until Book 4 (House of Hades) comes out.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|A trip into the mind for a nail-biter of a mystery. You'll be hooked right out of the gate! Couldn't wait to pick it back up after setting it down for a bit, gives it 5 stars from me.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|It was ok, but not what I expected, considering the original with Swartzanegger. sic No more to say, even though I usually like Colin Ferrell films.
B000R9J3XE|5.0|Can't get enough of this &#34;Absolute Garbage&#34;! There is hardly anything which I don't like on this album.<br />Highly recommend it!
1439199388|3.0|Not particularly well written but interesting account of fist hand experience. Quick read (4-6 hours) and worth the time invested.
B002ZG981E|5.0|owning a great film like Inception on Bluray for only $10 is a great value and great addition to my collection
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This a a great app and very useful. Big numbers and the calculator fills up the whole screen. Highly recommended.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|good story, well written but not at the end yet, still reading....here are the eight more words you require which is stupid..oops 11 words, should have erased three..please take me off your review list
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I have love this series!  I love the romance and the mystery of the whole books.  My daughter and I have read all of her books over and over.  We have watched all the movies and still go back to the book to read what they left out.  I know their is a lot of negative things said about these books BUT this series has brought my daughter and me closer in the last couple years as we have compared and discuss all about them.  Thank you Stephanie Meyers.  So wish you would write more on the Jacob and Renesime.
034547581X|5.0|the book is even better than the movie, just what I was looking for, for my husband, thanks great purchase.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|this app made my kindle over heat so much that I had to shut it down every15 minutes. I had to get a new Kindle!!
B001LF3YQK|5.0|Ok, it's a splurge as far as wipe cases go. However, it's quality is definitely much better, the plastic is sturdier and its much better looking. Also, i feared that it will be too big for my diaper bag ( Sip Hop Duo Dash Nixon) but its actually a very good size.
0316067598|5.0|They was an error at first. But the company went above and beyond to corrected it. Will order again from the company...
B007IK44CK|4.0|I wasn't sure if this was suppose to be funny, but I figured with Simon Pegg as a supporting character it had to be. I enjoyed how the technology and mechanical things kept going wrong. I appreciated the irony of the GPS tracking scene and how the things that did go wrong actually go wrong for the rest of us in real life. I am glad that it didn't take itself too seriously and allowed for the hero to be only a above average instead of implausible. Overall I enjoyed it and it made me laugh.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Man, this was a great story!  Great acting!  Great everything.  I have a newfound respect for Jessica Lange.  She did an awesome acting job in this.  We were stunned how excellent this show was.  Highly recommend it.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Lee Childs has built a good character in the Jack Reacher series. This may be one of the better Reacher novels written by Childs.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nice story.  Well done. I couldn't put my book aside.  Nicholas Sparks is a genius.  Actors well chosen for the film.
B0077EBWVI|5.0|Footloose (2011)<br />I loved it!!!!!  I watched the old movie(the classic one) and i love them both very, very much!
1423124960|5.0|It came right away... The kids were excited and they started reading it by themselves.. Great for night time kids always looking forward to bedtime
B0000A98ZP|5.0|The Breakfast Club is a movie that brings back the 80',  it is so good you can watch It over and over!0
B00992CF6W|4.0|My 10 yr old loves this game, it keeps him busy for hours, the only thing I don't like is how you can't pause it
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Its a great game and I love it but the prices on the horses are too high the creators/creator needs to lower them
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Great book. I couldn't put it down. I had to see what happened next! My first Jodi Picoult book, but it won't be the last!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its fun and adictive but it wouldnt let me update so i had to delete the game and re-install it :( so i lost all my progress.
1594203334|1.0|I was really excited about reading this book.  I started out liking it, even enjoying it and recommending it to friends...and then the further I got into this book, I realized how one sided this woman was. She is pretty much an American who is so stuck up and wants to be French that she puts down anything that &#34;American's&#34; do, and boosts about what the French do.  In all honesty, it just makes the French sound so stuck up--not wanting to play with their kids to let them know their &#34;place in the world&#34;  I hated that.  I don't think it's good to be a helicopter parent, but I never want to be one who just sits back and watches my kids from afar while I have my coffee and just observe from afar.  No way! that's not want parenting is about, it's about enjoying the time with your kids and teaching them and helping them grow into good people.  This book is horrible.  Honestly, this is the first review i've ever written on Amazon.  That's how much I disliked this book and what it stands for.  Don't waste your time like I did.  AWFUL!
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book!!!!!! I t was amazing! I would read it again and again forever!!!! READ THIS BOOK PLEASE!!!!!!!
B009PLKPMS|4.0|I really love the first track and some of the others are good but some of the music I am not so keen on
B008K8VDPU|5.0|So I was looking for a piano app to practice my chords & learn how to play more when I didn't have a keyboard in front of me to actually play. Luckily, I found this! Even though not the whole piano can fit on the screen at once, you can swipe to play the different tones - fell in love!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Lots of fun, and my girlfriend even enjoys it (maybe more than I do) and she has somewhat of an inversion to games and technology in general (prefers actual books over a Kindle Fire and see's my iPhone as pointless because phones are for calls, not games). There is no need to purchase any in-app items, but as it's a free game, it wouldn't hurt to spend $1 or $2 if you had the desire.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|It was really fun to play and is every interesting of a mystery it makes you want to keep going no matter what
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the trilogy, although the first book is the best in my opinion. Still, it's important to &#34;finish&#34; the story and I am content with how it all played out.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is a lot of fun on my down time. My four year old loves it. The graphics are very good.....just an all around good game
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved the book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fiction and isn't looking for anything too serious. Sure there are a few plot holes and inconsistencies, but if you just enjoy it for what it is, you will not be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Um.... hey you guys me names Lina me Irish um this game wonderful!! Fun excitin' and crazy......the games bombin'.  Have the game on me Kindle Fire itself! I really recommend it.....4 stars cause some of the eggs are impossible to get
B00BHMF578|5.0|Super good movie.  Couldn't have been a better pick for the Oscars.<br />I thought the supporting cast was excellent. Hate that Ben Affleck didn't get an oscar nod though for directing.<br />He is quite good.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|it's what I expected, quick shipping 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 1 2 3 4 5
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Loved this book. Can't wait to read another one by this wonderful author. I love the way she always has a twist to her books.
B00003OSSL|5.0|This is one of my favorite videos and wanted a dvd for future viewing.  The dvd was ordered.  It arrived withing a few days and was as advertised.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really fun for me and all my sister's, but they should honestly expand the days for getting the characters for Rome or Brazil. Other then that it's a really fun game and I hope they keep coming up with new themes!
0307346617|4.0|The book was a fast read; one that I could not put down. if you like the 'Walking Dead', you will love this book -- though it has a happier ending. It is written in somewhat of the style of Cornelius Ryan's the Longest Day (if you remember that one), with a lot of interviews reflecting back on the war.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|Spirits of the Western Sky \\"is the new studio album by Justin Hayward, historical voice, front-man and guitarist of The Moody Blues, the legendary rock band, still active.<br />Were years that both the group and the same Justin, engaged in continuous successful world tours, there giving away the joy of a new job, but the wait was not in vain, for \\"Spirits of the Western Sky\\" is a great album .<br />Recorded between Genoa, in studies of good Alberto Parodi, sound engineer and also producer and Nashville, where they recorded three songs in \\"bluegrass\\" style! that are truly amazing. Other special features worth mentioning are the 'orchestration of some songs, by Anne Dudley, now famous for having participated in the sound track of the film \\"Les Miserables\\" and the end of the CD an incredible remix of \\"Out there somewhere\\" The Moody Blues of course sung by Hayward-style \\"techno\\"!<br />Apart from the bold and unexpected digressions sound, almost all of the album returns to the atmosphere of soft rock, typical of the author and his legendary group.<br />Particularly noteworthy ballads \\"Someday One Day\\" and \\"Lazy Afternoon\\", the first orchestrated by Anne Dudley, above.<br />With \\"On the road to love\\" we are dealing with a small masterpiece, again with country rock sound unusual to Justin Hayward, but understandable since the song composed and interpreted with the help of Kenny Loggins, another famous name.<br />Among the pieces in style \\"bluegrass\\", recorded with the participation of famous musicians in Nashville, we note the revival of \\"Broken Dream\\" a beautiful melodic song originally included in previous album \\"The view from the hill.\\"<br />The main story, what we would call the 'single' is undoubtedly the first entitled \\"In Your Blue Eyes\\", very pleasant, with a chorus that is imprinted.<br />Ultimately an album honest, nice, registered with joyful participation of the author and his collaborators.<br />The musical story of Justin Hayward (Moody Blues and) continuoussteel giving good music and pleasant sensations for many years and we still hope in the future, when a new studio album for the group? (Giacomo aka Gian Antonio from Italy )
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read every book!  He needs to get with it, write another book!! I'll be first in line  I'll be watching for amazon to inform me
B0043RSK3K|4.0|somewhat a rehash of current events, but well documented on some very interesting historic events; the details of those events are fascinating.
B007JRUCGO|5.0|My toddler, now 19 months, began demanding this movie long before she could speak words.  We tried the original Happy Feet and a lot of other DVD's, but this was the only movie she really loved for most of her first year and a half.  We now all know the script almost by heart, and we love it.  In my opinion, it's a better movie than Happy Feet one, and it ranks much better than almost all of the kids' movies out there.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great series, very inventive and suspenseful, good actors, the plot line holds up well.  If you liked X Files, you're gonna love this.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I got this as the free app of the day and what caught my interest were all the reviews that went on and on about how scary this game is.  I enjoy creepy so I gave it a shot. So far I have played the very first level &quot;The Road&quot; in day mode. The controls are very difficult to get the hang of but by the time I made it to the end of the road I had a little better handle on it... not much but a little. Now I got to the end of the road and thought I would see what was on the other side of the hill because I needed one more sign. However, I walked right thru that hill and completely off the grid. I was just floating out there in white nothingness. I only needed one more sign and I couldn't make my way back in the game. Isn't that a b*itch!
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I LOVE this movie - I stayed away from watching it since it came out as the name just didn't draw me to it. HOWEVER, I'm sooo glad I finally broke down and watched it! I highly recommend watching it if you love good acting, a beautiful script and story line, and a positive message.
B007REV4YI|5.0|The best. Can't beat it.  Loved it. Great. Awesome. Exciting. More than words can describe. Don't know what I did before this movie.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|I liked the style of music on this album and the wonderful singing of Amy Winehouse.  I would recommend this album highly.
0151003084|5.0|This book is quite morbid, so don't expect to read it to a 5 year old. With that said it is educational and entertaining for young and old. There were a few words I had to look up in the dictionary and some of the illustrations are really chilling. The book came with a few smears and smudges on the cover (nothing a good wiping down didn't take care of). Besides the smudges I am overall very pleased with the book!
B0017ANAZO|5.0|This was sort of a different movie.  I loved the actresses in it but it wasn't as good as I thought it would be.  I also purchased the older one from 1939 to compare.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app it's  fun and addictive :)!!!!! I cant take my eyes off it!!!!!!!you should get the app you will love it!!!!!:)
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|This was a gift to my daughter.  She just loves all Wizard of Oz stories and movies.  I am helping her fill out her collection of videos
B001H1SVO8|5.0|Watch the movie first, so you dont ruin the surprise. But then read the book. It goes much deeper into the characters. Both are fantastic.
B0008ENICU|5.0|I haven't watched this yet but plan to soon.  I purchased this to compare w/the newer 2008 version and see difference.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My daughter statesmen watching Downton Abby and it quickly became one of my favorite shows on TV.  Finally something other than mindless dribble that passes for entertainment.  The Brita have the magic!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|In detail and overall, this is a 'Do Not Miss' kind of television series.  An Entertaining Murder Mystery that is Smart, Funny, and Intriguing.  Think of a British version of House (Yes, Hugh Laurie is also British, but that doesn't count) because Holmes is brilliant, cocky, a smart ass, and totally insane.  You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes to agree that this is one of the best shows available on television.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely loved this season. Great show. Sad we have to wait for so long for the next season :(
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great Bond movie that shows him climbing back up after a fall. I highly recommend it. Amazing villain by the way.
0316017930|3.0|Gladwell is a good author and always provides a thought provoking experience.  What more can be said about this book ????
0399256385|5.0|My 1 year old son loves this book, we read it several times a day and before bed!  He loves to flip up the flaps, he loves Where's Spot too, 2 of our fave books!!
0765325950|5.0|Any fan of the series will definitely love this book... It was so fast paced and awesome in every way, I could hardly put it down!
0786891416|1.0|Could not finish this book,  stopped reading at about pg 24.  My comments are the same as other 1 star reviews  with this added remark: The profanity used in  this is not acceptable  I  lost count of the number of curses etc in the first 24 pages.  that in itself made the characters unbelievible.  bad language was not used in the show and in my opinion it shows really poor taste filling a book with faul language without forewarning so a reader can make a informed decision as to whether they want to expose themselves to the vaulgarity.  I wish there were rating system for books
0062014536|3.0|I loved the other two books in the series and could not wait for this book to be published.  I eagerly began reading and really enjoyed the book until it hit the last two chapters.  I don't know if her publisher gave her a page limit or if she was rushed to get it published, but the whole entire series just came fizzling to an end.  It remains so open ended that I feel that I have no closure at all.  There was an attempt to tie up some loose ends, but overall, I am very disappointed with the rush to the finish.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|great game for the kids and adults fun for the whole family I like that it is glitches free to
B009NPA3MS|4.0|Good, but this album lacks replay interest for me, especially given that the best songs have already been overplayed in the pop market.  If you're a Dave Matthews fan, you'll be amazed at how similar Phillip is at times.  To me, if you get 2-3 good listens out of an album it's a decent entertainment deal, so I'd still recommend the album and I look forward to his next.
0812984412|2.0|Resuming the story plot is no easy task. Ask anyone who has read it. Basically, it is a collection of six stories that are set in different places; different times, different genres and that each feature a different main character. The first 5 stories are divided in halves with the 6th story being the only undivided one. As you read on, you move forward in time until you reach the bending point (aka the 6th story) and start moving backward in time, in order to read the second half of every story, finishing each in turn.<br /><br />Although I truly admire and applaud the author for his effort and creativity, I must admit that I have mixed feelings about his novel.<br /><br />I can't say that I truly dislike it, as some of the character and stories did hit a certain cord for me. For example, I particularly enjoyed the stories entitled \\"Half-lives: the first Luisa Rey mystery\\" and \\"The ghastly ordeal of Timothy Cavendish\\" They were written in styles I usually am attracted and seemed to me to be best build up. I also liked their colorful and resourceful characters and the fast-pace of their story plot.<br /><br />As for the other stories, something just didn't hit the mark for me; either it being the genre, the style, the story plot and even sometimes the main character.<br /><br />Moreover, the link between the stories was loose and made me wish at times that there was none. Even now, I find it difficult to understand its importance and significance:<br /><br />* Is it the fact that the whole book seems to be a critic of some sort on slavery and the disparity between social classes?<br />* Or does the book somehow critic humanity's perpetual desire to achieve absolute power through different means and how it affects the rest of society?<br /><br />Even the relationship between the title of the book and its contents makes very little sense to me.<br /><br />I do believe that I might have liked to book more should the stories have been completely separated from one another. I think they would have worked better taken individually instead of as a whole, which is just confusing.<br /><br />As to whether or not, this will be my first and last incursion into the works of David Mitchell is still open for discussion.<br /><br />For more on this book and others, visit my blog at :<br /><br />ladybugandotherbookworms.blogspot.com
B0084B5TK8|4.0|A little too much boring dialog plus old english can be a little difficult to decipher but overall nice change from the movie versions
0316228532|2.0|Even though I kept in mind that this was Rowling's first adult novel and that she was entitled, just like any other first time author, to make mistakes, I must admit that I didn't particularly enjoy reading it. Moreover, I kept putting it down and finding myself excuses to do anything but read it.<br /><br />The one good thing I have to say about this book is that this is mainly the story of the people of Pagford. This is where the strength of the J.K. Rowling as we have come to know her in the \\"HP\\" series, is. Her characters, although numerous, all bring their contribution to the story and help it move forward as they evolve and follow their paths, whether for better or worse. They are all of them distinct in their own way. I particularly liked her teens, which as we know seems to be her forte. Although her adults are also well built, at the end of the day you feel naturally drawn to these teens and their lives, especially in my case to the central teen character, Krystal Wheedon who leaves a lasting impression event after you're done reading the book.<br /><br />Now what I didn't really like is the fact that the story, although mainly about the characters, remains difficult to follow and the pacing might have a lot to do with it. The pacing here is that of our normal lives where some days are over packed with activities or action and others where nothing really important happens. It is okay in real life, but in a book, it makes the reading tedious and I got easily bored. Should the book have been shorter, it might have worked, but here the length creates a dragging effect and some scenes were definitely too long and even, at times, unnecessary.<br /><br />Moreover, Rowling tries to recreate here the likes of our society in its every detail, but to a smaller scale, making the book heavier and denser that it should be. She tries to treat every subject, ending up, at times, by only scratching the surface. Though, I have to applaud her for using crude language and exposing at times, something raw and dark. She does not shy away from what we all know to be the truth.<br /><br />All in all, I believe the author might have tried to put too much in one book and that a more thorough editing process might have solved the problem by making the book shorter and lighter. Let's all hope that this will be the case in her next book.<br /><br />For more on this book and other reviews, visit my blog at<br /><br />ladybugandotherbookworms.blogspot.com
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I loved the way the author used authentic photos throughout the book to tell his story. It was very imaginative and the descriptions made it easy to place yourself into his peculiar world. Great read for an escape from the norm.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Its one of the best scary movies I have seen, it was funny, hilarious, lots of action, and the whole family enjoyed it.
B000YJ6736|3.0|A story about a woman who is a cold fish and a guy who falls in love with her. Interesting at times but certainly not a feel-good story.
B008CJ0KBU|4.0|I heard this was compared to Buffy but I didn't really get a Buffy vide though Bo and Kenzi can quip with the best of them. What I liked was all the fairy lore and the relationship between Bo and Kenzi. They are so adorable together and it's great to watch them go from strangers to best friends. Kenzi really is just awesome; she is sort of like the audience reacting to everything that is happening except funnier. I love whenever her and Hale are onscreen together. Right after I finished S1 I got S2 so yeah I enjoyed the show.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Interesting plot, predictable to th end.  Wife is convicted of murder she didn't commit but there is always the question of her guilt introduced in the opening scene during which she disagrees with a woman after much goading from her.  Russel Crowe's character appeals and determines he cannot win and his only option is to break her free.  He fumbles around and finally get is correct.The movie is entertaining but does not have many unexpected twists or turns.
B003L77GGK|3.0|I didn't really enjoy S6 but I had S1-5 so I figured I had to have it to complete my collection. I found the plots to be sort of all over the place and there were only a handful of episodes I actually enjoyed; I hated Soulless!Sam with a fiery passion so that ruined a lot for me, as well as what happened to Castiel near the end. Over all it was a pretty meh season in my humble opinion.
B004RKXNDU|4.0|Probably my favorite of all the so-called George Smiley novels, Tinker, Tailor has been a joy to read time and again. If it were not on Kindle, my copy would be be well worn and thumbed by now.<br /><br />I think the best part of the book is the feeling outside of the margins of a country and service that are in a state of flux and trying to find direction in a world that seemed, at the time, new. While its true the Cold War was still in full swing, Britain, at least in this book, has lost it's standing as the world's super power and is still trying to find a vital role to play as an inferior to America.<br /><br />I also love Smiley's ingenuity. He's a thinking man's thinking man in a service that values looks over actual intellectual integrity.
145210655X|5.0|I gave this as a Christmas/birthday present to by boyfriend, a big Star Wars fan. The illustrations are adorable and very humorous. It is a cute book and will be the cause of many smiles for decades to come.
B000AP04KQ|5.0|I have always loved this movie and when my ex-boyfriend and I broke up, he asked me if he could have my DVD.  I gave it to him, like a dummy!  Had to buy it again, as this is a must-have in my movie collection :)
0062200909|5.0|If you like &#34;making of&#34; type of things in even the slightest sense, this book should be in your collection. There are a lot of great images, photos, drawings and more with notes written by the designers and other crew of them movie. I really enjoy this book, seeing all the steps and processes they went through for each character's look are of particular interest to me.
B003F48E4W|5.0|Had to get the DVD version of this flick, as I still have my old VHS version and wanted to upgrade
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Definitely &#34;can't put it down&#34; read.  I enjoyed the author's writing style.  I felt like I was walking down Himmel Street experiencing the same threats, fears and day-to-day struggles of Liesel Meminger.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|I was a little disappointed in this one. It's more like old home week with all the old bad  @ss actors from back in the day. A few good one liners but not as good as the first.
B0096PYUE2|2.0|This does not work on my kindle, as a matter of fact no flash player works on my Kindle. Shame on you Amazon...
B00B2V66VS|5.0|So cool I can not put it down<br />It is the best game ever I love the game  it is so asome and the save me is very helpful
0345803485|5.0|I love it, very interesting, just met all my expectations, I can't stop reading it!! Highlty recommended to buy it
0385504225|1.0|Mr Brown ought to retire from this genre. His poorly researched novels centered around secret societies and the rewriting of history are truly unbelievable (i.e not believable) and sometimes right down ridiculous.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Looks great. Has many more functions than I will ever need or use. The measurement converter will probably get used quite a bit since I enjoy cookiing and making deserts, and some of the recipes I try are from the UK and Europe.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|The book talks about in depth about why people often say my partner has changed or everything seemed so perfect what happened? The Five Love Language book to the rescue.
1616960922|4.0|This is well written and has a great plot. This a story to be read in a single session. Quite thought provoking.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The backpack has great features for its price and size. Highly recommend it if you want something small and functional
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is a really cool game I like it alot and I really like the new things that they installed.
B009NOVCTM|4.0|A collection of their best; what's not to like? I was shocked by omission of &#34;Let It Bleed&#34;, otherwise OK!
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I downloaded this game for my iPad and it is great so far. So I went ahead and get it for my daughter's tablet running android (Nabi2). Unfortunately, the application did not work properly. Just by touching the screen, without even swiping forward, the character jumps forward all the time. So it cannot turn right/left and cannot duck. All it does is jumping, ruining the game experience. You may think the issue may reside in my device. However, I have TR 1 & 2, and also the Brave edition and all of them work great, but not the Oz edition. Hopefully there will be a fix available soon.
B001I45UFC|5.0|This is the first book Lewis wrote about the magical world of Narnia. It is in an alternate dimension from ours, reachable through an enchanted wardrobe in an old country house. How 4 children discover the world is just the first part of this classic children's adventure. When they all do enter the world they find they are in place where all the creatures who make up our mythology are real and where a witch has cast a spell so that it is always winter but never Christmas. Their coming, though, has been foretold and sets in motion a confrontation between the witch and the rightful King of Narnia, a wise but dangerous lion named Aslan. How he breaks the spell over the land is alternately scary, heartbreaking and rousing.

B0019M06JS|5.0|I own CDs of many many female Brazilian artists but Eliane is on the top of my list.  Her lovely vocals are effortless and still unique.  She brings new life to Brazilian classics, American standards and pop hits.  But its her keyboard artistry that can stand head and shoulders with the best contemporary Brazilian artists to date.  A must own CD.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am very happy with the microshell folio case it does exactlly what it was sold for.it protects my kindle and keeps it scratch free
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|Once you start playing it it's fun. But once you get to a certain part it tells you that you have to pay  to continue. I'm sorry but if it's on the free games the whole thing should be free. The demos like this should be in the paid games so you can play it to see if you like it before you buy it.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|Not a true \\"period\\" piece but visually rich Russian society before Marx. At the heart, a love story, a forbidden love, love story. All acting is superb. Very evenly paced drama with no real violence or raw language. Might be too slow for some. A date movie? Yes. Shared spousal unit viewing?? Certainly this is not a manly man movie as just not enough action or sordid sex scenes. If you like drama, this one is a decent enough drama. Oh, I did not read the book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a good game and verry realistic it is just an overall good game and fun to play with friends
B001O4FGG4|5.0|I LOVE this movie! I lent it out to some friends, and guess what? Right! They never returned it, so I just re-ordered it. I love the price..very affordable, got here in good time, and no damage at all! very cool. Thank You!!

B009MO5960|3.0|I wanted to add this to my collection of Resident Evil's, unfortunately, I wasn't paying attention, and I ordered the Blue-Ray, which I cannot play on anything I have, so I just gave it away as a gift and re-ordered it from the buyer. The buyer was most helpful in explaining the difference. Lesson learned. I'd buy from this buyer again.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The best book next to Percy Jackson book 1 so I hope to see the same in the next book!
B000YPUF9W|5.0|What can I say? The price was right. My DVD arrived in a timely manner, and in good shape. No cracked jewel case like sometimes happens to DVD's or CD's. I'm happy camper! Great movie! Thanks.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|Well, I knew this final book was due out and had an auto order on my Kindle, I read the first 2 books last year and really didn't have it fresh in my mind when it showed up available to read. I have read a ton of books in between and I have to say I forgot how awesome an author Lauren Oliver is! Her style is like no other and I am still reading this final book and fully loving every page, I actually am spending too<br />much time worrying about the page number and that I'm getting too close to the end!!<br />Hope you keep writing more stories with your fabulous style, and I can't wait to read them all, please keep them coming!

B00821OUT6|4.0|Revolutionaries vs. reactionaries.  An amalgam (if not a mish-mosh) of Red Dawn, Battlestar Galactica (heavy dose of BSG), Independence Day, Invasion of the Body Snatchers—they even have something that resembles the Replicators from Stargate SG-1—with a liberal dose of Lost.  The main character is a disaffected sort; the heroine could pass for Evangeline Lilly’s sister; there’s a Sawyer—even Terry O’Quinn is in the mix.  So nothing new under the sun.<br /><br />But still, it’s entertaining, and here’s why: First, the aliens are imaginative—they don’t look anything like humans—even the humanoids don’t—and there’s a language barrier.  But the main reason is, the commanding officer is not a two-dimensional martinet.  He has baggage and motivations, and they color what he does and how he does it.  And the commander is not the star of the show.<br /><br />The star is Noah Wylie, who plays Tom Mason.  Before the aliens invaded, Mason was a history professor.  Now he is the moral conscience of a group of freedom fighters, both keeping up the will to fight, while maintaining the “human” perspective.  Curiously, even though Mason is a professor turned fighter, in the first two seasons there has been no reference to Stonewall Jackson or Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain.<br /><br />So the series is not unique or innovative, and it has resorted to some hackneyed BEM (bug-eyed-monsters) clichés, but it is entertaining.  The characters get developed at a reasonable pace, and the dialogue is decent.<br /><br />But here is something that Falling Skies keeps bringing back to me: Said through Tom Mason’s character, this group of freedom fighters is determined to take back the world from the aliens.  They will fight to the death, or until the aliens are gone.  They fight with a sense that Earth is their birthright.  And Tom Mason keeps bringing up American examples of this fighting spirit—not the least the Revolutionary War.  But there is no reference to the point that America has most often been on the invading side of that equation.  I think it’s helpful to have a show that keeps us aware of what the oppressed must feel like.

0811879542|5.0|One of those books that can be a little different each time you read it to your kids.  love it.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Yahoo periodically will  not allow me to send emails.  It is very stressful because I own my own business and when I can't send out information then I cannot communicate with my clients.  Asking for help from Yahoo is worthless.  The last timet his happened they sent me an email asking me to submit to them numerous steps I had taken to correct the problem.  THAT is NOT customer service by any means.  I am moving my account to gmail.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I used to read every grisham book but a few years ago got tired of them. Big business is always corrupt and evil, blah blah blah... but this one was good more back like the old days and I thoroughly enjoyed it
B00AJLHUA8|5.0|First, Ethan Hawke gives another terrific performance in this very scary film.  I was on the edge of my seat and even had to take a couple breaks just to calm down.  Highly recommeded!
B0027MJU00|5.0|This would be a good gift for someone who loved \\"Gone Girl\\".  It's an easy, conversational read, just like \\"Gone Girl\\".  Although I'm having a tough time liking the main character - in \\"Gone Girl\\", the main characters were flawed but likeable.
1451696191|4.0|I absolutely loved this book! It shows you what it's really like being a teenager and what struggles we go through as kids in high school. A must-read for anyone who has struggled in school.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|You've no doubt heard people rave in book reviews, that they couldn't put it down.  I am here to make the same statement.  Couldn't. Put. It. Down.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I mean, am I reviewing the show or the product?  It's a DVD.  It worked.<br /><br />The show, on the other hand, is amazing.  I liked being able to binge watch the last four episodes of the season at once.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Just look at how many great reviews it got, and so few bad ones.  This is money well spent for sure.
B008Y1YK9Y|3.0|The first in the series was the best, of course. The first usually is. This one tied up some loose ends. I am glad I finished the series. I like both Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith. Both are superb actors.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Excellent book! I was a little in doubt about a story told by a dog, but a friend recommended it highly so I decided to give it a try. The story seemed to drag a little bit partway through but soon turned around, and by the end Enzo the dog was tugging on my heartstrings and had me reaching for the tissue box. And I appreciated the wisdom in Denny's driving theory that &#34;the car goes where the eyes go.&#34; That's a good life lesson for us all.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|I was hooked by this book from the first few pages....the ending was such a let down, I was very disappointed.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Easy to play and if you like mahjong then you will like playing it.  Will be addicting.  Good game for free but does occasionally freeze.
B007REV4YI|4.0|This completed my 50 years of Bond Movies. I am very pleased whit the aquisition. I would recommend this to my freinds and family.
030758836X|1.0|Gone Girl held my interest from the get-go. Cleaverly written with lots of twists. I couldn't put the book down!  And then the ending....... what can I say?  It was awful!  A HUGE disappointment.  Felt like you were cheated out of the cherry and whipped cream on a ice cream sundae!  I kept flipping through the pages of the acknowledgments thinking, if I turn the next page there will be something titled Epilogue or And Now the Conclusion.  I have never written a rewiew before but this book hit such a sour note with me that I needed to express to future readers how this ending will leave you feeling empty.  Read this book knowing you will be entertained only to have your climax come crashing down on you as you read, what you won't realize, is the ending.
B004QX07G4|5.0|Very entertaining. I have told everyone who has asked me what I'm reading that they should read this book. I laughed my self to tears.
B008602KQI|5.0|I'm sure most of you have seen this movie, I chose it because it's a movie I can easily watch more than once,
B004T4LUPW|4.0|a few glitches but very worth it!<br />my husband and i use it to keep track of all our activities and<br />appointments, work schedules, etc.
0062124293|5.0|The most important thing to know about this book is that it probably won't be what you expect. I was surprised by things including: Caitlin Moran's frank discussions of all aspects of being a woman; how she defined feminism; and how completely and totally hilarious some of this book was. All of her philosophical musings on feminism and being a woman are tied together very nicely by stories she shares of her life. These are both the funniest bits and the thing that imposes chronological order on what would otherwise be a series of distinct essays. For a good idea of the topics and the tone of the book, I'd recommend the goodreads summary.<br /><br />I don't have a ton to say about this one except that I loved it. There was at least one chapter that I spent completely breathless I was laughing so hard. Nearly every page there was something so funny or paragraph that expressed something I'd felt so perfectly, that I wanted to run and share the book with someone immediately. I definitely wouldn't share it with just anyone though, as the language often well beyond what most people would be comfortable using in front of their grandmother.<br /><br />I should also mention for those of you scared off by a book about feminism, that the author's brand of feminism certainly didn't conform to my stereotypes. To me, feminism mostly sounds out-dated, largely because I've been fortunate enough to never encounter discrimination in the work place. However, I think she makes some very sound arguments that feminism is still both good and necessary. Obviously you can decide how you feel about it yourself, but I don't think anyone would deny her arguments are compellingly written and thought provoking. I don't know if a male reader would find it as enjoyable or interesting as I did though, so if you know of a good review by a male reader or are a male reader who's  read the book, please share!
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|It has the similar actor roles and similar story to the original Schwarzenegger flick.  It has new exciting detailed imagery.  I liked it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is a wonderful 5 min-at-a-time challenge. The attack mode is intense and outstanding! What fun for all ages.
B00AKKS278|4.0|This was a tremendous read and I look forward to starting my 30 day challenge and beyond. There were several areas I highlighted for future reference that will help me grow in both my personal and professional life. The only aspect that annoyed me and hurt the flow of the book was the constant reference to the title in the text. It felt like a salesman trying to sell me his product.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was action packed with love, fights, adventure and laughter from the beginning. Loved every second of it. A must read.

B003TXSF5C|5.0|Wonderful book<br />Wish there was a deeper coverage of positive and negative energy and a more detailed explanation on the no boundary scenario for Big Bang
B0091REZMW|3.0|Like the game. My only complaint is I get stuck at certain points. Can't do this cause you don't have that, not enough energy, too many missions. Other than this, it's a good app for its type.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey rocks!! This is amazingly entertaining and gripping series. Season 3 was a jaw dropper and I cant wait for Season 4 to begin!!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This was a nice alternative to the more expensive cases.I liked the quality and the protection which it provides to the Kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|fun, whatever. good with food, good on toilet, good in bed (like me). take it from me, kids; this game is okay.
B0022W6L6G|5.0|Do I even have to write anything about this??  If you don't have this album you need it.  It is one of those difinitive items that any collection must have.  This band wrote part of the history of rock and roll.  Must have.
B009GEAPYW|5.0|Awesome movie smooth glitch free playing with good sound. The movie is not for kids younger than 13 IMO but great none the less.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This is a great show - excellent acting.  I love the historical elegance.  Did not like that they are already killing off characters.
1608870081|5.0|It doesn't have many pages but the cutouts are well done and have a nice variety of scenes from the books/films. There are assorted descriptions on the pages of the items. The die cut pop-ups are really nice.

B003HARV98|5.0|Every single song speaks to me, I love Marina. She writes her own songs & is an amazingly talented person with a happy dance vibe in a lot of her songs. My daughter & I love to dance to her music!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My daughter showed me the game for her I-phone. I downloaded it for my kindle fire. You can purchase things with real money but if you have a little patience you can play for free. It is a little bit like farmville; but you breed dragons. Fun Fun.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series had my eyes trained until the very last word. From the narration through katniss' eyes to the pain she had to endure Suzanne Collins has created an honest and realistic character and a world that resembles great creativity and realism.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This Harry Potter Blu-ray collection was better than I hoped, I got the British version!!! The picture and sound quality is amazing and the price was the best feature/ If you haven't purchased this yet, DO IT NOW!
B009ME47H2|5.0|I have had this app for quite some time now on my Nexus 7 and it has come in handy quite a few times. Controls are very straight forward and simple, and recording quality is excellent as far as simple voice recorders go.
0547884591|5.0|Amazing! I love Timothy Ferris and his no-nonsense approach to everything he does. To heck with what conventional wisdom says, he actually explores the shortcuts and natural approaches to everything, whether it be learning to swim or cooking the perfect steak. He should be the new spokesperson for Dos Equis.
0062238868|5.0|It was very inlighting as to what our troops have to face every day, face to face with an enemy who through their religious beliefs  are trying to inflict up on we Christians there ancient almost first to second century belliefs upon us.
B002W24E0G|5.0|All sad when a young artist with some much promise leave us too soon.<br />I really enjoy the album and I fell lucky to have it.

B003TSEL7S|3.0|Honestly I didn't see Jason and Thalia being brother and sister<br />I didn't think Jason's tattoo could make the gods change to there Roman aspects .
B000001ZS5|3.0|This music became monotonous after a short while.  It was probably better in the 70's and 80's than in the 2000's
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I love the kindle chargers especially for my smartphone because of the length. Although they last for quite a while, eventually the coating starts breaking a bit. Still a great product, perhaps a different formula will make the coating more durable.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|When I read the book I hadn't seen the movie so I couldn't compare which I liked best.  I can only say it was a great read. I will now plan on seeing the movie. Hope it is as good as the book.  The book was so engaging you didn't want to put it down. You will laugh and you will cry.  This is one of those books when you get close to the end you want to save it for the right moment where you can savor every very last word!  Then you can set back and think about the story.  You will then come to the realization Mr. Sparks just gave you a gift.  You will love it!
B000059MEK|5.0|I love Daft Punk. Album is great, and the item came quick even though I bought it during the hectic holiday season.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|So far it is interesting. Music is slightly creepy. If you think hidden object games are boring then don't download it.
B0029NY9YO|5.0|I bought this movie as a gift and he loves it. It also arrived quickly. I am a satisfied customer.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Read it in one setting.  Mental illness, no matter to what degree, can be  dehibilitating...to all involved.<br />If nothing else, it should remind each of us not to be judgemental of others.....you never know what 's on their plate or in their mind..  or what dreams they  can actually  make come true.
B001MTENOC|5.0|I loved this book but I don't think everyone is ready for it.  If you don't like it after the first 50 pages, put it away and look at it in five years.  :-)
0062014536|3.0|Loved Delirium, the beauty of Lena and Alex's love for each other was so heart-breakingly true. The end where Alex sacrificed himself for Lena's freedom proved the deep bond of their love.<br /><br />Pandemonium is a mourning process. We know how much Lena misses Alex, how he was wrenched from her, and his almost certain death afterwards both kills her inside and fuels her passion for living. I was glad for her that Julian was able to help her heal, to know love again. Given the circumstances, she could hardly be blamed for entering into another relationship.<br /><br />When Alex resurfaced at the end of Pandemonium, I waited with bated breath for A WHOLE YEAR to find out how this story works out.<br /><br />Without spoiling the end for anyone, the book starts out very well, with expected tension, not just between Alex and Lena, but also between Lena and Julian. As the story evolves and the group in the Wilds has to fight for each other's survival, undercurrents of emotions keep the tensions alive. Although a lot of this book focuses on the relationships between Lena and Alex, Lena and Julian, Julian and Alex, and even Lena and Annabelle, it is almost too much ground to cover satisfactorily, in the way that the author mapped out the telling of the story.<br /><br />Every other chapter is told from the point of view of Hana, and while this helps move the story along and helps us see how her life plays a role in the greater picture, in retrospect, I feel that too much time was spent on Hana's point of view. We could have gotten a few less chapters of Hana, and instead gotten a few more chapters of resolution at the end.<br /><br />I was happy to see Gracie return, and know that for her, there is a happy-ish ending. However, I got the feeling that at the end of this book the author is just trying to wrap up as many loose ends as possible, almost appeasingly so. But, in reality, I was left with more questions than feelings of resolution.<br /><br />What happens to Lu, Fred, and Hana? And Melanea?<br />What happens with Lena and Julian?<br />What happens with Coral and Alex?<br />What happens with the revolution? (I can't help but get the feeling that tanks are going to roll in any moment to wipe out all the resistance at the wall.)<br /><br />Because I love this story so much, I want to give the book 5 stars, but in reality, I was left unsatisfied. So, 3 stars for the superb writing, - 2 stars for the unresolved feeling.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver, you are a fantastic writer, and the overall theme of the Delirium series is a very deep and meaningful one. Really amazing. Thank you for all of it. Please consider writing a fourth book. It's not over.red, and Hana?

Really amazing. Thank you for all of it. Please consider writing a fourth book. It's not over.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I mean really? Feel very disappointed in this ending. Was not really into the going back and forth from Hana and Lena either. Wished we could have maybe had it from Alex's POV? Just really surprised it ended so abruptly. Just left everyone hanging, no closure on anything.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I  have to admit they did a great job on this one. I'm a fan of The Avengers and Josh Whedon anyway but I'm really pleased that they got it right. I am looking forward to the next installment.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed the first book-Beautiful Creatures, and this fun, twisting sequel did not disappoint. I am not sure which book to read next, but I suppose I will read the book about Link and his newly acquired abilities. Ridley and John...sounds like fun trouble!
B008VVT51U|5.0|I really like this movie! It catches your interest, it's a good story and I liked the characters. I got some good laughs and there are poignant moments ( not boo-hoo moments). I've watched it several times since I've had it and will watch it again, just to enjoy it all over again. Recommend it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Daniel Craig is my favorite actor to play Bond even ahead of Sean Connery and the script of this movie is so solid, all the actors are in top shape, Javier Bardem gives one of his best performance and of course Dame Judi Dench always great no matter how small or big is the part, Of all the James Bond movie franchise this is by far the best ever made.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a nice looking watch with easy to read, glow in the dark features.  The back is transparent so you can see the crazy mechanisms that make it run.  It is an automatic so you have to wear it every day, or put it in a winder (like a Diplomat) to keep it current.  But when it does stop the day and time are easy to adjust with just a few turns.  the watch is both sporty and dressy.
B008NAFU9A|4.0|Another interesting book by Rebecca Hamilton! I loved the Forever Girl, so I thought I'd give this one a try, and I'm glad I did.<br />Ophelia's story is one full of complications and heartache. A love that can never be because of their destiny... Or can it?<br />I can't wait to read more about the forever girls!<br /><br />If you haven't read The Forever Girl you can still read this novella as it's good enough to be a stand alone and if you decide to read the first book it will answer a lot of the questions that you'll have.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Have not had any issues with and I used this almost every day.  Works great for thos items that have an otter box case.  Quite strong and durable.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I LOVE this book! They are all Awesome! Great reading. Couldn't put the books down. A true love story with a happy ending. I love it!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved the book and how it ended. One of the best books I have read in a very long time
B0034G4P80|3.0|I'm one of those kids that read the original Thor comic book in the sixties by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee. I was a little bit afraid that my own experience with the original might make it difficult for me to like the film adaption.  However, I actually did enjoy this film. I think Kenneth Branagh did a good job overall in this adaption, not a fantastic job mind you, but a good job. The movie does feel like a real honest-to-goodness Thor movie.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what Asgard might look like in the live film compared to Kirby's cosmic splendors of the kingdom, but I did like the design and effects for the city of Asgard, so it worked for me.  Btw, I also really loved the costumes. As for the script, I liked it although Odin's last remarks weren't anything that was illuminating or surprising.<br /><br />On the actresses and actors:  some of the quality of acting isn't up to what it should be.  However, I really enjoyed Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston as Thor and Loki and thought they were both good choices for their parts.  I was also delighted to see the Warriors Three in the film. However, I wasn't as happy about the lack of content and development for their characters: Hogan (Tadanobu Asano) really has  nothing to say or talk about, Volstagg (Ray Stevenson) is not quite as weighty and as buffoonish as the rolling comic mass from the comic books (but that's okay), and Fandral (Joshua Dallas) doesn't have enough time or witty dialogue to bring forth his genuine swashbuckling mirth. The selection of those three, however, still made me happy that these characters were in the film and wish there were more time spent developing/deepening their personalities. I really liked Jaimie Alexander's Sif (hubba-hubba), but again we hardly get a chance to spend much time with them.<br /><br />Odin (Anthony Hopkins) voice seemed too soft and mild for me.  I always imagined Odin with a more bombastic or booming voice.  Ah well.<br /><br />Natalie Portman wasn't very interestingas Jane Foster -- but, as I recall it, Jane Foster in the comic book wasn't very interesting either.  The other actor (Stellan Skarsgård) and actress (Kat Dennings) seem to be in it only for the ride, and so they had very little drama or content to grasp in order to act out anything interesting in any manner or form.<br /><br />I gave the film three-out-of-five stars. I'm hoping in the next Thor movie we'll see more content and development from the side characters and not just only the leads
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really good book to read, liked how the events were entwined to make it very interesting. I would suggest it to everyone.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Haven't purchased a bad Zac Brown Band CD yet, and have had the pleasure of seeing them in concert here in San Diego. A driving rain and hail while they played in an outdoor amphitheater didn't pose any problem for these amazing musicians! We all were concerned that the rain might shock someone in the band, but Zac and the guys still charged out onto the exposed runway and rocked the house. Their proclamation of &#34;We're in this with you guys!&#34; just made the experience that much more fun. I'm not a country music fan, more of a Trop-Rock (Jimmy Buffett music) aficianoado, but Zac Brown Band crosses over for jjst about anyone's music tastes.
B004GHNIRK|1.0|Just too hard to get into....I'll watch the movie. Like a lot of  classic literature, this book is very &#34;wordy&#34;.
1451695195|5.0|I stumbled upon Dr. Raymond Moody's book &#34;Life After Life&#34; 35 years ago when I was a teenager who was confused, skeptical, and puzzled by organized religion and the significance of life.  I'm an avid reader and if there was a single book that transformed and guided me in life, it was that book.  When a friend of mine raved about &#34;Proof of Heaven,&#34; and I saw Dr. Moody's endorsement on the cover, I knew it would be good!<br /><br />Dr. Alexander has taken the concept from Dr. Moody's book and expanded  it in a comprehensive, thought provoking and sometimes even scientific manner.  It took tremendous courage for Dr. Alexander to share his near death experience, and I imagine he might be somewhat ostrasized from his pragmatic, dogmatic collegues.  However, Dr. Alexander has done a great service for those tired of the divisiveness and polarity of organized religion, and are interested in opening their minds and hearts to unconventional thought.  I hope this book finds its way into the hands of those who are seeking answers into the meaning of life, particularly young adults, who like me at 16,  was searching for a world of love, hope, unity and purpose.  Thank you, Dr. Alexander for sharing your tremendous experience!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Excellent start that gripped me intensely, however, the finish was a bit too &#34;simple&#34; for my taste; good read nonetheless. Perhaps a darker end would have been more fitting considering the cirqumstances.
B005LAII0I|5.0|it was worth the money still in good shape. such a cute movie.. Hastings always good pricing for used movies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Epic game! A very good game for all ages. It is fun to play it when I am bored. You can hop on trains while you are running away from some guys.
B002ZG983M|5.0|super value and super shipping speed.<br />this movie is a fun fantasy romp a la tropic thunder.<br />it will not please everyone...<br />but if it is your &#34;cup of tea&#34; , cant be beat!<br />enjoy!
B0057A6GA6|3.0|I really like the game but am a little fustrated with the lack of choices of weapons some screens get. I think since you went through all this trouble to pass a level you should be able to save your progress but theirs no save. and last once you get to a high level you should be able to save your weapons for future games as a bonus. kind of like what you earn stays with you regardless of level.<br />over all I had fun with this game as it is.
B0060MYK7G|5.0|This series gives you the feeling like you are watching a bit of actual history. The production is wonderful, the costumes are beautiful, the acting supurb and all in all watching it is a delight.
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|This movie left a bad taste in my mouth and had many gaffs from reallity.  Wouldnt recommend it to anyone
B000DWMN2S|4.0|My plumber recommended this film to me..he loved it! I found it very interesting and the essential messages universal of course..the acting was excellent and this film is a very &#34;different&#34; sideways look at the persecution of the Jewish population during WW ll. I was very glad that I saw it and also pleasantly surprised to discover that Elijah Wood has more talent than I had given him credit for before seeing this.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|i would recommend this to anyone who is interested in historical perspectives.  This was a gripping prespective of the condition of Iran at the time.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I love this calculator it helps me with problems I don&quot;t know  and also this calculator saves a lot more than others and it helps me in math.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A great series and study in the British class system.  Maggie Smith is wonderful.  She doesn't have to open her mouth to make me laugh but when she does, her lines are priceless!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Excellent little sharpener. I'm surprised it holds up as well as it does for the price. I take it with me camping for when I dull my fixed-blade. Works like a charm.
B00979JTWK|4.0|I see a couple of complaining reviews about the special, (looks as if it was shot last summer- it's &#34;Christmas&#34; in broadcast date (UK) only) but I found it to be pretty much up to the usual &#34;Downton&#34; standard and an episode worth watching. Dan Stevens three year contract was up and he wanted out- so the writers obliged him, shocked a few p epode with that one.<br />No need for an American &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; fan to buy this stand alone &#34;special&#34;- just buy the &#34;Original UK edition&#34; DVD or Blu ray sets, they include it and they're Region 1 playable on standard players with no problem. I've seen the DVD set and it's as clear, or better, a picture as the TV broadcast.
0061733199|5.0|Excellent book. Easy to read, logically ordered, simplistic overall while maintaining necessary/useful information. Covered and expounded upon the basics of survivalist training. Definitely satisfied.
B00A6VAW9W|5.0|Kenny Loggins has done it again. The songs are incredible especially Feelin Brave. This is surely the fisrt step in very successful relationship with Georgia Middleman and Gary Burr who amazingly sounds like Larry Stewart from Restless Heart fame. Great job Kenny!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Somehow I got a lot gems by updating it. Really good game I have two horses  Mac and Mic. Good game
B000SGSU58|4.0|I enjoy the twist at the end and the details all tied up at the end. A quick page turner that keeps you hooked till the end
B000089RVX|5.0|The cd was in great condition. thank you very much for the cd that was in really good shape. No sharachse to me seen.
0525478817|5.0|If I could give this book more than 5 stars I totally would. Holy hell it was fabulous. So amazing in fact that I almost became enraged at my grandmother for interupting my reading so I could get her some much needed groceries. I did not want to put it down, I read it in 1 day. Spoiler alert, this book will make you have emotions. You will care for these characters more than any others you've read in a long long time. And you will cry, if you don't it's possible you have no soul. I sobbed/bawled my way through the last 50 pages. My eyes were on fire (thanks mascara), my hair was soggy, and I'm pretty sure I was the epitome of beauty (not!). This book made me FEEL and I haven't had a book do that in a while. I literally cannot stop thinking about this book, it's just too good.<br /><br />I will attempt to decribe this book without giving too much away or making it sound depressing. The story follows Hazel, a sixteen year old girl with terminal cancer. Her best friends are her parents and she hasrelaxed into a routine that involves not doing much of anything. Her parents desperate to get her out of the house make her go to a cancer support group for kids and it is there that she meets Augustus. Augustus is in remission but his battle made him lose a leg. He doesn't dwell on it though, he uses his charm (and good looks) to befriend Hazel. In no time at all they're inseperable, they read the same books, help their friend Isaac get through the loss of his eyesight, and try to make the best out of being sick. I think I enjoyed this book so much because it isn't about the poor sick little cancer kid that needs to be pitied, this is the other side if the story, this is what it is really like for these kids living with cancer. They don't need to be pitied, they need to be understood.<br /><br />Again, this is a must read. It is without a doubt added to my list of all time favorites and I cannot wait to read his other works. Side note, for all you Hoosiers or Vonnegut lovers, there is a Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. reference in here. So it goes :)<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at: [...]Vonnegut, Jr. reference in here.

1455523550|3.0|This was a breeze to get through. One lazy Sunday and BAM it's down. Occasionally, I like to read a fast, no brainer, romantic book and this fit the bill. Nicholas Sparks has the ability to suck you in with his too good to be true romances and this is no exception.<br /><br />Katie is a girl running from a haunted past (aka abusive husband) and she lands in, Southport, a sleepy town thousands of miles away from her husband.  She tries to stay inconspicuous and under the radar but soon she attracts the attention of Alex, an attractive widower with two small children. Of course Alex is the most perfect of men and she succumbs to his good looks and manners, but what happens if her past catches up to her?<br /><br />Read to find out more. This is a perfect beach read, although not my favorite Nicholas Sparks novel (I do however plan on seeing the movie next month!)<br />[...] [...]
B008EKOO46|5.0|Like Daniel Boorstin's &#34;The Discoverers,&#34; Jared Diamond's &#34;The World Until Yesterday&#34; recasts myriads of facts, history, cultural touchstones, etc., so that one understands the world as a whole in a completely different way.  Accepted ideas about morality and justice, war & peace, children and the elderly, language, and even what we eat are turned upside-down as Diamond compares and contrasts tribal and state-based societies' views and practices in each area.  The revelations are often surprising, sometimes horrifying, but always enlightening.  As it dawned on me that our government's, society's, and culture's ways are relatively new in history, Diamond showed me again and again that the &#34;old ways&#34; that have served mankind for eons have much to teach us.
0316228532|3.0|It took me a while but I finally finished this bad boy. This was one of those books where I was immediately hooked, then lost interest for a while in the middle, and then got hooked again. There is a lot of back and forth and you have no clue how the story will end.<br /><br />And boy o boy, there is a lot to keep track of! The story follows a community's reaction to the untimely death of Barry Fairbrother, one of Pagford's councillors. As the story progresses the townspeople's different \\"hidden agendas\\" come to life. The story is viewed through about 20 of Pagford's citizen's eyes and sometimes it's hard to keep track of who's who, and who has biases against whom and so on and so forth. The good thing is that most of these characters are relateable on some level and the other ones? Well they're just fun to hate :)<br /><br />Part of me was disappointed that this was not Harry Potter, I know, I know, she's trying to break away from that and do her own thing, but it's soo new to me. One good thing is that her writing style is still the same and her words still have a magical, flowing quality about them.<br /><br />Overall, this book was different from anything I have read in a long long time. The concept may sound kind of droll (who cares about a small English town?) but it hooks you regardless and Rowling keeps you guessing til the very end. Who will fill Barry's seat on council? Will his agenda be dropped? Who is spilling Pagford's darkest secrets?<br /><br />This is one of those books that everyone is reading and you need to be in the know. So read it! And let me know what you think of JK Rowling's newest project!<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at: [...]
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the first of the Hunger Games series and this is the second time I've read it. It's suspenseful, well written, and the characters and plot are well developed throughout the books. You will want to read the second two as soon as you're done with the first. :)
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Literally could not put this bad boy down!! From the first page I was hooked. Nancy Pearl couldn't have endorsed a better novel (I knew she was an awesome librarian for a reason!). I absolutely cannot wait to see the movie adaptation of this. I just know it's going to be fantastic!<br /><br />Pat Peoples is convinced that if he gets in shape, reads more, and is kind to people then he can leave \\"the bad place\\" and end his \\"apart time\\" from his wife Nikki. He believes that as long as you work hard enough you will always get your happy ending/silver lining.<br /><br />Pat starts to learn the hard way that is not always the case. He returns from the mental institution to live with his family and while at home keeps a strict physical routine to get him in shape for Nikki. Lifting weights for many hours and jogging upwards of 10 miles everyday make him feel confident that he is on the right path to win Nikki back. He can't fathom why no one in his family will discuss Nikki with him but that doesn't deter him. Nothing does, not even beautiful, Tiffany, who begins to take an interest in him. Tiffany has problems of her own and soon these two form an interesting friendship. Soon he'll discover that he has to rely on his friends, family, Eagles football, his therapist, and Tiffany to get him through. Silver Linings aren't always what we think they are.<br /><br />Simply stunning, excellent character development. I fell in love with every character. Matthew Quick does a fantastic job getting into Pat's head and making his mental problems understandable. A tour de force in a culture that surrounds mental health with such stigma. I cannot recommend this book enough.<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at [...]
B006LSZECO|1.0|I read this because it was recommended by a friend. She also loved 50 Shades, which I read on her recommendation and also hated. I should have known - ha!<br /><br />Basically, if you are just looking for a page turner to waste a few hours, go for it. It will keep you captivated for most of the book and then leave you with the same emotions about humanity you would get from watching Jerry Springer. Essentially, &#34;whaaaat? That can't be for real.&#34;<br /><br />If, however, you want more from your books - compelling plot, consistent character development, clever/beautiful writing - definitely do not waste your time. The plot is contrived, there are way to many &#34;coincidences&#34; that make things work out the way the author wants and I'm pretty sure the ending was written to purposely piss off the reader/elicit a response. I don't like it when I can tell I'm being manipulated by the author instead of the characters, but I understand that most people don't look for that much depth in their reading.<br /><br />So, looking for a page-turner - might be worth it. But I don't see what all the hype is about.
0060557818|3.0|This was definitely not my favorite Neil Gaiman book. There was a lot of plodding around and not enough character development.<br /><br />This \\"fanciful adventure\\" (not a mystery Molly, not at all!) takes place in London Below. London Below is lurking beneath the streets of London, it's a magical place full of dark lurking tunnels, rat-speakers, moving markets, and interesting underground creatures. Perfectly normal Richard Mayhew (from London Above) finds a young girl hurt in the street, ignoring his fiance's wishes he takes the girl home and helps her. Little does he realize his life is about to turn upside down. Within 24 hours he loses his job, his fiance, his apartment, and ultimately his life. He ceases to exist in London Above and must try to survive in London Below. He goes on a mission with the young girl he rescued, Door (you read that right, that's really her name), the Marqui des Caraba, and a woman named Hunter. Together they try to piece together why Door's family was killed and how to get Richard back home.<br /><br />Overall, the writing style is nice, Gaiman is always ludicrously descriptive and it's fun to get caught up in his imagination but the overall plot did nothing to steal my attention. It's a merely ho-hum story, not Gaiman's strongest effort.<br /><br />Read more of my reviews at: [...]

0385737955|5.0|People have been raving about this book for years and I feel silly for just now getting around to reading it, but boy am I glad I did!! This book is a must read for anyone who enjoys dystopia novels like \\"The Hunger Games Trilogy\\" or \\"Divergent.\\" It's a futuristic world where kids have to fend for their lives and know one (including the reader) knows what the hell is going on until the very end.<br /><br />The story opens with Thomas awakening in a metal box and being hauled up to \\"the Glade.\\" It's a haven full of teenage boys who survive by trying to create order in a world of chaos. The Glade is located smack dab in the middle of a giant maze filled with grievers, terrible slug like mechanical creatures that come out after dark and sting or kill you. No one knows why they're there but every day the maze runners risk their lives by running around the massive labyrinth trying to find a way out. Everyone's memory has been wiped, all they remember is coming up in the metal box. Their life is a hell, paranoia, chaos, and death meets them at every turn. Can Thomas adjust to this hellish nightmare? What is the meaning of the maze? Why are they there? Trust me you'll want to read more! This page turner will keep you guessing til the very end.

1451695195|5.0|I lost my mother in March 2012.  I have been struggling with her death.  This book has made it easier for me to accept she is gone but in a much better place.  Dr. Alexander is so passionate about his experience.  It is not hard to get caught up in it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Got this book for my birthday and it had my complete attention for the three days it took to read it. I really  enjoyed it.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|I have been listening to Van Morrison since the early '70s.  I even saw him in 1973 at the San Diego Sports Arena.  Many of these wonderful songs bring back memories of high school and college.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Love this game! Have played several G5 games and I have liked them as well. Keep making great games guys!
B004SIP7F8|5.0|This was a fabulous buy. I learned so much by the additional information provided about the making of the movie and its characters. The movie had many twists and turns but it was so well done that I never felt confused by it. Beautiful story. I can't believe that I am just now watching it. But I am very happy I have. This will be in my permanent collection.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I loved it. I bought it for my 3 year old girl who is the pricencess phase and I enjoyed it just as much as her.
B00866JL96|5.0|I love this movie. I wish Scott Hicks' would make more movies, he has a certain magic. The actors are so believable, it is a very simple little movie, and I watch it to relax. I don't know why, but this particular movie really calms me. I have a benign brain tumor and although I am very well, sometimes everything seems to get on top of me. I shut the door to the loud, rushed world and put this movie on and it just takes me away to a calm peaceful place. I think Zac Efron, Taylor Schilling and Blythe Danner are fabulous in this, I love Blythe Danner's character. I hope I am a Nana that cool. Riley Stewart is such a great little actor, I hope we see him in more movies. And Jay Ferguson as the troubled but underneath it all, not a bad guy, ex husband is totally believable. Thanks to all who made this movie, you calm my life.

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|Sherlock Holmes, game of shadows is a great movie that I really enjoy watching, a great sequence to the original Sherlock Holmes.<br /><br />Robert Downy is a very funny to the point actor, this is a action-pack movie that I can recommend others to watch.

B003Y5HWJU|5.0|I gave this movie a five star ratings because it gave a you a sense of you being there at that particular time.  Steve Buscemi is a great actor and comedian. I enjoyed this movie so much that I ordered season two already.  If you wanted to know who ran atlantic city back in the days, get this movie, you will not be  disappointed.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the trilogy. I have read all three books twice.  This series is my favorite. I couldn't stop reading them!
B00BS4U8VS|5.0|Awesome season so far! Got a little worried when Rick started going nuts, but then, given the circumstances, can't believe their all not losing it. The characters are great, very believable, except maybe Michonne (how many chicks do you know running around with a sword?), but then my wife says in that situation, who knows? Just when you think you know how things are going to pan out,.......

1451648537|4.0|I don' usually care for biographies, because I find them to be ponderous massive tomes. But I loved reading Walter Isaacson's biography of Steve Jobs. Even though this was not a short book at 600 pages, it was a page-turner.<br /><br />However, the biography is not perfect. After reading the book, I went to the Amazon page and listened to all of the author videos about how he came to know and like Steve Jobs. I was surprised by how much Mr. Isaacson evidently liked Steve Jobs as much as he says he did on those videos, because when I read his biography I felt I was constantly being assailed by the negative parts of Jobs' personality. It didn't take me long to develop a strong dislike to Jobs based on Mr. Isaacson's biography. Like others, I wondered why Steve Jobs was so unkind and brutal to those who worked for him. What was wrong? Did he have an untreated mental health condition like bio-polar disorder?<br /><br />I think Walter Isaacson's biography would have benefited greatly from more of a discussion of this issue, since Jobs' gratuitous nastiness was such a salient feature of the  interactions he had with various people throughout his life. Four stars.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I am somewhat surprised to see “Flight” on so many Top 10 Best Movies of 2013 lists.  It is a good but not great film, with more than a few flaws that cannot be overlooked.<br /><br />Let’s start with the positive.  Denzel Washington gives strong performance in a role that is absolutely the centerpiece of the film.  The events of the actual airplane flight of the title are gripping, and the action sequences of the flight itself are very well done, and will cause many a viewer to wonder how they were faked. (“Did they really crash a plane into a field to generate that footage?”)  The story “Flight” is really about, one man’s battle with alcohol and drug addictions, is a compelling one.<br /><br />Now to the flaws.  Flight aspires to be a serious film, yet it has characters and scenes that detract from the emotional impact the film is attempting to make.  One of these characters is the pilot's drug dealer friend, whose appearances are so over-the-top with quick wittedness that he comes across as a stand-up comic doing a rehearsed routine, rather than a real person.  The co-pilot is an idiot (could any trained, licensed pilot really be that bad under pressure?) whose stupidity is only exceeded later in the film by his wife, a mindless Christian automaton who could have been portrayed by a piece of cardboard with &#34;Praise Jesus!&#34; written on it.<br /><br />As for scenes, several of the &#34;drinking to excess&#34; scenes seem over-the-top (is it really possible to consume that much alcohol and survive?), and it is a bit hard to believe that the pilot would think and act that well during the crisis in flight after a night of heavy boozing and drugs, with barely any sleep.  The movie builds towards a courtroom drama scene, yet the courtroom is really a NTSB hearing, and any viewer will immediately be able to cite several hundred other more dramatic courtroom scenes from film and TV history.<br /><br />If you are looking for a much more compelling film about the evils of alcohol and how they can put a person on a long downward spiral, I recommend &#34;Leaving Las Vegas&#34; with Nicholas Cage and Elisabeth Shue.  That film is more difficult to watch because of the powerful emotions its images conjure up, but it ultimately does a much better job than &#34;Flight&#34; of conveying the same messages.
1419704400|5.0|I think that this book is the top of the iceberg of the huge Vogue's world, however is full of magnificent images, and tells a few nice stories. You will see just greats photographers page after page, iconic models and well know people. All the book is interesting and you will love it and keep it like a treasure.
B009TTGM3C|5.0|I like this movie. It's very interesting that brothers grimm has funny think. I like grimm. I love they. haha
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show. LOVE that I can watch it on my ipad now. Netflix doesn't have Season 2 of Downton Abbey available but Amazon doees! So glad I am a Prime member.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Argo was a very entertaining movie that was well worth watching.  The movie was a great story and well worth its Oscar nomination.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love this book almost as much as I loved the first one. Can't wait to read the third!!!! These always keep me on my feet!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I cannot get enough of this movie , I am almost done with the 2nd season and cannot wait for the next season.
B00BP4VPUE|4.0|I love thrillers.  I'm a bit over bloodiness -- it's tolerable here.  The suspense is awesome on this!!  Kevin Bacon's acting gets much better as the show progresses.  I think they do a good job after the 3rd episode of building out the characters.  Each show leaves with such a cliff-hanger I can hardly wait for the next episode.  Interesting story line although I'll be very curious how they can keep it going after 1 season... seems to be the trend lately where shows fizzle out after one season of a strong plot.  Stringing plots along season to season is key and many shows can't seem to succeed with that lately.<br /><br />If you like thrillers and are looking for a new show, this is a must see!
B007RP4D5Y|2.0|Not up to Pat Methaney standards. I have a number of other albums of which some are in my favorites. This one just missed.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|arrived in great time for my grandkids. Easy to order and great selection. We would order again from this site
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I read a LOT of the reviews and comparisons and a lot of them saying to save yourself a few bucks because the MDR-V6 is exactly the same as the MDR7506. NOT! Let's cut to the car chase... I've been recording my own music since the early 80's. Way back when I tried several different headphones and settled upon the MDR7506, hands down.<br /><br />Recently, after years of use I decided to get another pair. Actually, I don't NEED them as this original pair is still kicking! However, I tried the MDR-V6 and a new MDR7506 and according to my ears there IS a difference. A BIG difference to me. Mostly to me mid-range frequencies are not nearly as clear, they are too muddy.<br /><br />You can't go wrong paying an extra $20 - $30 for the MDR7506.<br />Of course, this is my opinion. I'm quite certain my Mother wouldn't notice a thing :-)
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|This book isn't my kind of book . But I still like it. I hope I  can read this book . Again.

B007KAJG3K|1.0|I don't have time to spend on the discussion of this terrible movie but to just give it what it deserves - a \\"poor\\" rating. If this is what has become of Sherlock Holmes, then he truly must be dead.

B00846REIS|5.0|i loved these books and i cannot wait for the next one. would like to find more books like this and 50 shades. i loved both of these series and really am not sure which books i liked more. they were similar yet very different. i liked that it was not the same as 50 shades and didn't feel like i was just rereading the same story
B003L20IJM|5.0|This was enjoyable as much as the original movie--fun for the entire family, and asset to movie library. Good price.

B007P2DQJI|5.0|UPDATED 10-31-2013: The battery got inflated, it is not usable anymore.<br /><br />ORIGINAL POST: Sometimes people complaints about buying an advertised \\"as original\\" product and receiving a generic one, this one is the original, NFC included, excelent price, just have in mind that te product is sent from France, so you will have to wait a little
B005HSL626|5.0|Fun simple mindless fun.  Game play is great and it is a game that I can<br />play along with my 9 year old granddaughter (she kicks my butt at this game).
B00011KHTM|1.0|Save your money!! This is FALSE ADVERTISEMENT, IT'S NOT AN APPLE PRODUCT, AND AMAZON NEEDS TO TAKE CARE OF THIS COMPANY THAT IS CLAIMING TO BE. The product is made poorly, so much that it will stop working correctly within a few weeks. DO NOT PURCHASE.
B000QUCNOK|5.0|A Dark complex movie that i absolutely LOVE!! this is not a Hollywood blockbuster but deserves so much more attention than it gets!

B006UG90RM|4.0|Its not VH from the 80's but it is great! Eddy and the boys still got it! it is awesome
014241493X|4.0|It was a very good read, a little repetitive at times, but good. I think i may be noticing a pattern with this author when it comes to the characters he creates.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I love Meryl Streep and she did good again in this role. No one could have played a more miserable husband than Tommy Lee Jones. Two perfect people for these roles.  You will laugh and at the end it has a happy ending.  What a way to end a romance movie.

0385349947|5.0|Must read for all (women and men). Great stories, research and experiences. I am not a particularly fast reader and went through this quickly, highlighter in hand. This will be staying on my bookshelf for frequent future reference. :)
B005LAIGN2|4.0|IT WAS GOOD IT HAD ERRORS IN IT AND WAS NOT FACTUAL NOR TRUTHFUL AND I WAS SUPRISED a a a
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Well done and gives a view of just how well  our Special Forces are trained to handle situations (not always situations at war).  I will watch this again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing. And the come out with new places to \\"surf\\" quite often...which is what I love the most. It keeps me from getting bored of the game!
1442346272|4.0|Love Apple! Great story of the beginning of a awesome tech company! I love Apple, better than android! Android is glitchy so apple rocks!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This book is easy and fun to read. I downloaded it to my phone and I've really enjoyed reading it.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I love this app, it does everything I expected and some!<br /><br />Of course, it won't actually perform your tasks for you but then again no app could. Short of that this tool is marvelous.
B004WGIXX4|3.0|It had some great lines. Very funny.  However, the story was just average.  Nevertheless, It was just the thing for watching as I worked out on my treadmill.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Amazing cast, amazing storyline..... I was captivated!  I have a hard time sitting through movies, especially at home and it held my interest the entire time!  What a great film!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This, and book two ,were the best books that I have read in some time. I was surprised to be proven wrong about so many historical facts, regarding both wars, that I thought I knew. It was also surprising that the story moved along at an amazing speed. The characters were all believable and well defined.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on book two.<br /><br />I assume book three has not been completed yet since I can't seem to find it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a very good game and i would recomend it to all of the people in the world especially kids
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game,  not too easy or too hard, but could be a little more reasonable in price. I want more games like this one!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|very good game and a good take on the original game. definately addicting good fun. good for kids and adults alike.:)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|I'm a hidden objects fan and this is one of the best, good story line,interesting plot. Great game I love the graphics!
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This was a great movie.  Even tho I didn't know most of the cast, I loved it.  The plot is great!
0345803485|1.0|Not much of a story and boring, just the same stuff over and over. Who could like a self centered, egotistical, sadistic person like Grey. I just don't get it!. I got the 2nd book from the library but it's going back unread. Getting through the first was tough enough!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|Husband loves Mumford & Sons. Than you! It turned out to be a perfect gift. He enjoys the music while he drives around for work!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie is one of the most fantastic, battleship movies there ever was.  I remember old WWII movies, but this is far more exciting.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|While I read a lot of fiction and nonfiction, sci-fi hasn't always been a favorite of mine, but this book(s) was phenomenal. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a refreshing story.
B00064AM6C|5.0|Nice gift for family member. He loves it. Thank you for having a great selection. Turned out to be the perfect gift.
0763644765|4.0|This is probably one of the cutest books I found explaining potty training. Great for smaller kids who are just starting to potty train.
B008AYCSE4|5.0|Realistic and gritty. I believe this to be an honest depiction of addiction. I would recommend this DVD not only because Michael Fassbender is an extremely attractive man, but because it has a captivating story plot. Two Thumbs Up....
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I could hardly stop reading and was a bit sad to have finished the trilogy. Outstanding characters and plot. Overall a brilliant set of books. I will no doubt read them again.
B000VMBXNA|2.0|Easy read. In my opinion, the plot was a little \\"hokey\\". The few crude comments throughout the book didn't match with the writing style of the rest of the book. Wouldn't recommend it.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|A very funny app. With this comical cat.<br />For kids and adults who like cartoons,and<br />other comical things like this
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even though i knew what was going to happen it still kept me on the edge of my seat! I see why he won the academy award!
0981951252|5.0|I have to say that I was really expecting this to just impact my thoughts and actions around my business, but the Compound Effect is an amazing and effective tool for life. I listen to a portion of it (if not the whole thing) at least once or twice a week.
B00BEJL3IY|5.0|The movie was fantastic. Excellent graphics and a great story line. As they are bringing back all the old nursery rhymes, this is one of the best so far. My husband and I go to the movies every week and really enjoy seeing the new and creative ideas. This is a great film for the whole family to enjoy.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I hope E L James makes a fourth book, and I can't wait til the movie comes out.  Hurry up Universal Studios!!!!
B008JFUN8C|5.0|Prequal to the Wizard of Oz but great. The story line is very understandable, beautiful scenery and characters. My favorite part was the China Doll, she was beautiful. Overall a great production, does start out kind of slow, but excellent performances.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is an amazing app for everypony! You get to get all kinds of ponies from the show and play amazing games. Anyone who likes the tv show will love this app!
B005CGI4EG|5.0|The only con I can imagine is that there are NO special features.  NONE!!  How can you issue the whole series in a box set and not at least have an interview or about the show, or something!  That's my only disappointment.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was a very steamy and pulse rising book that gets you sweating with anticipation. Its a good well written story that keeps you flipping through the pages because you have to know what happens next!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is a lot of fun !!! I've definitely got my money's worth out if it. I've played it over and over and haven't tired if it yet !
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book will make you cry, make you hot and make you open your eyes wide at the quick changes in mood and situations. The twists and turns of emotions (and bodies) keeps you on your toes and wanting more. The pain is real and the love is real. Cant wait till the 3rd book comes out!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|First I thought that this is going to be a boring lovestory, after the 3rd chapter I got curious and loved to read till the end

B007KQ6XYY|4.0|While I haven't played the game, both my sisters and my brother have. And they love it. They play almost everyday just for a few minutes. It's one of the few games that they all enjoy and play together with.
0375869026|4.0|I'd heard up and down how great this book was and as a parent and an educator, it looked like it was one of those \\"important\\" books everyone should read once. It definitely is that. This is the story of August, a fifth grader born with facial deformities. His parents decide he is ready to attend a real school, as opposed to being home-schooled, and the reader is treated to his journey through his eyes, as well as those of his friends and his sister.<br /><br />I loved August. His voice is sweet and sincere and he wants to much to just be normal. He knows what he looks like though and the strange looks he gets from others do not go unnoticed. His parents do their best to give him a normal life, but even they can't shield him from everyone. Over the course of the book, we get to see not only how August changes throughout the school year, but how he changes others. He has a profound effect on the kids who become his closest friends, as well as the adults who interact with him on a daily basis. We get to see how being the sibling of someone with special needs can be tough at times. We also get to see how some people are just never going to see the \\"good\\" in someone else and that they can't always get over their own hangups and insecurities.<br /><br />I cried several times while reading. The language is simple and pure. The emotions are straightforward and there is something here everyone can relate to. I feel this would be a great book for teachers to teach in the classroom - all ages - because the message is so wonderful. Be kinder than is necessary. A huge thank you to R.J. Palacio for writing this book - the conversations that will no doubt come out of reading this one are very necessary. I can't wait to read it with my daughter in a couple years.<br /><br />4.5/5
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I didn't want to download this app/game, however since it was free I figured I'd give it a shot. It was really for my sister's. I read the reviews and wasn't convinced. It's fun for about 5 seconds and becomes quickly an app that waste more time than anything else. It isn't fun. There's no knowledge to gain. It's a waste. So I got rid of it. And my sister's haven't even noticed it's gone.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I somehow lost the charger that came w/ my Kindle keyboard. This replacement is just like tne original that came w/ my Kindle.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I had gotten this app for my sister's to put a variety of apps onto the kindle. I love that they spend time trying to play the piano, it's great because it takes the mechanics of learning how to play to and creating it into playing a game.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|If you found yourself wading through the mainstream reviews of The Intouchables in the American press, I doubt you would even recognize this magnificent film. From what is a remarkable, mesmerizing and poignant tribute to the power of authentic human connection over the paralysis of fear, lovelessness and ennui, Variety and The New York Times among others, choose to see this truth-based relationship between an aristocratic French quadriplegic and his street-tough black caregiver as a red, white and blue meme to the continuing plague of racial stereotyping and class-based exploitation.<br /><br />As Jerry Lewis has learned the hard way over decades, America ain't France and I would therefore most humbly suggest to the lions of professional judgment that they view the film without the baggage and institutionalized biases that overwhelm their own criticisms of it. What the critics-for-hire anticipated was the stillborn, racial clownishness of Eddie Murphy and Judge Reinhold in Beverly Hills Cop - what the film delivered was something real and touching that they couldn't explain, so they forced their original narrative anyway.<br /><br />I am the first one to roll may eyes at any film that is overwrought by any political or ham handed social agenda - thankfully, this screenwriter borne virus is not an issue with this film.<br /><br />The Intouchables is the rare film where you know from the first five minutes that you are watching something special. The subtitles melt quickly into the background as the real-world relationship between billionaire Philippe and reluctant caregiver Driss is propelled by the bravura performances of actors Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. The proceedings elevate further as the bone-dry subtlety of the highly intelligent, serio-comic screenplay of writers Oliver Nakache and Eric Toledano crackles with prescient insight.<br /><br />The Intouchables is in fact a genuine \\"feel good\\" film that mass-audience populars like Silver Linings Playbook can only aspire to. Playbook, while enjoyable to watch, allows powerful star-turn acting to be habitually hamstrung by too cute by half emotional manipulation and story-line choreography that delivers every player to their predestined against-all-odds triumph that even the dullest member of the audience could have easily predicted.<br /><br />Time will tell whether the must-see Intouchables cracks my personal top ten. In the meantime, enjoy and savor this rare treat of a film.
0525457585|5.0|This isn't a review about the book as a piece of literature. I have yet to read it. This review is simply how wonderful/excited I am to have found it. Though there aren't any illustrations or plates, the design of the font is lovely. You will have to see it to understand what I mean.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Ever wonder what really happens in today's battlefield?  The Lone Survivor makes that picture very clear. He also makes clear the conundrum that our soldiers face in carrying out a military mission today. What are the implications of my field actions when heard back home, in the US media when all is said and done?  Our soldiers shouldn't have to think about that. They should be able to do their jobs. This book gives a clear picture of bravery, and maybe bravery that did not need to come to fruition in those hills in Afghanistan. Read this book and find out why. Thank you Navy SEALs and all other US military for allowing me the freedoms I have. God bless you all.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I bought this to use as a Bluetooth controller for my computer and my phone, not for use with a PS3. It worked as intended and was easy to set up.  If you are used to a PS3 controller for gaming than this will be a great controller for you. If you are used to an Xbox controller than you will be disappointed.<br /><br />I needed a controller for non-PS3 gaming and heard that this was a decent Bluetooth controller. After playing through the campaign of some games, I do not like the feel and button layout of this controller.  The shoulder buttons are too small and feel like they need to be reversed during game play.  I don't like the analog sticks being right next to each other either (very awkward). The controller feels light and and made of cheap plastic.<br /><br />I did like that the battery was built in and could be charged when not playing a game. No need for extra batteries is always a plus.
B00A11AN6O|2.0|It seems a bit silly that in this day and age that a company like Amazon only offers five Gb of storage either device (Fire) or Cloud.<br /><br />There are many free Cloud services out there that offers 20 plus Gb or more for free.

0143120530|5.0|When I read the Chapter 5 of the book, I was really engaging in the concept of memory palace, one of the best methods in elaborative encoding which involves converting meaningless and unnatural information into a series of imaginations—the “funnier, lewder and more bizarre the better.” How did he go from a guy who always forgot friends’ phone numbers and even left his car key to the one who had a record-breaking 1 minute 40 second in memorizing a deck of cards? The answer is memory palace! Memory can be strengthened by training and system of discipline; the two components are images and places. First, image a vivid and animate picture with multiple sensations in it. Then, store the picture to a place you know well. Memory palace is efficient even in our life and we can apply it to remember a shopping list or a to-do list—imaging each item in a detailed picture and saving in your memory palace. The method not only makes information immediately remember but lasts for a longer period. Therefore, you will never forget what to do next; it will definitely benefit you.
B007REV4T8|1.0|No impressive new 'Bond' gadgets nor vehicles, action comes in spurts that aren't that impressive, and tons of boring talk, talk, talk.  I haven't been this disappointed in a movie in a long time.  Save your money, go feed some birds or squirrels with a friend.
B0024Y9EYS|2.0|The premise, that there are terminator robots that reset themselves in120 sec. is just sophomoric.  They never run out of money they move and always have new furnished homes to live in,  I couldn't take it any longer.

B00BC5I6Q2|3.0|I admire the deep, abiding, and specific committment on the part of the writers to show Washington as an evil place, where manipulation and cynicism not only dominate, but are all.<br /><br />Into that jaded world we drop Francis Underwood, and he is a confused man.  And a dour one.  There is no joy here, only a hangdog workmanship, as he plots and schemes and manipulates.  It all looks like such work!<br /><br />There is a problem with the motivations of the lead character.  Specifically, he might have one of two motivations.  The first is revenge, for being passed over to be Secretary of State.  Revenge on the President, his Chief of Staff, the Secretary of State.  In the grip of this need for revenge, House Whip Underwood will do anything, take any risk, to get the revenge he seeks.  This explains the dangerous high wire act that is his manipulation and game playing.<br /><br />Or is he just seeking power?  By episode six, the viewer is confused.  Underwood's actions seem geared to make him more of a player.  In that context, some of the risks he takes seem silly.  If he was out for revenge, in an explosion of anger, OK.  But power requires more finesse.<br /><br />This confusion is due to poor plotting.  Here is another point:  the pay-off in episode six (which is where I believe the series went off the tracks) - this pay-off is Francis getting the union head to punch him.  An entire strategy, with multiple actions and staged set-ups, to get a union head to punch you, when it would have been far easier for the union head to just walk out.  This is sloppy writing.<br /><br />So, is he a master manipulator on a revenge-lust death run, or is he a master manipulator trying to build power within Washington?  And when he manipulates, does it all make sense?<br /><br />And his wife!  In episode six - -the last episode you should watch -- she morphs from a troubled partner in crime into a creepy psycho -- in the scene in her former bodyguard's hospital room -- for no good reason.  A flash of what?<br /><br />This confusion makes the series hard to abide, despite the great acting, the strong production values. I suggest that this is a good episode to stop the watching, and to switch to the far superior British progenitor.od reason.

B0058VW36U|5.0|My 8 year old daughter loves to play this game on her Kindle Fire - she just can't get enough of it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if not for the s***ty ending.<br />An awesome rollercoaster ride, the highest praise for the freakin insane plot and malice of a woman scorned.<br />I was giddy over hoping that either one of our main characters was REALLY gonna get it... I started out on Amy's side, then switched to Nick's side (poor bast@rd.)  And I couldn't stop reading to find out which one...  the plot is THAT GOOD!  but alas... a total night reading through for THAT ending... I do admit I love the last little surprise, but dang if I am not still disappointed.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I was kind of skeptical before I bought this but I heard so many positive things about it I decided to take a chance on it. And I'm glad I did. This is an awesome series. Great zombies and story line for that matter! Alot of breath taking moments. I will continue to buy these series as they come out! I can't wait for season 2....I've heard that Josh Stewart is in it which is even more incentive for me to buy it ;)
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I looked the game up in the app store and it's compatible with my android but not my Kindle Fire....but I read where another customer wrote a review saying that they played it on Kindle.  Is is available for Kindle Fire or will it be available some time soon?  Saw the movie, and really want the game now.....
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is really the best I have heard in quite some time. It has a very different sound that is hard to pin- point in relation to any other artists out there at the moment. It goes everywhere from little bits of 60's psychedelic sounds, to trip-hop, alternative rock, instrumentals, electronic pieces, to things I cannot really even describe very well. It does it all in a very flowing and well mixed way that has brought me back repeatedly to hear it again. I can't wait for this group to release their next album, it is a welcome new sound whatever you want to label it as.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I'm in algebra 1 and a lot of times I need a fraction button....it comes in handy.  It looks like this:  a b/c or d/e.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Fishdom is a lot of fun to play with many levels.  Building the fish bowl is enjoyable.  I play this game daily.
B007R0Y7VO|3.0|Disappointed as this movie had so much hype. Not what I thought it would be. Will not recommend this to friends.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|I enjoy the challenge of this game.  You really need to concentrate the levels keep getting harder.  Keeps your interest.
0345528581|3.0|I will keep this review brief:  I purchased Convict Conditioning over a year ago and have been following that plan, and it is working well for me.  I purchased \\"You Are Your Own Gym\\" a few days ago to see if I could expand my knowledge of body weight exercises.  I read the book cover to cover over the weekend.<br /><br />I have been researching health and fitness for over 20 years and I found much of the information in this book to be very basic.<br /><br />Pros:  I did book mark several body weight exercises which I will add to my routine at some point.  I also found his back story to be very inspirational.<br /><br />Cons:  The dietary section was basic, but I didn't buy the book for dietary information.  Many of his exercises are simply isolation gym exercises which he suggests substituting common household items in place of barbells/dumbbells.  Many more of the exercises are simply yoga exercises.  I personally didn't find his workout plans to fit into my personal fitness goals.<br /><br />Overall it was an interesting read, but I will probably utilize less than 5% of the information in the book to improve my current health and fitness goals.  But, an additional 5% is still a benefit.<br /><br />I do feel this would be an excellent book for people who are just starting out on a good health/fitness journey. I feel Convict Conditioning is better choice for someone who is strongly experienced in health and fitness.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Coin Dozer is slow moving game.  No excitement in playing also no challenges.  Coin Dozer is great for a relaxing game.
B004A8ZWWO|5.0|I watched this movie not expecting much and was pleasantly surprised. It may not be downright hilarious, but it is a very entertaining movie with plenty of plot twists you won't see coming. Ben Stiller gives a pretty solid performance and seems like one of his more serious roles believe it or not. Overall, I recommend this movie to friends and family who also say they enjoyed it. It is a very underrated movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|Temple Run is a good challenging game.  Lots of action and fast moving.  You really need to concentrate and keep going until it gets easier.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The United States of America has a thousand heroes in uniform all over the globe.  The hero of this novel is one of those.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Although not much new theory, it does a great job of putting behavioral economic theory into terms a lay person can understand and apply.
B000EGDAI4|4.0|The only issue I have with this product was that the cd case was damaged, but the cd itself was in perfect condition. A bit of a bummer, considering the damage to the cd case, but nothing I have any reason to complain about.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Liked the book a lot.  Just when you think you have it figured out, it takes another twist and leaves you wondering what is going to happen next.  Very suspenseful.  Disappointed at the ending after so much action during the book.  Fast reading.
1781164266|5.0|A lot of beautiful concept art and sketches from dead space, dead space 2 and dead spacce 3 as well.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I loved this book. The chapters were short and action filled. It kept me wanting to read the next chapter, and the next chapter, and so on. This is a great story that I recommend to everyone!
B00942X8PY|1.0|I have have not used it yet but I am hopeing its good so I think that you shod get it and try the app
1455128333|5.0|Great movie, fantastic cast. It's a good one to watch again. Listed as a comedy but more of a romantic drama if there is such a thing.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|We love this movie - from adults to a 10yr old, 7 yr old, and a 3 yr old.  It is funny and takes the 'scare' out of monsters for kids.  Lots of recognizable comedian voices as well - Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Molly Shannon, David Spade, etc...
1616550414|5.0|It's cheap by quality that it's made. The illustrations, the hard cover, all worth each cent. Have a book of the greatest game in the world is more than a fan can imagine!
B000SLP4SE|5.0|Yes, I do believe we have rogue actors in governement......and a few who make it right.  The story was good and action packed, as you would expect for your money.
1451695195|4.0|This appears to be an honest portrayal of events that were apparently experienced by this well-educated &#34;scientist&#34; during the time of his &#34;out-of-body&#34; encounter.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|Perhaps I was not so bad to have been drunk, it was quick thinking that saved people, but he was bad......But the airline was worse......they did not fix the plane as they should have.......and no corporate officer went to prison....go figure...It is typical of our government today......
B00999DFP0|3.0|I love this series but I was disappointed that the season 5 case was pretty badly beaten up to the point where the disk divider had detached... the plastic on season one was ripped.
B00006FDCD|2.0|DVD Review -<br /><br />Picture-3/5 Sound-2/5<br /><br />Made for T.V. - and it shows. But even if it was given more financing, I really don't think it would have helped this film. The problem lies in the fact that a good Stephen King book doesn't necessarily translate well to film. That is, when it's a GOOD book.<br /><br />\\"IT\\" isn't really a good book to begin with IMO. Read it once when it came out and once was enough. \\"IT\\" was just too long of a book with an ending that disappointed, for the effort spent reading it. Then the T.V. film was released and although I remember watching it then, I honestly didn't remember how I felt about it. Recently I came across the DVD for $3.00 (new). It said on the case that the running time was 3 hours. Hmmm. A buck an hour. Could it hurt? I shelled out my money and took home my bargain.<br /><br />So when I sat down to watch a film made from the book, I didn't expect the film version to magically change my mind about the book. It didn't. But I was hoping at least that I would be entertained. I wasn't.<br /><br />With respect to all the actors involved, the acting was painful to watch. I really felt sorry for most of these people who had to try and pretend that what they were saying was serious. I suppose that some of them needed a paycheck at the time the film was made. Maybe it was the direction. Maybe it should've been a musical. Who knows? The only thing I can say is \\"IT\\" was very hard to watch for 3 hours and perhaps I should've drank during the show. But I soldiered on and was grateful when the end finally came.<br /><br />Eject. Store. Shelf. Forget.<br /><br />If you love this movie, you're going to love this DVD. But if you're not sure or your just curious, get this DVD as cheap as you can.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game is fun, it changes on each game so it gives your mind a workout. I like competing against the timer. You'll never get bored with this game!
0307887960|4.0|Very easy to follow...Tells you exactly what you can and cannot eat at different stages of weight loss. My husband lost 15 pounds in three weeks. I lost 6 in one week.<br />Went on vacation and still could stick to regimen.
B00068TJM6|4.0|I have a kinda smaller wrist, so this watch fits really well... it is not overly big.  I like the style of watches that look very &#34;complex&#34; - my favorite &#34;real&#34; watch is the Breitling Navitimer (about $7,500 retail), which I could never buy.  This watch has a nice complicated face full of numbers and things that I will never use and that is what I like.  Good watch for the money.  I took it to Macy's and said that my grandfather had bought it for my birthday and they sized it for free.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This app is excellent for notes with media. It is perfect for this platform but does take some getting used to.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|I was blown away when I got this album.....it was worth EVERY PENNY.  and then some.  These guys can rock it all the way to the levee and back.  You gotta love southern and blues.....Get you some
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game rocks in a way that makes you feel wrong and dirty, but is great at strategic level. totally recommend this game
B007T2XC7A|3.0|Its Okay.....Good Morning is my favorite cut.  It is a bit disconnected. Its not as melodic as some of her earlier stuff.
1475143389|5.0|A great book packed with lots of info.  Very comprehensive covering many topics. Geared towards bodybuilding which is getting to be a rarity nowadays in weight training books.
B00A4GXJD0|3.0|This is a great album with a couple of STAND OUT tunes.  However, he is experimenting with some electronics that is drowning out the punch line.  Its beginning to sound repetitive on a commercial scale.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The black page with white text option is very easy on the eyes. The extreme high resolution of the Android device I am using resolves beautiful type. More books are coming with Kindle appropriate TOCs and formatting.
B008FDP7AW|5.0|.....about Last of a Dyin' Breed.....this is by far the best release in many years.  They have the three guitar attack and are tight with the changes.  The Writing is still very strong....they have remained close to their roots.....that is what make Lyn Skyn Timeless....<br />Get you Some!
B000B5XOY8|4.0|I saw this film due 2 a dare: I luv the adam west Batman and the style of the 60s avengers......BUT I can't tolerate oh Jack N. Therefore I waz dared to differ with this film 'if u still don't like Jackie boy, at least u'll like the clothes and style' I waz told. OK I confess, the movie is good!! As 4 jack, still feel the same BUT he totally plays the part well. After I saw it I looked up back stories & behind the scene stuff & came across this 2 disc recommendation. Yep, I did it! I'm the proud owner!!and fyi: No buyers' regret!
B008NNNF7G|5.0|There are more than just one or two on this album that makes it worth the money.....&#34;Everybody Knows She Mine&#34;....is one example of reaching in with a hook and grabbing you......I want more from this group.....
B005IZLPMY|5.0|What's not to like?  A handsome guy that embodies the values of what we know is truly the American spirit!!  Great background movie for the Avengers tie in.  We were  hoping for a sequel (to Thor as well), but it doesn't seem likely.  Too bad - because the characters are really wonderful.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It is an amazing story that will keep you entertained straight through the end. It had me on an emotional roller coaster.
B006WXHJNU|5.0|Not only do we love Edward Norton, but we love the HULK, so the combination is perfect!!  Great movie and wonderful background to find out about the hulking green guy, especially as it ties into the Avengers movie(s).  There are a few HULK movies out there, but this one is must-see.
B0013F1D02|5.0|Exquisite love story. Blubbering besides myself can't help but feel a swelling attachment to the  characters. Fictional with a magical land beyond the wall near england. JUST WATCH IT!!! Kid appropriate too.
6305128952|5.0|For this price, it's hard NOT to buy it.  A great movie that highlights Robert Redford's penchant for great story telling.  Even though it isn't his story, he made it his - he plays Tom Booker perfectly.<br />Highly recommended.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|This would have been a 5-star app, but advertising your other apps after you've purchased?  That's awful.  I pay to get rid of advertisements and support the author.  I know it's only 99 cents, but stop advertising your other items like this after we've paid you.<br /><br />Outside of that, this is a full-featured alarm clock that looks great and does the job.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this movie and it turned out that we all found it highly entertaining!  I'm not really a Robert Downey Jr fan, but I think he did incredibly well in this role (how much is really acting? :)) and he shined as Tony Stark.  Loved the visual effects, the idea of story, and the fact that there is a sequel!!  Also really like how we have both a regular DVD and Blu-Ray combo - wish they all did that!
B008ACC9CM|5.0|Saw them on YouTube and had to have a CD.  Awesome talent.  All songs are excellent.  Sound quality of CD is good
B004LQGXPA|5.0|If you're interested in learning about one of the greatest and most interesting combat generals of all time, this is the movie for you. The movie was very well done for its time and the performance put on by George C. Scott (Patton) was amazing. Not to mention the movie won 8 academy awards including Best Picture. Definitely worth a watch.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really good considering that they have fixed all of the lags in the game the world tour is what kept me playing. I thought that the game was starting to become boring,but not at all...GOOD JOB KILOO!!!!!!! :-)
B008ALA6DW|1.0|My adapter was great for about 2 months, but then the head-end of it started to get loose. Now it kind of settled at a weird diagonal angle and only works about 20% of the time.<br /><br />I would just recommend getting a cheaper adapter as opposed to spending $30 on one of these official ones.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander makes a very compelling case for &#34;life after life&#34; in Proof of Heaven. A neurosurgeon who had serious damage to his brain's neocortex and who recovered—against all odds—was able to remember in vivid detail what happened to him &#34;on the other side.&#34; If I didn't already accept the theory of life after life, his story would have convinced me.<br /><br />We are sometimes smug in trying to refute something that can't be proved in a science lab. Dr. Alexander's experience has been dissected by scientists, neurologists and neurosurgeons without being proved fallible.<br /><br />This book should be read by everyone who wonders about what happens when they die. They may not agree with it, but at least they have another option to ponder. For those of us who already espouse life after life, it is a comforting reinforcement of that belief.<br /><br />This book is written like a novel that you get caught up in and can't put down. By the time you finish the first page want to hang a &#34;do not disturb&#34; sign around your neck and find a quiet corner to stay in until you turn the last page.<br /><br />He is writing another book that will look at this from a more scientific perspective and you can bet my name will be on the list to get it the day it is published.
0802473156|5.0|EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED. This book helps couples learn what each party needs and gives great examples on how to achieve better communication.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|Very well written and inspirational story. As someone who has had many OBE's (Not the same as a NDE) I've always knew there was another dimension that we go to when we pass over. What's really interesting is a neurosurgeons take on his NDE.

B004ZY0VHY|5.0|From beginning to end, the reader will be intrigued.  The writing style is interesting.  It is a book comprised of letters.  Kevin is a problem child, and the reader feels as though he/she lives with him.

B00AH8U3UC|4.0|Hank Moody is still Hank Moody.  The show has gotten sillier but it's still good TV to zone out to.
B005LAIH2C|2.0|What does the story of Hansel and Gretel teach us? That evil witches who have a taste for children will, one day, get their comeuppance. And don't eat houses made out of candy. That one is pretty important. But have you ever wondered if this is where their story really ends? I have and this is Part 2. Hansel (Jeremy Renner) and Gretel (Gemma Arterton) are all grown up now but they've never forgotten their harrowing experience as children. After defeating the witch with a hunger for young flesh, they've made it their life's mission to eradicate the world of these vile creatures. Only things aren't quite as simple as they seem. Hansel and Gretel have gone from being the hunters to being the hunted. And now they face a greater evil (Famke Janssen) that will force them to confront their painful past.<br /><br />Retribution is the name of the game in Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters. Ya know, I find it pretty ironic that retribution is one of the many things this movie failed to achieve. Grimm's Hansel and Gretel would be ashamed, because, let's face it--- it was all sorts of bad. I kinda already knew that going in though. The way I saw it, was Hansel & Gretel had all the potential to be one of those &#34;awesomely bad&#34; films I'm constantly raving about. And that, folks, is why I took a chance on it. Unfortunately, such was not the case. My wallet and the hour and half I spent at the theatre are still suffering from severe pangs of regret. I'm sorry, guys. I wish I could blame my justification on illness but any excuse I come up with is flimsy, at best. I just... I don't even know anymore. This movie was far beyond disfunctional and no amount of Jeremy Renner hotness could salvage it from being such a mess.<br /><br />As much as I disliked the movie, Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters does have intermittent moments of satisfaction however far and few between they may be. The story has potential. It really does. I like the whole fairy tale/vigilante justice thing. My main problem was that it felt like they weren't even trying when it came to the actual execution. It's like, Hollywood just shoved piles of money at the producers and said, &#34;Here you go, give me bucket loads of CGI. Nothing more, nothing less. Story? The public doesn't give a damn about story. They want blood! And guts! And lots of it!&#34; Hansel & Gretel settles for being over-the-top with the amount violence and gore it presents. And don't get me wrong, the violence and gore is what kept it interesting for me. You will never see a better decapitation scene in a movie, I guarantee it. It's just unfortunate because SFX isn't enough to solely keep this movie-goer wholly entertained.<br /><br />Hansel & Gretel lacks decent dialogue, coherency and likeable characters which is surprising considering the talents they cast in the film. Renner and Arterton are both wooden in their delivery and just look uncomfortable, in general. The movie was relentless and unforgiving, killing off just about everyone, including the only likeable character. If Wirkola was smart, he could've made the film into a clever trope but instead it goes beyond spoofy and lands somewhere in the realm of cartoonish which is, quite possibly, the worst fate to befall an action film.<br /><br />Food for Thought: Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters is another film full of potential that was flushed down the toilet. It lacks both the oomph and fun that's assumed by watching the trailer. You go in expecting that it's going to be bad, just not quite that bad. While there were some gratifying death scenes and the all-asstastic Jeremy Renner, neither saves the movie from flopdom. There's none of the magic you'd expect or want in this good fairy tale gone bad.roblem was that it felt like they weren't even trying when it came to the actual execution.

B000MD9UJC|4.0|I bought this one at the same time I got the TerraLux upgrade, and this upgrade is pretty much the inverse of that one- the reflector's great on this one, its brightness is measured according to the FL-1 spec, and the tail-cap switch is great.<br /><br />However, it's only rated at 30 lumens, which isn't terribly bright by modern LED flashlight standards.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|In light of our nation's school shootings, this book is scary!  It was written after Columbine but after Sandy Hook Elementary.  The book gives a parental viewpoint of the problems a sick child creates in a family.
B004UXUX4Q|5.0|This is the fourth Alexander Payne movie I've seen and in some ways it is the best. It is the most affecting, that's for sure, at least for me. I cried through a good part of it. What I found so touching was the way the characters came to grips with the reality of their lives and in the way the King family--Matt (George Clooney), Alexandra (Shailene Woodley) and Scottie (Amara Miller)--strengthened their family ties despite the tragedy and the various unpleasant revelations.<br /><br />As Elizabeth King lies dying in a deep coma after a water skiing accident, it is her workaholic husband Matt who has to take care of a slightly dysfunctional family. He is the trustee of a great Hawaiian estate on the island of Kauai that now must be sold. Getting closer to his children he first learns that younger daughter Scottie's behavior needs a lot of work. Then he goes to the Big Island where his older daughter Alexandra is at school and finds her drunk. And then he learns... Well, it's better if you see the movie and see what she tells him that so sets him off.<br /><br />While this is almost as funny as the other Payne movies I've seen (Election 1999, About Schmidt 2002, and Sideways 2004) it is not as satirical. Payne reaches for our hearts in this one instead of our whimsy.<br /><br />Clooney is excellent in a part that emphasizes his controlled and very winning leading man style. He does a lot with restraint and subtle expressiveness. Woodley (just 19 as the film was shot) played the wiser-than-her-years teen with just enough edginess and spitfire to be believable. She is so pretty that just looking at her brought me to tears. But perhaps the most natural performance was that by Amara Miller as the foul-mouthed, chubby little girl who wants to be as grownup as her big sister.<br /><br />Interesting to me personally were the settings on location in Hawaii since I watched the film not long after spending nearly three weeks on Oahu, Maui, Hawaii, and Kauai. I recall driving into Princeville (as Matt and family do) on Kauai and being in the exact spot at the airport as they were. And the shot of the ocean with Honolulu in the background that opened the movie brought back memories.<br /><br />The real strength of the movie for me though was in the script and the direction. The clever dovetailing of the plot and subplot (the search for the truth about Matt's marriage; and the disposition of the fabulous estate on Kauai) melded seamlessly together as Matt meets real estate agent (and not a nice guy), Brian Speer. Underlying the story is something deeper though, and that is the growth as human beings that we see the characters go through, especially that of Matt and Alexandra.<br /><br />Excellent in a minor role was Judy Greer as Brian Speer's wife.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"nto Princeville (as Matt and family do) on Kauai and being in the exact spot at the airport as they were.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a nice book because it shows part of Katniss's back story in the first part of the book. I also like how she tricks the gamemakers into having two victors in the hunger games. And this is awesome, signing off.
B000GIXIGY|1.0|I am so disappointed with the sound quality of this particular CD release by [...]  The CD sounds completely muffled.  Clearly, this was either a botch-job transfer, or someone borrowed their brother's cassette copy of this album and used it for the CD version.  They wouldn't listen to this particular copy in the Gulag, even if it were the only CD available!
B004JLDSIC|5.0|A recent review, in the NY Times, said they are the best vocal instrumental match since Billie Holiday and Lester Young.  I agree, this LP confirms the review.
B008NNNF7G|5.0|I just happened to catch Blackberry Smoke's video for Pretty Little Lies on Palladium after a Who documentary and loved it. I grabbed the Whippoorwill CD and it's a 5 star CD!! Loved this one so much that I grabbed their earlier CD: Little Piece of Dixie and again, 5 Stars!! Every Songs is good. I'm a musician myself, and have played in several Southern Rock bands back in the day (Boston Charlie and Railway Express, etc) and THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL DEAL!!!!! I'm hoping they come up to NY soon!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|definitely a great buy!!  if you want a great game to ease and use your mind this is definitely it!!

B000DZ6VAK|5.0|My comments are about the MP3 Version of this set from Amazon. This is a wonderful set, but unfortunately the MP3 Version is not labeled with the Concerto Name, Musical Key or Number! The limited information that you see on this page about each track is how the track is labeled, no more information is given in the MP3 files.  Fine if you know your music, not so much if you don't.<br /><br />Also, Tracks 2 & 3 of Disc number 1 are not available for download as a MP3 file!!??  I checked my 'CLOUD' drive and they weren't there. I promptly emailed customer support and their confusing answer (I think) was that some tracks are not available as a MP3 for AutoRip??!!! Huh??  Why isn't this stated somewhere.  Not happy. Hope Amazon fixes this problem in the future... I'll just have to wait for the CDs to arrive and rip those 2 tracks myself.<br /><br />Anyway I researched the titles on the internet and have included them below for those of you who have only the MP3 versions with no song name/number.<br /><br />Mozart: The Piano Concertos [Box Set] (CD)<br />By: Jeffrey Tate (Conductor), English Chamber Orchestra (Ensemble) and Mitsuko Uchida (Performer)<br /><br />DISC 1 for Mozart: The Piano Concertos [Box Set] (CD) Album By Jeffrey Tate (Conductor)<br />1  Piano Concerto No.5 in D, K.175 - 1.

086571701X|5.0|This is an excellent book to get you going in aquaponics. There is a lot of fly by nights on the web so choose carefully. You can go back and reference from this book. I built my own 4' x 2' grow bed from wood as it had to pass the wife's test of eye appeal as it is in my dining room. I purchased almost everything from my local Lowes. It came out excellent, beautiful pecan stained, and we are well on the way to growing our own vegetables right next to our dining room table.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|In spite of a stellar and amazing career, the Grammy has eluded Groban, but it could just be that this will be \\"the one.\\" Not that the Grammy is the best standard for good albums....certainly far from it, but still it would be nice if he finally got that recognition. But I digress. I have waited to review this album until I had listened for a while. I know, from past experience, that some songs grow on me and others get tiresome very quickly. So it takes a few weeks to get a feel for a new CD. I also want to say that while some fans didn't like Illuminations (his last CD) I was not one of those fans....Illuminations is one of my favorite CD's. So when I say this could be \\"the one,\\" I am saying it is BETTER than a CD that I liked pretty darn well. One of the things about this CD is the variety. I have owned CDs where it all sounded the same. This is most assuredly not one of those! In fact, I have divided the songs into categories, all from which we have previously seen songs in Groban's past career. In the category of light pop songs with a top 40 feel, we have the lead single, Brave, as well as Below the Line and Play Me (a bonus track on the extended CD). For those who long for Groban's foreign language days, with a slightly operatic sound, we have E Ti Promettero (the duet with L.P.), Un Alma Mas, Sincera and the bonus track, Grazia. All of those songs are vocally challenging and show off Groban's amazing instrument to best advantage. There are four tracks on the CD that are, perhaps, darker and a little more haunting, either melodically or in the lyrics or both: False Alarms, Hallow Talk, and bonus tracks Changing Colors and Satellite. Every time I hear Groban sing Changing Colors, he gives it such a personal feel that I wonder if there is a particular loss that inspired him to choose that song? But in any case, he is not one to shy away from difficult topics like pain and death, and this is an example of that willingness to sing about things that some would avoid. Reminiscent of my college days of taking voice lessons, both She Moved Through the Fair and The Moon is A Harsh Mistress have a pre-twentieth century \\"art song\\" feel to them (although \\"The Moon\\" is actually quite contemporary). And last but certainly not least is Groban's venture into almost country western territory with Happy In My Heartache. While country western is not my favorite genre, this song works....in fact on some days it's my favorite track on this CD. But frankly there is so much depth on this CD, so MANY good tracks, that I have different favorites on different days. The only two tracks that have not stood up to repeated listening for me are Falling Slowly and I Believe if I Fall in Love it will be Forever, but I suspect that this is because I don't connect with those lyrics particularly well (the first time I fell in love, it WAS forever) and not because the songs aren't good. So to summarize, variety, outstanding musicality, and something for everyone! Yes, this definitely could be the one....
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This app was really good when I first got it, but after the last couple of updates, I would say it's excellent! There are some sounds I don't care for, but to each his own - I just don't listen to those. The app now allows mixing sounds and you can increase/lower the volume of each individual sound to your taste to make the perfect sleep mix. You can also download different sounds from the website. Can't really think of anything this app is missing - Even the FREE version offers several good, generic sounds. Great job, TMSoft!

B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again! I have never read another author who can suck you into his stories and make it almost impossible to put the book down. The book was amazing it gets the reader hooked as soon as you start reading it.  It was a fast paced read that kept you wanting more.  If you are a fan of the Harry Bosch series you won't be disappointed with this one.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|I finished this book this afternoon and can only described it as a cross between the Autobiography of Buffalo Bill and Jane Eyre. I found the book well written and worth the read but chapter after chapter is filled with unbelievable situations and family interactions that are cruel and cold.  This is not written as fiction but is promoted as the life story of Shirley McClaine's daughter. Is it true or a fictional story for financial gain and publicity?  I do not know.  The book was not at all what I expected.  Am I sorry I read it...not at all--I love a good book.  Do I take it as fact?  I am wondering that myself.
1451696205|5.0|To be clear, I actually saw the film before I read the book, but I'll discuss the novel first as its the original. Perks is a teen coming of age novel set in 1991.<br /><br />This is a compulsively readable book. Casually,  before picking at the flaws, this is the kind of book you read in one sitting. Every time I run across something this engaging, I feel an intense relief -- pleasure really -- because so much of what I read is a bit of a chore. Probably just me being jaded. So while I'm going harass Chbosky on a few fronts, any criticism should be framed in context: This is a novel that really sucks you in and holds you.<br /><br />As to voice. Technically, the book is epistolary. The protagonist, Charlie, writes letters to some imaginary friend. It's a gimmick that neither adds or subtracts. This is basically a first narrative with a slightly confused back and forth between past and present tense. The writing is deliberately clunky. Chbosky is trying to sound like a 15 year-old boy -- and a gifted one at that -- but he does it by being wordy and stilted. I'll give an example:<br /><br />I am trying now to practice not to do that. He also said that I should use the vocabulary words that I learn in class like \\"corpulent\\" and \\"jaundice.\\" I would use them here, but I really don't think they are appropriate in this format.<br /><br />My inner editor would rewrite this as:<br /><br />I'm trying to practice not to. He also suggested I use the vocabulary words from class like \\"corpulent\\" and \\"jaundice.\\" I would, but they might not be appropriate in this format.<br /><br />This clunk-factor lessened after the first third, and I'm not sure if it was because I adapted or because the character was maturing. Either way, it does provide a bit of youthful feel and the frank honesty of the voice is highly engaging. Charlie is a straightforward reporter, cold even, rarely leaping to extreme judgement. He is most definitely not snarky.<br /><br />For me, the early 90s setting was a big plus, as it's free of some of the annoying distractions of the post internet age (cel phones, Facebook, etc). It's also nostalgic, being closer to my own high school era, even if Charlie is a good seven years younger (my Freshman year was 1984, his 1991).<br /><br />The character development is very good. Charlie, Sam, and Patrick are all very well crafted and distinct. Likable too.<br /><br />In retrospect, after finishing the book, I feel several elements of the story construction are a little forced. It seems unlikely that two seniors like Sam and Patrick would take a Freshman under their wing and into their social circle quite so easily. Not impossible, just a bit contrived. More substantially, the major \\"twist\\" in the story feels a bit forced, unnecessary even. This is a book with a clear theme. The writer even states it, several times: \\"We accept the love we think we deserve.\\" Fine. But there sure is a lot of abuse flying around. Like 90% of the major characters experience it at some time or another in their lives. I don't mind these themes, but to have the same \\"startling\\" thing happen to not one, not two, but many characters feels forced. All this thinking was only in retrospect. While reading, the novel just draws you in from start to end.<br /><br />Having seen the film first, which is sexually rather tame, I was pleasantly surprised to find quite a bit of frank sexuality in the novel. I'm not sure why it was removed, and it's presence provided punch. Nevertheless, it's pretty incomprehensible that a smart well read 15 year-old like Charlie wouldn't already know about masterbation. Again, a little forced. This book has a lot of forced moments, they just play off well.<br /><br />So I must reiterate, these are intellectual nitpicks on a compulsively readable novel. One last observation: It's odd that Chbosky published this in 1999, went on to sell a bundle, yet has never published another novel.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of Untimed and The Darkening Dreamng Dream

0425252868|5.0|My God, what a book! Adam Makos with Larry Alexander bring us this harrowing and chivalrous story of two World War II Air Forces. This is not just a story about an incident involving a German Messerschmitt BF 109, and a U.S. B17 Flying Fortress. No, it's also about  both sides fighting with courage and perseverance, while maintaining a healthy respect for each other. The German Air Force fighter pilots were not Nazi Party members, in fact their attitude was a thorn in the hat of the German Reichsmarshall Hermann Goering ( German spelling ). They fought because they had no choice, fly or die.  On page 288, the pilots attitude is confirmed when Major Hohagen of the German Air Force tells a joke to one of the book's protagonist, Ace Franz Stigler: \\" Hitler, Goering, Himmler, and all of their friends are out on a boat at sea, there's a big storm and their boat sinks! Who's saved?\\" Franz knew the joke. \\"Germany.\\"  If a political officer overheard this joke, by law they both would have been executed. Herr Goering would occasionally slip a political officer into the ranks of the Air Force to get the flavor of the pilots. I extol the effort the authors made to bring the readers this compelling non-fiction Pulitzer Prize worthy story. I know that says a lot, but you haven't read this book.<br /><br />The book opens with the story of Franz Stigler, a German Messerschmitt BF109 fighter pilot, who completed 487 missions by the war's end. It focuses on his time served in North Africa, and his service defending Italy and Germany from U.S. and British bombing raids. The reader meets many aces; such as, Hans-Joachim Marseille, the Star of Africa, and General Adolf Galland, leader of all fighter pilots. Most of the fighters we meet are holders of the Knights Cross ( 30 or more victories ). Bear in mind that you are going to feel empathy for these men, even though they are the enemy. They fought bravely for their country, not for the Nazi Party. They fought with honor and with a knights chivalry throughout the war. They had a code of ethics similar to the American fighters and bombers: they didn't shoot a parachuting enemy pilot, nor mistreat them as a POW. Unfortunately, that can't be said if the SS did the capturing. It's sad that the typical German citizen hated the German fighter pilot at the end of the war because: \\"You didn't keep the bombs from falling.\\" That's a pretty sad statement since no one could stop thousands of B17's dropping bombs everyday. The Germans called our monstrous B17 flying fortress, \\"the four motors.\\" Each plane rained down twelve 500 pound bombs each trip.<br /><br />The second part of the book tells the story of a twenty year old American pilot, 2nd Lt. Charlie Brown ( Not of Snoopy's Red Baron squad ). He is a member of the 379th bomber group stationed in England. You are going to like his crew; Al `Doc' Sadok, Robert `Andy' Andrews, and Spencer `Pinky' Luke, to name a few. They get into a now famous incident with Franz Stigler on Charlie's first bombing raid as a Captain that winds up becoming the title of this book. My definition of `A higher call' is \\" vacating a duty for a better one, or \\" It's God's wish \\". I don't know if the author had my definitions in mind, or not. You might ask, What is the incident? Well, I can't tell you! I guess you will have to read this wonderful story yourself. By the way, this book doesn't read like the history that it is, instead it reads like a novel, such as Erik Larson's In the 'Garden of Beasts'.<br /><br />The third part of the book deals with Goering's dissatisfaction with Germany's famous fighter pilots led by General Galland. He would like them executed for treasonous statements, and he accuses them of being cowards, but they are too popular, so he makes them form the JV-44's unit ( the squadron of experts ). They are responsible for defending Germany against the massive U.S. bombing raids in the last months of the war. Goering figures that they will die quickly against overwhelming odds. He forgets that these men are legends in their own time: Franz Stigler, Major Gerhard Barkhorn ( 301 victories! ), Col. Luetzow, Oberst Steinhoff, Oberst Roedel, Major Hohagen, Oberst Trautloft, and Hauptmann ` the count' Krupinski are the main flyers. This part of the book was very exciting and sometimes very sad. The rest of the book deals with: What happened to these men ( German and American ) after the war was over, and the ensuing years? Well, like Arte Johnson on the 'Laugh-In' show used to say: \\"It's very interesting\\". So is this gripping book!verwhelming odds.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn certainly knows how to weave the tapestry of a twisted tale! I couldn't put this down. Also, without spoilers, I couldn't decide which of the two I disliked more by the end of the story. You will have to read it for yourself.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love it. lots of fun and perfect time killer.  highly recommend it to any horse lover. my favorite game at the moment and probably will be for a long time
B0054JZC6E|2.0|You play a lot of games over and over collecting enough points to level up.  Most of the games are really simple of course, and there are a few fun ones, but nothing that will keep you entertained for long.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|It is a really great when I wake up at 6:00.but it is very loud and hurts my ears. So it is ok.
B00AJLHULW|4.0|The Inside Story from many years ago is one of my favorite Robben Ford albums. Bringing It Back Home is a perfect bookend to that album. A similar careful choice of songs played with restraint yet good taste and memorable riffs and melodies. Hard rock cliches inundate so many blues releases today that CDs like this from Robben are welcome. Robben's vocals go down very smoothly, particularly on his cover of Most Likely You Go Your Way And I'll Go Mine. Robben sounds like Boz Scaggs on Oh,Virginia and even a bit like Mose Allison on Fools Paradise. No hot dog 200mph chord changes here. Robben uses an economy of notes like Ronnie Earl can do with such grace and skill. I suggest you bring this album home
B0094K1WZE|2.0|Overall, the story was wildly implausible, so much so that I just stopped caring and just skipped through large chunks.  Even the action sequences were ridiculous.  I'm all for escapist action movies like the Bourne series, but this failed miserably
B007REV4YI|5.0|This is the best of the Daniel Craig Bond films.From start to finish lots of action this is a must have .
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Enjoyed book, a page turner for me. Lovely love story. Would read again. Would recommend to a friend to read.
0670026603|5.0|I had heard about this book in one of my magazines and it sounded interesting. Once I started it, i couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|Excellent acting, excellent story, based on an exceptional book, with a fabulous soundtrack. One of my favorite movies of 2013.
B008LG6SXS|5.0|I have tried a great deal of sites, booking.com just has it going on.  Great options for last minute cancelations making it easy to come back to.  I trust them!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A throughly enjoyable glimpse into hamlet and village life with loveable characters of all ages and personalities.  A relaxing show to watch curled up with a cup of tea on a rainy day.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|I have most of Miles albums and this was a must to have.The pull out and DVD alone is worth it.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Found the book to be well written, kind of different, probably interesting to younger female readers and older ones as well.
B008XG1X18|1.0|so disappointing, every time I try to sign up im told I missed an apparently invisible entry. ridiculous glitch. to bad too.
1932735410|5.0|Although it may be repeated over and over again, I can't help but add my voice to others for the need to purchase this book if you are prepping to take the PMP exam.  The PMP Exam Prep provides key information for getting your head around the right concepts and getting the right mindset for taking the exam. There are also a lot of good exercises, exam questions, and lots of key concepts to be aware of that are not in the PMBOK, but that come from real-life (that not all PMs have had the pleasure of experiencing themselves) that PMI expects you to know from your 4500+ hours of REAL experience.  There are also many references to other guides and exam prep aides offered by RMC Corporation that are available free or low cost once you buy the book.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I recently built another pc with this and a MSI Z77 motherboard.  This processor seems quicker @ 4ghz than my own system which has an i5 2500k @ 4.3 ghz on an Asus Z68 motherboard.  Only con: runs a little hotter than the 2500k.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this game! A few levels can be challenging, but most are fun enough to get all the gnomes without pulling my hair out and throwing my tablet across the room. So much more fun the Where's My Water, because I can play, as well as my kids and grandkids! Hope you all plan for lots of updates, we really enjoy this game!
B003K1EYM6|5.0|This works seamlessly with my iPad! I needed only to plug it into the charging port on my iPad, and it imported the photos on its own. I have told many people about it and will continue to do so.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Really enjoyed the entire story - felt like I was right in the pages of the book with Katie (Erin).
B003G4W49C|2.0|Recommended to me by a friend, as a &#34;must read&#34;.  It was just ok. Would not recommend to anyone as a &#34;must read&#34;.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|WOW as usual I cannot put this book down haven't finished it but it skips to different characters as each chapter continues so it makes you want to continue to hurry and find out what has happened - very good read!
B000OCXIDK|5.0|I will definitely read this again, as it drew me into the protagonists world. Well written & researched. Made me cry.
B0012FHGCW|4.0|I had read some negative reviews on this video and almost didn't watch it because of that. I found the movie kept my interest quite well and I found the story very interesting. I can't help but think, though, that this guy had no business going off into the Alaskan bush in the first place, especially by himself. I can't say that I am surprised by how the movie ended but it is a shame he wasn't better prepared.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a real fun game I am addicted to this game it is sssuuuuuppppeeeeeeeeerrrr fun me and my family cannot stop playing this game I love it
B006GWO5NE|5.0|It is quick and easy. I can plug it in at night and during the evening unplug it and I am ready to go.
0547884591|5.0|I purchased the 4 Hour Chef for equal parts inspiration and instruction.  Rather than using it as a cookbook exclusively, I read it in bed (though it's kind of heavy for night time reading--literally!)  The book inspires me to incorporate simple planning and purpose into my life--in a way that extends far beyond food prep.  The recipes are genius and his approach is a no-brainer pathway to impressive meals.  Love Tim's work.  HIghly Recommend.
034580404X|5.0|My wife can't put it down, before work, after work,when ever she get a chance.<br />We went on a short week end trip, same thing, read it whenever she had a chance.<br />Best part is she gets very amorous.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Can't put this one down. if I didn't have to work or sleep I'd play it all day. I recommend this game to anyone that loves dragons.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game brings out my inner nerd(: I love it, me and my boyfriend play it all the time.. its really hard to get bored while playing. there is always something to do or places to explore. buyyy$
B008AK8FHM|5.0|The book was very well-written and included both the spiritual and medical perspective.  Refreshing to see proof of heaven written by a doctor who previously was a non-believer.
B005TBWN0K|5.0|I love to draw and this app can save these sketches to evernote so I can see them from my laptop and I would never lose them
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I selected this book because of the price and the good reviews, I was not disappointed.  The author Elizabeth Hayes wove a story that was full os suspense and intrigue.  This book kept me up a night and occupied during the day, I could not put it down.  The writing style is a bit unusual, but once you get into the flow of the story it works perfectly.  Highly recommended.  You will get your money's worth, but beware, any savings will go towards a manicure.  This is a real nail biter!
B000SEFNMS|5.0|Very insightful and moving.  Should be read by all outdoor enthusiasts.  Great to share among a book club or for a group reading.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this book. So much more information than the HBO series. I've seen the second series, hopefully the next book will be just as good!
B005DOKM9M|5.0|Attactive and a good protection for the Kindle Fire screen.  Wish it came with a cleaning cloth to have readily available in order to clean the screen surface.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great series.  I don't know what more to say, you're missing out if you don't read this,  and for 5 bucks????  Do yourself a favor and make a good decision for once.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Having the episodes on DVD I was able to watch the entire season in just a few nights when ever I wanted.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love that anytime I have a concern about the weather in my area, I just look at my phone and it gives me peace of mind to at least have the latest on the weather stiuation.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|The cast is wonderful together & stories are top-rated. Contains a good blend of mystery and action, very interesting and entertaining for all.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|Good drama and realistic events.  Very easy to pick up and watch another episode since a summary is included of the previous shows.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I lost count of how many times I have seen this movie and<br />it still fresh to watch it !
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It was a little slow in the beginning. Once it picked up it was hard to put down. Best book ever!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game the dragons look so real. At first I thought it was so boring but then my cousin showed me what to do. And now I LOVE it. Please listen to this review and if you don't already have the game get it NOW!!!!!!!!!!!;p
B001B51B9M|5.0|I love this movie and hadn't seen it for at least 20 years.  Now my three-year-old grandson loves it too!
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|This is an interesting show and I thought the acting was pretty good.  If you like British television then I say give it a go
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so awesome. I hate but it's amazing because when you get 7 notes he pops up at least 6 times. Buy this app it's worth the money
0762439009|5.0|I picked this up for a friend of mine who's a big Big Lebowski fan (aren't we all?) and all I can say is that he absolutely loved it. As he took each item out of the package, it basically triggered a sequence of uncontrollable laughter, Big Lebowski quotes and references (Nihilists, mouse pads holding the desk together, being a Little Lebowski urban achiever, you get the drill) and the kind of festivity that only comes when someone is basically geeking out. If you know a Lebowski fan in your life, you get them this asap. At this price, you might as well pick one up for yourself as well...you'll want one once they start opening it (I know I sure did).
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I use this as my regular alarm clock. I like the ringers for it and I like how I can set several different alarms for to go off on different days. It appears to be intended for use on a phone but I use it on the Kindle Fire and really like it.
B005PK56TA|5.0|I ended up watching the second season as it aired on FX before I watched this on prime. Watched the entire season in two sittings over one weekend! Very unique concept for the show, deep and interesting characters. Can't wait for the third season!
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I really like this mahjong. Has many, many games & graphics are great. The music is relaxing, also gives you chances to better your score.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Absolutely one of the finest books I have read, I would recommend without hesitation to everyone. The horrors of war, the sanctity of life are in your face and when all is said and done, the spirit of living, and of caring, emerge through the rubble. Dr A.
B0083Z614S|4.0|The best part is when Mary finds a child.... then everything gets better just from this certain part................. to fill up space
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've read all of Steven King's books and am a huge fan.  This book is really good, classic King.  Not one of my all time favorites of his, but definitely a good read!
B005O30Y5Y|2.0|I cannot ever imagine being more disappointing in a digital product than I am with &#34;UltraViolet&#34;. It's very nature defeats the purpose of having a digital copy. It does not allow you to download the movie onto your iPad. It tries to stream it, and of course to do so, you need an internet connection. Whenever it does let you download a bit, it still needs an internet connection to initialize. Ergo, I bought a &#34;digital edition&#34; that I can only use whenever I'm in a situation where I could just watch the bloody BlueRay, Thanks, UltraViiolet.
1601251505|5.0|I have been a happy user of this book for years.  I bought this for my sister, who has now started up her own gaming group, and it is worth the cost three times over.
0143034901|5.0|I read this book when it first came out, and I just had to add a copy to my library. It is one of the best books I have read in ages!
B00AHXDECG|5.0|This CD did not disappoint! I listen to this a lot while I am doing computer work when the kids go to bed. I love every song!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really really love this book.  I read it in less than a week.  Book was so good that I had to pick up the other 2 & of course finished them all in a matter of 2 weeks (combined time for all 3 books).
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This processor is at the right price-point for gamers. Any more processing power is typically wasted and the returns for price aren't worthwhile. I have a 2600k and bang for the buck goes to the 3570k. If you are looking at a video editing rig or a 3d rendering rig you will want to look at the i7 line, but for gaming this processor cant be beat for the price.
1419705849|5.0|my 10 year old daughter loves the series of books. She finds the books quite amusing and entertaining. The cartoon pictures used to express the wimpy kid's thought totally cracks her up!
B000AMJC2K|5.0|At first I thought I'll regret buying it but it turned out to be more than i expected. It was fabulous!
B008476HBM|5.0|I absolutely love this book. Though it's my first time actually reading a book AFTER seeing the movie, I have to say there were no &#34;spoiler alerts&#34;. This has become one of the few books that I will re-read.
B007QA3AH2|4.0|Absolutley hilarious and totally fun.  The entire cast was perfect and I was completely entertained from the beginning to the end!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It made me think of the world in different ways. The summary of the book does not do it justice.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|I love this processor. Great speed for price point. Barely any of your software is optimized to be run on 2 cores, nevertheless 4 cores. This will power anything you need.
1419702238|5.0|My 10 year old daughter totally enjoys this book. She hardly wants to put it down to eat or sleep.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Very easy to read and see .  I love this app more than the one on my cell phone.  Great alarm choices.
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great actors make this really work. Super hero fantasy for grownups. Loved the whole series. I wonder what comes next.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app I have ever gotten on my kindle! This game allows you to use your imagination and you will probably never get tired of it because you can do basically anything you want to. If you love minecraft already but you are no where near your computer this is the perfect app to get! WARNING: VERY ADDICTING!!!!!
B001PPLIEG|3.0|A Bond not very well done, no fault of Craig's. Has it's moment when it works but looks rushed, wrong direct poor story.
0062082353|5.0|I purchased this book shortly after I heard about Chris Kyle's murder in hopes that even some small amount of the purchase price would make it to his family.<br />I've since learned there is a foundation being created to help support the Kyle and Littlefield families.<br /><br />Chris Kyle was a hero and deserves more honor than he was given.
0810989956|4.0|Makes a part of a klovely gift for youths, along with the series of the Wimpy Kids Books. It makes the experience of reading the books more personal .
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|By far one of the best books I have ever read!! I completely understand why this book is getting such rave reviews. One minute I was laughing and the next, bawling my eyes out. This is one of those stories that completely entrances you and you just get lost in the pages. It was a quick read, mostly because I could not force myself to put it down. The beautiful love story the author creates between Hazel and Gus is unlike any other I have ever read about. Just every little detail in this book was beautifully done and I so wish this book had not ended. It is a must must must read!!!
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is the best of them all but I'm still waiting 2 read third wheel I'm sure it'll be nice
0525953728|5.0|Amazing window into the world of teir 1 special operations. Great read for the aspiring SEAL. Besides the fact that this guy was on the stack that sent Osama Bin Laden to hell, \\"Mark Owen\\" went on 13 combat deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan during his career as a SEAL. Great example for frogman hopefuls like myself!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Only gave it 4 stars because it becomes tedious earning points in the higher levels to unlock games.  Some of the games have unclear directions and it takes a bit to figure them out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Against common sense regarding perfection in anything, &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is perfect, that's all. The writing is phenomenal, each scene a brilliant playlet!  The general audience has never had such luck.
1419701533|5.0|My daughter was blown away when she she received the set of books for her tenth birthday. She is reading now more than ever!
B001GV09FS|5.0|It was just like being there again. The movie and music took me back in my personal history. Really fun.
B0012YYZYK|5.0|I thought they did a fine job at transferring this to blue ray! The sound and the picture were fantastic! A keeper...
B001EBWITA|5.0|loved this flick ,scenes are intense,action is non stop. hoped they would make another part. so many other stories to be told.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|It was a great reading but not the best of three.  It was a little slow, especially compared with the second book.  It was full of stories and had a great deal of complexity, dynamics and details in each branch of the story; however, some of the interesting characters were not fully developed.  I liked the ending; it had a nice finish to the wonderful complex suspense-thriller trilogy.
0062082353|5.0|Waiting for right time to read it. Was former POW and am just now, 42 years later able to read stuff like this.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I loved the book, first book I read from front to finish in a long time!!!! I've been recommending this book to everyone I know single and married!!!
B0001I561E|5.0|This Movie is a classic.  The picture looks great on DVD. My kids loved it from the moment it started.  No cons, there's nothing to complain about this movie.
B00026ZG10|4.0|Good movie one of his earlier ones but a good actor is always a good actor usually, and hope so !
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is fun I play subway surfers ever day my friends play it ever day<br />So time it frez up and I have to start over
0385366752|1.0|I listened to almost all of the first CD and found it too boring to finish. It might get better but you sure will need a lot of patience. Not worth the money, for sure!
B004SBQALA|5.0|I Am Number Four is definitely worth the money. My only complaint is that there still isn't a Part 2 for this movie, and it's been out for a while now.
B004QZ9PLU|2.0|Good character development and intriguing story line in the beginning which quickly turned into a predictable, unexciting second half. Had to double check and make sure I wasn't reading a high school creative writing assignment. I expected more from Nicholas Sparks.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I actually got this for my 2 year old who loves Angry Birds but always made the birds go backwards, lol.  With this one, it doesn't matter the direction she sends the bird bc it goes around the planet, so she loves it!
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This is a pretty good game.  While there is not much too the game it still manages to keep my interest.  It is a fun one to play.
B004P12SSW|5.0|I love musicals and this one is my favorite.....Cher is such a good actress and singer!!! This movie is one you will laugh and enjoy!
B007SZQXXI|5.0|I think it is one of his best. Much of the story implies a farewell as Shakespeare planned to end his theatrical career. That aside, my favorite plays by Shakespeare are the &#34;mystical&#34; ones including Midsummer Night's Dream. His imagination is as alive and bright is this last play as any other.
B005LAII80|4.0|I never made it out to see this movie so I was pleasantly surprised after buying it that the movie and 3D was so good. I would recommend this movie to my friends.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|This is one of the most heartwarming movies I have seen.  I just love the &#34;music&#34; theme & the endearing way this movie captured my heart from beginning to end.  Johnathan Rys Myers & Keri Russel really have great chemistry!
B0083Z614S|4.0|I loved this story!  I can't wait for spring to come so I can have my own flower garden.<br />Five stars
B007THA4FI|5.0|Loved this book!  Could not wait to see what would happen next with all the characters. Really enjoyed reading this.
0738711500|5.0|I love this set! The book has really clear explanations of all the cards - with great advice and insights. The cards are really beautiful as well. Finally, there's a chart to help lay out the cards for the celtic cross spread... this is really useful, and makes the process easier :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I was very amazed that this bible has all the version's all in one. With many extras. MUST HAVE. Don't miss out.
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I am a fan of the tv series.  I was totally unaware that this whole group of fiction exists as well.  I am having fun reading through them.  Formulaic, if you watch the show . . . there is kind of a pattern to that.  I am trying to figure out if Nathan Fillion IS Richard Caslte in this series or not.  I am delightfully surprised if he is.  This is a unique connection between screen and print, so I look forward to reading more of them.  Not a heavy literary read, but fun and in my favorite genre!
0765325950|5.0|I enjoyed the series, there are parts of the ending I don't like but that is just me. If you have followed this series you need to read the ending, regardless of what others feel.<br /><br />Requiring a certain amount of words is stupid amazon.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love Mahjong. I was so happy to find this for my Kindle. It has a great variety of the tile games.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Did you ever wonder what a dog is thinking?  Now I know that dogs really have thoughts and feelings.  Their love is unconditional, they just want to please their owners.  This story was touching and enlightening.  I enjoyed it!
0375842209|5.0|One of the best books I ever read!!  It was a unique glimpse into the holocaust from a perspective I had not anticipated.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This app is very easy to use. I do sale on eBay and having this app at the touch of my fingers will make me money. Business is easy when you have the right app.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the second time I brought this book.  I already had a hard copy, but wanted one for my kindle.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I really liked the story and the storyline. It was vey creative and he amount of research incredible. But, it seemed like Stephen King delved into too much detail and the writing became too drawn out. While there were parts where I could not put the book down, there were many where I wanted just to read on to get to the next chapter.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Wish I'd read the real reviews before wasting my time on this app. Played for about 2 minutes and realized this game is highly overrated. Uninstalling. Game lacks meaningful instructions and is not engaging whatsoever.
0399213015|1.0|I was very disappointed when I received these books for an upcoming event.  I knew they were going to be small, but I didn't think I would need tweezers to turn the pages! Wish I would have read the reviews before hand, like another reviewer wrote \\"It's smaller then a dollar bill!\\" =(
B0064W639K|5.0|This was a great example of fantastic story telling. Batman is, in my opinion, the best deep character driven comic book hero of our time. I recommend this book for readers of Batman. The Long Halloween had me on the edge of my seat.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|When I purchased this book I didn't think I would read the entire thing because I don't like sitting around that much and I figured it would be kinda dry leading to the Osama attack.<br /><br />I was completely wrong, I was glued to the book from the time I got it, the entire thing just keeps you on edge and experiencing the whole thing like you were there.<br /><br />I'm truly grateful that these men had what it took to make changes on the fly and still be as effective as they were, I thank the men and women that serve our great country everyday for the things they have to do to keep us safe.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|has a few curves which is good.  nice light reading to take your mind off of things for a while.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I was enjoying the game so far, but today it was loading and it took me back to the kindle menu. Tried to install in again, but it kept having problems.  This game is garbage!
0738702994|5.0|This is such a beautiful deck! The card quality is great! The images could be a bit bigger but I just love the cards, perfect size and everything!
B001JEPVDM|5.0|1994 is a hideous reminder of how useless the United Nations can be when it is confronted with complex problems; this book is a testimony of this reality. In this book, Romeo Dallaire vividly explains the Rwanda Genocide and the different events that trigger the  bloodbath.
B004UXUUDA|5.0|Great movie, compeling story.  Pulls at your heart strings.  Did not disappoint, although I had read the book.  A must see.
1423140591|5.0|great book all percy jackson and friends adventures are fun to read and really enoyable cant wait for the next books in this series
B000YDAYQS|5.0|Wear it when the snow is rather heavy and it's really sturdy, and I need to walk uphill at my city (providence) so I don't slip and fall. It looks good too c:<br />Customer service is excellent, had a size too smal and then had it returned which was a seamless process.<br />Would recommend this shoe to anyone out there looking for some good ol' walking boots
B0001CCY7E|5.0|Some how, My faverate CDs keep going missing. I think it's my fault for leaving them in the multy players in cars when I trading. I have thought about it after gitting home with the new car,  then going back or calling the dealers, and guess what, nobody has seen them: Larry
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|Who doesn't like all the Karate Kid movies?? I bought them all on Amazon just to have the whole collection to watch when I want and to show my future children!  :-)
1599290634|5.0|Great as always.  This is a magnificent series of cool art work.  Different styles of work are well represented in an excellent format.
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I liked the idea of this book but it was as if I was reading &#34;Sleeping with the Enemy,&#34; also a book turned into a movie, all over again. I don't understand how one could write the same material, changing a few things along the way, and it not be plagiarism.
1423140605|5.0|i enjoyed this book very much it was great. of coure i enjoy all adventures of percy jackson and friends. i cant wait for the house of hades!
1457514508|5.0|The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club opens on a lovely morning in Savannah, Georgia, with your friendly neighborhood contract killer preparing to execute his latest job. Rewind the clock by about a week. The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, a group of older women with a shared fondness for canines and cocktails, sigh about the impending death of one of their own. Thelma is on the verge of succumbing to cancer. Two of the ladies, former Vegas showgirl Carla and wholesome housewife Cindy, already have their eye on Thelma's soon-to-be widower, mayoral candidate Elliott. We are also introduced to the club's queen bee, an eighty-something-year-old named Heidi, and to several of their neighbors, including Kelly and Tom--a young couple with Hollywood good looks--and newlyweds Veronica and Doug. And then there's the neighborhood villain: an old man who fails to clean up after his dog during his walks in the park.<br /><br />Each member of this idyllic suburban neighborhood harbors a dirty little secret. Or, if they don't at the beginning of the novel, they do by the end. The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club follows each member of the community through their intertwining lives. Picture perfect on the outside, not so much behind closed doors. One of them is the contract killer's victim, and one of them the employer. But who? And why? With everything that's going on in Gordonston, everyone is fair game.<br /><br />Whitehead successfully employs the third person omniscient perspective in his novel to give the reader insights into each character's thoughts and motivations, often within one scene. In an era where first person and limited third are in fashion, using the omniscient voice is a daring yet highly effective move. Although Whitehead writes with a distinctive lilt, the narrator for the most part seems invisible, a mere camera through which the reader watches the characters, none of whom is exactly what they appear. Whitehead wastes no words, somehow keeping the prose fluid and tight at the same time. As a result, the pages fly by while at the same time allowing a reader to become immersed in the language and descriptions. Honestly, this book contains some of the finest examples of the omniscient voice I've seen in contemporary literature.<br /><br />Whitehead seamlessly integrates the various intertwining storylines. The cast is large, yet each character is so unique that it's easy to keep track of who is who. Whitehead deftly guides the reader through the secrets, mysteries, and multiple plots, making The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club an easy, relaxing read. There is so much going on, and yet everything feels straightforward with the way Whitehead tells it.<br /><br />In addition to his plotting abilities and knack for creating memorable characters, Whitehead also possesses a real talent for descriptions. It's easy to picture the locations described in the novel, be it a town in Argentina or the luxuries of Paris. His writing style is mesmerizing, hypnotic even, and it's easy to get lost in the locations and the lives of the characters. My one criticism would be that he doesn't always let the reader know where in the timeline they are (for instance, there's no indication that the first chapter, with the hit man, actually takes place after the bulk of the book until you get close to the end).<br /><br />The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club is a garden of irony, a brilliant suburban satire on par with the popular American TV show Desperate Housewives. Part thriller, part drama, the multitude of questions hanging in the air make it a gripping page-turner, especially toward the second half, where the plot really thickens. It's a relatively short book, and I ended up reading the whole thing in a single day. With all the juicy details and shocking revelations, I just couldn't put it down.ose fluid and tight at the same time.

Add the clear print format making for easy reading the Word of God and you have the road for learning the  greatest story ever told.  Could anything be more beautiful?
B00AAQHP66|5.0|I went and saw this movie in theaters and fell in love fast!  Awesome waves, great actors, and an all out feel good movie! Gerard Butler plays a serious side in this movie and does a great job at it! Plays Frosty who teaches Jay how to ride big waves. Got its funny parts, but it also has its teary eyed parts. If you're a fan of surfing or the beach, check this movie out! Its pretty amazing! The message at the end says &#34;Live Like Jay!&#34;... After seeing how Jay lives with a smile on his face and always in a positive outlook no matter what life throws, Its easy to see why thats the message.

B00APUYWYA|5.0|This movie was highly regarded by my friends. They loved it and after watching it I love it as well
1554072840|5.0|My daughter used this book when she was a child and now that it is time for her daughter to potty train I thought it would be great fun and very meaningful to have it for her.  It was quick to find on Amazon after searching other databases and I purchased it at a very reasonable price.  Both daughter, grandaughter and i are please...
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Amazing true to life history, touching details of a family's life that is moving from  a stift, trite and exclusive position of the upperclass to modern productive and inclusive everyday life of the englishperson.  I really love how American money supported their non-productive lives.  The writers were intune to reality and gave a vivid protrayal of the downfall of the grandiose life of the English.  It was quite impressive to view humanity on two levels , one on the lordship level, the other on the servant level and watch how their &#34; ideas of correct behavior&#34; twisted the lives of all involved.  Keep these kind of series coming...Thank-you for excellent entertainment, Jaclynn

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found this game to be entertaining and exciting. It is the best thing since angry birds. I am not a gamer and they really don't hold my interest. However this game calls me to play.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|What can I say?  Have already pre-purchased the Fifth Season.  Can't wait to see what happens next.  This is one awesome show.
B004ZNACA6|5.0|Great product. I wish they could have had better packaging though. For me that wasn't a deal beaker. Its a good set if you dont have any other albums from the band(which I didnt). All I had was Dark Side so this was a no brainer for me. I've heard thousands of times the songs that the radio plays of Pink Floyd and the fact that you can get the bands entire catalog is why i wanted to buy this box set. I have a very nice stereo system and the sound quality of the cds are excellent in my opinion.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|Bought this to replace the old VHS version I had. This movie scared the *something* out of me when I saw it in a drive in when it first came out. I swear the video quality in this one is even better.

B004SUDPXW|5.0|This show just gets better and better.  Got hooked on the first Season and am now buying all of them.  Great acting.  You will be surprised at what happens - expectations are out the window.  Things like 'I never saw that coming' are heard quite often watching this show.  The wife is hooked as well.
B00942G4UA|4.0|These are the facts. Extreme cruelty to chickens. Makes me sad. We had chickens for 1 1/2 years but the gardens won over fresh eggs. Chickens love veggies. They are very intelligent and the sweetest loving little pets. Yes, they are pets, producing pets. Very sad how they are so abused. Ecoli - manufactured by the meat industry. They ought to be shut down or forced to send cows out to pasture. They are directly responsible for the many deaths from ecoli in this country. FDA inspected meat NO MORE. Seems like 20 or 30 years ago, I would regularly see a blue inspection stamp on meat. I haven't seen one of those in years. Now, I know why. Only a fraction of commercial meat is inspected. I knew in Canada 30 years ago not to eat U.S. meat because their standards are so poor. I've been in the U.S. for around 20 years. Recent trips to Vancouver and Toronto convince me that Canada still has high standards versus U.S. very low standards. This documentary proves it. Cows wading in manure up to their knees... this documentary tells the sad truth about the meat industry in the U.S. Too bad the FDA doesn't do its job. Not enough staff? Some excuse! So hire more people!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|Thanks! Great price for a brand new item definitely worth it and loved that it arrived early.  Trying to build my Bones collection and can't find the sets of seasons for greater prices! Good luck with your daughter's college fund!

1608955702|5.0|Just finished reading Neil van Niekerk's latest book \\"Direction and Quality of Light\\".  I have been waiting for months to get my hands on a copy of this book and I was not disappointed.  I love Neil's conversational style and the way he is able to concisely convey his message with the right level of technical detail that is useful and not overwhelming.  As a hobbyist, I hear a lot about \\"finding great light\\" and this book finally explains not only how to evaluate the existing light, but how to use it and what to do to make it better.  The material in the book is presented in a very logical manner and really takes you into Neal's head and conveys his thought process throughout.  He shows you where he started and step by step what he did to solve the problems he faced for each set up.  In addition, this book illustrates techniques from using only available light to more complex set ups using multiple light sources.  On top of it all, there is a bit of his wit and beautiful photos throughout.  I am excited to try many of these techniques very soon.

1616614609|5.0|If you enjoy two player card games like Magic: The Gathering, Lord of the Rings, etc. then you need this game. If you have played the ones I've listed then you've likely already heard about Netrunner. BUY IT.<br /><br />This game is what is known as asymmetrical, meaning that each player has completely different mechanics and card interactions. Unlike games like MtG, where the turn order and card setup is essentially the same between players, this game has two different roles: the hacker and the corporation. The hacker tries to gain access to the corporation's files in order to expose wrongdoing, while the corporation builds defenses and tries to burn out the hacker and destroy his/her mind.<br /><br />The cards in the set feature great art, are durable, and decks are highly customizable thanks to a few expansions that have been released. So far I have only played with the core set but there is tons of gaming available without expansions. You have choice of three hackers and four corporations so there's plenty to try out.<br /><br />Again, this game is pretty amazing. There's a decent learning curve but don't get discouraged. After the first game it will all make sense. I can't recommend this game enough.
B00004WG2F|5.0|Thankyou for five star quality dvd with and film worth any collection with good emotiotions<br />....<br />well done old school
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I am so happy with this purchase. I was nervous because it was inexpensive. but wow. love it. Its exactly like a $30 dvd set.
B007N5YIUS|3.0|I enjoy AB and its challenges. I play infrequently, while waiting at Dr. Office, Train Station or other places. It is a good way to pass time, when tired of reading on my Android.
1423140591|5.0|Great book, looking forward to reading the rest of the series. Waiting patiently for October for the last book comes out.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Like that it gave views from the husband and wife's perspective.  The book was the warrior's view and not political.
B004LROUNG|4.0|No B S here, just sit back and enjoy the ride. HOPE you enjoy the story as much as I did.
B00BEU6JVY|4.0|Great new music from Justin Hayward.  This isn't Moody Blues exactly but it still is worth the listen and glad I bought it.  He's put some good stuff together in this album and it was great to hear something new from him.  May not be the most memorable recording he has done but it is Justin and sounds great.  Would love to see the whole group work on a new project now.
B007FU1OH6|4.0|There's something about the Gregariousness and zest for life that makes for a Spicy combination when listening to a tale told by a Spanish Author. Particularily Carlos Ruiz Zafon.Its a special blend of Romance, Spirituality and Mystery which is something I seek out and enjoy when I want to relax with a good story. This book is part of a Trilogy which I would highly recommend.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Awesome! The costumes, the characters, and the sets were amazing. You felt like you were taken back to that time.
0345529057|4.0|First book was really interesting.  But then it started just dragging on and on.  A lot of Characters to try and keep up with.  I read complete set within a week.  I will buy the fifth book when it comes out.
6303419607|1.0|This item was not a 'three-pack' of movies, but two movies and a 'Trailer'.  I wish I'd returned them and gotten just one DVD.  My mistake.  I'd seen the movies before and wanted to see them again but I couldn't on my VCR.  Don't know what was wrong.  Next time I'll make the return, although this hasn't happened before or since.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not the best with working out solo at home to a DVD, but when I started my new job and began working a lot of hours, taking classes or going to the gym wasn't an option anymore.  I don't like to work out to begin with and definitely need to push myself to do so.  When I saw this DVD, I figured I'd give it a try. It was only 30 minutes, if that, and I was able to do it first thing in the morning before I leave for work.  My goal was to have energy got my long days but I always wanted to lose some weight and get toned.  I have to say I was able to accomplish all 3 goals with this DVD, along with eating right and taking vitamins daily.<br /><br />So I tried it for 30 days, lost 10lbs and was able to maximize my energy for the day.  I did it about 3-4 times a week on average, 2-3 days I would just use the treadmill, and have one day's rest.<br /><br />I liked the circuits the DVD offered between strength, cardio and abs.  They show the exercise routine for beginners and for other's that are more advanced. Out of all 3 workout routines, the 2nd was my least favorite, it required more coordination than the other two videos and I'm not that coordinated to begin with.  So I pretty much skipped it and went to the 3rd workout, which was my favorite of them all.<br /><br />Great DVD, I was skeptical but I definitely saw the results.
1423113454|5.0|I bought this for my 10yo son, who is Egypt mad (especially after our recent trip there), on the recommendation of his 11 yo best friend.  I was nervous about the number of pages (over 500), as my son is dyslexic, but he loved it so much, he plowed through it in less than 3 weeks and immediately asked me to by the 2nd book in the series.  Since he loved it so much, I decided to read it myself.  It's far better than I expected!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|So many twists and turns. I can't wait for the next book in the series. Amazing work from an amazing author.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|the search scenes were too simple and the game was pretty short. good story, though. I prefer big fish games.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best dictionary app I've found for the kindle. It has some interesting games on it as well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great Series! We will most definitely watch it again. Wish there were more programs like this.  Can't wait to finish the 3rd season.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This game is so horrible, after only reading the description I got all excited & downloaded it without reading the ratings. Wished I had, this game is as bad if not worse than they're saying it is in the 1* reviews. Shame on you programmers that hyped this game, you know your game isn't as you described. It should be free all year, not just as a FAOTD promo. Too bad, I woulda recommended it.. instead I'll have to badmouth it. SHAME. (delete)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Every episode is filled with excitement. I missed an episode and downloaded it on my Kindle Fire. How easy. No skips and stops or slowdowns. Smooth as silk. The price was really attractive. I know now not to get too worried if I do miss it because it will be there for me on Amazon.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|I really did not want to watch this movie, but I am very glad that I did. Great movie overall, and they really put a lot of thought and heart into it. The dialogue and witty comments throughout the movie were hilarious. An engaging movie where the writers, actors, director, and producers did a wonderful job.<br /><br />When I heard that MIB3 was being released, I was less than enthusiastic about watching it. MIB2 was silly, and I was not interested in watching another MIB sequel.<br /><br />Well, this weekend came around, and my wife were looking for a movie to rent (IMO, there really were not many new releases worth spending cash on at the theatres). Nothing caught our eyes, so we looked up MIB3 on Amazon. The reviews were very good overall with a lot of 5 star reviews, so it got my curiosity going. We took a chance and rented it.<br /><br />From the start of the movie, I was impressed. They kept a good pace throughout the movie, and it kept you interested and engaged. For the genre, it's definitely one of the best that I can recall watching recently. Will Smith, Tommy Lee Jones, and Josh Brolin all did a spectacular job. All their lines were delivered perfectly.<br /><br />If you are looking for a good movie to watch, you won't be disappointed with MIB3. Don't let MIB2 turn you off. This movie was artfully and soulfully put together. This was my favorite of the franchise.
B000EGCITG|5.0|Pink rocked this album and showed she still has great music to offer. I liked her last song on this CD that she performed with her father - awesome!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a good game. Addictive. But it can go a bit glitchy at , but that might just be my kindle. Good game though.
B00AOMV7VK|5.0|I have been a BVB fan since We Stitch These Wounds came out. This album tells the story of \\"The wild ones\\" standing up to F.E.A.R. I don't know if they could have done a better job. My favorite song has to be the overture! Jinxx did such a good job with all of the strings work in this album! Most definitely my favorite album!

B00AHSIQWE|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises was dark, both literally and figuratively.  Many times the lighting was so poor it was difficult to see what was going on. It was a good story. Our family members are not a huge Bat Man followers, so that might help you gauge.  We liked it, didn't love it.
B006XOBFJC|3.0|When the Rheingold was released in 1980-in Digital Recorded Sound!-there was a flurry of excitement! The first stereo Ring release since the Boehm ( the Boulez appeared not long after this release but was not fully Digital)-and from East Germany-in Digital sound!! To add lustre, there was the prospect of the superb Dresden Staatskapelle orchestra, a cast comprising exciting newcomers and established stars, and if the conductor was largely unknown to us, so was Solti when HIS Rheingold was released in 1959.<br />To be fair, the initial promise was fulfilled to a degree with Das Rheingold, which features a superb Alberich in Nimsgern, beautiful Rhinemaidens, a surprisingly youthful sounding Wotan from Adam, imposing Giants, a stylish Loge from Schreier and a general all round good cast. There are reservations-the orchestra sounds a tad thin on the ground, brass was rather \\"blowsy\\" in the Slavic manner- the conducting established a swift but not rushed \\"non-interventionist \\"style, in all aspects. Die Walkure was a major disappointment when released, and remains so in my view. The recorded sound is boxy, and if the orchestra sounded undernourished occasionally in Rheingold, it appears to be playing on a shift rota basis in this recording.<br />Siegfried Jerusalem is a fine Siegmund, though he still struggled with top notes at this stage of his singing development, Norman blasts out mellifluous tone as Sieglinde, though sounds in no way vulnerable-but Adam's voice has developed an raggedness and waiver that it make unpleasant to endure, and Altmeyer's Brunnhilde is sung here and throughout the cycle in a remorseless Stentorian bellow, which though steely and secure is wearing to the ear and depressing to the spirit.<br />The big moments, such as the Walkurenritt, are an embarrassment, and the recording is thin. What interpretation Janowski attempts is misjudged.<br />Siegfried is better, certainly better recorded with, Kollo using his resources and technique to give us a fine Siegfried in all 3 acts. I feel that Peter Screier tries too hard with Mime-he sounds uncomfortable-but Adam is less taxed by the Wanderer's tessitura. Altmeyer's contribution is mercifully brief.<br />Gotterdammerung is depressing except in two remarkable performances-Salminen's Hagen and Hans Gunther-Nocker's extraordinary Gunther.<br />The Hagen's watch is so chilling in this performance that it is almost worth the price of the set alone. This was his first recorded Hagen, and although Matti Salminen can still deliver pretty much the same vocal quality today-he does not appear to have aged-this is his finest recorded assumption of the role. Similarly, this is a dark brooding Gunther, craving nobility but craven about how he achieves it, the finest assumption of the role since Uhde for Keilberth (especially in the 1953 Mono recording).<br />Altmeyer is relentless throughout, and the Immolation is tiresome instead of riveting, and she is not assisted by much ill-judged conducting by Janowski.<br />The orchestra sounds better, but the Gibichung Vassals don't make up a platoon, let alone an army.<br />This set is due to be re-issued at a modest cost, and there is the thought-\\"better this than no Ring at all!\\" However, the 1966 Bayreuth Boehm Ring is BETTER recorded, better sung and masterfully conducted, and is similarly priced in the UK than this set at time of writing and must count as first bargain choice, and for many first choice at any price!. There are fine passages and performances contained within this Dresden set, but the sum of its part is-mediocre. I have to acknowledge that there those who greatly admire this set, and respond to what I have described as Janowski's utilitarian style-\\" it gets the job done with functionality but not embellishment\\"-\\" and must emphasis that this is my opinion, though it is widely held. Where I am adamant is on sound quality which is frequently thin, edgy and boxy and even the live Baden Ring available for about £15 complete with libretti on Brilliant Classics is better recorded (and is remarkably fine) - It will be of interest for comparative purposes, but is unlikely to be many listener's favourite. I'm sorry to report that the first two instalments of Janowski's complete Wagner Operas project on Pentatone fare no better than this except in sound quality, and the third one, Parsifal has made me resolve to buy no further recordings in that series. Recommended only to avid collectors. Stewart Crowemplete with libretti on Brilliant Classics is better recorded (and is remarkably fine) - It will be of interest for comparative purposes, but is unlikely to be many listener's favourite. I'm sorry to report that the first two instalments of Janowski's complete Wagner Operas project on Pentatone fare no better than this except in sound quality, and the third one, Parsifal has made me resolve to buy no further recordings in that series.

B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This is the true story of Shin Dong-hyuk. A man who survives and escapes the prison camp in North Korea he was born in. What he goes through, and what people living in these camps are still going through today by far surpasses even my most horrible nightmare. This story is amazing. It leaves me feeling outraged, stunned, grateful for being fortunate enough not to be born in his position. But too, I feel helpless now knowing his story and not knowing what I can do as a bystander to help others like him. Despite this, I think this story is important to know. It needs to be told. As for rating this book for entertainment value, I feel like that would be wrong. I think being aware of what's going on in North Korea is important. I wish everyone would read this book.

B001M3LG84|3.0|The DVD itself is wonderful.  Andre Rieu is fantastic.  Bought this DVD to add to the collection and missed the small print of this format being unsuitable for US DVD players.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|Outstanding movie with a great team of super heroes put to a huge test.  Marvelous story with constant action.  Excellent
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am not sure the limited edition set is any different from the two-packs of Season 1 and Season 2 that are sold together. But I opted for this one because I liked what the description said it contained, and I have not been disappointed. The picture and sound quality of the dvd's themselves are superb. Even the open-edged box itself, with the two separate dvd folders inside (one for each season) is attractive on the bookshelf. Of course, the real key is the contents, the Downtown Abbey series itself, every episode of which is absolutely magnificent. The actors portray the characters so wonderfully that you forget they are actors and not Robert, Carson, and the characters great and small who surround them. They make you feel that they are letting you in on their lives and their little secrets, and that you are right there, amongst them all. And that lavish manor house is so visually delightful, as is the country village and all the other trappings, from the costumes, to the cars, to the carts and carriages, to the town's buildings.  It is all so very real.  With every episode you watch you just hate it when it's over, so that you can't help staying up to watch &#34;just one more.&#34;  We are dreading when the last episode of Season 2 comes to an end.  However, by then I will have purchased season 3, and extended the delights.<br /><br />I am a huge fan of Jane Austen, and Downtown Abbey reminds me of a 20th century version of Austen-land, with lavishly-developed characters and scenery, twisting plots with a lot of things always going on, but all within the trappings of 100 years later, beginning with the sinking of the Titanic.<br /><br />So, if you plan to order season 3 separately and just need seasons 1 and 2, this limited edition boxed set for me fills the bill perfectly.
B008N1LL42|5.0|This is a great movie..I have watched it several times and each time I saw something new. The lead actor is a cutie and the supporting cast are good as well. Great storylines....I had to have it for myself.

B007C3TVNA|3.0|This movie did not make much sense.  The camera focused mostly on Tilda Swinton's depressed face.  I would not recomend this one.  Boring!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read this book as party of the Hunger Games Trilogy.  Loved the trilogy and the first 2 books I couldn't put down.  Mockingjay was good but for me a bit slower than the other two...still active great read just the same.  I can't wait to watch the movie to the first book and hope there are other movies to follow.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The &#34; Hunger Games&#34; by S. Collins is a excellent narrative story book. I can recommended to my friends and my relatives.

B002SR2PKG|5.0|I've been on a Stephen King kick lately and this book did not disappoint. Once I got into it I couldn't put it down.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed and cried during  this book. John Green did a wonderful job portraying Augustus and Hazel. The way his visions of the world is beautifully written and was and still is a great read.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|I bought this DVD because my bf was an extra in this movie and he is in alot of the extra scenes in the &#34;Making Of&#34; section.  Received this dvd within 5 days of ordering and was in excellent shape and will order from this place again

B008AWBQGW|5.0|This CD was much better than expected.  All the songs were old style LS songs.  It's true, they are Last of of Dyin' Breed
B000SEI230|5.0|When I started to read this book, I knew it would be a good one. Nicholas Sparks, how he writes, makes me laugh at times.<br /><br />As a person who was pretty much shunned herself, I could identify with the supporting character. Also, I nearly cried at the end.<br /><br />I would recommend this book, because it's clean & apart from the trash that is written by others.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|Another captivating book. Still couldn't put the book down. Can't wait to read the next two books. Hopefully they are jusa captivating.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. As good as the first book in this series. Look forward to  reading the next book 50 shades \\"Freed\\".
1476712042|3.0|I have to admit that I read this book in 24 hours because I could not put this down.  This book is what I call brain candy.  It is not great literature, but a very good love story.  I am a fan of Fifty Shades of Grey.  The main character in this book, Travis, reminded me a lot of Christian Grey.  They were both unable to hold a steady relationship and used women for sexual relations.  Travis  is supposed to the be the school bad boy that no one can tame.  Along comes Abby and all of that changes.  Again, Abby reminds me of Ana from Fifty Shades.<br /><br />The part of the book that was the love story was written very well.  I actually cried twice, I mean full out tears.  Once was when Travis did something while Abby was visiting, and the next part was Travis was begging Abby for something.  (I don't want to spoil anything for you).  Other parts of the book were very poorly written.  Abby claims that she moved to Eastern U to get away from her old life.  She is hiding some big secret.  When you find out what that secret is it's a big let down.  I was like, Really?!  That's it?!<br /><br />Also, I had a problem with the main characters being so young.  My oldest daughter just turned 14.  I would hate to think of her involved with someone like  Travis in 5 years.  The book is properly named.  They were a disaster together, but a worse disaster apart.
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|I bought this a long time ago and don't remember much of the details but since I review every purchase from Amazon, I do remember it was good.  I think I bought it because Morgan Freeman was in it.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Amazing - have no idea how ms gibbs was able to get all of the information and inside information that she did - the relationships between sitting and former presidents and the struggles current presidents go through and their seeking out help and advice from former riavals is amazing - it really humanizes our presidents
B007MAETA8|3.0|Since he was not singing 4 several days and getting back into the gruve again might had have an impact on the CD, but thats just my point of view. . Others might think it was great and thats cool 2, 2 each their own
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|Cinder is loosely based on the story of Cinderella.  There is the evil step mother, the step sisters, and a prince but don't think for a moment that this is like any other Cinderella story you've read before because then you would be missing out on something really interesting.<br /><br />Cinder is well developed and interesting.  As the reader I was quickly sucked into the story and found myself thinking of the characters as if they were real.  It was easy to understand Cinder's feelings of being an outcast and how she reacts in certain situations.  Even the supporting characters are written in a manner that makes them interesting, including the ones that you end up disliking.<br /><br />This was an excellent read and I was relieved to find out that the second book in the series \\"Scarlet\\" was released in early February.  By the way Scarlet is based on Little Red Riding Hood<br />and somehow get connected to Cinder.  I can't wait to see what happens next, I just hope the author writes quickly.

0783117523|5.0|I think this might have been her first movie and basically showed how the modeling agency uses woman, eats them then spits them out.  This is a true story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun plus when u update the game it takes you to different places! It never ask  u to pay any money!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Amazing... calm and soft love story. Easy going plot and characters. I love reading a book that takes me inside. Finished in less then 24 hours. Makes the reader feel all the emotions in good or bad relationship. Tears, anger, happiness, sorrow, frustration, loss. Great read.
B0091REZMW|1.0|I thought this game was too hard to say the least.  There were goblins running around the screen that you could not get rid of, you couldn't earn enough money/gems for energy and to buy items to rid the game of the goblins, etc.  I liked looking around the rooms, but some of the items were too small to find and time would run out, making it difficult to complete the quests.  I don't think I'll be playing this game again, I've removed it from my device.  If an easier version were available, I might consider playing again but I don't have hours to be frustrated attempting to figure out this game and failing the quests and being invaded by goblins, snowmen, elves, etc.  It's too bad this game is so awful as some of the ideas had potential.  I don't want to waste my time on games that you can't win or solve.
0451169514|3.0|There is no question that Stephen King's \\"It\\" is his most terrifying novel he has written so far. There's an intimidation factor involved with even getting started (due to its mammoth length, being around 1,100 pages long), and then getting through the slow beginning sections. It is a novel that you have to be patient with before there is much in the way of any payoff. This novel does not reward the faint of heart. As I kept pushing through It, I was rewarded with some really terrific scenes that are both emotionally powerful and haunting, but was also punished with some awkward and unnecessary sequences.<br /><br />\\"It\\" begins with a sequence where little George Denbrough, brother of main character Bill, goes outside into a rainy day to play with his paper sailboat. He gets to a stormdrain and sees a clown hiding out in there, and is subsequently murdered. He would be only one of many people killed in Derry, Maine, and as time goes on Bill and his gang of friends (called The Losers) would soon start to uncover the nature of this monster. In the second storyline, they have to return to Derry as adults to confront the monster again.<br /><br />As with everything else in \\"It\\", there were some great and interesting characters that King created. Bill has to deal with the death of his little brother, believing it was his fault while simultaneously having to deal with his parents' neglect. Beverly Marsh has to suffer her father's insults and beatings as a child, but still finds herself marrying a man who does the same thing. Ben Hanscom suffers the most torment from Henry (the bully) and his issues of being overweight. At the same time, Richard Tozier came across as annoying and immature, even as an adult, and Bill's stuttering issues got to be too much after a while. Beverly also gave up any credibility she had as a character after an awkward and uncomfortable scene at the very end of the novel.<br /><br />The biggest strength of \\"It\\" deals with the scare factor. I've never really been scared when I read horror novels, but this one got to me. Most of them appear in the first 600 pgs, but they are genuinely terrifying moments. The It monster can take any shape or form, come from anywhere, at any moment. There is a sense that none of the gang are safe. Additionally, having The Losers deal with Henry and his gang of bullies brought in some great moments and a great theme. All of them have to learn to grow up with their own particular quirks, and have to deal with people who will never accept them as they are. There's a really good message there, especially in today's times, though the theme loses some power when King uses the simple \\"he's crazy\\" cop-out that he is so used to using. One underrated quality that King posseses is finding the right words to use at a story's end. This comes out in full force here, as there are some sad moments of things (finally) coming to an end. If King would spend more time on his endings, then many more of his novels would be so much better (\\"The Long Walk\\" and \\"Under the Dome\\"). It takes a good 60 pgs for \\"It\\" to end, and they are strong pages.<br /><br />However, some scenes came across as just plain awkward. Two scenes in particular (both sexual) are not needed, and actually hurt the credibility of some of the characters. I understand King's decision to move the plot forward in this fashion, but I think he could have found a different way of doing so that wouldn't be as controversial. Both of them just seem fake and unnatural. With so many different characters being featured, I also felt that the original conflict was lost somewhere. More time could have been spent on Bill dealing with the death of his brother. The climax spent hardly any time on that conflict, and it could have been a much more powerful ending otherwise. Finally, the character of Tom Rogan didn't get enough time. His role is to help bring up the stakes in the finale, and his potential in this regard was ignored. Beverly's characterarc could have been much more impactful if she had to face Tom and fight back.<br /><br />In the end, \\"It\\" is truly a novel of horror. It has some very, very good scenes and some very, very bad ones. As a result, it is only slightly above mediocre in my view. There was a lot of frustration reading this as it seemed like it would take so much time to get to a payoff scene, and I can't help but wonder if many of the words were needed. Is there enough material in here to warrant 1,100 pages? I'm not so sure. I think it could have been much better with 300 pgs trimmed off. I found all the childhood sequences to be much more fascinating than the ones as adults, and sometimes felt the two different timelines hurt each other rather than helped. There's no doubt that there is artistry in how King formatted the novel, and he interweaved both stories as well as is possible.<br /><br />\\"It\\" could have used an editor to take out the abundance of useless sequences, as well as informing King of its more awkward moments and the few poorly drawn-up characters. However, the terror initiated and some other well-written sequences makes \\"It\\" well worth reading, as long as you can remain patient.<br /><br />3/5
B0085TKAW6|4.0|A great read and an interesting view of the history of this time period, illustrating just how much the world is at the mercy of a handful of power brokers.
B006ZS4G24|3.0|I found out I overpaid for this by $30 dollars over the in-store price, kind of felt ripped off after the fact. Looked like a much larger kit on the computer, it is pretty small though. The quality of the product was just fine however, no qualms with lego.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Quite a good tale here for folks who like mind games.  This is actually an exceedingly clever story; it's well written and carefully thought out.  While I can understand the disappointment some may have had with the ending, I think it ended the only way it really could.  Quite fun.
0756407125|5.0|So where is book #?? I  loved this and the first, thoroughly engrossing. full of twists and turns and unexpected delights!

B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this game and it is awesome ! You can do whatever you want to. You can make crazy hairdos.
1620402963|5.0|I read a New York Times preview of the TV movie, was intrigued and was fortunate to find this in book form.  A wonderful read!  The blending of two separate timelines was well done, flowing seamlessly from one generation to the other.  The story line reminded me of Scott Turow's \\"Ordinary Heroes\\", where \\"ordinary people did extraordinary things\\"  -  never ceases to amaze me.<br />A fascinating period of history and a little known fact (if at all) about the British efforts to entice the United States into WWII;  interesting tie in with the recent movie \\"Hyde Park on the Hudson\\".<br /><br />Well written, thoroughly enjoyable;  the literary prose flows beuatifully;  hard to put down...<br /><br />Will look for more books by this author
B00005JNQS|5.0|Originally the first time my 2 year old nephew watched this he didn't seem overly excited about it but eventually he brought it in and wanted his Mom to put it in for him to watch.  Now he loves it.  When he's watching it he laughs out loud at certain parts which of course is fun for us to hear!

B0036S4C6G|5.0|A wonderfully sad and impressive book of short-stories following the interconnected lives of “has-beens” and their loved ones. Time chases them all, leaving them in various states of disarray. At times it gives a dismal outlook on post-2001 America that may leave orthodox readers frustrated by the lack of traditionally-linear narrative, however, each chapter tells a compelling, affecting story, occasionally evoking George Saunders, with more pathos and less levity.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Really good book. Didn't want to put it down. On my favorites list. Would recommend to anyone wanting to read a crazy live story.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I am totally wowed and even blogged about Rodriguez in more detail on my  blog - search for joyleftowsblog. A great poet and phenomenal person who has so many talents he was pulled in multiple directions artistically, politically and socially. A great hit in South Africa for several decades he was mostly ignored here stateside probably largely to do with prejudice. Imagine a Mexican American import writing more meaningful and poetic lyrics than Donavan and Dylan combined. To top it all off, this man cares nothing for cash and gives all his proceeds to the needy. Rodriguez I love you your music your poetry and lyrics!
B00A7OIXW6|2.0|The main draw for this movie is, let's face it, the cameos. People went to see this movie to see Street Fighter and Mario characters in a CG Disney movie. What we have left is a rather lifeless movie which largely takes place in Candy Land. This is supposed to be a movie about video games and all we're left with is a kart race in one particular game. The original characters aren't particularly interesting and the storyline drags out for far too long.
B004H8GLXQ|5.0|This is a book to be reread.  The characters immediately come to life.  The imaginative plot line surprised and intrigued this reader.  The conclusion is in the vein of classic gothic tales – only this one is a modern tale.  I loved this book.
B00A77II0U|4.0|I thought this game was fun. But I got frustrated several times when I was unable to exit a scene without using the hint button.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read. I've seen the movie to but I can honestly say the book is way better than the movie I would rate the movie a 2 or 3 compared to the book. The detail the love and creativity put into this book amazes me. Also if u seen the movie and you think the book will be the same it's not and I wish I didn't wast my money on seeing it.

B008TT7CXW|5.0|After searching my house for a &#34;missing&#34; microSD card, I concluded I needed some method for storing these little beauties in a single location.  As usual, I logged into Amazon.com and did a search for SD storage.  Bam - a number of products were available at a reasonable price.  I opted for this particular holder due to its ability to hold both SD and microSD cards.  Currently, I have 3 micro cards, a standard SD card and an SD to microSD adapter stored in the card.  I have not had occasion to travel with the holder, but when I do, it will be no trouble at all.  The cards seem to &#34;lock&#34; in fairly well and the entire holder is quite firm and sturdy.  Best of all, no more lost microSD cards!  There are even blank forms on the reverse side for labeling the content of each stored card.  Brilliant product!

B004UC4HCG|4.0|I got this to replace an existing one that was going POSTal on me.  Would only POST after 2 or more tries.  This was becoming the norm... So thought I may be having MB issues and got another barebones one to move all the components over.  Bought 8 more gigs ram, so now, I have 16.<br /><br />Installed new and old ram, moved all the components over, including the i5 cpu.  plugged in all my cables, usb devices, etc.  Turned on and NO POST!  Argghh, I thought.  removed the older ram, still no POST.  Now I am sweating...unplugged all the cables except the monitor and wireless kb dongle.  Turned on... and POST !!  Hurrah...must have been some conflict somewhere...installed all the drivers, since the MB is ver 2 and my old MB was ver 1,  The ethernet driver needed to to be loaded, since that must have changed from my older MB.  Turned off, reinstalled the old ram.  Start up again, POST and then reinstalled all the usb devices.  Now it's working good.  Seems slightly faster with the 16g ram.  I am looking at a SSD drive next.  Probably Crucial M4, since it is one of the Shuttle approved ssd...<br /><br />I like the small form factor, I hope this one doesn't go POSTal on me in a year... Shuttle... if you are reading this... this is your last chance regarding QC...

B009D7CP2M|3.0|I saw the film first, which inspired me to read the book to get more in-depth character analysis and hopefully a more detailed account of the story. This book is very well written and edited, there is no doubt. However, it doesn't mean I didn't find flaws in it. The father is even more of a dolt in the book than the film. I found it incredibly difficult to believe this man would so blindly accept the word of his son after so very many \\"incidents\\". There were just way too many problems with the Kevin character that went unpunished it drew me out of the story. Could these parents be real? Also, I found the mother to be less than sympathetic.....oftentimes later in Kevin's life, I found myself agreeing with him about 'mumsy' and her black and white hard-ass attitude towards people and things. This book also suffers, in my opinion, in being quite long and drawn out. We read it as a series of letter from the mom, Eva, to her husband, Franklin, and I think the author could have cut 50 pages and still have made the point. This book is definitely not uplifting and can be quite heavy; the writing is well done, but the story is a tad too over the top for my taste.
B00AJLHU3K|4.0|Songs are great and guitar work amazing. He sounds as strong as ever. Great addition to my collection and listen to it often.
B003EV6DBW|5.0|A very nice introduction to Amy and the new doctor. Brilliant chemistry between the two of them. Keep calm and don't blink.

0061900656|5.0|My grandson has yet to hear this story but I have read it a few times.  He will be reading it with his mom once the baby comes.  It's a great book and a book that should help him adjust.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|If you asked me about the plot, I'd say it's identical to the Twilight series but with older characters. But it's a testament to Deborah Harkness that you'd never notice the similarities, and the characters are really, really amazingly done. They're consistent, likable, and you are constantly wondering what they are doing next. I was hooked as soon as I read the first chapter. The historical details and research about place and people is unmatched by any other author I've read or heard from since the 70s.
B000000XB9|5.0|For some reason, I had forgotten about Creedence as I rarely listen to the radio.  I was watching TV one day, and stumbled across an infomercial of music of the 60's, 70's, 80's, etc. and hearing a good song, I stayed on watching the show for probably a good 20-30 minutes.  Then they played a song from this album and that got me to do a search on Amazon for more.  When I found this album, and looked at all the titles, recognizing well over half of them, I knew I had to have it.  There are 20 songs on this CD, and 12 of them are now on my &#34;fav's list&#34;.  (talk about value for the purchase!)

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I've been using this one for quite some time very successfully.<br />There's little that it does not display and edit correctly and it is quite intuitive.<br />I recently saw a review complaining that it doesn't work without Wi-Fi; however, this is obsurd. Of course it does, it would indeed be pointless unless it could.
B0052TDGQO|3.0|so, when I saw that he came out with a country music album, I had to have it.  I have listened to the entire album about 3 times, and have picked off about 5 songs that I like for my &#34;favs list&#34;.  If I have any objection to his music, it's that some of it is pretty &#34;twangy&#34;.  That goes with the territory of this genre, but there's a little twangy and a LOT twangy, and some of his songs are too twangy for me.  Also, I generally prefer songs that do not touch on religion... I don't mind if there is a brief reference, but I will not listen to songs that are totally about the subject.  (don't bother to send me comments on this subject - I will not respond to them)<br /><br />On this CD, I only found 2 songs that I considered a 5 rating, and about 6 songs that I consider a 1 rating, the rest being a 3 or 4 rating.  It's because of this mix that I averaged him to a &#34;3&#34; rating overall.<br /><br />Scotty M's voice is really quite remarkable, and I hope he comes out with many releases of music in the future.
B00511ONPG|4.0|I am usually not a big fan of social media books, but I found this one decidedly impressive. Not only was it full of thoughtful real life examples, but I loved the action items and questions at the end of each chapter.<br /><br />I have been working with content for 10 years and I still found the content of this book useful and thought-provoking.
0896600009|5.0|We have been using this book for our homeschool art class. The kids study the picture, make notes of small details and write a &#34;background&#34; story of the picture, what they think is going on, what led up to it and what happened after.

B00005B4GU|3.0|Its okay, a good introduction to Radiohead, but always beware of \\"best of\\" albums. Most people who are captivated by a particular band or song work backward from what impressed them in the first place.

B0000DD7LC|4.0|The case was cracked and opened. I did not like that was described as the seal was intact because it was misleading to consumer. Other then that the CD worked well and did not have scratches.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I purchased this so I could play with my grandson. At first I was pretty lost, but I caught on fairly quickly. There are many things that I don't know anything about or how to do, but I have got to the point that I can play with my grandson.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Best yet. Love it. Very upbeat. Impressed with how many songs composed by Josh. He is growing by leaps, bounds.
0446580848|1.0|John Corey is extremely sarcastic.  Always has been in this series.  But, this time it was too much and every other sentence out of his mouth was a wisecrack -- many of which were borderline racist or xenophobic.  Regardless, the story drags on and there isn't much action throughout the book.  At one point, a psychological profile is discussed and the conversations seems to last an eternity.  I like this author's other books, but this one was a disappointment.  I may be finished with this series.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Is so true. This book is beyond amazing. It is well written, amazingly phrased, so cleverly developed there was no way I could've put it down even if I had tried. This is going to be a classic, I am sure of it!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Pretty cool if you ask me but it got weard when the new control's came out<br />but overall it's the best kindle game I've seen for a very long time.
1600610234|5.0|And even I like looking at the pictures and how interesting the information is. This is a book that science fiction lovers need.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Decent game. Energy shouldn't be so much of a factor but at least it doesn't take a really long time to get a refill. Can only play for a very short time.
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander's neurological background and logical thinking make his well-written treatise extremely compelling and believable.<br />It is very helpful and uniquely inciteful.<br /><br />B. A. Bast
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game, if your are stressed out really helps sooth you and quiets the body down.  Like the game, it keeps the energy just flowing.
031237593X|5.0|I love the kind of books that transport me to another world, but unfortunately, they are often few and far between. However, this book is by far one of the best in which to become completely absorbed. I really love the way SKP is able to juggle such a large cast of fully-fleshed characters, I feel like it gives you a much clearer picture of the main events when you can experience it from so many viewpoints. Whether you believe that Richard III killed his nephews or not is irrelevant; this book makes for a great read and is an intelligent theory as to what may have happened to the &#34;Princes in the Tower.&#34;<br /><br />I love the Wars of the Roses time period and had already had a good bit of knowledge of it prior to reading this book, but I don't think that is necessary. Readers may become somewhat confused at times because many characters share the same name, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment at all. Also, at nearly 1,000 pages with small font, be prepared that this book may require patience at times. Even still, I appreciated the length and always looked forward to picking it up again. I truly did not want this book to end, which is a rarity for me.<br /><br />I almost never buy books before I've read them (there are too many awful ones out there), but I'm glad I took a chance on The Sunne in Spendour and would highly recommend it. I also look forward to revisiting it again sometime in the future and starting on my next SKP book!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Play it all the time - love it!  I don't know what more I can say?  Really enjoy the game, ok?
B008476HBM|5.0|I had never read a Jane Austen book before, and found it to be a very enjoyable read. I can't wait to read more of her books in the future.
B009M588K8|5.0|This is a great read if you are interested in the SEALs. Provided a lot of insight into the actual planning that is required for such a mission.
B000065AU2|4.0|I recently bought Russian Roulette and Metal Heart. I always listened to Accept casually but I wanted some albums!! So I pick up Russian Roulette and I have to say, it isn't as heavy as their other offerings but it is catchy, and melodic. Udo's vocals are some of the coolest in metal. \\"T.V. War\\" uses some good double bass drums and starts this album off with a bang. Udo is spot on with this track and this is the fastest track on the album. \\"Monsterman\\" seems like a chance at radio play but I like this song. It is melodic, catchy, and downright fun. (Who said metal can't be fun?) \\"Russian Roulette\\" is a GREAT track. It starts off slow and builds up to the chorus, which is really powerful. \\"It's Hard To Find A Way\\" is the semi-ballad and was an obvious shot at radio play. And although not horrible, it seems like the album gets thrown off pace. Until...\\"Aiming High\\" Probably uses the most simple and overused riff in heavy metal, but it is a faster tempo than the other tracks (except TV War) it brings the energy back! And the chorus is killer. Wolf Hoffman is at his best on this track. \\"Heaven Is Hell\\" almost AC/DCish but with an Accept overhaul. Riffs are killer on this track. Another powerful chorus driven track. \\"Another Second To Be\\" another up tempo song. Udo's vocals shriek on this track and it is one of the bests on the album. (It makes me drive fast, trust me folks its a scary thing) \\"Walking In The Shadow, and Man Enough To Cry\\" are both mid tempo songs. And are more shots to radio play. \\"Stand Tight\\" closes this album out with some good heavy metal riffs. In conclusion, Russian Roulette is a classic, chorus driven, heavy metal album. Although about three or four tracks are shots at radio play, this is essential heavy metal bfore the band hits a low spot. Overall, its a must have.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I have been transported to the world of Lou and Will by the words of this amazing author! I laughed, cried, cheered, sighed, and spent time in places I've never been before. I look forward to reading other books by this talented author!
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|Every single book on Amazon.com has some 1 and 2 star reviews with exactly the same content: &#34;This book is not as good as the other books in this series, I was disappointed in it, didn't connect with the characters, the plot was absurd and the author phoned it in.&#34;  I'm not sure why people write these reviews, or what it says about the reviewing process here in general, except to point out that because every single book has a handful of reviews like that they are of absolutely no value in distinguishing good books from bad, so it isn't clear why people write them, as they provide absolutely no information.<br /><br />This book is no different than any other in that regard, and as always I am at a loss as to why.  &#34;Captain Vorpatril's Alliance&#34; gives us exactly what we have come to expect from Lois McMaster Bujold: interesting characters in implausible and entertaining situations.  It isn't quite as wildly inventive as some of the earlier books, but that's like saying some mountains aren't as high as Everest.  What it does do is round out one of the background characters in the Vorkosiganverse, and gives us some insight into Ivan's motivations and outlook, while entertaining us no end.<br /><br />It's extremely sad that rather than review the book, some people feel obliged to give us no information whatsoever about it.  There are many good &#34;summary&#34; reviews here, and they fairly represent the book for what it is:  a filling-out of an interesting niche in a richly imagined universe, with some more insight into Jackson's Whole, and Ivan's view of Miles and a few other things besides.<br /><br />If you're expecting this to be a carbon-copy of the previous books you're maybe expecting the wrong thing, and complaining about it here will maybe make you look a bit silly.
B00AW0KGYI|5.0|Of course I had already seen it about 3 times in the theater, but now it is just added to my collection! :-) I don't think the extended version is all it was cracked up to be, but it was nice to have it.

Get it! It's free!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is better than the the first but sometimes it would erased all the data. I'll be playing and then the next day it wouldn't let me play so I have to download it again.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is one of the coolest books I have ever read. Living through the 80s as a teenager and early adult this book strikes close to my heart. I would recommend this book to anyone who has ever played a video game.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I tried for the longest time to avoid succumbing to the Angry Birds craze but,having played this game on my Kindle Fire, I have to admit it's hard to put down.  Recommended.

B003CI90MQ|2.0|I love my camera and really wanted to learn how to take better pictures!  Thought this would be perfect.  A little too complicated in my opinion.  Need someone to ask questions!  Think I will just try to take a class at local college!  Then I might understand this book a little more!!!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I enjoyed this book I've read every other book in the series. This book was very exciting and very funny.
B000002VMD|5.0|I recommend this to everyone. Has all the songs from the movie. It's great to add to your music collection, and always keep the memory of Whitney alive.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great directing, cinematography, actors, make-up/effects, altogether deserving of the Best Picture Oscar. Had me on the edge of my seat for a good deal of the film.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|this is very well written and stays true to Austen's characters. The set up for the mystery is good and I like the dynamics of the relationship between Elizabeth and Darcy.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|This version put me right to sleep. Though the costumes were lovely, the acting was not. Very stilted and stiff. The characters didn't come alive at all and by the end of the movie I could have cared less about what happened.
B0006N2EZ0|5.0|I recommend this to everyone. Costner and Houston have amazing chemistry! This is a must have for your movie collection, Whitney's music is phenomenal.
B00915G6YE|5.0|I've been with Dexter from the beginning. I've read Jeff Lindsay's books, kept up with the show since it's first season, buying them each on blu ray as they were released. After season 3, my wife became hooked, and it has been an absolute pleasure for us to watch Dexter as he evolved. Alas, season 8 will be it's farewell season, and I cannot describe how missed it will be. It still stands, in my mind, as the best written and acted stories I've seen put to television. Some seasons have had its slow runs (3, 6, sometimes 5) but this show never ceases to amaze. And now we are at the brink; Season 7 proved to be every bit as good as seasons 1,2 and 4...And to be honest, I have no idea how Deb and Dexter are going to get out of this one. I cannot wait to watch season 8, and get this when it releases on blu ray. Stellar cast. Stellar story. Stellar everything. Kudos, season 7.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd was a lot of fun to watch! I never heard of Dredd and when I rented the movie, I thought It was going to be a low budget movie. I was very wrong. The special effects were believable and the characters were very real. The movie reminded me of Batman and Supper Cop with a lot of action and no dead spots.
B0093ST02E|2.0|I really like Michele Williams but not in this. This wasn't up to her standards or ability. Boring to say the least.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I recomend this game.  Game is fun.  Can b easy for kids or challenging for adults.<br />A good time waster.
B00000JTB2|2.0|Can't believe anybody gave this 5 stars.  I thought I was hearing things at first and I kept saying to myself that nobody could be THAT out of tune and not hear it.  But then to release it on SACD is completely ridiculous.
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  One of the best out of the 5 Final Destinations!  This is like a Prequel to all of the movies.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really like this app and use it a lot before I go to bed. You can pick many different difficulties for each puzzle and there are many free extra puzzles to download if you want to switch it up. I didn't think I'd really use this app but I do all the time.
B00005JKNF|2.0|I bought this because it received good reviews and was written by the Julian Fellowes who also wrote Downtown Abbey. There are some similarities in the basic set-up but this failed to keep me interested. Even Maggie Smith is boring in this movie.
1616550414|5.0|The quality of the book (contents, material of the book, etc...), everything is perfect! I freaking love this book! Is a most-buy for all Zelda fans!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|I was on board for Season One, which had its thrills and chills. Season Two is different. Its twisted, its demented, its surprising stuff to even be on tv. I wouldn't let kids or young teens watch it. Its messed. But its also different and refreshing and tells a great story.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I think Jeremy Renner did an outstanding job...Definitely and action hero..plenty of gut wrenching action and outstanding locations all over the globe
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|its a fun game but it needs a lot more time other than that it's really fun I asked for girt card for my birthday so I can buy the full version
1907590331|5.0|I really enjoy the novel. As me being an international student, the vocabulary in the novel was quite easy to understand. I got along with it pretty easily. The novel tells us exactly how the society was at the time. Each characters suffer in different ways because of the old society and it has a surprising sad ending.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Replaced a lower capacity cord with this one to charge my Kindle Fire. Kindle charging time is now much faster.

B000784WMW|5.0|I recently listened to the audio book of Jane Eyre, and loved it, so wanted to see the movie. I knew there had recently been a new movie made of Jane Eyre, but I missed it in the theater. Another Amazon customer recommended this one, as she had seen them all. It is extraordinarily like the book, and done in 30 min to 1 hour chapter form by the BBC, a total of about 11 chapters. If you like a movie that's true to the book, this is the one to get.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|An understanding of how insulin works and how insulin resistance develops is essential for personal and public health. In Why We Get Fat, Mr. Taubes explains these processes and the vast body of evidence that excessive carbohydrate consumption is the root cause of many modern Western ailments.
B0007OCG56|4.0|Did I say well acted?  That is a miracle, I don't really care for Adam Sandler.  This movie changes my attitude toward this actor.<br /><br />The story is not new but is well told.  A single mother who doesn't speak English finds a position in a well to do houselhold.  The mother in the family attempts to take over the maid's daughter and the two end up having to leave the house.  There is some romance, of course, between the head of the household and the maid, but this comes to nothing.  If you are looking for the usual happy ending, you may be disappointed.<br /><br />Personally I am glad to have the movie and to have seen it.
B0083GQKQG|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like this at first, as the film jumps around a bit, but one quickly realizes that the director is \\"showing, not telling\\" the present-day life of a stunned, numbed and traumatized mother, played by Tilda Swinton, using vignettes of her and her family's past to show why she is how she is now, how she got to this place in her life. It doesn't take long to get the feel for the storytelling style, and once I was comfortable with that, within 15 minutes I was absolutely riveted. By 30 minutes, I was already thinking to myself this might be one of the most well-acted and -directed films I have ever seen. The cinematography is adept. What a sleeper... If you like cerebral, suspenseful, psychological thriller-esque, deep, and yes even dark movies, this is for you. It was perfect for watching alone, undistracted,on a quiet day, and I am sure will have me thinking about it for a long time. I immediately went online to see if Lynne Ramsay has directed anything else I might be able to watch and there are a couple films, so I put them in my queues; I like her style. I've always loved Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly and they just SHINE in this film, and honestly, I will be keeping my eye on the two young men who played Kevin at different ages, Jasper Newell (young Kevin), and Ezra Miller (older Kevin); I won't be surprised if they go on to great success and am excited for them both!<br /><br />I think it's important to note: I was unaware that this was an adaptation of a best-selling novel by Lionel Shriver, am inspired to read said book, AND ***I am glad in this case that I did not have any preconceived notions about what to expect, had no idea what was coming next*** as I sat down to watch. It was so engrossing, just wondering what on earth is going to happen next!!!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I refuse to write reviews that may give anything away, and I certainly don't want to waste your or my own time rehashing some version of the synopsis. This book had me so thoroughly that I fear I may slip a detail so I'll keep this one on the light side.<br /><br />Hopeless is easily on of the best books I've read so far this year and Colleen Hoover is a writer to contend with. This wasn't a book that was filled with words that had me reaching for my dictionary. The writing was smooth and easy reading; beautiful structure and grammar along with a superb rhythm and voice. It took me no time at all to finish this book, both because of the writing as well as the content.<br /><br />Hopeless is both beautiful and heartbreaking, terribly painful and relentlessly uplifting. I felt the gamut of emotion; I laughed, I cried, gasped, giggled and found myself covering my gaping mouth while holding my breath. Some of it was hard for me to read but it was to damn go to put it down. I needed to know more about the two most important characters, Sky and Holder. And now that the book is done I find myself both satisfied as well as sad that it's done.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book. Let yourself feel it and get lost in this fantastic story.
1933865474|4.0|Ok, so their drawn ... doesn't diminishes their appeal from their expressions and poses. Abt 4% of repeats, like coloured with an inked/ penciled only on the other page.

1451695195|1.0|\\"What I have to tell you is as important as anything anyone will ever tell you, and it is true.\\"  Eben Alexander, M.D. in [[ASIN:B008AK8FHM Proof of Heaven]]<br /><br />For those who don't like to read long reviews, I'll summarize in this first paragraph what Eben Alexander wants you to believe is true.  He wants you to believe there was a divine plan from the heavens above for him to become \\"fantastically sick\\" in a way that made him the only case in \\"medical history\\", so he could \\"die harder, and travel deeper than almost all NDE subjects\\" before him, in order for him to have \\"a technically near impeccable near-death experience, perhaps one of the most convincing such cases in modern history\\".  He also wants the reader to be aware that his \\"perfect storm\\" of a near-death experience is \\"true\\" and \\"real\\" and of  \\"stunning importance\\", not just to him, but to \\"all of us\\".  And why is it so important?  Because with him, \\"two events occurred in unison and concurrence, and together they break the back of the last efforts of reductive science to tell the world that the material realm is all that exists, and that consciousness or spirit\\"  is \\"not the great and central mystery of the universe.\\"  Dr. Alexander ends that statement and the book with the line:  \\"I am living proof\\".<br /><br />Now, if you can believe all of that, you might want to read this book.  Or you might want to read it if you think it is always a lot of fun to read a book with a lot of grandiose statements.  So, who is Eben Alexander for real?  Is he truly a messenger sent back from Heaven to Earth by God?  Or is he just a man who is trying to elevate himself above all of his past and present troubles by making himself out to be a modern day prophet?  Or is he possibly an academic neurosurgeon who just wants a new day job?<br /><br />Let's start at the beginning . . .<br /><br />Eben Alexander was born to a teenage unwed mother on a December night, where in the sky \\"brilliant Jupiter was just rising\\" and was \\"at opposition that night, and would not be as bright again for almost nine years\\".  (Kind of reminds you of the birth of Jesus, doesn't it?)  His mother wanted to keep him, but everyone else, including her boyfriend  opposed that idea.  Hence, he was taken to a very nice baby home, which was a Victorian house in North Carolina, and his mother visited him at least half a dozen times until March.  In April 1953, Dr. Alexander was adopted by a happily married neurosurgeon and his wife.  He describes his childhood as being happy, and he obviously had all the educational opportunities he needed to become a neurosurgeon like his father, whom he idolized.  Thus, Eben Alexander was only an orphan for three months. That's important to remember when you read about what happened in 2000.<br /><br />What happened in 2000 was that Dr. Alexander, at the age of 47,  heard again that his biological parents did not want to meet him.  This time, however, he was told they had gotten married and had three additional children.  (He noted that when he was hearing that information over the phone a blizzard hit.)  Finding out he was excluded from this second family apparently threw him into seven years of feeling like an orphan, which he seems to continue to do in the book.  He repeatedly calls himself an orphan in the book and repeatedly says he had been \\"given away\\", felt unwanted and felt like he had not \\"been loved and cared about\\".  Even at least once he stated he was \\"thrown away\\".  He sums up his feelings by stating: \\"So, on a precognitive, preverbal level, I'd known all through my life that I'd been given away, and on a deep level I was still struggling to forgive that fact.\\"  Now, remember, during the 711 months of his life, he was an orphan for only three of those months.  In 2000, by his own account, he was happily married and happily the father of two sons.  Yet, for seven years he apparently acted in ways that adversely affected both his family life and his career.  In one instance in 2007, as another reviewer discovered, Dr. Alexander not only didn't inform a patient that he did surgery on the wrong surgical site, he changed his original operative report to make it look like he did indeed do surgery on the right site. And this is a man who states in his book that as a doctor he has \\"two essential duties: to honor truth and to help heal\\".<br /><br />Not that there is anything unusual or wrong about an adopted person wanting to meet his biological family, and being sad when he can't; it just seems like he's possibly using it all as an excuse for what went wrong in his life for seven years.  He also comes across as being totally oblivious to all the orphans who do not end up in a really good family like he did.  Or the orphans who end up in foster care, going from home to home, until they age out of it, and have to go out into the world all alone. Or the orphans in war-torn countries, or the ones who have to beg every day in the street to eat, or the orphan baby girls in countries where daughters are not wanted.  (That's not even to mention all the children who were raised or are being raised by alcoholics, drug addicts or psychotic parents, who wish they had been put up for adoption as babies, and had ended up with normal parents and a normal life.)  At no time does Dr. Alexander acknowledge that others have had a much more difficult life than he has had. And we're suppose to see this man as having been specially chosen by God to scientifically prove the existence of life after death, and to preach and teach unconditional love to others?  In all fairness and realness, he should not even consider preaching or lecturing about unconditional love to others, until he has been a truly unconditionally loving person for at least seven years.<br /><br />His seven years of tribulation seemed to end in August 2007, when he did meet his biological family, and found out he was loved and wanted by his mother.  But dis-ease surfaced again in November 2008, when he acquires an almost always fatal case of e-coli meningitis, that is almost always acquired by those who have had neurological surgery.  Yet, Dr. Alexander had not had neurological surgery . . . yet, he is a neurosurgeon . . . so, how did he contact the disease?  He doesn't really speculate how he got it.  He just talks about it in a way that makes you wonder if there is any man alive who has ever been more incredibly impressed by the disease he got than Eben Alexander.  As stated in the first paragraph of this review, he also wants the reader to believe it was part of a divine plan where he was \\"allowed to die harder, and travel deeper, than almost all NDE subjects before\\" him.  Die harder?  He didn't even die or he'd be dead. Dead people don't write books. (Oh, except through automatic writing.:)  And, if there is such a thing as \\"dying harder\\", wouldn't people who are tortured to death be the ones who \\"die harder\\"?  Or the ones with painful terminal illnesses who suffer for a long time?  Dr. Alexander quickly slipped into a coma.  (He noted it was raining when that happened, and the rain did not stop until the day he woke up.  On that sunny day a \\"perfect rainbow\\" appeared in the sky.)<br /><br />His \\"deep travels\\" took him to a place where he experienced one of the most blah NDEs I have ever read. His NDE is neither interesting nor inspiring,  If you want to read an intriguing NDE by a doctor, read George Richie`s [[ASIN:080078412X Return from Tomorrow]]. (It was interesting to note that Dr. Alexander mentions Dr. Richie's NDE, but he doesn't identify him as a fellow doctor, but instead calls him \\"a man named George Richie\\".)  In Dr. Alexander's lackluster NDE, he first visits a place he calls the \\"Realm of the Earthworm's-Eye View\\" , and I renamed \\"The Mud Room\\". What went on in the Mud Room sounded more like an hallucination than anything else, especially the parts about the faces in the mud.  All the rest of his NDE was just abstract stuff andtypical messages about love.  One message, though--\\"there is nothing you can do wrong\\"--made you wonder if he's going to start preaching a type of New Age amorality, such as where everything you do is considered a spiritual learning experience, so nothing you do can be considered \\"bad\\".  No matter what harm you do to yourself or to others or to society, it`s all a \\"good\\" learning experience for everyone involved .  It's a type of belief most favored by the extremely naive and the extremely guilty.  Dr. Alexander has tried to clarify on his website that he is not suggesting you can do no wrong on Earth; he has changed the message there to : \\"There is nothing you can do wrong over there.\\"  This is good if he wants to attract all the people he can attract to his mission.  Because most people, especially those with children, do not want to live in a neighborhood that is like what the Superdome in New Orleans was like after Hurricane Katrina.<br /><br />Unlike many readers, I didn't care that there was so little about his NDE in his book, because it was so lifeless anyway.  But it's understandable that many readers felt cheated about getting what is basically a mini-memoir.  I am curious, though, about his NDE description in this book, as well as in any future books, due to his comments about Robert Monroe's Hemi-Sync method.  Robert Monroe was one of the most well known explorers of out-of-body experiences.  Personally, he was one of my very least favorite metaphysical writers.  Every time I started to read one of his books, filled with intrigue about possibly having an OBE, I would finish the book thinking I wanted absolutely nothing to do with OBEs and Robert Monroe.  Dr. Alexander, on the other hand, is a big fan of the deceased Mr. Monroe and his Hemi-Sync method.  He states: \\"I believe Hemi-Sync has enabled me to return to a realm similar to that which I visited deep in a coma, but without having to be deathly ill.\\"  Hence, the curiosity about Eben Alexander's NDE:  Is it NDE or is it Hemi-Sync?  Is he going to tell his readers when something was part of his NDE, or when something was actually a \\"discovery\\" made using the Hemi-Sync method?<br /><br />Eben Alexander repeatedly stated in his book that he sees it as his \\"duty\\" and \\"calling\\" to tell everyone about his NDE; to tell everyone about what he thinks is \\"true\\" and \\"real\\".  That reminds me of something my very smart and very tough high school journalism teacher once said.  Namely, that if you are reading something where the author keeps telling you what he or she is saying is true or real, chances are good that's exactly what it's not.  I'm afraid I can't picture Eben Alexander as a messenger from God or a prophet or a messiah or a spiritual leader, or whatever he thinks he is after his illness. (I can certainly see him as a missionary, however, since he obviously thinks what saved him will save everyone else.)  The idea that he believes he's not \\"anyone special\\", as he claimed in the book on the last page, is laughable beyond words.  His seven years of obsessing about his orphanhood, as well as his statement about life being meaningless to most people most of the time, makes you wonder if he possibly suffers from depression.  The beginning of the book where he talks on and on about sky diving, as well as his statement that meeting up with pilots in his biological family felt like \\"Old Home Week\\", makes you wonder if he wished he had become a pilot instead of a brain surgeon . . . and possibly has wished for a career change since the year 2000.<br /><br />Moreover, his website clearly shows he is trying to get big money for his new found mission, and how much donors give determines what they get.  Yes, for a one time donation of at least $50,000, or yearly donations of at least $10,000, you can be a member of the Blue Butterfly Society.  Don't fret, though, there are other lower priced memberships starting at $50.  You'll be treated more like a plain gray moth with a cheaper membership, however.  No  \\"black tie galas, high-end auctions, golf tournament lecture series, private dinner parties or salons\\" for you.  But, hey, maybe they'll use some of the money they raise to help orphans!<br /><br />Talking about the Blue Butterfly Society, I think it is disturbing that Dr. Alexander's deceased biological sister, whom he never met, has no choice about being in his book, and no voice about being immortalized as an angel riding around in Heaven on the wing of a blue butterfly.  It was also sad how Dr. Alexander mentioned he so regretted not seeing his father during his NDE, because he wanted his father to tell him everything was \\"okay\\"; in other words, he wanted his father to comfort him like a child; not that he wanted to see his father again to see that his father was okay, and was alive and well and happy in Heaven.  Almost all the talk about love in [[ASIN:B008AK8FHM Proof of Heaven]] is about the love Dr. Alexander received or did not receive.  Not the love he gives or gave. Sometimes those who so strongly advocate unconditional love do so because that's what they want for themselves.  Regardless of what they do or have done or may do, they think they should be unconditionally loved, as if it's a God given right.  Amusingly, they are often the ones who are the least likely to be unconditionally loving.  They see themselves as forever a unloved baby or a hurt child who has no obligation to love unconditionally, as they expect others to do, because they feel they were cheated out of unconditional love early in their lifetime. Any middle-aged man playing poor little orphan boy is quite possibly a man who thinks like that, as well as a man with major truth problems, and has had all those problems for a long time.<br /><br />I'll leave the question if Dr. Alexander scientifically proved that there is life after death to those who care about such a thing.  I think most people of faith don't care.  Just as most people who have no religious faith don't feel, as Dr. Alexander claims, \\"lost here on Earth\\" because they have \\"no memory of our larger connectedness, and of the unconditional love of are Creator\\".  Carl Sagan obviously didn't feel that way. Speaking of which, my favorite quotes involving science and faith come from Dr. Sagan's last book [[ASIN:1561004421 The Demon-Haunted World]].  In that book, he tells the story of how he asked the Dalai Lama what would happen if science disproved one of Buddhism's major beliefs.  The Dalai Lama answered that Tibetan Buddhism would then have to change their belief.  (This surprises Dr. Sagan, because apparently all other religious leaders reply something like:  \\"Yes, Carl, we would have to change our belief . . . like when Hell freezes over! Do tell us when scientists have proof that Hell has frozen over, Carl!\\")  Pressing the Dalai Lama further Dr. Sagan asked but what if science disproved reincarnation?  The Dalai Lama replied that Tibetan Buddhists would have to change their belief in reincarnation.  Ah, but the Dalai Lama then added, with \\"a twinkle\\", that science was going to have a hard time disproving reincarnation.  In reply to that statement, Carl Sagan wrote:  \\"Plainly, the Dalai Lama is right.  Religious doctrine that is insulated from disproof has little reason to worry about the advance of science.  The grand idea, common to many faiths, of a Creator of the Universe is one such doctrine--difficult alike to demonstrate or to dismiss.\\"typical messages about love.

B002KYHZLQ|1.0|Well this book is like the literature version of Navi the Fairy.<br /><br />\\"Hey, this is a FANTASY BOOK and you can tell cause there's MAGIC AND STUFF\\"<br />\\"Hey, MAGIC!\\"<br />\\"Hey, SPOOKY DEMON GIRL!

I made it 1/4 of the way through and gave up, because I didn't know who the story was about, or who the main characters were, or why the hell I should care.
B008469DGY|4.0|Fun,worth the small amount paid.  Can keep you occupied for a long time if you wish.  Some courses are a real challenge.
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Considering the cast... this could've been A LOT better.  I think the problem is that the main characters of this BOMB were either relatively unknown, or actors with very little experience.  Tom Cruise was hilarious.. and Catherine Zeta-Jones was great (as always).  But the rest of the cast was completely forgettable.  Julianne needs to stick to what she's good at... dancing.
030758836X|3.0|The book is compelling through Acts I and II, but then tanks in Act III.  It's difficult to find anything redeeming about either of the two protagonists in the novel.  Amy Elliott Dunne is a self-absorbed, passive-aggressive, bratty rich girl until she outs herself as an active-aggressive bratty rich girl with serious sociopathological traits.  Nick Dunne is the stereotypical feminist caricature of a man:  struggling to stifle is inner rage inherited and learned from an abusive father while simultaneously an immature, naive little boy who has been pampered the women in his life.  Gag.  Undoubtedly this is intended by Flynn as the setup for the plot twist, but it makes for less pleasant reading.  And frankly, the major plot twist is, well, about as subtle in its approach as a Stuka dive bomber.<br /><br />But where the book really falls flat is in Act 3, which is inelegant, and frankly so implausible that suspension of disbelief cannot be maintained.  Unfortunately, I cannot go into more detail without spoiling the ending.  But I have to say that it left me thinking \\"Why the hell did I just waste my time reading this?\\"<br /><br />According to Amazon review Ms. Flynn states \\"In those first two novels, I explored the geography of loneliness--and the devastation it can lead to. With Gone Girl, I wanted to go the opposite direction: what happens when two people intertwine their lives completely.I wanted to explore the geography of intimacy--and the devastation it can lead to. Marriage gone toxic.\\"<br /><br />Puhlease.  The Dunne marriage doesn't \\"go\\" toxic.  It's not the intimacy that Flynn explores, the Dunnes are decidedly not intimate, and indeed its that lack of intimacy that is the vehicle Flynn uses to advance the plot.<br /><br />No doubt,  Flynn thinks she's also offering some pointed social commentary:  blowhard cable TV commentators like Nancy Grace are bad, celebrity lawyers who defend the guilty are sleazy and self-serving, East Cost urban elitists think little and less of those living in \\"flyover country,\\" etc.  The media is parasitic.  Yawn.<br /><br />I know that these comments have been almost entirely negative.  The book isn't a bad book.  It's a reasonably entertaining read for most of it.  I just don't think the book is worth the praise that it has received (I was pointed to it by a Top 10 of the year list in WSJ).  If I had to sum up this book in one not-so-pithy line it would be this:<br /><br />It's War of the Roses without the charm or the humor.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I read the reviews and was skeptical about the purchase. I am so glad I did buy it. Maybe I can relate on a level but it was very touching and I was in tears at the rnd.
1451695195|4.0|I found this book to be very intriguing and sincerely presented.  As a believer, in a non-traditional sense, it is affirming to hear a description of the doctor's experience of the hereafter, and the book left me feeling good.  Aren't we all curious about what comes after this world and what \\"it's all about\\" or how it fits together in some unified way?  The fact that Dr. Alexander is who he is and has the experience himself lends credibility and makes me smile.  I give a four star rating rather than a five only because while he is a remarkable human being and his writing is good, Dr. Alexander is a great doctor...a great writer not so much.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I just love this show!  It really cannot get much better...  The drama, the suspense, the violence.  And oddly enough.. this show is actually pretty comical at times!  It really takes an incredible cast to both move you to tears, and make you laugh your butt off.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book. I would recommend it to everyone. I wish that I would have read it before seeing the movie. This book reminded me of people living in a dystopian society, Knoxville the people in \\"Brave New World.\\"

This book has all the science anyone would need to understand exactly why dairy products, all grains, legumes and refined food should not be eaten. We have a choice to make, either to eat for health or to eat for disease. I choose to eat for health, and this book has convinced me that what I'm doing is the best choice for my body.

It's the only feature that doesn't work on some devices. It works on my I phone, though. I recommend it on phones,I pads and I pods. But I don't recommended it on a kindle. But it's still an awesome app. Get it but not on a kindle. :)

B009DT424Y|3.0|you must follow the user guide on pairing with bluetooth speaker, if the speaker is already connected to Ipad you must disconnect it, or better turn off ipad bluetooth and now pair the Nolan Mic to speaker with the blue light flashing.<br />If blue and ember light alternate, it is to pair with Ipad or Surface tablet.  So far, I have succeeded in pairing with bluetooth speaker and Surface tablet, but no luck with Ipad which I didn't have any use.  Once speaker is pair, there is an slight delay and echo, so not so great for teaching workshops and as loudspeakers.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love this game! The tile configurations are challenging and very nicely displayed. It helps keep my poor brain sharp and eyes alert. I keep going back to the games already played just to see if I can beat my time previously held. Totally worth the effort....
B0090CVJZ4|4.0|I used these banana plugs to secure speaker wire to two floor-standing speakers. Previously I had the bare wire going directly into the connectors. This sounded fine, but over time the speaker wires would come loose from the regular pulling on the wires that occurs when vacuuming the area. Not only would the wire come loose, but what was left was typically frayed and broken. These speaker plugs allow me to secure the wire and make a clean connection to the binding posts. They're simple, tight screwing, and well coded in black and red. At just over a dollar a piece, they're well worth it!

1400069807|5.0|This is a must-read for anyone who is trying to lose weight. Mr. Moss reveals some of the reasons that it may be harder to lose weight than it seems like it should be. He gives you insight into the lifestyle changes that promote weight gain and hinder healthy eating, and discloses some little known facts about the food and drinks that everyone buys at the local supermarket.<br /><br />Mr. Moss interviews many of the knowledgeable people in the processed food and beverage industry. He discovers that the scientists and engineers that are working for the food companies are using research and scientific testing to fine tune the food formulas to make their products taste so good that your body will then crave them. The ad agencies then promote that food so that you are thinking about the next time that you will be able to taste that delicious treat. The marketing experts make sure that the food you desire is in an easy to see location, so that you won't have to wait for you next fix.<br /><br />Is this a big conspiracy among the food giants to make everyone fat? No, Mr. Moss shows us that this is the free enterprise system at work. The food and beverage companies are just as beholden to Wall Street as the High Tech segment is. They have to increase sales and profits every quarter just like the rest of industrial America needs to. But if Apple gets people into their stores to get the new iPad Mini and then they also add a new iPhone and an Apple TV and maybe even an Airport Extreme, then when they walk out of that store, they may have an empty wallet, but they won't be packing on the pounds. Every company in the United States is trying to maximize their sales and profits, but most of the time that doesn't endanger the public's health. Mr. Moss delves into the possibility of more government regulation, but until something is done to mandate changes in the way the food industry formulates their products, your best weapon  is knowledge, and Mr. Moss gives you some of that.<br /><br />Read this, understand how you are being manipulated, and then maybe, just maybe you can get back in control of your eating and realize that you don't need to gain weight every year.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars out of 5, and wish that everyone could read a copy and put these ideas to work. We will all feel more empowered and possibly healthier too.<br /><br />I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads.r /><br />Read this, understand how you are being manipulated, and then maybe, just maybe you can get back in control of your eating and realize that you don't need to gain weight every year.<br /><br />I give this book 5 stars out of 5, and wish that everyone could read a copy and put these ideas to work.

0307895475|5.0|This is a great edition to any fan of Skyrim's library. It's not a must-have if you have the original, but if you want the extra content and some fresh edits - this will do just fine.<br /><br />It has the information you need and want, plus it is a nice conversation piece for one's coffee table, too.

B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|So far a good game, one that is not to easy, I like a challenge, makes me want to keep playing
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent blend neurology & spirituality. In the same genre as Life After Life which was groundbreaking when it was published.  This is too but more than similar books because it's self report and more neurology than earlier work of similar nature.  Definitely not &#34;sentimental.&#34;  Just a perspective with discussion of explanations he and other physicians have used to explain similar experiences & how they might/might not apply here.  For anyone with interest in this topic, it's interesting and informative.

0452295548|5.0|This is a truly remarkable book.<br /><br />The author, Jill Bolte Taylor, is an eminent neuroanatomist who, at age thirty-seven experienced a massive stroke in the left hemisphere of her brain.  She survived, recovered, and wrote this book about the experience. Reading it opens doors of understanding on many unexpected levels.<br /><br />Most astonishingly, the experience that she describes was in many ways positive. I've always considered a stroke to be a irredeemably terrifying event.  What I've imagined a catastrophic stroke must be like from my outside-in vantage point is being imprisoned in one's body - sentient in some ways, but unable to coherently direct body parts and otherwise interact with the outside world.<br /><br />What Taylor experienced was a form of liberation rather than a struggle of imprisonment. Freed from the logic / language boundaries presumably enforced by the left brain hemisphere (which was compromised by her stroke) she was immersed in the unfettered perceptions of the creative and intuitive right brain. Here's how she describes it:<br /><br />\\"As the domineering fibers of my left hemisphere shut down, they no longer inhibited my right hemisphere, and my perception was free to shift such that my consciousness could embody the tranquility of my right mind. Swathed in an enfolding sense of liberation and transformation, the essence of my consciousness into a state that felt amazingly similar to my experiences in Thetaville. I'm no authority, but I think the Buddhists would say I entered the mode of existence they call Nirvana\\".<br /><br />On a more practical level, there is much in this book to inform caregivers and family as to how best to interact with stroke patients. This is very valuable and in many cases counterintuitive material.<br /><br />The author also develops her thinking about how the understanding of brain circuitry and functioning can be channeled into a discipline of choosing which circuits to give preeminence to on the moment-by-moment stage of our consciousness. As she writes, \\" Ultimately, everything we experience is a product of our cells and their circuitry. Once you have tuned into how different circuits feel inside your body, then you can pick and choose how you want to be in the world. I personally, feel allergic as to how fear and/or anxiety feel in my body...Because I don't like the way these emotions feel physiologically, I'm not inclined to hook into that circuitry on a regular basis\\".<br /><br />Fascinating stuff indeed.oment-by-moment stage of our consciousness.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|Tedious. Only made it to best sellers list because it's porn, but not advertised as such. I enjoy sensual writing, but this lacks all sensuality.
1451613512|5.0|...but where is the account, and implications of, imperialist US's machinations in the former Yugoslavia? The amount of lies to justify that entire ill-informed,'world saving' and 'democracy spreading' liberation theater were momentous, as was the entire debacle known as the ICTY. A bit surprised that it was omitted.<br /><br />Otherwise a fantastic book.
B007F7QG0Y|4.0|I have been a Stones fan since the mid 60's, and this book was an interesting read considering Keef was a big part of my musical tastes as a child.  The book was slow for me to get into at first. It drags a little, but many books do. I was a third of the way through with it and Keith was still in 1967.  I liked that the book is extremely detailed, yet I hated that the detail is mainly in the parts of his life that are not very exciting.  He explains in detail his drug use. It encompasses the majority of the book. The drug use is the main theme, it completely controls his life, night and day.  Keith doesnt shy away from hard facts about himself that are very negative towards his character. For instance, he doesnt come out and say it, but he details the reasons he was completely worthless as a father.  If the things he did were actually reported when they happened, the Stones would have needed a new guitar player/song writer.  He mentions very important events in his life with only a passing thought, like his fathers passing is found out as &#34;Bert died in 2003&#34;, but then spends 5 pages on explaining how he was going to meet his dealer.  I found his, or the author who helped him, detail of events to be a little over the top.  At 500+ pages, the reader gets the idea of the heroin use. I feel he could have conveyed that in a chapter instead of over 500+ pages.  A waste I think.<br /><br />The book was an interesting read. I wouldnt call it a great read by any stretch.  I have read other biographies that have me riveted from page one and I cant put the book down. I read &#34;Life&#34; in about 4 days and although too long for what it is, it gives a great insight as to who Keith Richards really is.  When you finish the book, your opinion of him might be a little diminished, I do credit that to him being open and honest though.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|A sometimes sad, but mostly upbeat story of Mark OBrien, a survivor of polio, forced to live in an iron lung almost all of his life.  Helen Hunt, as his sex therapist is marvelous.

B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is awesome, it's like grand theft auto but better, especially for it being on the kindle fire. It's the best game I've player for a long time!!! You have to buy it!!!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Not even close to a real Bond movie.  Just a shoot em up, car crasher. OK if you have nothing better to do.
1405862416|5.0|It good book . I recommended for you. It's good novel to enjoy with it. Specially for those who want an easy story & it has easy vocabulary.
B009TSA7MA|5.0|There are a bunch of Michael Schenker DVD's out there, but I especially love watching this one cause in a way it reunites 3 of the players from the Scorpions Lovedrive album. Not to take away the fact that Michael is playing better today than he has in the past, and the great MSG songs, but the addition of several Scorpions songs he does here, even ones that were not on Lovedrive. Great to see Herman rarebell reunited with Frances Bucholz here. And I hate to say it, on a couple of songs the band does a better job than the Scorpions do today, and this coming from a huge Scorpions fan. My only 'down' moment is that while Doogie White is an excellent singer, he just does not feel like the right singer for MSG.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game.  I first played it on my work computer, and I was glad to see it was available on my Kindle.  It is easier to play than regular solitaire, which is what I love about it.  It is a nice escape for my brain from the stresses of life.
B004TMPJP6|5.0|This is app is a very useful tool for me. I have 2 jobs, serve on 2 boards, and several ministries. Wunderlist really helps me to keep my m mind together! I am able to create different lists for different areas of my life, view them all together by what's due or coming up soon, or view just by area so that it seems less intimidating. The new features have greatly improved functionality: sub-tasks, ability to move tasks between lists, automatic shifting of incomplete tasks to &quot;today&quot;, and the new reoccurring feature. I love that I can schedule a reminder and that I can access my Wunderlist from all of my devices (Kindle, Iphone, home &amp; work PC)

B0065GC0BA|5.0|Fantastic read, hard to put down. I thought it would end differently.  Look forward to reading more from JoJo Moyes.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|I selected 4 stars as a rating because this book is as informative, attention grabbing and entertaining as any book of this genre. No, it is not Jane Austin nor is it Shakespeare. However, it is as good a book as you will find of this sort. So, if you like action-adventure novels that are well written, move fast and a bit naughty, this book can't be beaten. Why 4 stars instead of five? Because I knew who-done-it a good bit before the end. It was still an exciting, suspenseful ending, though, so no harm.
B00A6N7QIA|4.0|I like the &#34;Breaking Bad&#34; cable series better. This film is similar plot but centers around Ferrari(?) driving, mansion on the beach living, prettier young people. Characters are a bit thinly developed, but not much time for that...and they are not very likeable. John Travolta is good as a FBI agent and keeps it real while having a real dramatic scene, Salma Hayek plays a drug lord and I think takes her big &#34;dramatic&#34; scene a bit too &#34;over the top&#34;. Benicio Torres(?) is a scary dude... looks it and acts it... lots of blood and some pretty bizarre stuff... Oliver Stone in my opinion has a &#34;close, but no cigar&#34; film here.  It had a lot going for it but the endings (there are two of them!) left me feeling incomplete.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I used to be able to play but now I cant it will only goes to the first part and then it shuts off to the menu
B007WFR0QS|4.0|I first heard Emeil Sande on the radio and really liked the sound of her voice.  CD is great and would recommend it.
B004JHY8A8|2.0|First it's a historical novel, then it's a story of a marriage going wrong, then it's a heart breaking tale, then  its like watching  an episode of &#34;who do you think you are?&#34; THEN at the tail end it suddenly  tries to turn into a love story - it just felt all over the place!!!<br /><br />The main character annoyed me from the get go and I was glad to turn the final page and forget about her whiny ass!!!<br /><br />And another &#34;bug bear&#34; have - why such cliched careers ???<br />An architect, a journalist for a glossy mag, a tough Manhattan lawyer - for crying out loud could you not be SLIGHTLY more original - that just made it even more tired!!<br /><br />Stories of the holocaust break my heart to pieces, and to me it felt like she just was being disrespectful and using a tragic time in history  to write a book that would get good sales by using a touchy subject - it didn't feel genuine.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good book but I went with the book rating,<br />was rated a 5, so I tried it all the way thru<br />50 % of the book. I then stop reading this book.<br />I will file it as \\"Unfinished\\", not due to the<br />writing but do to the subject of the book.<br />Very well written but not my type of stories.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|First time I have played a game like this and I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is fun and challenging.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I am a big fan of the show and really enjoyed the music.  Hoping they will release a new CD with each season
B005AKFXZW|5.0|I loved this book- I have no words!!!<br />I have noticed that very pragmatic realist types do not enjoy the imaginary, fantastical elements that make up this extraordinary book - so if that's you, give it a skip.<br />It took me back to childhood days adventuring with Enid Blyton's characters up the faraway tree!!!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great picture...I really enjoyed the second season.  Looking forward to Season 3.  Hope you notify me when it comes out.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Fairly fun game with good graphics and a easy way to waste time. The things that hurt the game are that game play is slow going,  you can't purchase more dinosaurs of the same kind you've discovered, and there are two different types of currency.
B00B2166BS|5.0|I use my Nexus 10 a lot for reading documents and for research.  The downside to its big, bright screen is that it uses a lot of power.  The USB charger cannot supply enough current to operate the device, so the battery level actually goes down slowly while using it.  The N10 is programmed to not draw the full 2A that the charger can supply with it is being charged by the micro USB port.<br /><br />The pogo cable solves several problems.  First, the pogo pins allow the Nexus 10 to draw more current from the charger.  Not a lot more, but enough for the device to charge slowly while using it as opposed to discharging slowly.  Second, the magnetic latching makes it very easy to connect and disconnect.  Sometimes I have to rotate the N10 so that the cable is not being pulled, but this is one of those things that quickly becomes natural.  Third, the pogo cable will extend the life of the USB connector.  These connectors do have a limited lifetime based on the number of connection cycles.  I've had other devices with failed USB connectors, so I know that it can happen.<br /><br />The build quality is excellent.<br /><br />The only negative comment I can make it that Google should have included this cable with the N10.  But that's not the cable's fault.  I'm just glad to have it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Very good book and I enjoyed reading. It had lots of funny parts and romantic parts that l really enjoyed
B0053JJLLC|4.0|I'm a huge Crichton fan, however, Crichton's books had more real science based theories, like timeline, that speaks of technology that already exists & is slightly tweeked to make it fictional. This book wasn't really based on any existing technology, nor was the technology explained in detail that is classic Crichton style.
B00992CF6W|1.0|(I would have rated this a 0 star)<br /><br />This game cost 7 dollars! This game should be 10x cheaper then it is now!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I must say this camera backpack fit the bill perfectly. It holds my main camera, a handful of filters, zoom lens, many accessories and still has plenty of room. It's very comfortable and very easy to use. Access to all the compartments is a snap. Would recommend this to anyone wishing to make their life a lot easier. Shipping was well packed and taken care of and arrived on time. No issues here
B000FVQLRA|5.0|I used this with the Parish youth group when we did a lesson on religious persecution. We have the older high school students in our group.  I would be careful showing to younger kids. Very graphic, and violent. It made a real impact on the kids.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a great book. I would recommend it it to anyone who has read the Percy Jackson series .
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Unlike all other Mad Men seasons, there wasn't a single episode in season 5 that I found a little dull/boring or crammed with too much dialogue. This season is drama packed and I couldn't stop watching it until I finished it!
B008220DGE|3.0|This is an uneven movie.  It stars three of my favorite actors:  Joaquin Phoenix, Philip Seymour Hoffman and Amy Adams.  They all give outstanding performances in \\"The Master\\".  Joaquin is his quirky self though he's excessively thin and walks with a stoop throughout the movie.  The only time he straightens up is when he's running which he does with abandon, as if hell itself is after him...or the cameraman is a genius or Joaquin's stunt double is very fit.  Joaquin plays Freddie Quell a damaged alcoholic World War II vet who can't find his place in society after the war.  He's violent and unpredictable.  He's unlikable yet who could dislike Joaquin Phoenix?  He somehow makes this misfit a sympathetic character.  There's no way he can make us believe he's a 20 something Navy vet however.<br /><br />Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a megalomaniac cult leader.  He's his creepy self and VERY believable in this role.  Manipulative doesn't even begin to describe him.  Amy Adams plays his wife.  She manipulates through guilt and appeals where Hoffman uses brawn and intimidation to insure their flock's compliance.  I'm not sure how Adams did it but in this movie she manages to play an unpleasant woman without ever raising her voice or having a look of anger on her face.  She remains doe eyed and sincere the entire time.  All the same I wouldn't want to spend Thanksgiving dinner with her character.<br /><br />Though there's a standard disclaimer to negate it this plot reeks of Scientology.  Per the Master the books he writes either cause his readers see God or commit suicide.  He teaches them the influences of past lives.  He sets up challenges for them to prove themselves.  HE lets them know when they've `passed'.<br /><br />I'm still not sure how I feel about this movie.  There's something very compelling about it, perhaps that's attributable to the incredible actors, but it's also overlong and disjointed.  How much manipulation do we need to see?  We get it already.  Whatever you do be sure and watch the `extras' section that is included on this DVD.  It explains some of the vague plot points.<br /><br />I have to note the incredible musical score.  The opening is highlighted with a very unnerving contemporary classical piece by Jonny Greenwood, performed by The Aukso Chamber Orchestra.  I'd never heard it before.  It sets the tone for the entire movie and intermittently is reprised throughout.  It's as jarring and melodic as this story.  There's a wonderful contrast between the above and vintage World War II songs such as \\"No Other Love\\",  \\"You Go to My Head\\", \\"Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree\\", etc.  At one point Hoffman eerily sings \\"On a Slow Boat to China\\" to Joaquin's character who's at the very end of his fraying tether.  The contrast of sweetness and evil is chilling as are Phoenix's slowly changing facial expressions.  I was also impressed with the cinematography especially the many scenes of the ocean and the desert.<br /><br />To sum up \\"The Master\\" is disjointed, disturbing and hammers home something most people already know which is that that cults are damaging.  The acting is superb but over the top.  The weirdness factor is off the charts.  The aftermath of World War II wasn't all sweetness.  The musical score is wonderful and the cinematography is excellent.  My mind is reeling wondering what role Joaquin will follow this with.  I hope he still has that foil hat he wore in \\"Signs' AND that he puts it on before reading possible scripts for his next project.r you do be sure and watch the `extras' section that is included on this DVD.

B001AII4RM|3.0|With all the great actors involved in this, I was surprised that this is a CGI version, particularly since it strives to make the characters look like the actors whose voices they use, from Robin Wright to Anthony Hopkins.  At first, I was badly put off by the awkward motion of the CGI - images look great when still, but when they move it looks like a cartoon or video game, not real life.  This turned me off from almost the first images.<br /><br />The story also starts off weak.  A hero arrives in a court whose King is devolving into a useless drunk.  Then the monster arrives, whom Beowulf defeats handily.  It is oddly sterile in my viewing.  We turned it off at this point and I was reluctant to give it another viewing.  It is a 2-star performance.<br /><br />Fortunately, I gave it another try.  When Beowulf confronts Grendel's mother, it becomes much much better.  Beowulf himself seems to change, and you wonder if he has somehow lost it.  He has betrayed his beloved wife and may have based his kingship on lies.  In a battle to redeem himself, he seems to re-find his heroism.  It is a good story line and I must now read the original myth to learn more.  This is a 4-star performance.<br /><br />Recommended tepidly.
B0083DJUMA|3.0|Anderson's enthusiasm for the so-called Maker Movement is admirable, and it is surpassed only by his desire to share his own successes with the reader, but, at times, his enthusiasm makes cause-and-effect leaps in futurist manufacturing thinking that aren't necessarily wholly justified. Furthermore, Anderson has a hard time putting a label on his book. Is it a semi-autobiography? Is it a book about 3D printing? Is it a book about technological advancements? Anderson jumps from personal stories to examining technology to reviewing companies throughout the book, but it lacks cohesion. Each jump feels like a shift in theme. By the end of the book, the reader has a solid idea what the overall thesis is, but it just seems like there wasn't enough information out there on this new movement for Anderson to write a complete book; he had to stretch things out a little.<br /><br />Despite these complaints, Makers is a quality book for contemplating the future of desktop manufacturing. Anderson's enthusiasm keeps you entertained, while you pick through his book for the quality bits and pieces that might entice you. Anderson certainly name drops the devices and software needed to get started as a hobbyist, and does show some examples of people who were able to turn those hobbies into full-fledged businesses. Anderson's book isn't going to become the Bible of 3D printing by any means, but it's more than enough to get you creatively thinking about desktop manufacturing, and certainly shows you ways to enter into the Maker Movement.
1416550550|2.0|Many books have &#34;captivated&#34; me with their excitement, interesting characters, or just plain great story content. The Forgotten Garden, on the other hand, &#34;trapped&#34; me because I was constantly led to believe that something...anything... might eventually occur that at last would make this long, convoluted, back-and-forth saga worth reading to the end. And, alas, finish it I did!<br /><br />The constant back-and-forth throughout four generations of dysfunctional families was mind-numbing in itself. When coupled with characters who were bounced around from decade to decade in a manner that prohibited the reader from developing any serious closeness with anyone in the story and we have a huge disappointment.

Basie's orchestra has the wonderful strong sound of the big band era, with great accompaniment and contrast to the words of the singer.  Frank's voice is strong and, I don't know when this was recorded, but seems when he was younger, maybe in the 60's?  It's great!  Recommend it!

B00AFROVQC|5.0|I found the first book on the kindle store and tried a sample then bought the book and have bought the other two since.  Its a great story and I can't wait for the next book to come out.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone, you won't be disappointed.  The one draw back that I would say is that there are quite a few more spelling errors than you would expect to see in a book, but it doesn't take away from the book itself.  I would, however, suggest a better proof reader to the author.

Had a bit of trouble figuring out how to wear it at first though. :D But once I did, it fit perfectly and the sound was as good as I expect it to be since it was Sony. Also, they aren't kidding about the Ultra Lightweight bit. Seriously didn't feel like I was wearing headphones after a few minutes.

B008HT4FUW|4.0|Bought this bluray for my wife as a Valentine's gift.  We have enjoyed watching it (have just finished Season 1 so far).  My only complaint is with the picture quality. In some scenes it looks fantastic (especially a sunny outdoor shot), but in many scenes (particularly the less well-lit scenes), the picture is downright fuzzy.  This is especially a problem when we watch it on a big-screen TV (a 65&#34; plasma).  Disappointing given that bluray is supposed to provide a superior, high def picture.  As some other reviewers have noted, we have resigned ourselves to watching it on a smaller TV instead, where we have not had the same problem with the picture.  From what we have seen of the show itself, we have thoroughly enjoyed it.  Would have given it 5 stars, but had to downgrade it by a star for the poor picture quality.

B00AZRBLHO|3.0|I am a SysAdmin and have just finished \\"The Phoenix Project.\\" I've reviewed this book on my blog, so if this sounds familiar perhaps that's where you read this text. However, I would also like to share it here for future readers that purchase the book through Amazon.<br /><br />*The TL;DR Review*<br /><br />The book is a fictional account of a director of IT at a large enterprise; an enterprise that has a deeply flawed IT organization that is dragging the company into destruction. He is quickly turned into acting VP of Operations after the sudden departure of the last VP. Bill has 90 days to turn the IT department around or face the dual threat of a total IT outsourcing and the failing company being split apart by an aggressive and impatient board of directors.<br /><br />The storytelling is poor. The concepts themselves are great, however not explained to the depth that you would expect from a 300 page book. If you have a genuine interest in doing better as an IT person in general, pick the book up and see if it excites your interest in the various operational methods to getting things done for the business using IT. This is not a management book. This is not a developer book. This is not an operations, sysadmin, cloud, ITIL, infrastructure, or $buzzword book. This is about workflow management done from a factory background that can be applied to anyone's work. If you're skeptical of the so-called DevOps movement, don't be afraid of this book.<br /><br />I'd give it 3.5 out of five stars if Amazon allowed me to give half stars, however when I pressed myself to fall on a solid number, I chose three rather than four.<br /><br />*The Long Review*<br /><br />The story centers around Bill Palmer, a late-thirties former marine with a wife and two kids. He starts the story as the Director of Midrange Technology Operations. Side note: I have no idea what \\"midrange technology operations\\" is, nor did I figure it out after some Googling.<br /><br />He is quickly thrust into the position of VP of IT Operations to fill a sudden vacancy. He and his entire department is thrust under the intense scrutiny, skepticism and frustration of a hard nosed CEO, board of directors, and SVP of Retail Operations. It's fix or fail time, and he's got everyone working towards failure.<br /><br />Before we go any further, let's get the bad parts out of the way<br /><br />*The Bad*<br /><br />The storytelling is awful. The book is not intended to weave a masterful tale, so I'm not terribly disappointed. However, there came a point about halfway into the book that the writing became grating to read and was an obstacle to the subject matter.<br /><br />There is virtually no character development, and what little development can be seen is either banal (Bill Palmers, toughened Marine, fighting back tears while telling about his bad father at a team building session) or bizarre (late devops adopter security-guy-John disappearing for weeks in a drunken haze without being fired, then suddenly reappears with a shaved head and GQ clothes and now he \\"gets it\\"). Neither dramatic occurrence helped move the story along, and in fact the sudden addition of drama looked garish standing in such obvious contrast to the rest of the vanilla story.<br /><br />Adding to the lack of character development, is that each character reads like every other character. There were many times in the book when a character would be delivering two or three consecutive paragraphs of dialog and halfway through I would lose all notion of who was speaking. Was it Wes? Patty? Bill? John?<br /><br />Each character is gruff, cold, worn out, and mildly bitter. I wanted to punch Erik, the supposedly sage-like purveyor of factory Zen, at about the book's halfway point. I wanted to lock him in his precious heat-treat oven by the end. I was genuinley surprised at some of the raw language. I don't flinch much at cursing, and certainly in the real world some meetings can have blue streaks pour out from under the doors. That's life. However, I found the sheer number of \\"goddamn\\"s and \\"s***\\"s distracting to the book, not an addition of realism. It seemed like it was trying too hard to be one of the cool kids, and as a result there are a not insignificant amount of people who will find that to be a distracting irritant to the core of the book.<br /><br />The story is also a bit sing-songy at times with the usual tropes of total chaos being turned around. Skeptics are silenced. The tough guy shows his soft side. There is a self-seeking back stabber, and they get their comeuppance (sort of?). There's an irreverent hippy who sticks it to the man. Someone has a hidden special forces background. To complete the cycle, it just needed a dragon slain by a cowboy who gets the girl and rides off into the sunset singing a love song.<br /><br />I think the storyline was unrealisticly biased in favor of the concepts. I do not think it is possible to have turned around such a large company as Parts Unlimited that was as deeply flawed in its operations, company structure, workflows, and personalities in the just over four months. I do not think it is realistic at all to have so many changed hearts and minds in so short a time. From years of bitterness, frustration and institutionalized failure to suddenly, in four months, most people \\"get it\\" well enough to be embracing, adopting, and successfully practising such drastic changes. Is it possible? Yes. Possible in that amount of time? No.<br /><br />Keep in mind that the characters and storyline are mere vehicles to transport much larger concepts to the reader. It's an overgrown parable that has expanded a bit too large to comfortably carry such weighty topics on such a weak skeleton. You will gain the most if you can discard the storytelling and focus on the concepts.<br /><br />*The Okay*<br /><br />Fortunately the parts of the book that could truly be called \\"bad\\" aren't directly tied to what the book is actually about. The book is about how to get IT, from infrastructure to development, from management to security, to work closely together with eachother and the other business units while using workflow management methods that have been vetted on factory floors for generations.<br /><br />What's merely \\"okay\\" is that the book doesn't do justice to the core concepts that it intends to teach. Seemingly every chapter introduces a new manufacturing term, plant management buzz phrase, or factory concept. From \\"takt time vs cycle time\\" to the difference between bill of goods and, I believe, \\"bill of resources.\\" Oh, and during one dialog, the book refers to \\"single-minute exchange of die\\" as a legendary concept. Okay - I'll take their word for it. However, these concepts and terms are thrown at the reader in clusters that can be overwhelming. They are explained well enough to get you through that dialog and whet your appetite, however at times they are dropped unceremoniously into the reader's lap for them to stare at and search for the meaning.<br />Terms like \\"kanban\\", \\"katas\\", \\"The three ways\\" and references to Toyota's manufacturing prowess are woven throughout the book, however they are mere allusions and foreshadowing. However, the foreshadowing doesn't blossom into an actual in-depth explanation of any of them. Certainly those concepts and tools are large and themselves need many books to be fully developed, however I think a few pages of focused explanation should have been given to them. I still don't know what a \\"kata\\" is precisely and what \\"The Three Ways\\" are in any concrete way.<br /><br />In spite of all the above, the book did excite an interest in these things. You instinctively understand that there are many large concepts that are being introduced, each of them mere tips to multiple icebergs. That conveys a sense of forgiveness to the lack of clear explanations for some factory terms and processes. Even the character Bill Palmer has to write down a few words and phrases for later review, which leads me to believe the authors knew what was happening with the flood of factory-think. However, it only works if you later unravel the knot you hand someone, and it's merely loosened by the book's end. The deeper concepts that inspired the book seem near to only one or two characters in the book, but kept at a distance from the reader.<br /><br />*The Good*<br /><br />I started this review with the negative so that I could end on a positive note. With all of the above said, you might think I hated the book. I didn't hate it. I didn't love it either. I liked it - and want to like it more than I do. I think it deserves a re-read once I take in some of the works that represent the larger body of knowledge that this books rests on.<br /><br />For example, I'm planning on reading Dr. Eliyahu Goldratt's book, \\"The Goal: A Process Of Ongoing Improvement\\". I want to learn more about \\"The Toyota Way\\" and look into Jez Humble  and David Farley's book \\"Continuous Delivery: Reliable Software Releases through Build, Test, and Deployment Automation.\\" I'm interested in the concepts behind agile and lean manufacturing as applied to software development, but also on a larger scale of IT project delivery.<br /><br />To be fair, I was gaining more and more interest in those concepts before this book, however The Phoenix Project wrapped up many of these concepts, and in conjunction with the the book's blog gave interesting backstory and history to them. As a result I think it does a good job of encapsulating very complex topics into a primer in the form of a fictional case study. I think the storytelling being as poor as it is does get in the way at times, but if you can ignore that, the book has a good chance at exciting you over the possibilities that an IT department has if monolithic thinking is let go in favor of a more holistic, business-centered approach.<br /><br />One of the most fantastic elements to the book is that it isn't at all focused on the tactics involved. No specific technologies are talked about, no vendors, no task management styles, not ITIL. It seems that there was great effort spent to not mention any vendor for any reason. For a book over 300 pages long about IT, there are hardly any references to what they're using to deliver the services. It's mentioned briefly that one of the ops teams manages 1,000 Windows servers. Another time a reference is made to an Oracle database. That's about it. No specific mention of any vendor is made. No language, no hardware, no software. The closest thing to an endorsement is a few references to the various IT teams using open source tools to quickly create a solution, and that's about as specific as it gets. Literally, it's just about three sentences scattered around the book that basically say \\"the team used some open source tools to create a solution for...\\"<br />The Phoenix Project is about the strategic understanding of work. Not just IT work. Not just project management. Not operations. Not development. Just work. The concepts can be applied to any work wether it's making fences from driftwood on the shores of a Madagascar to the most complex operating environemnt in the most web 2.5 trendy-kewl devop shop you can imagine. It very wisely and deftly avoids any vendor bias.<br /><br />It also avoids departmental bias. SysAdmins, security, development, management - they're not intentionally pitted against eachother. Bill, the protagonist, comes from an infrastructure background and his character has the typical negative mindset towards developers as being only in the business of crashing production systems and the security guys as only wanting to halt all projects with inane restrictions. The mindset is eye-rollingly stereotypical, however it shows each department's conversion to a belief in a larger concept that just their small team's goals. If any team got short shrift in the book, it was security, but I'm willing to admin that my understanding of how and why securitywas treated like it was is a bit foggy. I think there are larger concepts and business processes that I'm not familiar with that would explain what happened and why. (I won't spoil anything - read it for yourself and if you figure it out, let me know! =) )<br />On a more nuts-and-bolts level, the book is presented in a very clean fashion. There's no table of contents. There are no chapter titles save for having a date printed beneath the chapter number. There are 35 chapters spread across 338 pages making the story flow in small, manageable chunks. I like this format for this book since it makes less of an emphasis on story development and more on getting the reader to consume concepts in small bites. Had I not been multitasking so hard for a week, it could have been finished in two evenings. One Saturday if you've got nothing to do on the weekend.<br /><br />*The Background and Foreground*<br /><br />This book is apparently the first fruits of  the digestion and practice of an enormous body of work and decades of combined life/work experience among the authors. Much of the material that this book is founded upon is listed in the IT Revolution Press blog post \\"Where to Learn More About Concepts In The Phoenix Project\\".<br /><br />These four authors have worked together before with the book \\"The Visible Ops Handbook: Implementing ITIL in 4 Practical and Auditable Steps\\" and \\"Visible Ops Security: Achieving Common Security and IT Operations Objectives in 4 Practical Steps\\".<br /><br />There is a second book on the horizon for IT Revolution Press called \\"The Devops Cookbook.\\" In fact, there is a very transparent pitch for this book that is woven into the final pages of the story. (Side note: I found the setup for \\"The Devops Cookbook\\" to be the most gag inducing part of the book, but by the time I made it to the last few pages I had gained a startling ability to quickly suspend my distaste for the storytelling and take the bumbling attempts at using various literary devices out of the equation.)<br /><br />I'm somewhat critical of devops on a broad scale. Or rather, what is sometimes passed off as devops (what is poked fun of by @DevopsBorat on Twitter). Devops itself is a nebulous term that is in its infancy and still has no strict definition, so anyone can call anything \\"devops\\" and be nearly as right as the next person. However with an author lineup like John Allspaw, Patrick Debois, Damon Edwards, Jes Humble, Gene Kim, Mike Orzen, and John Willis, you know this will be the real deal. Not \\"I know ruby, installed puppet and now know everything about network management\\" which is what much of \\"devops\\" appears to be these days.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that while the book is, of course, fiction, it does have an interesting way of blending reality into the story here and there. Mostly to make mention of certain names and books like Rother, Ohno, \\"The Game\\" and references to Toyota in the 1950s. In chapter 30, the 2009 Velocity Conference where John Allspaw and Paul Hammond delivered their \\"Ten Deployments Per Day\\" talk is referenced and takes the focal point for a few chapters as characters are aghast at the thought of that many deployments.<br /><br />*Final Words*<br /><br />On the back of the book's dust jacket, Adrian Cockroft is quoted as saying the book is an \\"IT swamp draining manual for anyone who is neck deep in alligators.\\" It isn't. It's an introduction course on wetland management written by a few brilliant professors that didn't earn stellar marks in literature class.<br /><br />The book feels like someone has overturned a box full or Erector Set parts in front of you and provided a few wrenches and torn instructions. You have a great sense of potential at what you see laying before you. The instructions give opaque guidance on the ultimate value that could be created with them. But you know you need more resources to draw on and time to think in order to pull it together a high degree of skill and success.<br /><br />(Note: Apparently the book had a name change from \\"When IT Failts\\" to \\"The Phoenix Project.\\" This can be a bit confusing when researching the book itself. Even in the acknowledgements section at the end of the book, one of the authors refers to the book as \\"When IT fails.\\" Thanks to whoever was the catalyst behind changing the title from what would have been one of the most ill conceived book titles in the history of publishing to something compelling and worthy of the book's awesome cover art. Thank you.)<br /><br />If you can get past the story telling, and ignore the tropes and unrealistic outcome (or rather, the unrealistic timetable that the outcome developed over) then I think you can be fired up to probe deeper into this realm of plant management, katas, kanbans, and other means of managing projects. I think anyone looking to learn more about what IT can bring to a business, not just geeking out on fun technologies, this book will be a good tool to get your feet wet in some pretty large topics and give you a diving board into much deeper waters.

B003Q6D2B4|4.0|One nice thing about \\"Red\\" is that it doesn't take itself seriously. And with a Malkovich and a Mirren (among others), it doesn't have to. Totally implausible but immensely entertaining, the film needs to be taken for what it is: entertainment to go with the popcorn and drink. An added treat is a rare appearance by then-93 year old Ernest Borgnine, who seems to have been acting virtually up until his demise. And the SFX lovers will have a feast...

B001I45UFC|5.0|These books by C.S. Lewis, along with James Harriot's amazing books about his veterinary career, are my favorite books to this time. It's no surprise that I studied English lit as an undergrad and am now in Veterinary school. I'm sure these books changed me for better, and I'm actually a bit upset that my husband has never read any of them! If I have children, I will make sure the hard copies are around for them to read when they're ready. For now, I've bought the whole series for my kindle so I can take them around. The ones I read as a child are at my parents house and might as well stay in their library. The Lion, the witch and the wardrobe is the first one written, but chronologically it's second.  I would probably read this book first because it was fun reading prequel later and then going back to the LWW. Have fun reading!

B007REV4YI|5.0|Skyfall was a perfect addition to the Bond series. Being darker than the other films, this movie adds more insight into the characters and into the franchise itself. The disc was of excellent quality and the disc matches very well with my Bond 50 anniversary boxed set. I preordered it which seemed to take quite a while longer than it should have normally but it is exactly what I wanted. Skyfall's one of the best.

0446672653|3.0|Brein Weiss, MD, who has done multiple past life regressions focused on how he indirectly brought patients together who had known each other in past lives. By coincidence, two of his patients, one from Mexico and the other from the United States, had been lovers in past lives. Dr. Weiss, himself, was astounded when he realized this coincidence while doing past life regressions with them both. Although he never mentioned to either, so as not to betray patient confidentiality, that the other was a past lover while they were, together, in the waiting room, they each thought the other seemed familiar to them and were instantly attracted.  One returned to Mexico, but they met, by accident, at the airport when one of them had a delayed flight. Today they are both married to each other. What a wonderful love story! Barbara Fifield
B005PR44XC|5.0|Amazing insight into the world financial state and how money is really worth nothing on paper.<br /><br />An excellent read overall.
B005LAIISA|5.0|This movie really held it's own! Was a little worried being it is like the 4th Ice Age movie, really glad that they kept original voices of lots of the main characters!  Good flick!

0385344228|5.0|To be fair i havent gotten all that far in the book but i am a very picky reader- a book has to hook me in from the get-go or i get bored. Im definitely hooked. If youre into murder mysteries (and im usually not) i say go for it!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Fun game! Lots of levels to beat by improving your time. You can stay engaged with this game for a long time.
B00AG51V8E|2.0|I am really surprised by this movie, usually if it has Bruce Willis it is fairly good. I think that they put Bruce Willis in it just to sale copies, because he is not in it for very long. The acting is not great, even Sigourney Weaver wasn't very good in it. So I would say don't waste your money or time getting and watching this movie. Decent storyline, but became confusing in some parts because there was alot going on.

1616550414|5.0|A few people waited for this book to get a sneer to other non-illustrative, more analytic ones.<br />Well, this is no analysis of the games, or historical point of view.<br />But for the fan I am, the chronology, the illustrations used are a lot of fun material and bring back a lot of nice souvenirs.<br />A must-have for the fans!

B005FUTBWS|3.0|The essential message would have come through more clearly if they hadn't made the mistake of making the Government likewise evil.  Strategic error.  The government is ideally the instrument of the people, and we count on them to keep us safe from wackjobs.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So there are several books that have left me with an emotional pain with the realization that the last line of the story has arrived.  Hopeless was one of those novels that grabbed me hard with all of it's might, or shall I say words.  A grip that was so tight from page one until the very end.  Hopeless is the story of seventeen year old Sky.  It's her life and relationships that the reader immediately falls in love with.  Homeschooled for her entire educational career by her single parent, adoptive mother, Sky has decided that spending her senior year of high school in a public setting would be  a life experience that she didn't want to miss out on.  Her best friend Six won't be there to help her through the transition, as she will be abroad, but Sky pushes on hoping that she will survive.  Of course she is faced with the usual gossip and cliques that most \\"new students\\" are faced with.  However, thankgoodness for Holden, a new friend in her life that steps up to the plate in more ways than just one.  I can't say enough about Holden.  In my eyes, he's the silent hero,  taking charge, taking command, protecting Sky no matter the cost.<br /><br />Hopeless is jammed packed with twists, turns, secrets, heartaches and love.  Written in first person, the reader gets a true view of Sky and Holder's feelings and thoughts.  The minor characters sprinkled throughout the story all have been developed very nicely by the author.  The reader truly becomes attached and invested in their lives.  The storyline has dark and emotional undertones, that truly hit you when you least expect it.  Be prepared to fall in love all over again and to possibly shed some silent tears.  This is truly an amazing novel that gives new meaning to the word HOPELESS... - Deitre
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I love my case.  It protects my screen, is simple to use, keeps it all clean and tidy, and feels like a leatherbound book.  Also love the &#34;kickstand&#34; feature.  Great value for the price!
B002SQ364Q|4.0|It was almost as if I was there-- ironically, since the lead character was only at the fringes of the event.  I like that the film did not have a lot of big name actors.  That makes it easier to see the characters AS the characters.
0143116738|5.0|Ordered the book 3/5 and received it 3/8.  The book is like new with no markings or highlighting. Great purchase.
B000SEI230|5.0|I love this book, it's a happy book and such a sad book at the same time. I had to put it down a few times because I was crying so hard and I couldn't see. I also read it in one day, I just couldn't stop reading.
B00BETX5PS|4.0|I liked it for a few of the big action scenes, Javier is weirdo, but not my favorite Bond ever.
0143120530|4.0|One of the most annoying and frustrating human flaws is probably our forgetfulness. In Moonwalking with Einstein, Joshua Foer offers a range of useful and surprising facts about memory, from its history to its significance in life. However, the first thing to be noted is the book's style of writing. Since Joshua Foer is a journalist, this book is essentially an investigative report of his journey to the US memory championship, explaining his initial motives to find out if an average person can master in advanced memory techniques, and also how memory has become more externalized with modern technology and its negative consequences. Therefore for readers who are more used to novelistic style of writing (a more cohesive style), this book can be a tough one to follow with its overwhelming amount of information and character names. For this reason, I would much recommend this book to people who are particularly intrigued by the topic of memory and perhaps those who study in this area, but for the average readers like me who are only looking for a lighthearted easy read, this may not be the one for you.
