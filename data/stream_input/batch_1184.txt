B004X0XA82|5.0|I've been listening to the Sun Giant EP and the self titled album since they came out and was very much looking forward to Helplessness Blues. Upon finally listening to this a few times I must say that I am not in the least bit dissapointed. It's funny, I was walking through a music store the other day and they were playing \\"The Shrine/An Argument\\" in the background. If you've heard the song you know that there is a section at the end in which there is a very disjointed and improvisational saxophone cadence (that reminds me of drunken geese on a fall day), played against a solitary drumbeat and violin rhythm. When this part of the song came on the girl behind the counter was chatting with another customer and said something to the effect of \\"I liked the last album from these guys but just can't get into this one.\\"     Well for me, the drunken geese section of \\"The Shrine/An Argument\\" is a great example of why I like this album so much. These musicians are exploring new sounds and ideas yet at the same time they remain true to what makes them \\"Fleet Foxes\\". I don't know how true fans of their previous efforts could dislike this one.     A lot of times there are groups that come out with a freshman album that I really enjoy and hardly ever take out of my stereo. I look forward to their sophomore effort, and when it hits the shelves, I find out that the band has changed their sound so much that it doesn't even sound like the same group anymore. Fortunately Fleet Foxes has not made this mistake. Their music has matured but they have also remained true to their roots. And now that I have been a fan of them for three albums I can see myself listening to their music for a very long time to come.

143327079X|5.0|Saw so many comments from those who felt very strongly that the narrator ruined the book that I almost didn't purchase it.  So glad I did because I felt the narrator added to the book - certainly the author thought so as well.  Perhaps those who didn't like the narrator are those who do not want to taste the experience of the story. For instance, those people would also hate Maya Angelou's rich voice, with her slow cadence and enunciated words.  When I read a book, I read much faster, but when I LISTEN to an audiobook, I want the atmosphere and the nuances that I may miss with a quick read.  My only complaint may be that it ended too abruptly - would've preferred a couple more chapters to flesh out a couple story threads.  A great book - I've already downloaded two more of Mankell's.

B0051BNRTO|4.0|Nick Hornby, in Juliet, Naked, returns to the world in which many of his fans met him for the first time: that of pop music and the music's obsessed super-fans.  Readers of High Fidelity will certainly feel comfortable with the setting and characters of Juliet, Naked, but there is a twist to the story this time.  Unlike in High Fidelity, which focused on a group of young pop culture fanatics, the main characters in this 2009 novel are old enough to know better.  But they don't often act like it.<br /><br />Tucker Crowe is an American musician who went into self-chosen exile just a few months after creating Juliet, an album that has become a cult classic - in large part, of course, because of its association with Crowe's disappearance.  Twenty years later, he is said to be living alone on a farm, so successfully isolated that not even a decent picture of him has been seen in all that time.<br /><br />Duncan and Annie, in the meantime, are living their own lives in a lifeless little English seaside town.  The two are not married, but have been together for fifteen years, so Annie has grown accustomed to Duncan's preoccupation with Tucker Crowe and Juliet.  Annie, for her part, has heard the songs from Juliet so many times that they have become part of her life, too, but she is not part of the Tucker Crowe cult that has grown up around the album.  Duncan, on the other hand, considers himself to be the founding member of that cult.  He spends hours every day listening to the music and discussing Tucker Crowe sightings and rumors on the internet with the group that meets there every day.<br /><br />Things get complicated when Duncan mysteriously receives a bootlegged copy of Juliet, Naked - a basic, stripped-down version of the songs on Crowe's masterpiece album, Juliet.  Duncan not only shares the music with the Tucker Crowe cult, he posts a gushing review of the new songs in which he claims they are even better than the commercial version of Juliet.  It is Annie's reaction to the stripped-down songs, however, that will forever change the lives of her, Duncan, and Tucker Crowe.<br /><br />Juliet, Naked, at its heart, is a book about second chances.  Even Tucker Crowe, himself, admits to himself that he is pretty much a failure.  Multiple marriages have produced children he barely knows, and his current marriage (one that has given him a six-year-old son he adores) seems to be doomed.  Tucker has not worked at his music, or anything else, since he walked away from it all.  He knows there has to be more to life, and he is ready for it.  Annie, fast approaching middle age and yearning for a baby, is beginning to regret the fifteen years of her life she may have wasted on Duncan, a man pretty much content with the life they have.<br /><br />When fate, with a big assist from the Internet, contrives to bring the three face-to-face, Tucker, Annie, and Duncan find that they have a lot to learn about each other - and, more importantly, about themselves.down songs, however, that will forever change the lives of her, Duncan, and Tucker Crowe.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|Like many other fans of this series, I had been eagerly looking forward to the arrival of ADWD.  Over the past 6 years, I had re-read each of the previous books (as well as the Dance chapters that were released), been checking GRRM's website for updates, and been following other sites and articles reporting on the progress of the latest installment.  I honestly do not recall spending as much emotional energy on another author, book or series before.  Maybe all of this created an unrealistic expectation and set me up for a disappointment.<br /><br />But it was a disappointment.  A huge one.  I tried very, very hard to enjoy this book as I struggled through the first several chapters, making my way through 40% before forcing myself to stop, take a break, and start over fresh.  I even went through previous book summaries, just to make sure I didn't miss anything that was causing me not to get what was going on here.  I grudgingly read about 70% before giving up and stopping for good, which was the absolute last outcome I would have expected.<br /><br />To be fair, I'm still not 100% sure what the problem is.  Although this really didn't bother me in past books, I found myself weary with the food references and the phrases that have been exhausted by now (A Lannister pays his debts/you know nothing Jon Snow).  Much more importantly, I was completely lost with the new characters, the new bands, and the new places with new histories - all of which in my opinion just seemed odd given how far we are in the series.  Regardless of whether or not AFFC/ADWD should be looked at as one book or separate volumes, after 4K+ pages I was hoping to stay closer to the characters that were not killed off, and get SOME sense of the beginning of how all of this is going to end.  I was surprised with the constant cliffhangers (which in Dance  seemed to be a little forced and artificial compared to how chapters from previous books ended).  Maybe this series has just gotten too long or is being stretched to span 7 books.  Whatever the cause, I'm  cutting the cord on my attachment and will not wait for the 10+ years that I'm guessing it will take to finish this (if it does get finished).  This is more than a little depressing to me, considering how much I really enjoyed the other books, and the thought I had that this really was going to go down as one of the greatest sagas of all time.<br /><br />All of that said, GRRM should be given a ton of credit for setting out to write a story of this scope, so vastly different from the standard fantasy books of the simple farmer turned hero who sets out on an impossible quest with his harmless trouble making friends, interacting with one dimensional characters to overcome the dark evil force that's on the verge of destroying the world.  All of the previous books in this series (even AFFC) were monumental.  Regardless of how little I liked the Dance and how/if the other two will end,  GRRM will have a lasting impact on fantasy writing in the future.
0553801473|4.0|Having just discovered the series, I was able to read the latest installment right after finishing Feast of Crows just days before. And this was done after reading the first four books back to back in the span of a month. So everything was fresh, and there was no 5-year wait to run up my frustrations.<br /><br />Dance with Dragons is as leisurely in its pacing at Feast of Crows, but the saving grace is that, unlike Feast, the cast of characters in Dance is far more interesting (Tyrion could be his own novel; and everyone has the hots for Daenerys, right?). While some readers may complain of the endless setup, I found myself fascinated by what Martin is hatching.<br /><br />The experience of reading the Game of Thrones series is a bit like watching the TV series Lost. There are so many sub-plots and diversions that one can't help wondering how Martin plans to coalesce the numerous strands of his gargantuan narrative into one coherent picture. But let's face it: Most fantasy readers have already guessed, from the first book, how this series is going to end. The trick lies in the getting there, and what sorts of amusements will be given to us along the way. Martin's skill at getting us there is among the best. (Though, yes, I agree with many other reviewers that there are a bit too many characters rising up from the dead. As a result, anytime a major character now dies, I wonder, \\"So how's this one going to return?\\")<br /><br />At Martin's current pacing, it seems impossible that the series will conclude with just one or even two more novels. But maybe it will? I for one will relish the rest of the journey, no matter how long it takes. I just hope that Mr. Martin is hale and hearty--it's going to take a while to finish up this mammoth tapestry!

0439023513|4.0|After finishing Catching Fire, I swore off reading any of the other 7 books on my to read list. It turns out, Mockingjay was well worth the wait and does not disappoint as the final book in the Hunger Games trilogy. Since there have been many reviews and much discussion on the topic, I'll write a brief summary and then explain what I liked and didn't like as well as what to expect from this book.<br /><br />Mockingjay begins with Katniss in District 13 under the safety and protection of their underground base. Recovering from a nasty concussion suffered in the 75th Hunger Games as well as the fact that her home district has been bombed into oblivion, Katniss admittely is not well mentally or physically as she struggles to find herself and separate reality from fantasy. After recovering sufficiently to the point of being mentally competent, Katniss reluctantly agrees to become the symbol of hope that all of the districts begin to rally around as the rebels make one final push to end the Capitol and their tyrannous ways once and for all. The war wages on and Collins paints a surprisingly strong and violent picture of war for a book for young adult readers, which I think is actually a good thing. Many young adult readers don't quite realize what it's like out there in real war and perhaps think that there are no real casualties in war. As a book that is admittedly a strong advocate in getting the reader to realize just how post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects those who come home from war and how some are never the same person ever again despite helpful drugs, therapy, and everything else as a tool in their healing. The 2nd and 3rd portions of Mockingjay deal with an assault on the Capitol and President Snow's mansion. When a seemingly innocent assault of a \\"safe\\" Capitol neighborhood goes awry, the real war begins and Collins takes us on a non-stop thrill ride all the way up to the end with a few twists and surprises along the way. Allies become foes and one surprising foe gives Katniss the truth she needs to make her final decision during the war.<br /><br />There were many elements I liked in this book as a finale to the trilogy. Just when you think you've figured out what Collins ending is going to be, she throws a surprise twist at you that only until the last few pages becomes obvious. In addition, the love triangle of Katniss, Peeta, and Gale is finally resolved (although in a slightly rushed and somewhat unsatisfactory way), which provides a bit of closure. Although the real surprise for me was the development of Haymitch as a pivotal character in Mockingjay. Haymitch reminded me a lot of Patches O'Houlihan from Dodgeball in a comedic and sad way in that they were both once greats that now are seemingly useless and intolerable people troubled by their pasts. While Haymitch doesn't significantly factor into the equation in the end, I was happy to see Collins develop him a lot more as a character and not just some useless drunkard that he was in the first two books. Finnick is a lot more developed as well and the reader begins to see the real reasons behind his seductive charms and persona from Catching Fire. Also, the exploration of what can happen to even the best intentioned leaders in power and the often corrupting nature of power was a very effective message which could serve as a welcome wake-up call for those to have a more critical eye and be more involved in their participation of whatever government they might have in their country. Collins doesn't stir a nest or implant a deep conspiracy theory that all governments are evil, but merely to be conscious and not to believe everything you read and her on the news.<br /><br />That being said, there are elements of the book that take away at least a star for me. For being the main protagonist throughout the first two books, Katniss spends a good deal of her time either lying in a hospital while an IV drips morphling and other various drugs into her body or unconscious and a complete mental case. Granted, in reality war does do this to people but I felt like Collins could have done a little better job with Katniss' character. In addition, the way some of the characters that Katniss holds dear are killed off leaves something to be desired too, as it seems like Collins just wanted to have them killed to get them out of the way. The details/emotion were definitely lacking in a few deaths towards the end and I felt were just glossed over. The epilogue in a lot of books typically doesn't offer too much in terms of depth and substance and the epilogue of Mockingjay is no different.<br /><br />***SPOILER***<br />***SPOILER***<br />My main gripe with the epilogue isn't necessarily that, it's the resolution of Peeta's character that is just slightly odd and unsettling. After being brainwashed and tortured by President Snow throughout the book as well as being programmed as a weapon of destruction against Katniss and spending half his time either sedated, in chains, or shackles of some kind - all of the sudden he just pulls it all together in the end? It's not quite believable from that regard<br />***SPOILER***<br />***SPOILER***<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />With all of the above being said, I still felt it was a more than satisfactory end to the Hunger Games trilogy. There's no doubt that the 1st book was absolutely outstanding and that Catching Fire was a very worthy sequel. However, Mockingjay is not the disappointing finale in a series like it so often can be. It's not an easy read sometimes as Collins goes full-force with the atrocities and tragedies that war entails, but it also tidies things up in a manner that doesn't leave you with many lingering questions or what-if's. I feel that the overall 3.5 star review of this book is an interesting result since concluding books of a series are often either hit or miss. Maybe I'm biased in that I love to read just to read and unless the story just has obvious flaws and patches that make no sense, I don't often give a book a less than 3 star review. I'll also throw in a slightly un-related plug in that the price of each book in the series is very appealing compared to a lot of mainstream authors and the prices their publishers set. Whatever Scholastic Press is doing, it certainly isn't pricing fans out of the market.<br /><br />-Travis Smental case.

B004G5ZXVQ|1.0|As a long-time fan of REM, I cannot say, how disappointed I am at this, their newest and worst album to date! Their last couple of albums were mixed bags, with some inspired and some not-so-inspired songs, but this one is a disaster. It lacks direction, and what direction it has, is amateurish, uninspiring, and uninteresting. Michael Stipe sounds awful, and the group, if this is indicative of their current incarnation, has really lost it. And I have been one of their biggest fans, and still love and cherish so much of their \\"songbook.\\" Even went to a wonderful benefit concert two years ago of \\"The REM Songbook,\\" in NYC. I listened once to this album, and was crestfallen. What has happened to a once great band?
0553801473|5.0|This book seems to have gotten the same negative reviews as Feast for Crows, and I don't really know why.  I thought it was great!  It wasn't quite as awesome as the first couple books, but it still had me not wanting to put it down.  Yes, there were a ton of cliffhangers and the book didn't end really resolved on anything - but we should be used to that, it's just his writing style.  I agree with some of the people that there were a couple chapters that should have been left for the next book (mainly Cersei and Jamie) because they didn't really add anything to this story, but that doesn't make it a bad book.  It was exciting, a lot happened, and it isn't always what was expected.  Some new character perspectives, like Barristan, Asha, Melisandre, and Quentyn, added to the variety and it was nice to see things from some new perspectives.  I enjoyed reading this book and while I don't look forward to the wait for the next book, I am excited for the book itself.

Let's face it, in most other versions, you wouldn't know anything else happened between the time Cathy dies and Heathcliffe's death years later.  This one is the most well-rounded.  Please enjoy!
0345522478|4.0|Atticus O'Sullivan is a 2000+ year old Irish Druid.  Currently, Atticus is living in Arizona, but he has spent his life on the run; in hiding from his Fae enemy, Aenghus Óg.  Many lifetimes earlier, Atticus gained possession of a powerful Fae sword that Aenghus wants for himself.    After 2000 years, Atticus is tired of running.  This time, when Aenghus finds him, Atticus decides that it is time to face the enemy.  He has become a powerful magician and accomplished swordsman in his own right, and he knows he has a fighting chance.     Fortunately, Atticus is not alone.  His best friend is an Irish Wolfhound named Oberon whom he can speak with telepathically.  Oberon is fiercely loyal and an excellent guard dog.  Also in Atticus's corner are a Vampire, a pack of Werewolves, and a few Fae Goddesses.  As the time for the faceoff grows nearer, Atticus discovers that many characters have their own agendas for wanting Aenghus dead - and even the Fae who are on his side of the war have no problem manipulating him.    My favorite part of this book was the dialog; Atticus is a smartass, and it is a lot of fun to read his narration of the story.  One of my favorite quotes from the book was \\"A friend will help you move, a really good friend will help you move a body\\".... and what made this quote so especially funny was that it referred to his elderly widowed neighbor Mrs. McDonough.     Something else that was a pleasant surprise:  our hero Atticus is not bound to any lofty ideals about fighting honorably.  His choices are steering him to win the battle and nothing else.  Several times he comments about how honor is the fastest way to die.  I found this incredibly refreshing because I don't believe that a war can be won with honesty and integrity.... the nature of war is cunning and deception.    On the negative side, there were a few things that didn't sit as well with me.  First, the setting was an odd choice.  This is a story about an ancient Irish magical Druid warrior living in Tempe, Arizona.  To me, this is the equivalent of having Bram Stoker's Dracula set in present day Miami.  The author does explain the location, but I still struggled with it from time to time while I was reading.    Another struggle I had was with the melting pot of supernatural characters.  Just about every possible preternatural species was represented in this book.  I think there might be readers who find this to be a positive attribute to the book, but I am a HUGE fan of celtic mythology and I felt the variety of species diluted the Celtic storyline.  I was looking forward to this being a Druid/Fae book, but it was actually a little bit of everything.    Overall, I though Hounded was very entertaining.  It's definitely worth reading for the smartly written Atticus character alone.  I'm looking forward to seeing what he faces in the next installment of the series

B004EPYZOO|2.0|SPOILER FREE REVIEW    I'm a Nicholas Cage fan and despite very solid performances by Nicholas Cage, Amber Head, and William Fichtner, they could not save a bad script and horrible direction.    I think this movie is a great example of having a good idea but being unable to execute effectively.    The premise and plot are very interesting however the script was not cohesive and the direction could not quite find the right balance between being bad ass over the top and being grounded enough to connect us to the characters.    Some parts of the movie come off as cartoonish, some as if it should be on Jack Ass, some as if it should be on Airplane...  basically the movie is just a giant mess.    But even with all that, I think the actors did a phenonmenal job.  So IMO, its just not their fault, but rather a bad script and horrible direction.      amnightus
0691143692|5.0|This is a super book, well organized and informative. Chapters are arranged by thematic issues, rather than in chronological sequence. Reference to ruler lists and a chronology in the back helps place each episode in historical perspective.    When I first saw the book I wondered what could be added to Julius Norwich's 3 volume history, but was pleasantly surprised. It's curious, however, that the author never credits Norwich in her extensive bibliography. Is there a rivalry, or does Herrin not consider the older work worth reading?    I would be interested in reading the other works by this author.
B000R2SXJ6|5.0|The third album from The Jimi Hendrix Experience was released in 1968 and, more than 40 years on, justifiably finds its place in most people's top ten greatest rock albums of all time.<br /><br />However the fame/notoriety of EL doesn't really do it justice: to realise just how ground-breaking and innovative this project was, how revolutionary in concept and execution, you need to listen to it against other music from the period.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I love Jaycee. I was a young woman just out of high school when she was stolen. I thought in that week I never want to bring a child into this life if this can happen to someone so easily. I too live in northern CA, and thought of all the places...this is where I can be safe. I am encouraged by Jaycee that she can be so open and honest while having suffered such inhumane circumstances for such a long long period of time. I am now a Christian and she doesn't profess to be one herself but she lives in her heart like one. Shining a light for all to see...and hopefully learn from. I can't help but love her, her children and family. Thank you to all that did something, anything to help in her recovery and continued life. May she be richly blessed, loved, and cherished each day as she finds peace to just live out her future. What an amazing story of survival, and resilience.
0553801473|4.0|A lot of the reviewers have pretty harsh words to say here. Let me say that this book was worth reading.<br />---------------------------------<br /><br />Pros:<br />All the cliffhangers left in \\"Feast\\" are more or less resolved or are left in a more bare-able manner.<br /><br />The new POV's are very entertaining. I don't really want to give spoilers but the Reek/Theon chapters are probably the best in the book. His story arc alone was very satisfying and I loved the last line he delivers. His character really grows in this book.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, the POV chapters in the North a very entertaining and are 5 star. Jon's chapters are the High light of the book.<br /><br />The series is shaping its end:<br />A lot of the reviewers say that it doesn't look like this series is even starting to formulate a conclusion, even with this 5th book in a series of 7. I have to disagree. It might just be my feeling but I felt very satisfied with were all the characters were at the end and could easily visualize there coming home with these next to books. Its hard to explain but you really need to pay attention with what happens in these chapters because its easy to miss certain things. And if you need a more clear example I would simply recommend re-reading the epilogue because the readers have a pretty good idea of what a certain POV will do.<br /><br />Finally I would like to say that although there were some boring chapters when it is all said and done I am excited for the next book. All the POVs had very interesting conclusions and the readers should expect a lot of fast paced action in the next book.<br /><br />--------------------------------------<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Most of the reviewers here were quick to point out how boring certain POV chapters were. Let me say that the only POV chapters I found boring were the Tyrion chapters. I think what irked people the most about this is that as a character Tyrion is the most entertaining to read and he is generally the fan favorite of this series. However his chapters are boring and I think people think that his chapters don't do his character justice. Plus there are a lot of Tyrion chapters and about 3/4 of them a very dry and dense reads. So that is to say a size-able bite of \\"Dance\\" is pretty boring(sad to say).<br /><br />Only 3 Bran chapters. Now these chapters are very well written and entertaining. But there are only 3! However, i am not really going to push this as a con too much because even though there are only 3 Bran chapters a lot happens too him and he is subtly shown in other POV chapters if you pay attention.<br /><br />I believe the books biggest weakness is its pacing. As far as the chapters go, all the chapters focused in the North of Westors are faced paced and are just as good as chapters in the first 3 books. However, the pace is considerably slower in the south of westeros and in the eastern continents. And since most of the stories POVs happen there it does hurt the book. I believe if these chapters were shorter and edited a little more it would have helped a lot. Having said that I do not want to give the impression that the POV chapters in the east are all boring in the later half in the book they are very interesting and worth reading. Bit in there is a part in the middle were its pretty dull.
B0000AQS0F|3.0|I was disappointed to find that Disc 1 had a number of \\"bad spots\\" on it that froze the feed and forced me to jump to the next scene. Other than that, the rest of the discs worked fine.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|Everyone's favorite combo in director Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio is here once again in Shutter Island, and the end result is a masterpice. Every character, every scene, and just about every word in the scrip is pure perfection. This psychological thriller has Leonardo searching an American prison for a missing patient and, eventually, answers to the island's true intentions. I won't spoil the plot, and since words do it no justice, I will simply say that if you love Scorses and DiCaprio and don't have this movie, you do not love them. Simple as that.
B004XWLN20|2.0|I really can't see myself paying this much for this set when I already own seasons 1-8, waited on season 9 to see if they put out a complete Blu-Ray collection. Until it comes out like this on Blu-Ray I'll take a pass. If they can go back to '05 and put out a complete Blu set for Lost you'd think they would put the effort in it for Smallville. This just seems rushed to me. Feels like they just wanted to hurry up and have this available by Christmas time this year.
1594744769|2.0|Take the found photos from \\"Time and Again,\\" the collection of children from Harry Potter, the mutants of X-Men, and mix in dashes of other sci-fi and fantasy literature, and you come up with this novel.  While it's not all that original, it is a good read. However, I thought the photos, while they may have provided inspiration to the writer, need not have been shared with the reader; they really did nothing for the plot that more detailed writing couldn't have done.  In addition, the novel's voice, that of the 16-year-old protagonist/narrator, is inconsistant, fluctuating between juvenile delinquency and thoughtful, philosophical adulthood.

If you have a camera using XD I would suggest you buy an extra because before too long you won't see them.  They are pretty much out of the retail stores now.
0307272702|4.0|This book is a readable scientific explanation proving that carbs make us fat.  It is refreshing to read a book that discusses how we should eat without trying to sell their diet plan.
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I came to this series late, so I wasn't bothered by the fact that each and every novel left so many plot lines hanging.  I was able to immediately start the next book in the series and that was fine for the first few.  But enough is enough!  I don't see anything getting wrapped up and have no appetite for a ten or twelve book series.  They just aren't that good.<br /><br />If GRRM would just lose some of the endless and boring detail about meals and store houses and family lines that having nothing to do with the story, this might have been a wonderful series.  Maybe five books...tops.<br /><br />Like many others have said...I find myself skimming past monotonous trivialities just to find some meaningful plot movement.  GRRM must feel this brings richness to the narrative, but after five books, it has just gotten tedious.  I feel like I skimmed past at least a third of the book.<br /><br />This series reminds me of the television series \\"Lost.\\"  It was interesting at first, but the writers \\"lost\\" their way and it became a convoluted mess with an unsatisfying ending.  Some people will love it to the end, but I'm afraid I won't be along for the ride.  At this point, I'm not convinced the author himself knows where the series is going or when it will end.
0634009206|4.0|I bought this book thinking it was for guitar, but as soon as I got the book I knew it was exclusively for drums. I was very disappointed obviously, and sent it back a few days later.<br /><br />However, I did look through it and have to say the drum transcriptions are pretty spot on; only Mitch himself could have written better parts. So if you are looking for DRUM tabs only for this album, then look no further.<br /><br />I still think it is a little misleading to not list this book as, \\"Jimi Hendrix - Are You Experienced (Drum Tab).\\"<br />That would save many peoples' time, and not piss off anyone looking for a guitar tab.<br /><br />Amazon: PLEASE CHANGE THE TITLE OF THIS PAGE!!
B000JVSUS4|3.0|If it wasn't for the rather cool Japanese invasion of Pearl Harbor, this movie would be nothing more than a simple made for TV romance story.  And they really stretched that \\"two men love the same woman, and one woman loves those two men\\" schlock throughout the whole 3 hour movie.  If it wasn't for the cool 40 minute Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in the middle of the film, I'd never watch this again.<br /><br />One funny note: The Japanese Commander chose to attack innocent people (we americans) who had no interest in participating in the war, and with all that killing of innocent people, they called it a means of \\"honor\\". I guess, to them, shooting somebody in the back to avoid equaled confrontation must be a means of \\"honor\\" too.<br /><br />It is interesting though that Dan Ackroyd was in this film.  He was in the 1979 John Landis comedy \\"1941\\".  Now that's a World War II movie of the Japanese attacking an american beach that is worthy of watching again and again.  I wish they would release that movie onto Blu-Ray because it has alot a cool visuals of WWII airplanes and various familiar comic actors and actresses.<br /><br />Anyway, Pearl Harbor has it's moments, but I doubt I'd ever watch it again unless I had some female company that forced me to sit down with them and watch it again.  I would definitely need some alcohol to sit through that long movie ever again.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This is a fantastic movie.  I have shared it with many people I know and almost everyone who has watched it has been moved by the movie and wanted to learn more after watching it, which I think is a good accomplishment for a movie.
B0034G4ORM|1.0|I wonder if the maker of this film has anything to do with the maker of the film \\"Monsters\\" because the intention and the overall outcome seems to be the same.<br /><br />They put all these cool scenes of an alien invasion all through their trailer to promote the film, but I guess all those aliens that were actually seen in the movie were already seen in the trailer.  The rest of the whole two hour movie was just about men arguing about \\"who's in charge here\\" and \\"what makes you think you're so special? My friend died under your command.\\"  Oh Geez, blah, blah, blah!  It would have been more realistic if all the soldiers involved were all women with menstrual issues so that the tiresome drama would make more sense about a bunch of women b!tchin' about what they are displeased about of all the questionable commands thrown at them throughout the film. (Forgive me for exaggerating a little bit here. I'm just being a little silly.)<br /><br />But, this: I'm serious about. There seems to be a new kind of film promotion and end result that continues to prove itself here.  Some film-makers now think: Let's spend a huge chunk of the film budget on a cool movie trailer, and then go cheap on filming the rest of the movie around it.<br /><br />Boy, this movie was tiresome, dialogue-laden screen fodder!  You just can't count on a cool movie trailer anymore.  That seems to be where they put all their money on hoping to sell a movie these days.  A new film making strategy that guarantees that they get your money, but not concerned, at all, if you actually enjoyed the film afterwards.
B005AUWY90|5.0|My daughter, 7, and my son, 10, and I loved this movie.  We laughed, we loved the suspense involved and we loved watching Mater take the spotlight it this delightful film.  It's nothing like the original, but that was okay with us.  My son and daughter loved the spy plot and all the cool tricks the cars could do.  As a parent, I loved watching the lessons Mater and others learned about accepting yourself, true friendship, and the spirit of adventure. There are some car crashes; however they don't seem death-like or violent to me or my kids. My son left the theater saying it was the best movie of 2011. That's a five star rating in my book!
B000002MU3|4.0|Monster is a very good album from R.E.M. and more of an artistic statement than their more popular releases. The guitars were louder than ever before and heavy on the echo and distortion and Michael Stipe experimented a lot with his voice here as well. Most of the songs are very good as the fast paced \\"Star 69\\" is carried by Peter Buck's jangly but noisy guitar while \\"Strange Currencies\\" is a beautiful ballad with an excellent lyric and vocal from Stipe and isn't all schmaltzy like \\"Everybody Hurts\\" was. \\"I Took Your Name\\" and the hit \\"What's The Frequency, Kenneth?\\" are strong rock tracks carried by the riffs while the excellent \\"Bang and Blame\\" has an almost tribal beat during its verses before returning to loud power chords during the choruses.  Other strong tracks include the super noisy \\"Circus Envy\\", the moody \\"I Don't Sleep, I Dream\\" and the mid-tempo and oft-kilter \\"Crush with Eyeliner\\". The only misstep here is \\"King of Comedy\\", some attempt at rap and dance that doesn't work. The last track, \\"You\\", is the album's masterwork that is both haunting and sensuous in its execution. R.E.M. is one of the most adventurous bands of the last 30 years and Monster is one of their best albums.
0307272702|5.0|Gary deserves to be honored as a national hero.  Getting out the truth on how carbs are fattening and unhealthy and taking the fire for it from would be professionals that refuse to look at the evidence (even from studies they held to try to prove low carb bad and low fat good, but which actually did the OPPOSITE - proving low carb to be the only healthy lifestyle one can lead to avoid heart attacks, diabetes, stroke and obesity).<br /><br />If you've tried diets and struggled with 'will power' or hunger, put your mind at rest.  YOU are not the problem.  The real culprit is the USDA and groups that have pushed the low calorie and low fat diets on the American public for the past 40 years (which happens to also follow a rise in sugar use per capita and the rise of - or epidemic of - diabetes, obesity, heart attacks, stroke and a multitude of other illnesses.  Sadly, they have hurt far more of us in the supposed desire to help.  But if the really want to HELP us, why oh why won't they listen and STOP with pushing fattening carbs on us?  How many good Americans have to die from carb diseases before the fallacy of low fat and low calorie can be realized?<br /><br />Save your families lives - read Gary's book.  The evidence is inevitable.  Follow up with some good Jimmy Moore Livin La Vida Low Carb podcasts, easy to follow recipes on You Tube from Kent Altena (user bowulf) and a visit to [..] or [..] and you'll be on your way to a healthy & happy life!<br /><br />Thanks Gary - we owe our health to you!
0316010669|1.0|I found Blink to be superficial with no serious insights.  Its basic premise is to trust your snap judgement but only if you have sufficient knowledge to do so.  Its other points are to think outside the box and don't get bogged down in the minuteness of knowledge.    Although easy to read and somewhat enjoyable there is nothing new here, so move along.    I've also read Malcom Gladwell's \\"Ouliers\\" which I would rate higher because it did contain some new insights for me, but it was still basic pop sociology.
0345529057|5.0|If you have watched Season one of Game of Thrones on HBO, then you will read the first book and it is exactly like the story.  I loved every one of those books.

B003ZSJ212|2.0|No in-depth interviews, let alone ANY new interviews from the core ORIGINAL cast? - NO!  No return of the approximate 7 minutes that was released during New Hopes very first limited release? - NOPE  No original versions of the first 3 films prior to the \\"special\\" edition debacle? - NEGATIVE GHOST RIDER!    ... Than I am not going to buy these just to get  RICK ROLLED!  Grrrr....    PS - Rick Rolled is a term you can google for when you think your going to see one thing and you in fact are forced to watch something completely different!  ...like a Rick Astley video.  PSS - Yes, if you were old enough to see Star Wars on the limited release, prior to full nationwide release AND remember there were deleted scenes - than you know what I am talking about.  If not, than after some google research you will find that I am not the only one, and Lucas has said in the past those will not be released.  If you find old kids picture/story books, you may find one with pictures from deleted scenes like when Luke, in the first of New Hope, actually does go into town and meets newly graduated x-wing pilot Wedge and talks about the rebels!    [**update** I have been informed that this scene I am speaking of is, for the first time, \\"IS\\" being released in this set. For that reason I am changing my rating from 1 star to 2 stars.  That kind of childhood vindication that I saw a \\"different\\" version the very first time, as a child, is worth it. ....now if only I could see the original versions we are predominantly speaking of...that would be another review entirely! My final thought still stands, considering the many decades this took and my over all point...]    But who am I to ask for such things?  OH, I dont know maybe part of the generation that has payed hard earned money to line George Lucas pockets for life.  Phewww, whatever, hope I dont ever meet him in person.

LOVED,LOVED,LOVED IT!!   I always feel a little lonesome?? Maybe Lost?.. After i get done reading a book that i know there will be no follow up to, and after reading Libba Bray's Gemma Doyle Series (starting with a great and terrible beauty) I was wanting to read a book that was a fantasy and with a tough as nails charater as the Protagonist and Kasta did not dissappoint!   Kristin Cashore did a wonderful job at sucking you into the pages and leaving you constantly wondering what was going to happen on the next pages.  So if your looking for a great \\"Killer female\\" type book I would definently pick this one up and give it a try! Oh and i love that it is a Big, Fat, over 400 pages...:) Perfect..Can't wait to read Bitterblue. Fire was good also..
0345522478|5.0|Hounded by Kevin Hearne was an absolute delight to read. I cannot express how awesome this book is. I bought it sort of on a whim, not having had such hot luck with new urban fantasy authors of late, but man am I glad I picked this little baby up!  Atticus is a fantastic hero, he is strong and gifted, but not all-powerful or self agrandizing. I loved Atticus's witty banter and jokes with all the goddesses that came to visit him and his guarded but relaxed way of approaching life. I never realised druidic magic could be so rad. Some people compare Kevin Hearne to Jim Butcher, but Atticus is a million times cooler and more interesting than Harry Dresden. I loathed the limp-wristed perpetual-screw-up with no hope and no prospects side of Harry Dresden's character. He was just so ineffectual. Atticus, praise the Gods above and below, is nothing like that.     Normally I get leery of fantasy books too loaded up with fantastical creatures from many different pantheons and intersecting deities and the such, but Hounded never felt weighed down by mythology. The plot absolutely hums along with no lull or boring passages. So so so much happened and yet the story never felt rushed, there were no gaping plot holes and for such a seriously fantastical novel, I never had trouble with suspension of disbelief once! I hate it when authors insert unexplained mythology or magic and leave the reader to fumble along, desperately trying to tie together the plot as they go. Kevin Hearne is a true maestro at urban fantasy. I cannot wait for tomorrow when I get to buy the sequel!

B0000VCZKW|5.0|This is one of the best adaptations of Roald Dahl's books, and certainly enjoyed hugely by children. This is the of Matilda, a neglected but gifted child, who goes on to tackle her mostly idiotic parents, a bully of a principal, and goes on to a happy ending. When read out aloud to children, the book grabs children's attention. The movie stays mostly true to the book, but in at least a couple of instances it adds what needn't have been added. Like the sub-plot involving the bumbling FBI cops. It may have been necessary to explain the parents' hurried escape from the country later on, but the children notice the deviation from the story. The principal, Miss Trunchbull, can get scary for the children, especially in the scenes where Matilda and Miss Honey go to her house.<br /><br />In the book's illustrations (by Quentin Blake), the father is shown as a thin man. Danny DeVito is anything but thin. But he pulls the character off to perfection. The principal, Miss Trunchbull, is a shoo-in for the bully, cheating, principal. Even Bruce Bogtrotter's character is almost as you would have imagined it while reading the book.<br /><br />This is a movie that the kids can watch and enjoy.
0553805371|2.0|Overall, The Grand Design was pretty bleak and uninspiring. I think the thing that disappointed me most was the lack of anything new. Several major parts of the big chapters are copied word for word from Hawking's earlier A Brief History of Time and the information on M-Theory leaves a lot to be desired. Mostly, this work is an argument for holding out hope that a Theory of Everything is on the horizon. The book is also very, very short (especially given the hefty price tag). It's almost ridiculously upbeat considering the major mathematical roadblocks preventing the completion of such theories.<br /><br />In many ways, the title of this book is completely misleading for it fails to deliver any sort of proposals for a grand design at all. Hawking and Mlodinow spend the bulk of the book going over fundamental constants, black holes and interesting, but generally well understood, quantum phenomenon rather than delivering on the promise of the title to tie it all together. It isn't until almost the very end that the authors delve into the mysterious M-Theory, which, at this point, should not even be called a theory. It doesn't even have a proper name. Ask 10 physicists what M-Theory stands for and you'll get 10 different answers ranging from the \\"Mother of all Theories\\" to \\"Membrane Theory\\" and back again. M-Theory is more of a framework that allows for transformations between different incarnations of 10 dimensional Superstring Theories. Proponents of M-Theory argue that all versions of Superstring Theory are manifestations of this deeper theory. All you have to do is add yet another spatial dimension, bringing the grand total to eleven. One of the arguments in favor of the framework is alluded to by the title of the book: its mathematical elegance. Among the many generally accepted criteria that would validate a theory of everything is beauty. It's gained quite a bit of traction and attention of late because it's a rather neat way of showing the relationships between different versions of theories that all potentially show at least some promise of explaining reality. That's a lot of \\"maybes\\" and \\"looks likes\\" and not a whole lot of tangible results.<br /><br />On top of the rehashed nature of the information and its presentation, The Grand Design feels like it has an underlying hostility to it. The purpose of the book is to show that nature itself follows a master plan and to inspire hope that human beings are capable of understanding why it is that things are the way they are without resorting to superstition or an omnipotent and omniscient deity - all worthy and noble goals.<br /><br />Nevertheless, there are a couple things that Hawking does well. His explanations of theoretical physics applications to cosmology are still top notch, but there's nothing truly groundbreaking. The illustrations are top notch and the book clearly benefitted from some very high production values.ent versions of theories that all potentially show at least some promise of explaining reality.

B00005JKNF|5.0|[[ASIN:B000I543SM Gosford Park]] When I first saw this film almost 10 years ago I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the characters and their complicated relationships. Also I found it difficult to comprehend the dialog in the kitchen scenes because of the various accents and the noise of the clanking dishes, etc. Soon afterward I purchased the text of the film which enabled me to become better acquainted with the characters and how they connect with each other. It really takes more than one viewing of the story to get a handle on all the details as well as the dialog -- you don't want to miss the snappy exchanges -- and the more I watch it the more I enjoy the story. It's an amazing ensemble and beautifully directed by Robert Altman. Be sure to view the special features which add more depth to your viewing experience. The music adds yet another dimension to the story and, of course, the CD is most enjoyable, too.
0393316041|4.0|Ok. Feynman himself of course gets five stars, and I think my four star rating is mostly a reflection of my own slight disappointment at there being so little science in the anecdotes presented. I think I just had an expectation that any autobiography of Feynman would be centrally focused on his life's work and his passion and what I found out instead is that everything Feynman did he was passionate about! And boy does he have some stories to tell.<br /><br />The book is mostly anecdotal. There's no real flowing narrative from youth to adulthood and oftentimes the stories skip around based on themes that he's covering. In a way, it adds to the charm of the book rather than detracting from it. It's almost as if you're sitting down with him in his office as he's relating the major chapters of his life to you in a casual and friendly way. (In many ways, I believe this is exactly what it is. The end of the book contains some reference to recorded conversations with friends being consulted for many of the stories related in the book.) The stories flow naturally in a manner that mimics the way that memory works. Different stories lead him to different recollections along the same lines to events spaced throughout his life, which by all accounts, including this one, seemed full, funny, preposterous, and rewarding.<br /><br />All in all, this book put together a completely different picture of the famous scientist than the one I was accustomed to. His chief concern was living life to its fullest, going on adventures and getting into as much trouble as possible. Encapsulated between are little nuggets of wisdom about life, work and the meaning behind the big issues of his time. The most interesting thing to learn about the man was just how accomplished he was in other fields besides physics, from art to music and back to biology and genetics. Truly a man passionate about learning and committed to doing things right and satisfying every intellectual itch that occurred to him in the most straightforward way possible. The story is tremendously inspiring.<br /><br />If only there were more recollections of his work! I have the feeling, though, that he probably felt that much of it was so technical that the average reader wouldn't be able to decipher it. Great teacher that he was, he explained what he could, and what he felt would have gone over most of our heads, he limits to his feelings and impressions. A very fun read.raightforward way possible.

B005DC68NI|5.0|I am currently just about to self-publish my first novel; a project I've been working on for several years. I saw this book and debated whether to download it for being already so far along in the process.<br /><br />Shortly thereafter I ran into formatting problems, three times in succession actually, and began to rethink things. What did I really know about self-publishing? Nothing much. Sure, I knew I would win out eventually but to what degree of success?<br /><br />I downloaded this book and, in the following ten minutes alone, I reaped more insightful information on the self-publishing industry and its birth than I had (scraped together from a plethora of different on-line resources) in the last three months.<br /><br />This book is extremely well-written. It is clear and concise; and above all personable.<br /><br />At this point there is nothing more to say except, Thank you David Graughran! I really appreciate what you've put together here.
0316017930|3.0|Outliers is the study of success and an attempt to reconceptualize the traits and factors that we typically associate with success. Gladwell is eminently readable and he builds his arguments in an engaging way - usually with some rather startling or puzzling statistics, or a story of success, that is then analyzed to reveal some broader concept or meaning behind the nature of the theme: what makes some individuals so spectacularly successful, and others not?<br /><br />What's great about Outliers is that Gladwell is not afraid to focus in on the importance of factors that have for a long time, at least in America, been considered taboo since the Civil Rights Movement. What role does ethnicity play in someone's success? Are Korean pilots inferior to pilots of other ethnicities? Are American Jews more likely to succeed than members of other immigrant groups? Can poor children really learn? Gladwell does an admirable job tackling these questions without a hint of bias or racism, or even ethnocentrism. (It's not that Koreans are poor pilots, it's the culture as it relates to authority that made them more prone to easily avoidable accidents in the 60s and 70s.) This is particularly so for that time-honored question in American education: are Asians better at math? Gladwell does his homework, both sociologically and historically to put forth some compelling arguments that we are as much a byproduct of our upbringing, our geography and our time as we are of our genetics. Perhaps more so. In the broader philosophical conceptualization: nurture is more significant than nature. This is a wonderful idea, and the evidence is fairly solid, though one can conceivably poke holes in some of it as being tailored specifically for the argument and rather subjective. It is a hopeful idea, especially in the realm of education reform that hard work does matter much more than your family background or income and that these traits can be learned. It's also not a bad idea to poke holes in the myth of genius that we've built up in America, especially since the days of Horatio Alger and the booming business tycoons of the 19th century. It's a marked step on the road to both racial and socioeconomic equality that we recognize, sociologically and informationally, that all people are capable of success, and that we can breed success for a better society if we're willing to abandon our preconceived notions of it.<br /><br />The book tends to be repetitive. By the time Gladwell gets to his third or fourth example of a life-study, you're already anticipating where he's going with it. The people profiled are interesting, but you just want more of the analysis than the life story. He has a tendency to over-emphasize too, as if he's insecure about whether or not the reader is really going to appreciate the point he's trying to make, and the ending chapter on his own personal history seems to drag the work out rather than end it with definitive punctuation. His anecdote likely would have worked better toward the beginning or the middle, with the ending reserved for the KIPP story and the idea of transforming society to take new factors of success into account.<br /><br />Worth reading, and definitely has peaked my interest in reading Gladwell's other book, The Tipping Point, which from what I've gathered from other reviewers, is much better. In short, this could have been an extended article or blog post series and worked far more effectively at a much leaner size. That's not to say that it isn't enjoyable. It is immensely so and immersive, but with so many other good things waiting to be read on my shelf, I found myself skimming some parts when I felt like I knew where he was going. Maybe that's more my fault than his. Or perhaps the arguments are so intuitive, that it seems like he's just voicing something that an observant reader probably already knows.of genius that we've built up in America, especially since the days of Horatio Alger and the booming business tycoons of the 19th century.

1589795474|4.0|I read The Millionaire Next Door because of a recommendation from a person that I trust.  The book was very informative and opened up my eyes to the habits of those in the higher income brackets versus those in the middle class.  If you are looking for a book to read that deals with financial independence and the habits of millionaires, then this book is a must-read.    I gave this book four stars out of five due to the writing style.  While the authors are very enlightening about what it means to truly be financially free, they take a lot of time beating around the bush or repeating the information until it becomes dry.  It is obvious that the authors took their time preparing the material and ensuring that it is easy to read and understandable, it just becomes dull at times.  However, it isn't a long book which makes it more forgivable.    Overall, I highly recommend this book.  I believe that if you read this along with Dave Ramsey's The Total Money Makeover and apply the learned principles, anyone can become truly financially independent and enjoy an incredibly less stressful life.

061891868X|5.0|Smolin really delivers with this volume. It's pretty weighty, but the concepts are presented very neatly and without a lot of the technical jargon. The real strength of this book is Smolin's real objectivity when surveying the landscape of modern physics research. With all the hype over String Theory, it's nice to see someone take a step back from the giddying beauty and symmetries of the theory(ies) and provide a realistic assessment as to whether or not the theory has delivered. I think some of the best parts of this book are the last few chapters that deal with the sociological and philosophical aspects of science in general for the 21st century. Smolin's insights into the profession, particularly his critique for how new graduates are hired, given tenure, or research grants are pointed and disconcerting. Whether or not String Theory is the real deal, or the worst fad in physics since the aether, Smolin's approach to the subject is one that is well wroth embracing. The lesson that professionals and amateurs alike can take from this is never to put all your eggs in one basket. There've just been too many precedents of fundamental assumptions being overthrown in the past 300 years.

B00271DNP4|1.0|This review isn't about the film, but rather the streaming service, which is absolutely terrible. If I pause the movie it takes a minute or more to 'seek' the data and restart the film. THEN the volume doesn't work, leaving me no choice but to refresh the whole page or go back a page and start over.  Also, the volume is set rather low, such that I have to use headphones, though that may be my computer (MAC).

B004FVHBXY|5.0|Best crafted movie of all time.  The story is rewarding to watch and figure out. Buy the DVD to watch it over and over to figure it out.  The premise of the movie is \\"dream-sharing\\" with corrupting twists.  An intruder can extract secrets from an unsuspecting dreamer's mind; likewise, a foreign idea can be planted into a dreamer's subconscious as his own--INCEPTION.  The acting, special effects, and sound track are spectacular.  Watch the movie multiple times to marvel at how the pieces of the puzzle are weaved together with great care...ultimately, the logic is consistent.  It is easy to lose track of what's real and what's a dream as it is for the characters in the movie, so pay attention to the spinning of the top used to test their \\"reality\\" (if the spinning top never falls, that \\"reality\\" is actually a dream).  By the climax, DiCaprio's character is struggling to come back to reality and home to his family.  Is he successful?  The director leaves us clues throughout, but makes us guess whether he finally makes it home or he's lost in his dreams.  The fun of watching the movie is to figuring it out and debating over it. : )

Looking back I'm glad Swype didn't work for me. I've gone though some of the negative comments(other then language pack, which should be fixed now); most of these involve the Space key auto insert. Those people didn't realize they could change the setting to make the space bar just insert a space.  The addition of cloud based predictive feature only enhances the already good feature.  This is a learning app, meaning the more you use it the better predictive feature is.

B001E75QGG|4.0|It was a very enjoyable \\"popcorn flick\\".  It had much of the spirit of Indiana Jones, but fell short of excellence.<br />As a stand alone movie this one would be great, but we have to compare it to the original trilogy. It would have ben near impossible to match the greatness held by the others; for one Harrison ford is 20 years removed from the last movie.  I understand the whole extraterrestrial aspect is troubling to some as it doesn't fall in line with the others,but I would argue its not that far from temple of doom where the human sacrifice remains alive despite having his heart removed.<br /><br />To sum up:  This is a must see for the Indy fans out there, but don't expect it to occupy that same spot in your heart like the other three
0061998494|5.0|I have been a Craig Ferguson fan for years, and his book didn't disappoint at all.      More than anything, though, I was struck by Craig's love of America.  It was a seminal reminder to me, as one who was born and raised in the US, to always appreciate the great things about this country.  Only in America could an immigrant arrive nearly penniless, work hard, practice his craft, and with a couple of lucky breaks end up famous, wealthy, and beloved by millions.      So while we complain and argue about \\"the state of America today\\", we should always be grateful for the opportunities our country has bestowed upon us.

I remember them with bouffant hair styles. Ride the tiger bro!    Seriously this CD is just ok. It lacks aggression and is way too mellow. The Suite has some great moments and some spotty ones. The last song is darn good. In between there is a lot of bland stuff. You can't fault the new singer for this rather average offering. He does a great job when they let him but they don't really let Benoit shine. Yes fans should buy this but don't expect too much.
076790592X|5.0|Mitch Albom was already one of my favorite writers before this book was released, from his work with the Detroit Free Press.  I was switched onto his books when a friend of mine, who is not a sports fan by any measure, told me a few years ago that her favorite author was Mitch Albom.  I devoured Tuesdays with Morrie in one sitting.     It's simple to read but is absolutely captivating, especially as Mitch explains the transformation from his initial shock at seeing his old mentor Morrie struggling with his health, to how comfortable he becomes with Morrie at his advanced stage.  There are so many lessons to be learned and reminded through this story.  I immediately picked up The Five People You Meet in Heaven, which was fantastic as well.      Don't hesitate to get this book - it will be well worth the time you took to read it.

B0042JIL2E|4.0|If you're looking for a Jazz album, don't buy this. It seems the negative reviews are about it not being good Jazz. She's a Rockabilly Blues singer, no idea how she got classified as Jazz.     If you liked the first album, you'll likely love this one, although it's a little over-produced. She has a powerful voice, not smooth and sugary sweet, not Jazzy. Her writing is solid, her covers are fun.     If you're unsure, listen to the samples. Pulling the Rug, Humble and Proud, Mayhem, and Sneaky Freak will give you a good idea of the album's range. Tainted Love is raucous, good fun.
B004UXUSIM|2.0|I had the feeling I'd seen it before. The plot was similar to other Woody Allen movies. The actor played Woody Allen more than he played the movie character Gil. He sounded just like Woody Allen. He walked like Woody Allen. And another actor played the same character played by Alan Alda in other Woody Allen movies. Dialogue sounded the same as in other WA movies too. But the original Woody Allen was more like-able than his actor-imitator in this film. Nothing new here except the 1920s Paris scenery and costumes.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|The movie is an interesting take on the old nursery rhyme. Actually, it's more like \\"inspired by\\" rather than \\"based upon\\" the Red Riding Hood we all know. It will hold your attention, but don't expect anything ground breaking.    As for the presentation on DVD, I am very disappointed. Obviously, I don't expect BluRay quality, but this title suffers from very poor image quality. This seems to be a common problem with recent Warner Brother's releases. I say rent this one.

I have been listening to them for about ten years now and enjoy their 70s output the most. I have albums from all of their different eras inclding their more recent live and studio albums and with that preface, I have to say that Fly from Here is my new favorite Yes album. I was very surprised when I found out that the band was going to release an album without Jon Anderson on vocals; the new singer, Benoit David, is actually far more enoyable to listen to than Anderson (blasphemy, I know). I was also pleasantly surprised to see Geoff Downes would be playing keyboards. Sqire, Howe, and White turn in the virtuosic performances Yes fans expect and in the twilight of their career, the prog-gods dig deep to write some of the best music they've ever put out. If you like progressive rock in the least or are a fan of Yes from any era, I highly recommend this album. I wasn't sure what to expect, but I would bet you will be as pleasantly surprised as I was.
B004V9J3HM|4.0|Finally, the present effort by Neal Morse is able to take the best style from his last era with Spock's Beard (at the time of \\"Snow\\"), as well as from the most \\"metal prog-oriented\\" period with Transatlantic, but without forgetting his \\"religious\\" and more mystical roots of the early music career as a soloist (think of the track \\"Jesus' Blood\\", which goes into such direction)...Well, the typical \\"overtures\\" and more symphonic themes represent a secure \\"trade- mark\\" for an intelligent artist like him, as He's obliged to survive inside the difficult market of music; nevertheless the sound (unlike his recent compositions) is not too much derivative and a bit \\"fresh\\" too, except on the gentle-giantesque vocalism of \\"Time Changer\\" or a few parts in the vein of the quite disappointing \\"Lifeline\\". Moreover the track \\"Nighttime Collectors\\" perhaps is able to maintain the same mood as in the recent concerts with Transatlantic, where the organic work of each player has been performed live to serve the teamwork and not to let remark a specific talent on stage within a sort of \\"music-competition\\"; then I like to mention also the song \\"Time Has Come Today\\", where Neal let emerge the good music talent of the guitarist, even though emotionally it cannot be compared to the already mentioned feeling of \\"Jesus' Blood\\".  Instead, talking about the second section of the present album by N. Morse, I prefer the tune \\"Supernatural\\", where his original prog rock roots in the vein of the early Genesis emerge by means of his lush synths...even though also the pop song \\"Absolute Beginner\\"- the opener of side 2- is not bad, in spite of an obvious style, partially improved if you consider the chorus inside...then the final track \\"Seeds of Gold, (almost 26 minutes long), which is not prolix- being very \\"varied\\" in the composition- thanks also to the presence of a special guest-star like Steve Morse; but you know I don't like a too much long composition (except of course on the mythical suite \\"Supper's Ready\\" by Genesis) in every kind of music style...nevermind, the present \\"Testimony 2\\" is worth checking out anyway!!

B000002MX7|5.0|Listening to Chaka brings back memories of my youth!  Love her voice from back in the day!  Also, since becoming a member/customer of Amazon, I have been quite happy with all of my purchases and the sellers.  BIG THANKS!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Why does this application have only 3.5 stars? This is a great application and is totally worth the price. Lots of fun and has a great replayability factor.
0763644765|5.0|That was fun to show my little one how to go potty. I own a number of Leslie's books. They are so simple but to the point. Very sturdy too so they would withstand quite a bit of abuse by a small kid with tantrums.
B0052GVGYG|4.0|A fine album for Southern rock fans. Tight band, good (not great) material. Derek Trucks is by far the finest slide guitarist of his generation. Susan Tedeschi is an able vocalist, though somewhat lacking in a distinctive idiomatic style that separates good singers from great. That may come in time.
B005AUWXZ0|4.0|My son is 4 -- he loved it but not sure how much he understood the plot. He just loved the constant action.  My friend's daughter came with us, she is 10.  She really enjoyed it as well.  She and I both agreed that this is better than the first Cars.  The first Cars was slow, you had to be older I think to understand the lesson learned. Cars 2 is really for the kids who grew up with Cars and are now older and ready for more of a plot.  This is less of \\"be a good person\\" message and just plain old fun.  However, if you have a young one who LOVES anything with wheels (like mine), they are going to be equally entertained but in a different way.
1594744769|5.0|I like anything that is out of the ordinary so when I saw this book I was very intrigued. Page by page I wanted more. I finished this book in less than 7 hours, and the cliffhanger at the end has left me wanting more from Mr. Riggs. Kudos to Mr. Riggs on his first novel I will hope to be reading more from him in the future.
B0045DO8NI|5.0|Pink wears trademark snarl here as she did on her previous three albums. She's kind of tough on the outside but vulnerable on the inside which makes me want to make her some hot nutritious soup!    Most of her CDs sold here are imports so there is a plethora of choices between the different versions. Here's the tracklist for the European version so you can make an informed choice.    CD  1. Get The Party Started  2. There You Go  3. You Make Me Sick.  4. Don't Let Me Get Me  5. Just Like A Pill  6. Family Portrait  7. Trouble  8. Stupid Girls  9. Who Knew ( My All Time Fav!)  10. U + Ur Hand  11. Dear Mr President  12. So What  13. Sober  14. Please Don't Leave Me (Another All Time Fav!)  15. Bad Influence  16. Funhouse  17. Raise Your Glass  18. F**kin Perfect  19. Heartbreak Down     DVD  1. There You Go  2. Most Girls  3. You Make Me Sick  4. Get The Party Started  5. Don't Let Me Get Me  6. Just Like A Pill  7. Family Portrait   8. Trouble  9. God Is A DJ  10. The Last To Know  11. Stupid Girls  12. Who Knew  13. U + Ur Hand  14. Nobody Knows  15. Dear Mr President (From I'm Not Dead Live)  16. So What  17. Please Don't Leave Me  18. Sober  19. Funhouse  20. I Don't Believe You  21. Bad Influence (Funhouse Live In Australia)  22. Leave Me Alone (I'm Lonely) (Funhouse Freakshow Edition)  23. Please Don't Leave Me (Funhouse Freakshow Ed)  24. Funhouse (Funhouse Freakshow Ed)     Includes behind the scences of the Funhouse video and Greatest Hits photo shoot    I kind of like the old back and white silent movie treatment they used on all the Funhouse Freakshow videos. It's a nice bonus. The standard version of Please Don't Leave Me is kind of violent with ideas borrowed from films Misery and The Shining. Sober seems to suggest schizophrenia and we see Pink making out with herself. Unfortunately, the videos for the new hits are not here, so you might want to YouTube them.     The CD here contains three new songs and the DVD is loaded with videos. Quite thorough, considering it's Pink's first hits collection. Both discs exclude the minor Charlie Angels number. There's a bit of inconsistency. Explicit language can be heard on the audio but erased on the DVD. Still, very worth the money!
0757302661|4.0|I read this book and practiced the techniques before the birth of my second child (I didn't take the class...only this book).  I wanted the birth to be unmedicated (my first child was born by c-section, and my obgyn said that an unmedicated birth would be safest so that I could tell if any severe problems were arising with the VBAC), and I believe that this book helped me achieve that.      I labored for 23 hours, and certainly the techniques made a huge difference for the first 20 hours.  During this first part, I could use the techniques fairly easily and was reasonably comfortable.  For the next 2 hours, though, I needed my husband's help to stay focused, and I struggled.  And then, at the end, I was dilated to 8, and I said I couldn't take it any more and I wanted an epidural.  But before the nurse left the room, I ended up pushing.  Pushing was hard!  And hypnobirthing became useless.  The baby had decels, and I needed to get him out fast, but for some reason, my instinct was to get in bad positions that prevented the baby from coming out (like arching my back).  Luckily, all worked out in the end.  I will reread the book for my next birth to see if there is anything I missed with learning the pushing part.      Even though pushing was no good, I credit the book for getting me to that point, and for that, I'd say the book was great.  I do also use some techniques when I am very stressed and have trouble falling asleep, and they work.
B000059GEI|4.0|I like musicals, I love Donald O'connor, Dan Daily, Ethel Merman, and all the rest!  Two things bugged me about the product. The movie plot is mainly about the Donahue's and their journey in vaudeville, and therefore had more \\"air time\\" in the movie and should've been on the dvd cover.  As good as Marilyn Monroe is, she should NOT be on the cover, but as usual, advertisers think we're all neanderthals and are only interested in \\"sex appeal.\\"  The movie itself is great, but in the part where Mitzi Gaynor does her \\"French\\" dance, the volume goes way down.  I've noticed this in renting it from rental stores, so it can't be just my purchase that has this problem.  But it's a great movie with great choreography!
B004N44SOI|2.0|Loved the first album..actually still listen to it to this day but damn, what happened here?  The pure emotion and power of the previous release seems to have left the boys with nothing for the 2nd disc.  Not that it necessarily hurts my ears to listen to most of these songs but I'm just VERY underwhelmed with nearly every track here.  If this was some no-name band that I had zero expectations for then I'd just toss it in the trash and say oh well, just another wanna-be rock band, but I gave this multiple listens and tried to get into it. Overall, however, I am not impressed and expected a lot more from these guys.
B004SBB0LU|5.0|After seeing the Crown Jewels and hearing how superb they play, I was expecting a lot from the First five albums. (I received the collection of five as a gift so I can't be a \\"verified purchase\\") They have the only two albums that I still have in Vinyl from 75 and 76 ( I forget the original release dates in Tasmania, but I bought them there when they first came out). I had actually first bought the remastered Night at the Opera from 2005 before the Crown Jewels and this set, and was amazed with the quality, but I had been expecting something of that calibre after hearing the Video Collections 1 and 2 on DVD.        The amazing thing about the two different collections is that the quality is superb. Also, only the 40th Anniversary has the art work from the original albums in the booklets. The additional CDs contain material have seen on VHS official releases and DVD concerts, so to hear them polished up is just beautiful. Play them on a 5.1 system to truly appreciate what they have done in this Master collection; the depth and clarity is beyond good. I guess I would have liked a box like the Crown Jewel set , but thats probably expecting too much.         The broad selection of material on the bonus CDs is great ( such as the song from the Hyde Park concert... so where is the DVD for that ??), and there is not a weak spot amongst the whole lot. I am greatly looking forward to the second 5, since the first 5 are truly brilliant in broad sound systems. They play well in a small portable device, but you probably need higher end head-phones or ear-buds ( I have a set of Rockford Fosgates that make the experience very worthwhile), and even with my Ipod's standard KOSS, the sound is way above great. In 5.1 you get to hear so much more, and thats the main point; with the CD bonus each album gives you so much more as well. Totally Awesome package. Highly Recommended.  ( about the only thing that is tee-ing me off is the way the downloads are available in the 40th Anniversaryyear in the UK only, and they never seem to make it here to the big two download sites in the US.)
B004TB6GUY|5.0|Excellent release from Zakk and company.  All ten songs here are acoustic based tunes...including a standout version of 'Darkest Days' that features John Rich of Big & Rich fame, and great covers of Neil Young's 'Helpless' and Sabbath's 'Juniors Eyes.'  My only gripe is that they should have recorded a few more acoustic renditions of the songs from Order of the Black since they only did 'Parade of the Dead', 'Darkest Days', 'Overlord' and 'Riders of the Damned'  But I wont be greedy and will love it for what we did get.  Zakk Wylde... pure genius in all things metal, rock, and stripped down acoustic.  BLS - SDMF
B001PPF12Q|1.0|Radiohead sounds like a million other crappy bands.  I've had so many people try to nearly brainwash me into liking them...but, they just don't take.  Firstly, I don't like Thom Yorke's voice...it's like a calculated, pseudo-emotive voice with a mild element of pretentiousness.  Secondly, his lyrics aren't much at all; just a couple notches up from Creed or MGMT or whatever.  Don't give me wrong, Yorke seems like a swell person an' all, But he ain't Baudelaire and he ain't Bob Dylan.  Their music has a lot of bright spots, but it's not enough to slab over the bland lyrics, and THAT...voice!  To make a short story, even shorter, Radiohead aren't the Beatles, Thom Yorke isn't Lennon, and OK, COMPUTER is NOT the WHITE ALBUM.  I think what happened with these guys is some music snob magazine critic said they were genuises, and then his critic friends said they were geniuses,an' so on an' so forth. This created an inertia for the band's success, and it sold a hell of a lot of magazines, as well.  The sheep filed ranks and swallowed this helping of cultural propaganda with bells on. Enlightened Self-interest at its finest.  Radiohead try real hard, but they just don't have that real magic.  I think they should break up and start other bands because I think their personal styles are too much in contrast with one another.  I think those other bands could be VERY interesting.  P.S. The guitarist is pretty damn great; the best part of this ensemble that has always left me scratching my head.
1932100660|5.0|This great!! If only people would listen. This is big and could save your life and many others! Thanks Ron
0553386794|5.0|I started reading this after getting half way through the Miniseries and being intrigued about the source material. The book is fantastic and it makes me appreciate what the series producers/writers/art directors, and costumers have done even more. The series (so far) is extremely faithful to the book. If I had read it first I would have doubted it could be done as a series, simply for budgetary reasons. But the book is fantastic and leaves you time to reflect a little more on who's who and what's happening than the series does. I'm not a huge follower of fantasy novels, with Tolkien and The Once and Future King being my only two forays into the genre. But this was a real page turner for me. Highly recommended; I hope the rest of the books are as good.
B00001OH7X|3.0|Brian Eno had just produced Talking Heads, and Bowie the musical magpie heard an opportunity and was looking to the future. Lodger is the result, and is a mixed blessing. Not one of my favorites, and if Eno had been on board for Station to Station and that wonderful album recorded in Berlin, Lodger would be in a category of its own rather than being the last and somewhat anomalous chapter of the so-called Berlin Trilogy. Call it what you may, this is a minor entry in the Bowie catalog. He was back on track with Scary Monsters in 1980.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|I admit that my husband read the directions and set it up for me. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and it works like a dream.  The calls come in very clearly and the caller on the other end can hear me too.  So far, sooooo gooood! Love my \\"Buddy\\" and I think you will too. So what are you waiting for?
B004ZGI1V0|3.0|Have you ever asked yourself, what would you do in a situation where they wake up from a coma (in a foreign country) and someone has stolen all of your identity?  I know, that's something most people do all the time, right?  (*wink*)<br /><br />The movie \\"Unknown\\" is as good as can be expected.  Liam Neesan is a good actor for the role, but not truly believable in his role here.<br /><br />There are missing pieces to this movie, such as emotional outrage that any normal human would feel in a situation where they are backed into a corner scratching at anything to retrieve a thread of their identity.<br /><br />This film could use improvement, but is overall entertaining.
0061974307|3.0|Secret Daughter is a beautiful book that follows the difficult choices that women have to make regarding letting go and sacrifice. The first half of the book follows Kavita Merchant a wife of a poor Indian farmer who gives birth to a daughter she can't keep and Somer is an American doctor who chooses adoption after infertility changes her perspective on how a family is made. The latter part of the book includes the two women but also includes Asha, the biological daughter of Kavita and adoptive daughter of Somer, who as a young adult, returns to India to discover her heritage.    This book is full of so many ideas and themes, including the gender differences in India and emotional expectations regarding fertility, family make-up and motherhood and the author does a wonderful job of giving us a fair and understanding view of each of these issues, with a smattering of comments regarding family that made me put down the book for a second and just think.     As a person who is not a mother, I found myself relating less to Kavita and Somer in the latter part of the book, when they are older women who are reflective on their choices and the role of motherhood in their lives.  An author should make all the major characters of her book relatable even when the character is very different than the reader.     However, my favorite part of this book was when Asha, as an adult, was discovering the beauty, taste and wonder that is India.  There is also a glossary defining common Indian foods and items that make the book easy to follow. This book left me with an appreciation for India and a desire to check out the cost of a flight to Mumbai.
0817439390|5.0|I've been shooting sports photography of my kids and their friends in tournaments and high school for about nine years. In that time I've learned much from books, podcasts, and simply trial and error. However, this book stitches it all together for me. It has explained and verified things I knew or suspected about the interplay of aperture, shutter speed, focal length, and white balance but it does so in an easy to understand way. The directions on what setting to use for a particular look are easy to implement, and it's fun to follow a particular instruction and watch a photo appear that you didn't think you could make. I wish I'd found this book about five years ago but I'll take what I can get now. If you're a pro or a super-serious amateur this book is probably too fundamental for you because you already know these points (or at least you better). But if you're new to photography or just love it as a hobby (and wish you could leave your day job to do what you really like to do) take a look at this book. You'll be glad you did.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Several of the previous reviews said to not buy this movie, as the subtitles were all screwed up.  As of 7/20/11, this, the theatrical version, works just fine. You even have choice of subtitles and/or dubbed English dialog, plus a lot of interesting extras.<br /><br />The film itself is so well-done that I can't imagine that an American version would be worth bothering with. The same holds true for the Swedish Millenium trilogy and the more obscure but remarkable Norwegian film \\"Insomnia\\".<br /><br />And of course, there could not possibly be an American version of the amazing \\"Trollhunter\\"
B001E75QH0|5.0|This item was a good buy for all four movies and in excellent shape.  They came within the predicted time as well.
1582701709|5.0|There are a zillion self help book, but for whatever reason, this one gave me HOPE.  I noticed a difference in almost all aspects of my life when I began to do the things  that are discussed in the book, Sometimes when I started to feel down I would open the book  anywhere and read 1 page and I would feel better right away. It talked about doing things  that were do-able.  And it feels so much better to feel good about life than sad.  I loved  this book so  much I bought 3 used copies, and gave one to each of my sons and a friend.  It helped both my sons and friend, still pending. It's the kind of book to keep at your bedside  and re-read whenever you find yourself needing a lift.  Many situations in mu life have changed  for the better and I believe \\"the secret\\" coming into my life help'd me to make that happen.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I waited a long LONG time for this book to come out. I can say, I am not disappointed. Martin is a brilliant story teller. His descriptions and characters and world creation are amazing. However, after waiting so very long for this book, I was looking forward to, and even requiring, some resolution. There isn't any, and not only is there no resolution, but we are introduced to more characters and more plot lines. The story feels like it is too short.<br /><br />The characters are still the best portrayals of real people I've ever read. There are very few straight up villains (you know the kind - those that are bad just to because they are bad). Each characters has a history, a present and a future, their actions and reactions are utterly believable and in character. They grow and change and sometimes diminish. People who are detestable in one book are sympathetic in the next, and vise verse. But, as in his other books, Martin is not nice to his characters, in that they don't all live, and they certainly don't always get what they want or what they deserve. This book is no exception. My mother started reading the first book, and when one of her favorite characters was killed, flatly refuses to read any more. After many of us have come this far through all the books and all these years, be warned, not everyone lives to see the end.<br /><br />And, as with the previous book, this book does not include all the characters. This book, and the one before, were the same timeline split up amongst the characters. Although, I did not feel that each character gave anything to the story, meaning they did not all further the plot line. I felt like their chapters were just thrown in just because, just because I guess to get all the characters in. Jamie and Brianne get s very small, and virtually meaningless, showing. Cerasi gets some small play. Arya gets a very small part that has one small addition to the furthering of the plot, but added nothing to the greater scheme of things.Minor characters such as Theon, Asha and Stannis get big parts, but essentially go no where and I really couldn't care less about them. Jon and Tyrion and Dany have parts, but they are basically meaningless meanderings without resolution or growth. There are new characters introduced, or at least they seemed new to me but may have been more minor characters given grander roles (at the expense of already developed and loved characters) without delivering anything worthwhile in the end. Old characters seem to be in stasis or in a holding pattern, waiting for the plot to reach a certain point (or not since the plot seems to have frayed). I would have preferred Martin to leave people out if they have no part to play and allow more room to finish some of the more pertinent plot lines - and deal with more interesting, much loved, and existing characters.<br /><br />The plot had a lot of fluff and nonessential (often tedious and boring) added descriptions weather they be about food, history, or myths. I don't recall the others books have whole paragraphs about food or history, kingdom relations or myths. There were some pages I flat out skipped, which I don't ever recall doing in the previous 4 books (even during re-reads). And, as another reviewer pointed out, there is a lot of sailing, these people are sailing, then those people are sailing and then these people are sailing AGAIN!! And, the same goes for marching. And scouting and searching. I really felt like much of this could have been cut and more of the real plot lines put onto the end. There were some sections and some character chapters that left me thinking - well, what was the point of that?? Previous books had forward momentum and development for each character every time. Nothing extraneous was included.  In Dance with Dragons, some characters have one or two chapters that really have nothing to say, or give just a hint of something that never takes shape and then are never seen again. Perhaps in the next book, some of it will have meaning, but why does it need to be included now? To take up space and try to fit into my memory banks, when it could be included later when its necessary to the plot and makes more sense?<br /><br />Overall, it was an okay read though this book seems to suffer from bloat and fluff and meanders lost. The characters and plot weren't horrible. I enjoyed much of it. Though, i kept looking at the completion bar on my Kindle, watching it move up and up, and waiting for something to happen. In the beginning, I kept thinking, I'm only at 15% or 30% or 40%. there's still time for it to get really good! But, it never happened. When I looked down and saw I saw at 85%, my heart literally sank. At that point, I knew there was no saving this book. There was no pulling out of the nose dive.<br /><br />And then, it just ended, without resolution of any kind, without a satisfactory climax, without regard for characters, plot, or us readers. It did not feel like an entire book, but more like a prelude. The other books were all massive as well, and there are plot line that continue on and on and morph and change, but every book just felt like a complete story in itself.  Each ending was a crescendo that left me satisfied and wanting more. This one does not. The ending is a slow decline and a fizzle.  It seems as if the book just got too long, and was just ended with no thought to resolution or timing or plot, or us readers. And the cliffhangers, well, all I have to say is, blah. They aren't cliffhangers so much as chopped off lines left dangling. Honestly dangling, chopped plots, bloated descriptions and fluff filler just seems like lazy writing to me. I felt as if we readers were simply paid lip service. I am not a mindless, escapist reader looking for cheap entertainment. Cheap, light entertainment is what I was reading while I wait for books like the previous installments of Song of Ice and Fire from authors like Martin, and there aren't many like either the series or the author. I was disappointed and a little insulted reading Dance with Dragons.<br /><br />The book was worth reading, well, I could not have passed it by lets say that, and I think there are important happenings to lead into the next book (though very few). I am glad I read it, but wish it would have been worth the $14.99 I paid for the Kindle version, and I wish I could have at least some of my weekend back . . .<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just read a comment made by Martin that Amazon reviews, negative ones, are from sock puppets and trolls. I bought this book and all the previous books, and have read every one, often more than once. This review is from a actual reader and honestly a fan (for the most part).
0525422943|2.0|I'm beginning to think I won't read sequels in the future. I have become less and less thrilled with them in recent years, almost sorry I bothered to read them, especially if i enjoyed the first book. I especially wasn't impressed with Where She Went as the follow up to If I Stay. While the characters seemed real in the first book, in this book it was as if they were made out of cardboard and only being used for the purpose of a sequel.  Really wish I had enjoyed this title since I did enjoy reading If I Stay.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Love love love this season!  John Lithgow was ah-mazing in this season to the very end!  This season has a very shocking end but it was spoiled for me before I even got to see it.  But it was still a very good ending nonetheless.
B000VECAEO|5.0|Seinfeld is my all-time favorite TV comedy series. I have all nine seasons on DVD, so I have been able to watch the show from its meager beginnings to its rise to legend status. My favorite episodes from this season are \\"The Voice\\" (\\"Hellooooooo! La la laaaaa!\\"), \\"The Blood\\" (\\"You got three pints of Kramer in you, buddy!\\"), \\"The Frogger\\" (including a scene reminisent of the classic video game of the same name), and the series finale which brings back past characters including Sidra (from \\"The Implant\\"), Jackie Chiles (\\"The Maestro\\"), and Donald Sanger (\\"The Bubble Boy\\"). The series finale serves as an awesome bookend which actually makes references to the series premiere (\\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\"). Get ready for loads of laughs from Jerry, George, Elaine, Kramer, and even Puddy, Frank, and Estelle.
0439023521|4.0|I sadly Had not heard about this book, as I am typically one to read biography's and cannot remember when I last read a book with a \\"futuristic setting\\"... Luckily I was given a copy from a friend who enjoys many of the same books I do.  Although this book is dark and tells the story in a futuristic setting and involves the lives of young adults in  very  cruel game of instinct/survival, Suzanne Collins grabs the reader from the very beginning and never lets go...I LOVED it and highly recommend it to any one, from 12 years and up.  Please do not risk missing the opportunity to read this book due to the fact it is listed as a young adult/tween book, it should be simply listed as a great read.  I have just begun the second book in this trilogy and have already heard the first was just the beginning it only gets better.

B0055FR5PS|3.0|This movie does remind me a lot of Independence Day with its simple plot and the shallow character development.  The camera work is quite jerky at times to a point of distraction.  I'm glad I rented it during a discount weekend and I probably won't be watching it again anytime soon.

1400095204|5.0|Excellent story line. The author sheds light on an era that was very important in Nigerian history. The best part is that while the book is informative about the Nigerian-Biafra civil war, it is also one of the most entertaining and electrifying stories I've read. This is a powerful story of love and war. As an American, this book reminds me of the strong culture and history of Nigeria and how complex civil wars are and the role that foreigners play in aiding war. This book is easily one of the best books I've ever read!

B0007ZEBI0|5.0|I kept seeing all the reviews saying just how great the DTS version of Deadwing was and after just one listen, I am a believer. It's an awesome mix. The surround doesn't detract from the music at all, rather it highlights things differently than the two channel mix. The added depth that the DTS encode brings is also very welcome. It kind of makes me wonder what Deadwing would sound like as a fully lossless, DTS-MA encode.<br /><br />It's a shame that this is out of print because if you're a Porcupine Tree fan, you owe it to yourself to listen to this at least once.
B001CTUI8M|5.0|Electric, stunning performance that sends shivers along your spine. It's like watching a really good movie, like watching the most intense moment of an intense movie... but for the whole hour.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|The BAD: I was pretty excited when this was the free app of the day but after using it for the past few days, I've decided to uninstall it. I mostly use my hard keyboard and swiftkey is pretty glitchy when it comes to a physical keyboard (yes, even after playing with the settings) and I don't feel like waiting for the update. I'll check back in a month to see if there is a new edition.   The GOOD: If you're using an on-screen keyboard, this app is perfect. It works great. I'm just so much faster on the physical keyboard and I use it more often than the on-screen one.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I thought this was going to be a cool app, but there was one major hitch.  When I ran the app it deleted my calendar data.  All of it.  Gone.      So, now this app is gone and will never be reinstalled.

B0030IIYWA|5.0|The visuals don't look as polished as you may have come to expect, so it's a testament to the quality of writing that this movie is still as good today as it was sixteen years ago. I can't undersell the ingenuity of the filmmaking either, as Pixar does more with limited technology and a thin rule book than most CGI artists can manage today. Careful, artistic shot selection and playful direction really do a lot to compensate for the occasional bad render, and a world-class cast of voice actors takes care of the rest. Tom Hanks and Tim Allen deserve every bit of recognition they get for their roles as Woody and Buzz; they really put the film on their shoulders and carry it right over the top, shifting something that would've probably been pretty good in other hands into a raging success story.

B003ZYU3T6|5.0|Charlie Chaplin's last semi-silent picture, and his final appearance as the little tramp. It's also a not-so-subtle critique of the change in America's popular attitude during his professional heyday, decrying the abundance of automation in local factories while the great depression still raged on city streets. Despite the weighty deeper implications, it remains a genuinely charming set of skits and Chaplin is at his emotive, expressive best from curtain to curtain. The film gets bonus points for throwing its star into so many unique, visually spectacular situations, including what's probably his signature scene inside the belly of a giant, mechanical assembly line.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I have a large list of all time favorite movies, a few are,  the God father, saving private Ryan,casino, scarface, titanic, but the movie limitless is in my top 3 favorite movies of all time!!!

B004L3AQFG|4.0|I read some reviews here on Amazon before actually sitting down to watch the movie. I had already bought it, so it was just a matter of when I was going to watch it. Anyway, I notice that the negative reviews about this movie all seem to mention how boring it was for them. I'm not entirely sure what anyone who thinks it was boring believes could be done to make it more interesting than it already was. I never once felt like checking to see how much time was left in the movie because I was really focused on the events transpiring, however slowly. The flashbacks really were not as confusing as some might have thought. You just have to realize that they're flashbacks. Now, it would have been incredibly boring to me if literally the ONLY thing focused on was his arm being stuck. True, it was the main focus. However, it was still a compelling movie for me. I just found it to be interesting the way Danny Boyle changed angles during some of the shots. James Franco portrayed Ralston quite well during the time in which he was stuck at the bottom of Blue John Canyon. At times, I found myself imagining what I would have done if I had been in his shoes. If you don't mind a little gore and some foul language sprinkled throughout, you probably will be able to like watching this film.
B002DKGWSE|2.0|This is a remake of the classic from 1972 by director Wes Craven. A starring cast that includes Tony Goldwin, Monica Potter, Sarah Paxton, Garret Dillahunt , Spencer Trent Clark and Aaron Paul. This movie has what appears to be, the makings of a good flick. However, let me warn you. I will not say this movie is bad, but I will say that I enjoyed very few parts of the movie. Not enough to call it good! The original storyline is a great concept but somehow this movie fell short for me. I caught myself laughing at the utter absurdity of the characters' reasoning, or lack thereof, and some of the death scenes were over the top! I warn you now, if you watch the unrated version of this movie be prepared for a brutal rape scene! All in all, it wasn't terrible, and somehow Wes Craven did what he does best...make me watch the whole movie. I am torn as to whether I liked this movie better on the shelf or in my DVD player, but I am not torn as to whether or not I will watch another Wes Craven flick. Considering the fact that Mr. Craven is the same man who made us afraid to go to sleep with 'A Nightmare on Elm Street', he will always be one of the great directors. Just my opinion. If there is nothing else available to watch on DVD, give this movie a try, however, don't say I didn't warn you!<br />WebbWeaver Reviews
1932100660|5.0|Wow, what an absolutely amazing book.  I'd give it at least 10 stars if Amazon would let me.  I find that after I've read this book, I tell everyone I know about it - I'm starting to sound like a broken record and am considering asking the authors for referral royalties. LOL!  I tend to be a true skeptic of just about everything, but the scientific data and cold hard facts the author presents in this book are so compelling, they drove me to completely revamp my life.  I come from a very large family where most folks don't come close to beating the average age for life expectancy (I am one of over a 100 great grandchildren - believe it - I counted them all!).  So I've always been told growing up, and had consequently come to expect, that I'll die of some horrific disease such as alzheimers, heart disease, cancer, diabetes (the list goes on) since it seems every one of my great aunts/uncles and their progeny has died of these diseases (or a combination of them).  Until now.  After reading this book, I no longer live with that doomsday perspective.  I now have hope and equally importantly, I feel I'm now in the driver's seat and in-control of my future health and life expectency.  :)
B002PMV9FG|3.0|Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince was directed by David Yates and released in theatres on July 15, 2009. It was released on DVD December 08, 2009. The movie stars Danielle Radcliffe (Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) as the young trio of friends attending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />Since the murder of Sirius Black and the escape of the Death Eaters from Azcaban Prison, no one is safe. Wizards, witches and muggles alike are being terrorized by the Death Eaters and their seemingly misguided dedication to Lord Voldemort. When professor Albus Dumbledore once again asks Harry Potter for his help, the search begins for a missing memory that is key to Voldemort's existence and also to his destruction.<br />While searching for the missing memory, Harry inadvertently comes across a 'potions book' once owned by The Half-Blood Prince, but who is he? A series of vicious attacks aimed at the now aging Dumbledore prompt Harry, Hermione and Ron to search out the Half-Blood Prince and try, yet again to uncover the one thing that will rid the wizardry world of Voldemort forever. But they will suffer great loss along the way and no one will be the same after they find what they seek.<br />Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is, of course, visually stunning and yet I found myself wanting more as the credits rolled. This is not the Harry PotterI have grown to expect and the supporting character's rolls were dull and lackluster. The lead characters did do their very best to save the film and it is for that reason, and that reason alone that I long to see the two final movies.<br />I must say that I was slightly disappointed by this film, however my children enjoyed it immensely. I am quite sure that lovers of the Harry Potter series will want to see The Half Blood Prince, as they should, in order to continue on with the series' storyline. I can only hope that the next Harry Potter movie doesn't leave me asking 'What Happened?' and that the story I have grown to love returns to the big screen. I am sadly giving Harry Potter and the Half -Blood Prince a 3-star rating and am doing so in hopes of better things to come. Please Harry, don't let me down!<br />WebbWeaver Reviewsnd that the story I have grown to love returns to the big screen.

B001C3KCSY|5.0|Only By The Night by Kings Of Leon is the band's fourth CD release and is currently burning up every music chart on the planet. The band from Tennessee, consists of Calab Followill-lead vocals/rhythem guitar, Jared Followill-bass, Matthew Followill-lead guitar, and Nathan Followill-drums. Your eyes do not deceive you! These band members are all related and apparently, we know how to grow them in the south! These guys are not only super-talented musically, but are super-easy on the eyes as well. These guys are HOT, Ladies!<br />From tracks like Closer (my personal favorite) to Use Somebody, Crawl and Manhattan, this CD has something for everyone. Kings Of Leon succeeds in covering all spectrum of emotion on this CD and the diversity of the tracks makes it a great pick for anyone. The guitars are ringing and drive deep, while the strong lead and melodic, harmonious tones from the combined band will entrance you.<br />Kings Of Leon has been touring and performing since April of 2007 with little down-time. They are scheduled to resume their U.S. tour on September 8th and continue touring through October 22nd of this year. If the CD is any indication of how good these guys are in concert...please make my seats 'front row'. Or, better yet, move over down front because I'm pushing my way to the stage! Kings Of Leon has stedily been drawing not only a large, but also diverse and exciting group of fans to their concert venues. I highly recommend you give Kings Of Leon a try. But don't be surprised when they become your favorite band and Only By The Night becomes the next favorite CD that never leaves your player.<br />WebbWeaver Reviews
B000NA1Z1A|4.0|It's devastating that Amy Winehouse died all too prematurely; wow, when she was at the top of her game very few could ever touch her! Back To Black by Amy Winehouse features her talents as a professional singer, songwriter and guitar player. She even provides her own background vocals on some of these tracks! I'm impressed. Amy certainly has her personal demons; but she does an incredible job performing the songs on this CD. The quality of the sound is excellent and the artwork is beautifully done. The liner notes include the song lyrics as well as the credits. In addition, the \\"clean\\" version of this CD may have a few words clumsily omitted; but for those of us who don't want their small children to hear certain words this version of Amy's album is the way to go.<br /><br />The album begins with Amy singing her heart out on \\"Rehab.\\" She sings of a woman, probably based in part on her own experiences, who is not exactly eager to go to a rehabilitation center as a way to get better. The musical arrangement has a strong percussion element that supplies the foundation for the music; the guitar and brass work well for \\"Rehab\\" to create a lush musical arrangement. Nevertheless, this arrangement never steals the spotlight away from Amy's vocals; and \\"Rehab\\" is a powerful, catchy and memorable number. \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" starts off with what sounds like a rap or hip hop musical intro; but when the music goes into the main portion of the song you get that `60s style arrangement Amy does so well. Amy sings this without a superfluous note and she never falters. \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" explores complicated, painful love relationships and Amy delivers this like a champ! In addition, I really like \\"Just Friends;\\" Amy sings this wearing her heart on her sleeve. Her excellent diction enhances her performance even more and again the music fits in perfectly with her singing.<br /><br />\\"Back To Black,\\" the title track for this album, reminds me of a tune The Supremes might have released in their time. Amy delivers this without a hitch. \\"Back To Black\\" deals with the pain that can come with the ending of a love affair; and \\"Back To Black\\" is obviously a major highlight of this album. \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" is another tune that explores the painful end of a love affair. \\"Love Is a Losing Game\\" also has a somewhat mellow, old school vibe arrangement to accompany Amy as she sings this to perfection and beyond! \\"Tears Dry on Their Own\\" is a stunner, too. \\"Wake Up Alone\\" has complex key modulations but Amy handles this like the pro she is and always will be! \\"Wake Up Alone\\" stuns me with its beauty even though it's not the happiest of songs; Amy Winehouse does a great job on \\"Wake Up Alone.\\"<br /><br />\\"Some Unholy War\\" has Amy singing, playing guitar and providing her own backup vocals. \\"Some Unholy War\\" has Amy squarely in the spotlight--right where she belongs! Although the track set appears to end with \\"He Can Only Hold Her,\\" the CD has silence for about 20 seconds before we are treated to a remix of \\"You Know I'm No Good.\\" Excellent!<br /><br />Back To Black still sells well years after its release; this proves just how wonderful the music is on this album. This CD is a \\"must-have\\" for Amy's fans who want the \\"clean\\" version of this album. In addition, people who enjoy songs with a retro soul flavor to them will not be disappointed.r time.

B002CAWNEM|1.0|'Obsessed' was written by David Loughery and directed by Steve Shill. The movie stars Idris Elba, Ali Larter, Beyonce Knowles and Jerry O'Connell. The trailer for 'Obsessed' had me fired up and ready to see a fantastic movie, however, the trailer ended up being the best part. I struggled to sit through this flick and was disturbed over the $3.00 I had spent to rent it! We have all seen this movie before. It was called 'Fatal Attraction'. The difference being that there was none of that pesky sex stuff to make us understand how our villainess became so enthralled with our married, male lead!<br />The acting in 'Obsessed' was much like watching a fourth grade play (No offence forth graders), and very quickly made me come to the conclusion that not all singers can act, regardless of their efforts...sorry Ms. Knowles! Ali Larter, on the other hand, played a fantastic psycho but the movie's dullness and lack of luster threw a dark veil over her performance. If you are looking for a good DVD this weekend, Obsessed IS NOT IT ! Surprisingly, this movie grossed $68 million dollars at the box office. Good thing there is a no-refund policy on box office hits...or in this case, misses!<br />WebbWeaver Reviews
B001GCUO16|3.0|This movie to me seemed kind of forced. They Forced Gambit in there and they forced/raped deadpool's character. All in all, the movie like it most likely was intended seemed to be made for money. special effect wernt even that great. But the blu ray looked clean, helps see all the F ups.
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|X-Men Origins Wolverine was released in theatres on May 1, 2009, available on DVD September 15, 2009, and directed by Gavin Hood. Starring Hugh Jackman, Liev Schreiber, Danny Huston and Dominic Monaghan, X-Men Origins Wolverine is the story before X-Men. It charts the beginnings for Wolverine also known as James Logan.<br />When Logan, played by Jackman, accidentally kills his own father in a fit of rage and is looked upon as a freak by his mother, he leaves home to find his place in the world. With the help of his half-brother, Victor, better known as Sabertooth (Schreiber), Wolverine embarks on a journey through wars and time to fight the forces of evil. Sabertooth soon becomes consumed with bloodlust and in disgust, Wolverine sets out on his own.<br />Years later, a mutant killer is on the loose and the government needs Wolverine's help to stop him. The indestructible Wolverine is then created. Inevitably, Wolverine is betrayed by those closest to him and he is then forced to take revenge & free the other enslaved mutants.<br />I absolutely enjoyed this movie. It was in-your-face exciting and the fight scenes were amazing and well choreographed. Wolverine was action-packed from start to finish and it answered so many questions about where Wolverine came from before joining the X-Men.<br />I would recommend this movie to all ages, young and old. You will be on the edge of your seat and hungry for the next installment of this fantastic series. If the astonishing action scenes don't keep you utterly enthralled then the story line will!<br />WebbWeaver Reviews<br />I had a hard time deciding on the WebbWeaver rating I would give Wolverine...it is that good! Pick up this flick today; you will not be disappointed.

B0011Z1BQK|5.0|There is no such thing as a \\"favorite\\" Led Zeppelin album.  They are each superb in their own way and Presence is no exception.  If you like the hard rockin' heavy side of Led Zeppelin you will love this album. Personal favorite song is \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\".  Followed by Hot's On For Nowhere, Royal Orleans, Candy Store Rock and last but not least Achilles' Last Stand.  Tea for one is also a nice slower blues track.  If you like Led Zeppelin you will love Presence.  It ages like fine wine.
B002VECM72|5.0|Product was delivered early. Price was competitive and Amazon is very good deal.  This is a movie that is a classic. Sandra Bullock deserved her oscar for this picture.

B00006FDCD|2.0|I feel King's success came from the ability to take cliches from the horror genre - be it vampires or mad dogs or just sudden violence - and give you really skillful dread, coupled with fear of loss of the characters you grew to care about. If you want a truly iconic trio of his works to get the full impact of his talent, read The Stand, The Shining and Salem's Lot. Truly brilliant stuff.    When I saw that this monstrosity got four stars, as one of my recommendations, I did a double take. In all honesty, It was the last of his novels that I read. It was bulky - which I always thanked him for, so that the good ones lasted a long time - and yet empty of interest for me. I had been losing faith in his ideas over the course of several short story collections - The Mist and Apt Pupil excepted of course - and some dud novels. This was the proverbial straw that broke the King's back.    I'm giving this two stars because Tim Curry was inspired. He is the penultimate villain. (Put himself and Gary Oldman in a film as competing bad guys, and you'll guarantee five stars from everyone.) I was going to give it three on his account, but dropped one because I remembered the sex magic ending that took lame to an entirely new level. Gag, puke, rowf. This film, like the book, was a non-stop cliche, but one that failed to excel.
0920236251|5.0|Since discovering this book in Canada years ago, I have kept a supply on hand to give to all the little princesses I know and many I don't know personally.  This is such an adorable book about a princess, who saves her prince by outwitting the dragon, only to learn that her prince isn't as wonderful as she thought, but it's okay because she has all the skills she needs to get along fine without him, thank you very much.
0439023521|5.0|I started this book on a sunday sitting out by the pool.  I really didnt feel like spending a lot of time figuring out what to read next, so I read the description and some reviews, and decided, why not?  Hit purchase, 10 seconds later I started reading.  I will say, that first day, I read for maybe an hour - lots of distractions at the pool, so I couldnt get too deep into it.  I thought the story started out a bit slowly, with a LOT of details about every little thing.  I read some more the following week, and got more intrigued.  I was at the point where I wasn't really loving the book, but I had to see what happened next.  I got pretty busy and put it down for a week or so.  Today, I picked it back up out at the pool, and read the final 3/4 of the book in 2 sittings.  I literally couldn't stop.  As I got further and further in, the more I not only needed to know what would happen next, but felt truly in Katniss's mind.  The characters are fantastic, and I felt like I was there in the arena with them.      This is not my typical genre of books, but I truly must thank Amazon, and the other readers, as I bought the book solely on the reviews and high ranking.  I finished the book at 3:15 in the morning, as I couldnt put it down, and purchased the second within minutes.  I can't wait for another pool day to sit and read the second in the series.     I really think this book was just a masterpiece.  As I said, it took me some time to really get into as it is not my typical genre, but all the sudden, I realized just how much I was enjoying it.  I would recommend this to EVERYONE.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|In many ways, this remake of the original Swedish film is almost 80% an exact scene by scene remake.<br />However, unlike many people I found the dark lighting and backgrounds more fitting to the story in this American remake.<br />The Swedish version was very light and cheerfully bright.<br /><br />I also thought the kid actors were more powerful in this remake.<br /><br />It is a very similar remake, but I found the Swedish original a bit too artsy , while this remake used a darker and more somber tone.<br /><br />Both films are a bit on the slow moving side ... but they still hold your interest.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|The songs on this cd really have grown on me since I purchased it about 1 month ago. At first I just listed to the Edge of Glory (fantastic song) over and over. I had heard Born this Way and Judas on the radio and neither of those are my favorites, although they are both good, they just don't stick in my brain like You and I and Bloody Mary do. My other favorites are Bad Kids and Gov't Hooker.  All in all, I like this one just as much as her other CD's. Definitely worth the money.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I couldn't get into this book. Story was slow. The struggles seemed pointless. All the main characters seemed to completely loose it. The first two were intriguing and fun reads. This by comparison was boring. I went from admiring the characters in the first book to being fed up with how unstable everyone was in this story.
0861714911|5.0|A lot of Buddhist works (and most other religious works) can tend to be daunting and unpenetrable. But not this work as it is easily accessible to all and translated into easily understandable English.

Top notch special effects highlight this latest in a long line of superhero films, and it is one of the better ones. He has a love interest that is not only beautiful, but also has a tough side.  Tommy Lee Jones is good as always, as the officer leading the band of soldiers. He brings humor even as his character is playing it straight. Helped by the 3D, this movie is a lot of fun.

Maybe I lost interest over the long years in-between, but I SO looked forward to it based on the previous books, and sad to say this one was returned after trying t slog through just 150 pages! No more fantasy series for me, because this book proved they never know when to end. What a grave disappointment.
B004EPZ0BG|3.0|Two attractive young adults, tired of the dating scene, decide to become friends who also engage in sex. This brings the expected complications, resulting in the predictable \\"will they or won't they\\" ending. This one is a mixed bag. The leads have good chemistry, and the parents of both bring a bit of depth to the story. However, the formula has certainly been done before, and nothing new is added here. Might be a good movie to take your girlfriend out to see, as it has a few laughs, and may lead to some hanky panky. Just make sure you wait until you get home.
0553801473|1.0|Over the course of the last few weeks, I have dragged myself through George R. R. Martin's latest, A Dance with Dragons, the fifth book in his Game of Thrones series.<br /><br />I'm done. No more. I'm not reading any of his books any more.<br /><br />It's terrible. Martin has taken the concept of the pot-boiler to an extreme -- it's a novel where nothing happens other than continual seething, roiling turmoil. He whipsaws the reader through a dozen different, complex story lines where characters struggle to survive in a world wrecked by civil war -- one other problem is that I'd hit a chapter about some minor character from the previous four books, and struggled to remember who the heck this person is, and why I'm supposed to care -- and again, nothing is resolved. Well, not quite: major characters are brutally killed, if they're male, and graphically and degradingly humiliated into irrelevance if they're female. I guess that's a resolution, all right -- perhaps the last book will be a lovingly detailed description of a graveyard, draped with naked women mourning?<br /><br />And all the death and destruction accomplishes nothing. It doesn't further the plot, it doesn't change any situations.<br /><br />There is still a mysterious, supernatural menace lurking beyond the great wall to the North; but don't worry about them, they do absolutely nothing in the entire book. That's the problem with the undead: inertia. They just kind of lie there.<br /><br />The expatriate princess with the dragons was supposed to be a great threat, promising invasion. She decides to hole up in one city and dither with palace intrigues for the whole book, while everything falls apart around her. She takes a lot of baths, though, and I felt like her primary role in Martin's mind is to provide nude scenes for the HBO serialization. The dragons? Pffft. Random SFX carnage.<br /><br />The dwarf ping-pongs about from place to place, commenting cynically. We're supposed to care about what imaginary continent he's on in this chapter, or what city or boat or troop of rapscallions he finds himself in now. I didn't.<br /><br />There's a war going on, you know, and one of the kings in this multi-sided conflict is marching his army off to attack a castle. In a snowstorm. Which leads to the army being mired down and starving. For the entire last half of the book. Those chapters would have benefited greatly if they'd just been left blank and white (blizzard, get it?)<br /><br />In his afterword, Martin complains about how his last book \\"was a bitch. This one was three bitches and a bastard.\\" I can sympathize. Writing over a thousand pages of dull, dragging, incestuously self-referential, soap-opera style narrative in which nothing happens must have been a torment. I understand he's committed to writing at least two more of these overblown pop fantasy novels, but I don't think he's at all committed to bringing anything to a conclusion. George R. R. Martin has successfully penned himself into a lucrative writerly hell of his own creation. I have a recommendation that would spare him some pain: stop now. Roll around happily in your money, and enjoy a prosperous retirement. It's not as if anyone expects anything to ever be resolved in your fantasy world, so just ending it now is the same as ending it at book #7. Or book #1, for that matter. I've reached an end that is as satisfying as anything I expect from this story, which is not satisfying at all.continent he's on in this chapter, or what city or boat or troop of rapscallions he finds himself in now.

0553801473|2.0|GRRM writes so well he almost gets away with not having much plot.  Almost.  I was unable to put down the first four installments in the Game of Thrones series; not so with Dragons, sorry to say.  In fact, it was something of a chore to get through.  I would say I don't want to give anything away, but honestly, there's not much to give away.  I felt a little irritated that after 1000 or so pages very little had really happened.  Big yawn. : 
B0002V7OI8|4.0|Well, this movie is another one in my top ten disaster movies list. The world is going to be destroyed by another meteor, ala Armageddon. This a disaster film \\"the world is comming to an end\\" The special effects are there, we have heroics, and heroism. This movie is about hope, as we get to peer into our players lives, and see how they react, and deal with the information. This movie is a worthwile investment for any collection.
B00006G8G1|5.0|We have this DVD on Blu ray and on regular dvd, the reason why, is, my husband is military and likes to bring his Maiden DVDs with him when he deploys, his laptop does not play blu rays, so we have to have one of each..he loves this DVD and watches it along with many others when he is home, I can ONLY imagine what he is putting his ship through with this DVD.. That be told Great DVD for Maiden Fans...
B000024GHY|5.0|Not a single track here is a throwaway. His compositions are unique and was able to create a trademark sound that only him can create. He may have been influenced by the German school of electronic music but his style is totally independent and distinct. This is the school of electronic music the French or Jarre way and far more superior that any of his releases. This album is a full menu from ambient, new age, instrumental rock, dark, prog and ofcourse   electronic or synthesizer music that is raving in that era. Jarre got them all in this record.

0345528581|2.0|I've been doing weight training for a year now. Since I enjoy more doing bodyweight exercises and I like to workout at home I decided to buy this book.     HIIT vs cardio for efficient weight loss is a continuous debate in the fitness world, and I just doubt very much that this book can serve as a substitute of cardio, as it claims on one of the chapters.    Nutrition only goes through the basics but that is ok with me. The main reason why I don't like this book is because of this:    1) The author explains how this method of training frees you from having to go to the gym and from the need of dumbells etc. However as I started looking at the exercises it requires objects that whilst they are normally quite easy to find in a house, they might not be fully adequate. For instance tables or chairs or doors. It's not easy to do pull ups on a door, and its not easy to find 2 tables of the exact same height that will hold your weight. Also, the exercises that use the door handle were just to painful to execute.     2) The exercises are explained by the authors description and with some pictures. However some several exercises can not be found on the internet, and its very hard to tell the exact movement from those pictures. For instance the military press that is in the intermediate workout... I did not find one single video on youtube of this exercise without weights (maybe its the authors own version?)    Yes, you can choose your own variation of the exercises although I prefer predefined programs from an expert. But I still did not find a substitute to some of the exercises that I could do.     So I'm sure the author went to a lot of trouble to put all this valuable information together, but I'm not satisfied with the result.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|I thought this was the most exciting book I had read in a long time.<br />The people that gave it 1 and 2 stars must not believe that there is<br />a lot that goes on in this world that we aren't supposed to know about.<br />And that this really could have happened the way it seemed.<br />I've given this book to many of my friends and they all loved it.<br />I even had a friend that only reads romance novels read it and she couldn't<br />put it down.  Try it, you can always quit reading if you don't like it, but<br />bet you can't..Carol
B005DD7H50|5.0|I had somewhat mediocre expectations going into the theatre so I was very pleasantly surprised.  This was a good movie.  Probably 4.5 stars.  Fairly intersting story, but I also really enjoyed the camera work.  I guess that is something I seem to notice now, anyway, it is pretty good.  Also, I felt good after the movie, I wanted to go study and learn something :-)
0061726826|3.0|This book left me feeling very sad. I've read The Hunger Games, which sends children off to the slaughter, but somehow this book disturbed me more. All I kept thinking was \\"they turned people into robots\\" - no feeling, no caring - how awful.     I don't read a lot of dystopian but one think I did like about this book was how the \\"world\\" seemed real. It seemed to be almost the same as it is today, just the mindset/thinking has changed. They went to school and college and lived in houses, some rich, some poor. They even \\"took\\" Advil!     I expected the ending and will probably pick up book two to see how it continues.
0439023491|4.0|I first heard about this book series when someone at work was reading it.  She described it to me, but I didn't think I'd be interested.

B001SF8G1Q|5.0|Coming off the mighty heels of Nashville Skyline, and four months previous to this release, Self Portrait, New Morning kind of flew past me. Of course I remember the song, New Morning, as it was played to death on the radio.     After stumbling over the song, The Man in Me, which is central to the The Big Lebowski soundtrack, I had to get that song, and needed to explore what this album was all about. (How did something this cool slip past me?).    Well, when you have folks like Al Kooper on keys and the inimitable Russ Kunkel on drums, as well as George Harrison and Charlie Daniels on bass, you get one interesting mix of music. The sum of the parts is the reason the album stands out. Dylan is able to paint with a broad brush, and what makes it more interesting is that he travels backwards in time a bit to his early years, and gives us folk songs backed up by the finest rock musicians alive.     If you like Dylan, and don't know this album well, just drop the dough and buy it. It's full of treats like a buried treasure, or a lovely message in a bottle. Hidden in plain sight, yet waiting to be plucked and enjoyed, like a ripe orange. It's sweet, indeed. It's got soul, it's got old time country quirkiness, and it leaves you wanting more...so you leave it on re-play and you can listen all day and continue discovering new and interesting nuggets from this all day long. It has a sound unlike any other Dylan album, which provides a platform for Dylan to sing in different ways....I love it.     Then again, I'm just one person talking. Enjoy!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|First Clash album I bought from The Only Band That Matters. A rock album from a former punk band. Forget Greenday and the rest of those phonies, go to the source! Then get their other cds.
B003UESJH4|5.0|It is a pleasure to get a glimpse of what was part of history, as it happened.  I feel this movie is a documentary of sorts, placed in an excellent movie background with outstanding actors.
B0000062FL|5.0|A must buy for classic rock fans. A wonderful followup album that sounds great today. Don't pass this one up.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|A \\"feel good\\" movie!  The various -and eventually connected - stories in the movie are captivating, and the obstacles (sad?) encountered within the stories have surprising resolutions. The \\"porno\\" couple couldn't be more innocent, naive and delightful - incongruent! Known, little known and unknown actors so appropos for their roles, to create a HILARIOUS, upbeat movie with the best MUSIC! I got the cd before ever getting the DVD.  The movie kept playing in my mind as I listened to the background cd music.  Definitely one of my favorite movies! LOVE, ACTUALLY is all around!
B000002J1U|4.0|Some country tunes here along with some great heavy stuff. Shows off how talented LZ was. Immigrant Song and Tangerine? Classic stuff. Forget the new crap put out every week...invest in the best of the best!
B0000045S6|1.0|This version of the audio-book is an abridged version of the book and this fact is not indicated in the listing.  The listing is incomplete and without details therefore implying that it is unabridged - very disappointing.  However, Amazon's Customer Service was excellent in remedying the problem - they gave a full refund even though the cd had been opened and offered to help find the unabridged version that we needed.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|Other reviews dont give this game a chance. Alchemy is a lot of fun, some of the combinations are not very accurate but remember ITS A GAME! Don't be to serious with alchemy,  just have fun with it.
B002M9WW30|1.0|I am very disapointed in this set.  I have dvd set and this blu ray looks just the same.  If I could return it, I would  and wait for the real remasterd blu ray set.  Don't waste your money.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|For those of us with blues/jazz inclinations, this is certainly one to have. Stylings reminiscent of Bonnie Raitt vocals and slide, Duane Allman slide, punctuated with horns, double percussion, B-3 keyboards and on time, in shape backing vocals. Catch them live if you can and pick up this disc. Shows you can combine bands and end up with more than the sum of the parts.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got this app when amamzon had it as the free app of the day. I am so happy with it and would have happily paid for it.<br /><br />I didn't necessarily like my built in android keyboard. Being new to the android phone scene, I figured I'd eventually get used to it, if not eventually like it. After a month and half...I was still not liking it. So when I saw this app that would give me an alternative to what I had, I figured it was worth a chance. Especially with all the good reviews. I love this keyboard! So much easier and the auto correct feature doesn't change my words to completely different words. I also like the fact that it \\"learns\\" they way I type. So after a while, it predicts what words your are going to use as you type. With me, personally, more often than not, it suggests the words I want. I also want to reiterate: It shows you a word you might want or mean, allowing you to select it or ignore it....it doesn't change it automatically. I literally text and type half the amount now because of the accurate predicting. I highly recommend this app. HTC Inspire 4G.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I got this app for free thanks to Amazon's free app of the day and I got to say its great.  I like so so much for my Inspire cell phone that I'm looking into getting it for my Motorola Xoom.
B002BU0DPE|2.0|I got this and a few months in, I could only hear out of the left one. For a while i could fix it by wiggling the cord but now I cant even hear out of my right at all. I sound whore in Call of Duty and now i always think they are coming from the left... If I were you, I would buy something better quality like the new Earforce Z6A.
B004LWZW24|3.0|This film starts off being great, creepy, atmospheric, scary and then falls completely flat in the last act. It isn't that the story loses its' appeal. If it had been just as well-written and filmed as the earlier scenes, I could have lived with the predictable ending. It's as if it's a completely different movie, the style, tone, cheap look of the final sets, the overall look seems different, like they had a new cinematographer and director -it just doesn't flow well. And late in the film, Patrick Wilson's character all but uses a bullhorn to announce his presence when being quiet is of the utmost importance. Rose Bryne is the one that needed to shout in this scene, not Wilson. I did really like Lin Shaye in this. It's nice to see her in something other than a Farrelly Bros. movie. Not that she isn't great in those. There are obvious bits of other movies here, Poltergeist, 1408 but this film could have stood on its' own had it not lost it all in the climatic scenes at the end. Bummer.
B003INBNXO|4.0|Based strictly on the acting, action and quality of the movie, Ip Man deserves a 5. Donnie Yen does a phenomenal job portraying the use of Wing Chun as a useable fighting style. His technique sticks to the fundamentals of the style with only a few dramatic embellishments for cinematic effect. Also, no weird flying stuff, thank goodness.  The fights in the movie are intense and powerful, with enough of them to keep the action junkie happy, while still giving room for the plot. This is really one of the better \\"Kung Fu\\" movies I've seen in a while.  So why only 4 stars? Well I have a real problem with the Communist Chinese government trying to make some kind of folk hero out of the Grandmaster of a Martial Arts style I trained in for 5 years. Ip Man was known as a very good fighter, and was known to take on challengers, but wasn't some lordly gentleman. At the time of when the movie was supposed to take place he was a policeman, and after the war he had to flee to Hong Kong, without his family, because he supported an opposition party. This is a little nit-picky I know, but the point of the production company is clear as day. 1.) Pick one of the classic \\"bad guys\\", which will be a.) the Japanese, b.) the Ching Dynasty or c.) Westerners attempting to import drugs or export valuable artifacts. 2.) Make the hero a simple, down to earth common man who is always pleasant and respective of \\"proper\\" authority. 3.) Have a lot of heavy handed moments involving Chinese culture, strength, underestimated superiority and of course the need for unity. Over the years the Communists have found a way to make money off of their culture and to subtly push their message into all forms of media. Ip Man was a kick ass street brawler, not an iconic poster boy for the Revolution, and that just bothers me a little.    Pros:  AWESOME fights  Great Wing Chun action  Actual acting and plot. Donnie Yen may be a better actor/action star than Jet Li, Jackie Chan or Chow Yun Fat combined.    Cons:Stinks of commie. Unless you are a history buff you probably won't notice it; which is probably the point.

0553801473|1.0|I went to Amazon.com to order the book, but after reading the reviews, I decided not to bother. I have read all 4 books hoping for some closure.

B003Q6D25K|4.0|Thanks to \\"Scream 2,\\" everybody knows the rules for horror sequels - more gore, more exotic death scenes, more T&A, and a nasty tendency to explain more about the villain, thereby making the villain less scary.  Based on these rules, virtually no horror sequel holds a candle to the original that sparked the franchise.    Fortunately, the team behind \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" knows these rules well enough to avoid them.  \\"Paranormal Activity 2\\" does not truly dive deeper into the story of Micah and Katie, the doomed couple from \\"Paranormal Activity.\\"  Instead, this sequel expands upon their story by telling a parallel tale about Katie's sister Kristi (Sprague Grayden), her husband Dan (Brian Boland), Dan's teenage daughter Ali (Molly Iphraim) and their baby son Hunter.  Kristi and Katie have remained close, and this sequel takes place largely in the weeks leading up to Katie's and Micah's tale of terror.    Kristi and Dan are delighted to bring Hunter home to their SoCal not-quite-McMansion.  They barbeque with Katie and Micah and shoot loving home movies in their bucolic backyard swimming pool.  But soon their house is broken into, and strangely, nothing is taken.  This little development is nothing more than a cute contrivance to get the same security-cam video structure that made the first movie so spooky.    [Mild Spoiler Alert]  The installation of the security cams gets things rolling, as we now get to see the creepily low-budget yet realistic security footage of spectral beasties doing that voodoo that they do so well.  Certain film critics may sneer at this movie as a collection of \\"gotcha\\" moments, but the movie skilfully builds tension from small moments of fright to genuine terror.  We learn a bit more about Katie's history with the demon from the first movie, but not so much as to rip all the fun out of this story.      If you liked the first movie, you will definitely appreciate that this movie goes to great lengths to add to the first movie rather than merely ride its coattails.
B004WJREMW|5.0|Well.. what can I say about Paul Mccartney? Always releasing good material.  This new collection has a perfect sound. I already have Band on The Run and waiting for the next week to purchase the Mccartney 1.    You can buy this with your eyes closed.
B0058RCVYS|3.0|Screen shots were a bit repetitive (close-ups of blinking eyes) -- one too many times that didn't evoke any feeling.    The plot, up until the halfway mark was very good, interesting and moving - we finally understand Jorgen's weird behavior.    However, the plot and the story line could have been improved once we get to the end in terms of the relationship between Jacob and Jorgen - something was a bit left out (but I can't put my finger on it.)    The plot was interesting, although a bit melodramatic and not totally believeable, but thought-provoking nonetheless. The end was perfect in a way, \\"from the mouths of babes.\\"

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|After the phenomenal and intimist Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan's follow-up is an epic, spectacular, well acted, action packed film that not only stands head and shoulders above any other superhero film but also is one of the best films ever made.<br /><br />The Dark Knight picks off right after BB left and introduces us to Batman's nemesis: The Joker. I think we all remember Jack Nicholson as The Joker in Burton's Batman and while he is a terrific actor and did a great job with the character, Heath Ledger took the character and turned him into a force of nature that has to be reckoned with. Ledger's Joker is one of the many highlights of the film and he does a terrific job with the character. He is a smart psychothic killer who only wants to see the world burn. Is too bad that this was Ledger's final role becuase he was a fantastic actor and it clearly shows here. As terrific as Bale is in the role of Batman, ha can't help but get overshadowed by Ledger. In fact, everything and everyone in the film are overshadowed by him. He created a fantastic, timeless character.<br /><br />Still, every other single aspect of the film deserves praise, the cast, the imax sequences, the action, the plot, etc., TDK is a fantastic film that will keep you at the edge of your seat every time you see it. It's bigger than BB but also darker and one of the best sequels ever made. An excellent film through and through.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />TDK boasts a terrific video presentation in HD. First the aspect ratio will switch in the Imax scenes to make you relive the experience. It's not the same but it's a fantastic alternative. The presentation is strong, with a high resolution, excellent contrast and with no compression artifacts whatsoever. A fantastic transfer.<br /><br />Likewise, the 5.1 Dolby TrueHD is dynamic, clear and potent.<br /><br />Bonus material:<br />This is a 2-disc BD set that has a lot of insightful materia. You have a documentary about the Imax proces and the production of the film in general and a PIP presentation on key scenes. On disc two you have hours of material that delves with the technology, the psychology of Batman, trailers and galleries.<br />Everything is interesting and should not be missed.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />TDK is Nolan's finest film to date. With an amazing plot, a spectacular cast, great action sequences and awesome special effects, this movie is a must-own for everyone. Warner's BD has a terrific P/A presentation and great and insightful bonus material. Highly Recommended!!!esentation on key scenes.

0634049011|4.0|I've been playing guitar for over forty years, and I have a pretty sound knowledge of the fretboard and music/chord theory. This book is useful in that it condenses a lot of what it took me years to figure out in a few pages, and I've learned a couple new tricks. It wasn't quite what I expected (although I can't fault the book for that), but I'd recommend it to mid-level players wanting to raise their chops a notch or two.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|I like Tim Burton's Batman and Batman Returns. They are dark, funny, sexy, and work great as comic book adaptations. Then of course Schumacher's Batman Forever and Batman & Robin derailed completely the franchise. A new reboot was necessary but I don't think anyone was prepared to see how Batman's return to the big screen was going to be that spellbinding in the hands of the gifted director Christopher Nolan.<br /><br />Batman Begins takes the hero to its origins in a most realistic, dark way. Bruce Wayne is not a perfect hero, he is driven by sorrow, anger, fear and desire of revenge and we see his struggle to overcome this in order to become Batman. Christian Bale is perfect as the tortured Wayne and also as the no-nosense Batman. What I like most about this film is how Nolan and Goyer were able to give Bruce Wayne the same weight as Batman and give him enough room to develop the character. Also, Bale is surrounded by an extraordinary supporting cast composed by Michael Caine, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy and Katie Holmes.<br /><br />This film is not full of big action sequences or special effects. This is a much human and realistic portrait of an amazing character that slowly builds the foundation of future Batman films. A spectacular reboot.<br /><br />Video & Audio:<br />BB has a solid but flawed video presentation. It's not bad and is superior to the SD DVD but it's not demo quality as The Dark Knight. Some night scenes look crushed and there is softness in some scenes. Still it offers balanced colors and there are not compression artifacts to see.<br /><br />The 5.1 Dolby TrueHD is also great but it's not spectacular.<br /><br />Bonus Features:<br />BB comes with some special features that include a PIP commentary, many featurettes which delves with the creation of Gotham, the cast, the action sequences, the special effects and more and the Imax Prologue of TDK. There is a great assortment of bonus material that will keep you engaged and entertained.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts:<br />Batman Begins is the best origin movie for a superhero and the second best Batman movie (behind its sequel), its has a great story, a compelling hero and amazing supporting characters that make this film to stand above the usual hero films. Warner's BD is not perfect but its not awful and it has many insightful featurettes to keep you interested Recommended!!!he best origin movie for a superhero and the second best Batman movie (behind its sequel), its has a great story, a compelling hero and amazing supporting characters that make this film to stand above the usual hero films.

0553801473|2.0|Despite my low rating of this book I would hate to ruin any part of it for anybody.  So I humbly present my spoiler-FREE review.<br /><br />For many years I applauded George R.R. Martin for avoiding what has become the bane of many modern fantasy writers: books so long that their reader feels like he gets a lower arm workout when reading, and so slowly progressing that they're more sleep-inducing than counting sheep.<br /><br />No Longer is this true.  And I can't tell you how much it hurts my heart to tell you this, but A Dance With Dragons just isn't that good.<br /><br />Yes GRRM does finally reunite you with many of your favorite characters after their long absence in A Feast For Crows, but their stories just don't seem progress much.  There was so much anticipation and buildup at the end of the last two books that most of us staunch GRRM fans were expecting great things from this book...but great things simply don't happen.<br /><br />Instead, armies march, lords and ladies plot and scheme, Tyrion jokes a bit and philosophizes some, and men of the Night's Watch shiver in the snow and wind.<br />Sure there are a few \\"major\\" developments, but most of them don't concern the characters you've come to know and love over the last decade (i.e. The Starks, the Lannisters, the Tullys, the Arryns, etc.)<br /><br />All in all, this book is neither captivating nor rewarding.  And for those of us who have been eagerly awaiting it for 5+ years, this is a huge, huge disappointment.
B004UXUSPA|5.0|Saw the movie twice at the theater. I wondered why Owen Wilson was cast in a Woody Allen movie. He was perfect for the role of Gil. I don't usually recommend any movie to friends and family, but I have recommended Midnight in Paris to anyone who would listen to me. ;-)<br /><br />Len

B000XR4OC0|1.0|I bought a pair of these shoes (grey) for my daughter's birthday earlier this month.  She's worn them some of each day since then, and they are very nearly too worn out for her to wear to school starting next week!<br /><br />By too worn out, I mean that there is NO tread left and the canvas is worn through on the heel area, and there is a significant wear spot on the toe.<br /><br />Never again will I pay $40+ for Tom's ANYTHING.  I don't care how many shoes he sends to needy kids, I'll buy a pair of a different brand of shoe for my daughter and a pair for an indigent soul and upgrade in quality and save money all at the same time.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|Except for a few lapses in logic and character motivation and action, I thought Limitless was a fascinating and suspenseful psycho-thriller. I very much liked the visual canvas, that is the cinematic use of color and movement the film employs. Good acting throughout in this speculative look at a drug that enables full brain function and the superman that it would create.
B000002J1S|5.0|Thanksgiving Eve 2006, as an 18 year old \\"kid\\" I discovered this masterwork. Beforehand I hadn't heard much from Genesis except the obvious radio hits, so I wrote them off as a pop group that happened to have Phil Collins in it. I was becoming a HUGE Yes fan at the time and was beginning to hear about the grandiosity and majesty of Genesis' earlier works. I decided to take them for a spin. Lamb would be my starting point.    Looking back, I don't think I was prepared at the time for what this long-winded, epic album is. I mean, I heard Tales From Topographic Oceans and did just fine. Tarkus, by ELP, was straightforward enough and grand in its own right. However, nothing could prepare me for what this album is.    The first song, the title track, was pretty accessible on first listen, but that was about it. As I listened to the rest of the album I was intrigued. I didn't know what I loved about it at first, but I couldn't put it away.    The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is quite a journey. For the last five years since discovering it, I have listened to it and studied it. There are various guides on the Internet interpreting the impenetrable storyline. As the last album with Peter Gabriel before climbing up on Solsbury Hill, he is the standout here lyrically and vocally. He provides emotion as if he is Rael himself. He became Rael while recording this.    Musically, they are geniuses. Phil, Mike, Tony, and Steve. They \\"became one\\" when recording this. After dozens of full listens, I still cannot comprehend how they became so cohesive on this.     The first disc (talking about the CD version here), is flawless and complex. One is likely to hear it and only after a few listens full appreciate most of its beauty. I think of this section of songs as an emotional roller coaster. There is so much to experience here emotionally. You will feel it in your bones.    The second disc is all dark. While listening to this disc alone, with headphones, after listening to the first disc, you are in for quite a buildup of tension and drama. Listening to this I find to be actually emotionally taxing until the exciting end, which I won't ruin for anyone. If you can learn to appreciate this disc, you may get some out of body experience while listening to it. That's how deep it is.    While the first disc is definitely a brilliant masterpiece that explores different modes and emotions of the inner psyche, the second disc is the grower over time. Even Incantations or Olias of Sunhillow can't come close to the pure subtlety of the second disc, and those are lovely albums.    As I am writing this, it feels like trying to describe the indescribable. It cannot be compared to any other artists, and I can't really call this progressive rock at all. Lamb is a thing to experience. That's all I can say.    While their many albums before and after are A+ like By The Pound, and Foxtrot, they would never again attempt something of this magnitude.    Life-changing.
0553801473|4.0|I liked A Dance with Dragons, and had no problem with its pace.  It couldn't move too much faster than A Feast for Crows, which happens concurrently.  So no, there were no climactic battles or massive slaughters that turned the whole story in a different direction.  But there were plenty of surprises, and lots of build up to what should be a terrific volume six.  We caught up on favorite characters missing from A Feast for Crows, and got to know some terrific new characters, if only briefly in some cases.  The plot did move forward, and some key characters died or met with setbacks, while others arose to new prominence.  The whole thing held my interest just fine, perhaps because I didn't expect anything overly dramatic.<br /><br />I think the other reason this book has experienced a backlash is that fans are now worried the next volume will take another seven years.  I'm not sure that's true, first of all, since the story is now caught up and the stage is set for widely dispersed story lines to cross again.  Martin seems to have worked out the problems with his overall plot, and I'm hoping that means the next volume will flow more smoothly.<br /><br />And secondly, well, I'm not sure it's fair to criticize an author for taking so long to perfect his work.  The good thing about taking so much time to finish the next volume is that I could revisit all the previous volumes like old friends before reading the new one.<br /><br />Martin pulls off a neat trick by creating a world full of greys, supposedly blurring the distinctions between Good and Evil, and yet it is fairly easy to point to the characters for whom we root.  Three of those characters seem to be the subject of a prophecy, but it wouldn't surprise me if Martin figures out a way to make that prophecy bittersweet even for the characters who seem destined to survive in some form.  Despite all the contrasts between Song of Ice and Fire and Lord of the Rings, I think Martin is quite concerned about morality, andabout just how far characters will go when morals pose a barrier, and what it does to them to violate their own codes.<br /><br />Anyway, I'm willing to bet that Volume Six will bring the strands back together and will be published in less than three years.  If nothing else, Martin needs to keep ahead of the TV show!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|I bought this app from the Android market about a year ago. This is a great way to transfer files back and forth between devices and computers. I&apos;ve been using it for a while and it was worth every penny that I paid for it. For free it is definitely worth it. If you don&apos;t like it, a simple uninstall will fix that.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|Some people haven't liked this cast of Les Mis, but I think it is fantastic.  After seeing it first on PBS, I wanted to order the DVD to share it with friends and family.  I find myself watching all the time!  It isn't the full musical, but a concert with the songs...regardless, it keeps my attention the same way.  If you love Les Mis, this is a great way to keep you occupied until you see it in the theater again or the movie comes out!
0553801473|5.0|Hi all,<br /><br />honestly i dont understand the criticism some people are giving this book.<br />It is miles better than AFFC and in my opinion the BEST of the series so far.<br />I could not stop reading it - even so i know how long i will have to wait till the next one might come out....<br />There is not a single weak chapter in it and all the characters covered are entertaining and lifelike.<br />The coverage of plot is the broadest so far with plenty of satisfying character developements and intersections.<br />The deceivingly random and unpredictible twists and plot developements are one of the greatest strenght of the series, giving the characters a strong sense of realism while showing the writers skill to stay well away from clichee and predicability.<br />This book is a masterpiece in his series and i'd be extremly happy to see him repeat this quality level in the next books.<br /><br />A satisfied reader always pays his dept.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|Fun app for when you're bored in social settings.You don't need to really concentrate to play this one.Keeps promoting me to update' which runs but doesn't install. Please fix for five stats.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I've not read this book in YEARS... but every time I see the title, I cannot help but giggle.  It is such a great book.  A perfect book to read when the weather is awful, you're feeling blue, or you are just in the mood for a good laugh.  It makes everything a bit brighter.  So, pick this book up, and give yourself a smile.
B004EPZ07K|1.0|\\"Green Lantern\\" is one of the worst superhero movies I've ever seen. There are almost no redeeming qualities, and it is a painful, if sometimes unintentionally comical viewing experience. The dialogue is abysmal, the visual effects subpar, the performances weak, and the story limp.    Green Lantern is a superhero I didn't know too much about going in. The opening of the film tries to compact an entire series' worth of comic book lore into a three-minute jumble of exposition. Basically, it's explained that there are a a couple thousand protectors of the universe called the Green Lantern Corps. They wear green rings that are powered by green lanterns, which give the wearer the power to create anything that they can imagine (sword, machine gun, giant fist, etc.). The Lanterns are kind of like Jedi, using the Force (green energy) as a weapon against the Dark Side (the yellow lanterns of fear). The Lanterns are ruled by a council of elder aliens who sit atop large pillars. Whether they sit there constantly or just during meetings is unclear.    Ryan Reynolds plays Hal Jordan, the cocky pilot who has been \\"chosen\\" by the ring to be the next Green Lantern. The whole story operates under an inherently silly premise, and one which clearly is more easily visualized in comic book form, so I can sympathize to an extent with the hurdle the filmmakers had to cross to try and make it seem legitimate. However, they approached it the wrong way, relying too heavily on Ryan Reynolds' jokey persona to poke fun at how asinine everything around him is. \\"I pledge allegiance to a lantern, that was given to me by a dying purple alien\\", he stutters. And later, \\"I always knew I'd be a green supercop, defending the universe\\".     Ryan Reynolds may have the body type for the Green Lantern, but he was probably not the perfect casting choice for this movie, or even a decent casting choice. Reynolds is one of those guys you tend to like in spit of yourself; yes, he seems like an egotistical douche, but in the right set of circumstances, he can be charming. Needless to say, this movie does not have the right set of circumstances. He's even more of an ass than usual in this film, awkwardly infusing humor at every possible moment, and cheesing up the melodrama in the more dramatic scenes.    The main villain of \\"Green Lantern\\" is a giant space blob that feeds on fear, called Parallax. It's a shapeless blob that has a disembodied head floating amongst the goop. I would talk about what a lame, uninteresting villian it is, but I'm too distracted by the fact that it's a direct rip-off of Hexxus, the villain from FernGully: The Last Rainforest. Martin Campbell, you've come a long way from \\"Casino Royale\\".
B000AYELVA|5.0|My best friend and I recently went to see X Men: First Class, after which she expressed an interest in seeing the others. I bought this edition to replace my VHS copy because it was inexpensive and looked reliable. The movie has some basic special features and plays well.     As for the film itself: if you're a purist regarding the comics, you might not like it, but I have always found the earlier X Men films to be well acted and well written. Sirs Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart do quite well as Magneto and Charles Xavier, and Hugh Jackman makes a solid and admittedly attractive Wolverine. So, as before, there are deviations from the comics, but the film in itself is entertaining and intelligent. The X-Men is one of my favorite superhero films.
B001S86J0I|5.0|Galaxy Quest successfully takes a SyFi movie and adds a homorous cast. A lighthearted view of the love people share for the space traveling cult.
0553801473|1.0|Are you kidding me? This book was such a disappointment and if I could ask for a refund I would.  The material seemed like it was written to meet a deadline.  It was rushed and repetetive.  It seemed as if though all of the main characters are being killed off while new ones take their place.  The story line is so combobulated that it is hard to keep up.  What a let down to read after having read A Game of Thrones.  To add insult to injury, there are still 2 more books to read in the series and who knows when they will be released.  I am not holding my breath on the quality of the next two.  Sorry George, this one bit the dust!
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I gave this app a try without knowing Mich about it. I was pleasantly surprised at how much it did and how well it was organized. there is a bit of a learning curve, but once you get it all set the way you like then its very simple to maintain. I highly recommend this app.
1591844096|5.0|I've never heard of Seth Godin before reading this book. I actually stumbled upon this book because I wanted free Amazon shipping so I thought I would add it to the cart since there are many good reviews. I'm actually glad I read the book. I agree with the author on many points, and one of them that sticks is that human beings are not cogs in a system. Even though \\"things are the way things are\\", this does not mean it is the right way. This got me to think about my own job and life. Good work Seth.
B004Y1USV2|4.0|I wanted to dislike this or should I say...  I fully expected to dislike this.  In light of recent events with bands seeking to find young replicas of lead singers who were discovered on Utube during a Karaoke contest, I had a taste of dirt in my mouth from the get go.  Though Jon is about 89 at this point and probably in a state of perpetual weakness, it was hard to conceive of a Yes release without him.  I know Drama went this route and put out a very good album but that was Jon's decision.  This was Yes not asking him.  So I went into it with a bad state of mind.    I gotta say, I think I love most of this.  It sounds to me anyway like Drama and the Ladder, with better lyrics.  I must admit, Anderson's lyrical subject matter became annoying with the \\"children of light and love and celestial harmony in the starry ass crack of mother nature earth vagina.\\"  The lyrics here are good!  Well thought out and interesting.  The song writing is haunting at times, downright proggy (for men in the twilight of their twilight) and the flow is very smooth.  I don't dislike a single track on this CD.  Even those tunes that don't sound like they will go anywhere always seem to go somewhere, that I enjoy being in!  I would go see this band to hear the new material performed.  I couldn't bring myself to go see them over the past couple of years and they played right in my backyard and I could have had a backstage pass.  I've met them during the Masterwork and Magnification Tours and they looked rather old back then but it seems as if David has refreshed the lads.  I just couldn't see myself going to watch them play all the old standards without Jon.  I felt I owed him that.  Well, if they come back around, my narrow ass will be there.  Pick up this CD, it will surprise you.
B000O599ZS|4.0|I'd just like to say that the actor portraying the Indian chief Scar doesn't look at all like the rest of the Indians in the film, or any Indian whatsoever.  It turns out he was played by Henry Brandon, born in Germany, who had previously played the deliciously villainous Barnaby opposite Laurel and Hardy in March of the Wooden Soldiers.    It's ridiculous.  There must have been a hundred fine Indian actors who could have played the part, and looked the part too.    But they picked Barnaby!  I can't help but create my own little scene in which Scar glares at Ethan and snarls, \\"Big bait catches big rats!\\"
B002ZG997C|4.0|The beginning was a little long, but I guess I needed that to really \\"get\\" what had happened prior - and what was continuing to happen with the characters and their lives.  The acting by Washington was, as usual, believable and intense. The plot, theme and photography all worked together. An absorbing film with a timely message.
0062060554|5.0|I bought this book because I was intrigued by the subject matter.  Once I started reading, I just couldn't put it down!  The author does an amazing job of revealing Christine's memories while maintaining the integrity of Christine's symptoms.  Yet the story continues to build and mover forward.  Wonderful novel.  I can not wait to see what SJ Watson creates next!
B0054JZC6E|1.0|having played this exact game on the ds 1st, I was a little excited to see it for android. my son loved it, so I thought it was a great idea...  that being said it's actually the exact opposite. the controls are very difficult and the game lags quite a bit. and the ads are very annoying. nice start I suppose, but no comparison to the ds version, sorry...
B0057L03EK|5.0|great album. from start to finish a must hear. wes brings them back to their roots. fred's lyrics are still stupid but works for the album feel. rap metal may not be trending here in the u.s. but they are loved world wide. you might want give it a listen. it is definitely worth the money. if you were a fan before you'll love it.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|I absolutely loved this movie.  Right after it finished I ran into my basement and started working on my own songs with my guitar.  I just wish I could write songs like this guy and girl!  I checked out the credits because i didnt even know that the movie's stars are the actual songwriters and obviously performers.  I also noticed acting credits said \\"the guy\\" and \\"the girl\\"- I didn't even realize that they had no names until the end credits.    The existing reviews give good movie summaries, so i'll just point out a few of my favorite scenes.  Well, to start with I'm obsessive about watching the beginning of a movie- if I miss the beginning I don't want to see it.  Because the beginning is usually the best part- well I loved how art and commerce collide at the beginning when the street singer is robbed of his few dollars while he's singing, by another street person and then chases the robber through the streets- funny stuff.  Then I loved how after the \\"girl and guy\\" meet, she brings her vacuum cleaner so he can fix it and she rolls it down the street like she's was walking a dog!  Hilarious.  Then the couple visit a music store and she gets on the piano and he teaches her a new song of his and I was just overcome by this scene.  I think that girls cry when they're young and that guys start crying when they get older- because I just started tearing up!  I don't even know these people but I was overwhelmed by the beauty of the music.  I thought at that moment-- that is what music is- its love, its sex, its beautiful.  Music is magic and this scene was magic.      I also liked how she lived with her mother and they didn't have a phone and their neighbors came by to watch tv because they were the only tenants in the building with a television.  Well i tell you, there isn't one phony moment in this whole film.  And you keep waiting for the big kiss or the sex scene like most Hollywood movies, but it never happens.  The girl and guy share a love or friendship through music that didn't need to consummate into romance.  Although you keep hoping it does!  Amazing movie!
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I love Martin's style and this is very Martin!  The biggest issue I had with the story is that I couldn't help but think of Monty Python's Holy Grail line \\"Get on with IT!\\"  By the end I didn't really feel as if the story had advanced much.  Now of course some of the problems are perceptional since as fans we've been waiting 6 years for this book and it sort of feels like that wait was for nothing.  I plan on re-reading it after a break, but the fact remains is that as of right now I feel very disappointed in it.  If you are reading the entire A Song of Ice and Fire then obviously you will read this at some point; and if like me you've been waiting 6 years for this book then you've probably have already read it, but in the long run it doesn't feel as tight and streamlined as the first 3 books.
0062060554|1.0|So I was really excited to read this book after reading the reviews, but I am sadly disappointed. The book could have been told in a short story about 10 pages long. Most of it is just minute details about what she is doing, how's she's preparing for something that has nothing to do with the plot etc, etc. I took to clicking through pages after just skimming because nothing whatsoever interesting happened in them. There are a few \\"twists\\" that didn't impress me either, there was so much build up and then it just turns flat. The main twist I figured out well before it was revealed. Overall this book is well overhyped and I waisted a few days of my life trying to read it.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|I've been using swiftkey since it first came out, and I've always loved it. Unfortunately when I had to reset my phone a little over a month ago, the new install from amazon was broken and would crash on startup. It was been well over a month since that happened, SwiftKey designers have acknowledged that amazon's version is glitched, yet they still have done nothing about it. So after waiting this long I decided that I'd rather buy the app from the regular marketplace while it's on sale rather than keep hoping for amazon's version to get fixed. I guess this should be taken as a lesson to avoid buying apps from 3rd party marketplaces.

B0002EXH4A|5.0|When most people argue what the quintessential Megadeth album is, most people will tell you \\"Countdown to Extinction\\", \\"Rust in Peace\\", or \\"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying\\".  While I agree that \\"Peace Sells\\" is Dave Mustaine's masterpiece, this album, in my opinion falls as there second best album, as a whole.  The guitar work on this album by both Dave and Jeff Young are so incredible, every time I listen to the album it makes the hairs on my neck stand up.  Dave Ell's bass is not to be forgotten.  Amazing rhythm from both him and newcomer, Jeff Behler, bring these songs to life.  This album has, in my opinion, the best Megadeth song in their discography:  In My Darkest Hour.  It is the most amazing song.  It is truly six minutes and twenty five seconds of absolute bliss.  Not just because it was inspired by the death of the great Cliff Burton, but because it is one of the most honest songs ever written.  Dave poured his heart into the song.<br /><br />The album also shows Dave's heart of music writing.  It is a true testament of his abilities as a musician and a song writer.  The album came out the same time that Metallica's \\"and Justice for All...\\"  It would be interesting to see where Metallica would have ended up if they had stuck with Dave and left Kirk Hammett with Exodus.  I truly believe that 1988 would have been the year that they would have really shown their colors with Dave.<br /><br />I could rant all day about Megadeth.  I'm a huge fan and thus is why I love this album, but I really think most Thrash Metal fans will agree that this album is an underrated gem of an album.  I was 12 when it came out, and it was one of my first buys.  This album introduced me to Thrash Metal and I have been a fan ever since.  If you are wanting an introduction to the 1980s Thrash Metal scene, this is a good place to start.

B0012QE4Q2|3.0|This movie looks great.  The amount put into the production certainly shows.  Too bad more money wasn't put into getting the history correct.  The problem with movies like this is that people see them and think they're the truth.  The real story is interesting enough.  They should have stuck to that.  It has some real talent in it, but they were wasted on this plot.
B001JNNDE2|3.0|There are extras not in the DVD version, but the studio's Blu Ray quality as far as picture goes is poor.
1599219751|5.0|The BBC. Walking the talk? An epic story of human endurance is being challenged. Did wartime prisoners really walk from Siberia to India?<br /><br />In some of the negative reviews you will learn of the above BBC program containing evidence found by investigators including Linda Willis which cause doubt of the validity of this book. You can read the BBC report by googling the first paragraph above.<br /><br />What I found most interesting of the BBC investigation was several online comments to the article from individuals around Europe who personally know of Polish prisoners who made treks of 1000 miles or so out of Russia's gulag to Persia, the middle East, and the far orient. The truth is that stories somewhat like Rawicz's actually happened many times; maybe hundreds at least it would seem to me. And there remains many other Polish descendants in Siberia's rural areas of those who got out from the Soviet prison system, but then traveled far less distances away.
B0054JURZA|5.0|I came upon this collection by accident.  What a wonderful accident!  The songs are light and mellow; perfect for relaxing with a glass of wine.  The melodies are smooth and beautiful.  Like an earlier writer said, the lyrics are sometimes more like mumbles, but beautiful nontheless.  Most songs kind of just run/blend together.  I can't wait to go backwards and listen to all of their other work.  I'm definitely a new fan.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I received the DVD in a very timely fashion in great condition. I'm very happy with the service and would use it again.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|If I had one word to use to describe this album it would be versatile. I don't even know what category to place it in. Strong elements of blues ,rock and roll and country permeate the whole cd.She manipulates her voice to fit the mood of each song.Some songs like Soldier's Angel and Wide Sargasso Sea, she deliberately adds a bit a roughness to it. Then other songs like Annabell Lee and The Twilight Song, she sings it breathy and sweet like a church bell. The duets with dave  stewart ( of the Eurythmics) and Lindsay Buckingham add a certian something to it.The imagery and the stories she tells with her music makes you hunger for more music like this.Even my one friend who listens strictly to gangsta rap like a few songs on here. The picture of her wearing the Victorian bonnet with an ostrich feather is worth the price of the cd alone.
0345529057|5.0|I'd never even heard of these books before I started seeing the billboards all over the city for the HBO special. I am so thrilled that I remembered to dvr this when I got home. I was half way through the tv series before I had to buy the books. I can not remember ever reading a book and watching a tv show simultameously. This is one of the most brilliant books/series of books I've ever read. Some have compared to The Lord of the Rings, some have compared to The Once and Future King...I have read them and many other of these types of books that can loosely be called similar, but I can compare this to nothing I've read previously. Perhaps - maybe - possibly - remotely - the Harry Piotter books only in the comparison of making a total and complete creation of another/aternate world, but one you feel utterly comfortable in from the first page. There is no new vocabulary to learn no new words to describe things (mostly they are spelling changes - but you get the idea immediately)and no strange creatures or languages that most fantasy books frankly, make you learn before you become comfortable with the books. From the first page you are comfortabley sucked in immediately and must continue to read until you get to the end. I highly recommend to anyone who likes a good, long, complicated but engaging yarn. Get a blanket, curl up by the fire - winter is coming - and you'll have a lot of reading to do!

B003UESJFG|5.0|This movie has just the right combination of adult/teen/child humor in it, which I feel is missing from so many animated movies today. They're either over the top to pander to the adults taking their children or simply too ridiculous for an adult to sit through. Not this one. It has that special \\"it\\" that is difficult to put one's finger on. Will Ferrell takes his usual over-the-top character persona and plays it PERFECTLY in animation. All the voice characters were well done and such fun. It seems like everyone really enjoyed making this movie. The plot is pretty standard with a clever think-through and I cannot say enough that I thought it was just darling. I rented this first before I bought it and have watched several times since.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a rousing conclusion to the cycle of films. I have not read the books (I'll start soon if I can work through my stack of books) so my review has to do with the film alone. The three principles in the story - Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson - demonstrate the acting skills that they have picked up over the years and turn in good performances.  The Amazon review noted that there was a lack of chemistry between Harry and Ginny Weasley but there had very little screen time and their characters seems to have taken a back seat to the struggle to defeat Vorldemort and the destruction of the remaining Horcruxes.  The film nicely expresses the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage of the wizards battling the forces of evil. .    It was great to see the many characters played by so many veteran British actors, even if they had only a single scene. John Hurt had a memorable scene describing the characters of different wands and Maggie Smith had a courageous scene displacing Professor Snape as the Headmaster of Hogwarts.  Alan Rickman has a small but effective role in the film and we finally learn Severus Snape's turn feelings toward Harry Potter with his relationship to his mother.  In the end, Snape is the hero that one suspected in watching the films. It would be interesting if J. K. Rowling would write about the generation before Harry, as there is a compelling story to be told.     The final installment of Harry Potter is filled with marvelous special effects, particularly the dragon guarding the vault of in Bellatrix Lestrange labyrinth of Gringotts Bank.  There are some humorous scenes as when Emma Watson impersonates Lestrange with the help of Polly Juice Potion. The only part of the story that was somewhat inexplicable was Harry's death and being brought back to life.  How the Resurrection Stone was used was rather mysterious.  One can't help enjoying the scene where the once timid Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) defies Voldemort.  The epilogue was a nice touch so we could see how enemies had reconciled and life goes on in a new generation.        The final installment of Harry Potter is a memorable film that one can enjoy several times.

B004WJRF6C|3.0|This is not a horrible album but it's definitely not Paul's best. It's a breezy, lazy collection on which Paul seems to be on cruise control. The album is credited to both him and Linda McCartney, his wife, but anyone that knows the history of post-Beatles McCartney material knows that although she made some contributions, she didn't really start coming into her own until after Band On The Run, which was released 3 years later. An almost all-acoustic production with only one outstanding song in MAYBE I'M AMAZED which is truly a McCartney classic of the highest caliber. The rest is filler to go with the single. If Paul wasn't an ex-Beatle this album would've probably not enjoyed very much success. Some of the songs would be better sandwiched in between some variety, but the album doesn't change much from beginning to end. Some of them are embarrassing, such as THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING's repetitive, un-distinctive, unrealized blues. Paul can do much better. The whole album sounds unfinished, except for MAYBE I'M AMAZED. MOMMA MISS AMERICA is a good song that would've been great with a better production standard and if someone had added lyrics and a melody to it. THE LOVELY LINDA and JUNK are good songs but again, not fully realized. McCartney is what the critics always said it is. It is a hodgepodge of ramshackle songs that hint at where Paul would go with his next release; the excellent masterpiece Ram. Paul is capable of much more than what this album suggests. It's not a total loss. It's an enjoyable casual listen, but that's it. This is more for McCartney enthusiasts than for casual fans. If you have Wingspan, the Wings greatest hits collection, then you don't need this.<br /><br />I bought the 2011 remaster and the sound is good, but the remastering used on Wingspan is better. You can hear a slightly better fidelity on MAYBE I'M AMAZED than on the McCartney album version. It has a booklet with all the lyrics and some very endearing pictures of Paul, Linda and their family. One can tell that this couple was truly blessed with a great life. It comes with a bonus cd of outtakes and live versions of some of the songs that is a nice addition, but I'm not a big fan of outtakes and demos. I'm only interested when a bonus disc includes unreleased, fully realized tracks, so I won't comment on the bonus disc. If you like that sort of thing you will be happyy.

0553386816|3.0|John Grisham has almost always delighted me with his novels' settings.  Mainly those taking place in Ford County, Mississippi.  There we are treated to background and main characters that run the gamut of personality types and idiosyncrasies.  Everyone wasn't always cookie-cutter good or bad.  Here, while the stories that take place are interesting, the vast majority of these people seem so terrible they are hard to care about because you hope nothing good happens to them.  Each story was good just almost devoid of goodness which isn't at all what Grisham has shown in his other works.  While there might be deplorable racist in one scene we are usually given a foil to that character that plays off it well.  Here, not so much.  Overall, this is a decent but depressing collection.
1451629184|5.0|WOW.  This book is the most amazing story of survival, love and hope I have ever read. It has moved me in more ways that I can describe.  What a wonderful human being is Jaycee Lee Dugard.  I admire her tremendously and want to thank her personally for sharing her story.  A powerful lesson can be learned by ANYONE who reads this book.  When life gets me down-for whatever silly reason or good reason- I will remember Jaycee and know that no matter what happens, there is always HOPE.<br />Jaycee---you are my HERO.
B0012Q732O|1.0|&#34;10,000 B.C.&#34; is a classic example of a film where all the budget was put into the cinematography and special effect, with little regard given to the script and acting. The results are an epic adventure tale, that is neither adventurous or epic.<br /><br />This story of a young hunter who faces his predestined fate to lead his tribe, could have been a compelling and intense story of human history. But the script is so horribly flawed and the acting so bland, that there is nothing to emotionally connect the audience to the characters or the story. You simply don't really care about any of it.<br /><br />I never bought the love story between the two lead characters. Their unemotive acting skills, hampered by a scripted romance that is so schmaltzy and unbelievable, that it isn't even worthy of being used as a dime store romance novel, much less a major budget motion picture, never brings about any sense of true emotion from the viewer. You not only don't believe these two people love each other, you don't even care enough to wonder why you feel that way. I'll admit I wasn't around back then to see how these people interacted with each other, but I can tell you it was probably nothing at all like this. And the way the girl survives to be with her man in the end, is so mind-numbingly unbelievable, it is more of an insult to the viewers intelligence, rather than the uplifting emotional moment the writers and director probably intended it to be.<br /><br />Another problem with the film is all the historical inaccuracies. When you want to make a film that is based on the history of the human race on Earth, if you can't create a stirring tale of fiction with human history as the backdrop, you'd do well to try to keep as close to the facts as you can. I mean, while the ancient Egyptians did use slave labor to build their vast cities and monuments, I don't believe that Woolly Mammoths were there to help in that. If this movie was about some alien world, I might be able to overlook this kind of thing, but if you are going to use actual Earth history as your setting, either use it right or don't use it at all. When it can be said that &#34;One Million Years B.C.&#34; is a more historically accurate film, you know something is seriously wrong with your film's script and research.<br /><br />Of course, the biggest problem I personally had with the film was the extremely slow and plodding pace, as the characters spend lots of time just walking around. I could have taken mini-naps between the major scenes of the film and not felt lost when I awoke and started watching it again. We get it, alright? They are traveling great distances. You don't need to make the audience feel like they are on one themselves, as they watch the film. An adventure tale is supposed to be exciting, not boring.<br /><br />The one place the film does get it right, though, is the cinematography. There is some brilliant and breathtaking camera work here, with some very gorgeous wide angle shots of the lands the characters travel through. It is the one place where the film truly shines. It is not, however, anywhere near enough to reverse the detriments in the script, acting and researching of the film to make the story even remotely enjoyable.<br /><br />&#34;10,000 B.C.&#34; could have been one of the great epic adventure stories of the the last decade, but being saddled with poorly emoting actors, an unbelievable soap opera romance, historical inaccuracies you could fly a jumbo jet through, and a pace so slow and tedious it would put a snail to sleep, the film instead becomes one of the biggest and most costly of viewing disappointments, perhaps of all time (&#34;Waterworld&#34; has nothing on this film, believe me)!

B003YFIUW8|2.0|I had read so many glowing reviews of this book that I was really looking forward to sitting down and enjoying this book; I didn't. Not only was the pace of the book excruciatingly slow but it really irritated me that Ma could introduce concepts of geometry to Jack but couldn't teach him to speak any better than a toddler???? Really?!?! I really think the baby talk did me in - couldn't take it; couldn't finish it.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I first played this game when I was in college, and have loved it since.  The basic game (the product reviewed here) is great because it has simple, easy-to-learn rules that can get you playing and enjoying it your very first game.  The game continues to improve, however, as you master the rules and strategy and are able to play with more experienced players.  I also love that Catan has so many great expansion packs.  Two of my favorites are Seafarers (which takes the games to the seas and introduces shipbuilding, but doesn't change the essentials of the game) and Cities and Knights (which adds greater complexity through the introduction of commodities, barbarian attacks, and the ability to train and maintain knights for city defense).

B004EPZ07K|2.0|Check out the full review at Metal Arcade DOT Net<br /><br />Be aware that this review may contain some spoilers. DC Comics' Green Lantern makes his long awaited debut on the big screen. So how did it pan out?<br /><br />Not too great. I went into this movie with very low expectations based on the bad word of mouth it had been receiving. The movie never blew away those low expectations, either.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds stars in this Martin Campbell (Casino Royale) directed, effects driven romp as Hal Jordan, the first ever human chosen to join the ranks of the Green Lantern Corps.<br /><br />Hal is a reckless, cocky pilot when the movie starts, and he seems to have pissed off most of the people in his life who care about him. Shortly after an accident causes him to lose his job, Hal encounters a dying alien named Abin Sur, who passes the Green Lantern torch to him before he dies, saying that the ring chose him as his successor. A Green Lantern must be responsible and fearless, and so Hal thinks that the ring has made a big mistake in choosing him.<br /><br />After the ring is bonded to him, Hal is sent to the Lantern's home world of Oa. It is there that he meets Sinestro, a great warrior who is resentful of Hal, whom he believes is unworthy of the legendary Abin Sur's ring. He is also greeted by Kilowog (Michael Clarke Duncan), a giant beast of a drill instructor, and the intellectual Tomar-Re (Geoffrey Rush). He is beaten down by Kilowog's harsh training and Sinestro's down-talking, and after being pushed too far, he quits, saying that the ring made a mistake in choosing him.<br /><br />Back on Earth, Hector Hammond (played by a nigh-unrecognizable Peter Skarsgaard), a highly intelligent professor and son of a senator (Tim Robbins), is visited by the government, who wants him to study the alien Abin Sur's body. While examining the body, he is infected by the fear energy that killed Abin Sur, by way of Parallax, a dumb looking Galactus ripoff, fueled by terrible CGI. Hal must overcome his fears of the past, his memories of his dead father's terrible plane crash, and now Hector and Galactus... erm, Parallax, if he's to make Sinestro proud and live up to his hype as a Lantern.<br /><br />The movie itself, however, far from lives up to its hype. With a director like Martin Campbell, who revitalized the aging James Bond franchise, you would think the movie was in good hands. However, this movie is just one more in the long line of 3-D driven special effects spectacles that try to cover up the film's lack of true substance and story. As you could probably tell from my long winded retelling of the film's setup, the story is terribly confusing, with too much going on, too many characters and too much CGI to distract you. This is DC's version of X-Men: The Last Stand (an arguably better movie).<br /><br />The CGI in the movie ranges from terrible to amazing. The time spent on the planet Oa, home of the Lanterns, is arguably the most well done, with thousands of cool looking alien species serving as Corps members and a beautiful skyline. Hal's training on Oa is by far the most interesting visually and story-wise. It's a shame Hal's time on Oa only accounts for about 15 minutes of this movie.<br /><br />Once Hector Hammond makes his debut as a dumb looking giant-headed, ugly ass guy in a wheelchair, the film becomes plain laughable. His character is far from intimidating, and I can't understand why they decided to put him in the movie. Near the end of the film he reveals his feelings for Hal's girl Carol (Blake Lively) and how he's despised Hal since they were kids- which seems thrown in at the last minute since the film makes no mention that they all grew up together. Sarsgaard's performance is hammy and terrible, and you just want his character to die a horrible death form the moment you see him. You'll understand once you see the film- he pretty much just wastes all the time he was onscreen, which could have been much better served on the awesome looking planet Oa.<br /><br />Likewise, the main villain, Parallax, is dumb, stupid looking, and not as intimidating as everyone in the movie makes him out to be. The final confrontation between Hal and this absurd looking villain could have been a great opportunity to showcase the cool looking ranks of the Green Lantern Corps, but I guess they ran out of CGI money there or something, because even Parallax himself looks like he was created by a budget, basement CGI team normally used for Sy-Fi channel garbage.<br /><br />Some people were complaining about Ryan Reynolds being cast in the role of Hal Jordan, but he is bar none the best thing in the movie. He is the only character you actually care about, and his acting ability and charisma are the only thing keeping this film from being totally unwatchable. Blake Lively is pretty good in her role, which doesn't give her much to do besides look pretty and have one cool Top-Gun style flight sequence in the beginning of the film.<br /><br />There are so many things wrong with this movie that I can't detail them all, even in this now close to 1000 word review. It isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, however Hal Jordan, one of DC's few well-respected characters, deserved much better. As it stands, Batman is still the only DC character with movies worthy of his comic pedigree, and that's a real shame.looking planet Oa.

B0034G4P8U|3.0|Check out the full review at [...]<br /><br />Transformers: Dark Of The Moon is a massive overload of action. By now, at the third entry in the series, you should know how you feel about Michael Bay's Transformers series, and Michael Bay movies in general. If you love dumb action,  hot girls, and the best CGI that mankind has to offer, then you will love this movie. If you hated the last two, this one definitely won't change your mind.<br /><br />The setup for the film can be summarized pretty quickly: the film recounts the War for Cybertron (pretty neat) and explains that there was an ulterior motive behind the space race of the 60's. There's even a CGI JFK, which lasted about 3 seconds but still was kinda cool. Flash-forward to present day, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LaBeouf) is having a hard time finding a job after college (there are some funny scenes with Sam on interviews). Elsewhere, Lt. Col. Lennox (Josh Duhamel) and the NEST team of Autobots are taking out the fledgling Decepticons. The bad guys rise up and invade Chicago, planning to take over Earth. Obviously Optimus Prime is pissed.<br /><br />The battles in this movie are better directed and easier to follow than in Transformers or Revenge of the Fallen.  They can still get pretty hectic, but in general I could tell who was fighting who more often than not. The fights were also visually more interesting, with great choreography and CGI. I still can't get over, after three movies, how freaking real the robots look standing right next to the human characters. ILM did a fantastic job once again.<br /><br />The movie is a tiny bit darker, but Bay exaggerated a bit about it. The Decepticons have some cool parts where they get to show how evil they are, such as a sequence when they kill off some of their human allies. I was surprised when they actually showed large groups of humans being exploded into nothing by Decepticons. Also, there is quite a bit of bad language in the movie. I felt a little weird being surrounded by kids and babies, and seeing gratuitous ass shots and violence and hearing much more expletives than in the previous films. I could care less, but parents should know that it does push its PG-13 rating a bit far.<br /><br />Most of the old cast returns, like the previously mentioned Shia  and Josh, along with Tyrese Gibson's Epps, and the always funny Agent Simmons, played by John Turturro. There are a good amount of newcomers this time around. John Malkovich is one of Sam's eccentric bosses.Ken Jeong is one of his co-workers, who was funny at first but they played his part out far too quicly, and he became annoying. The same could be said of Alan Tudyk (Steve The Pirate!) in some weird gay German sidekick shtick to Simmons. Kevin Dunn and Julie White are back as Sam's sometimes funny, sometimes grating parents. Here they are mostly grating. Frances McDormand plays National Intelligence Director Mearing. Patrick Dempsey makes a heel turn as a too-nice-to-be-true boss, who quickly shows his evil side. As you can see, there are a lot of characters stuffed into this mammoth, 2.5 hour movie.<br /><br />The characters you will see the most of are of course Sam, the awesome robots and Megan Fox's replacement, model-turned-actress (Slashie Award!) Rosie-Huntington-Whitely. She is OK for a first time-actress, but to be honest her sugar sweet attitude gets annoying by the end, and dare I say it, I missed Megan Fox a bit. I'm sure water cooler debate will wage for some time to come over who was hotter, and I'd have to give the edge to Megan. Also, even though there are giant robots doing battle on the streets of Chicago in this movie, the least believable thing has to be that Sam's character can continue to get these supermodel girls.<br /><br />Now for the robots. Optimus Prime is as badass as he's ever been, with awesome battles worthy of him. He also gets to use his cool sword more in this movie, and even takes a giant robo-shotgun to another bots face. Megatron is back in a smaller role than usual, with a cool hoodie/cloak type thing and a badly destroyed body from the ROTF end battle. Starscream and Shockwave are sweet. Some of those tiny, goofy, comedy relief robots are back and annoying as usual. There are some more dumb looking Autobots this time, like an Autobot that looks like an old man, with gray hair and everything. Since when do robots grow old or have hair? It's really dumb, unnecessary, and when he dies a horrible death (not a spoiler, nobody cares about him) most of the audience laughed. Those two racist robots from ROTF are gone, thank God. Finally, Leonard Nimoy voices a robot called Sentinel Prime.<br /><br />After the travesty that was Revenge of the Fallen, Michael Bay and company try to redeem themselves a bit with Dark of the Moon. They aren't completely successful, as the movie still falls into many of the traps the last two did, but it is the most fun Transformers movie since the first film. The movie is definitely too long, has too many goofy slapstick bits, and too many characters.

B003Y5H5A6|5.0|After a hell of a lot of hype, Captain America: The First Avenger is finally in theaters. It delivers on the hype and goes even beyond that, turning star Chris Evans into a bona fide leading man. Captain America is among the best of the comic book movies released this summer. It's a lot better than Green Lantern, a bit better than Thor, but not quite on the level of X-Men: First Class.<br /><br />The trail to The Avengers is blazed by director Joe Johnston, and he and Chris Evans bring style and substance to a character that I previously couldn't give a damn about. I've always thought of Cap as just a bit too hokey, too much of a cookie-cutter symbol of USA patriotism and old-timey square-jawed superheroes. I remember smiling when I learned that Evans was cast in the role; if anyone could bring genuine charisma to the character of Steve Rogers, it was the former Johnny Storm (and Lucas Lee!).<br /><br />The  film starts out in a barren arctic landscape, where a group of government officials have discovered something buried. The site is excavated, and before Cap's shield is discovered, my brother turned to me and asked, \\"Are we in the right movie?\\"<br /><br />Then the film smash cuts to WWII-era New York City, where we meet our hero Steve Rogers for the first time. If you haven't seen the trailers (unlikely), you will be taken aback a bit by the CG wizardry put to work to attach the always-buff Evans' head to a seriously scrawny, short body. Even as a gaunt  punching bag, Evans imbues his character with a likability that is integral throughout the movie. With a lesser actor in the lead, this movie wouldn't be half as good.<br /><br />We are shown Rogers' undying patriotism as he continually applies to be shipped overseas as a soldier. He is constantly turned down due to his tiny physical stature and myriad health problems. He is overheard by Dr. Abraham Erskine (Stanley Tucci) while talking to his buddy Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and defending his drive to join the army. Dr. Erskine sees unwavering spirit of Rogers, and offers him a chance to fight for his country- a serum that he has designed, which can turn an ordinary man into the perfect soldier. Tucci does a great job making Dr. Erskine feel like a person, not a throwaway character, in the short screen time he is given. He believes in Rogers, and Steve spends the rest of the movie trying to live up to his expectations and make him proud.<br /><br />Dr. Erskine tells the story of Dr. Johann Schmidt (Hugo Weaving), also known as The Red Skull and Cap's main enemy in this movie. Dr. Erskine's super soldier serum was discovered by Schmidt, who, as a power hungry man, demanded to be the first test subject. It turns out that the serum brings out the inner qualities of the man; a good man's qualities become better, while in the case of The Red Skull, he was horribly disfigured. Ever since Erskine defected to the US, Schmidt has tried to track him down and kill him, because he knows that if he is able to make another super soldier, it will be the one thing capable of stopping his plans for global domination.<br /><br />Tommy Lee Jones is great as an Army Colonel that continually tears down Steve Rogers both before and after his superhero transformation. Hayley Atwell plays the romantic interest, and has great chemistry with Evans. Her character is there to comfort Steve when he is distraught about the fact that, after his transformation, he is relegated to putting on a silly spandex costume (the original Captain America uniform) and parading around in a stage show to help sell war bonds (some of the funniest scenes in the movie happen here). After being booed, humiliated and lambasted by troops serving in Italy, he decides enough is enough and to go on a one-man mission to rescue P.O.W.'s at a nearby camp, and finally gain the respect of his fellow soldiers.<br /><br />After that, the movie is mostly just about Captain America taking down Red Skull, until a heartstring-pullingending that sets up The Avengers. All in all, it was a great summer popcorn flick, and a real star-making vehicle for Chris Evans. Marvel has done a great job in casting all of the Avengers, and it's one more movie I can't wait for next summer. Great job, Marvel..

0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay feels as though written by a different writer. The first 2 books were wonderful, perfect, edge of your seat excitement. However, Suzanne Collins finished the series with a sad, depressing, and disappointing book. Katniss sleep walks through the book contemplating suicide every other breath and has none of the personality from the first books. I'm not even going to go into what Collins does to the other characters! It seems all she cared about was making a statement about the horrors of war.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|This movie got really bad reviews, and it's true that Cameron Diaz cannot do a decent southern accent to save her life, but it's really thought provoking. If you are in the mood for something that will make you think, then this is a great movie.
B005D9MUWY|1.0|Don't waste your money on this one if you're a speed typer. This  was the worst $3 I've spent. The auto predictions box doesn't show up in many apps and even when it does, you have to pause from typing to see if it predicted your word, which takes much longer for the whole typing process. I tried to use it for a few days to see if it would get better at predicting but it really just stayed at the same level. After seeing no difference except for my phone slowing down, I stopped using it. Wish I could refund it now.  For those looking for more control yet an extremely fast typing keyboard, I highly recommend swype. once you get used to it, you never have to even think about lifting a finger between letters. And swype even includes auto predictions just in case you mess up. And best of all it's free.
B000002H6C|4.0|Metallica's 1988 album, ...And Justice For All, is a juggernaut. With 9 tracks that average nearly 7 and a half minutes in length, a ferociously heavy guitar sound, top-flight riffs, and a vocal performance from singer/rhythm guitarist James Hetfield that is unrivaled by any of their other albums, this has everything it needs to be Metallica's all-time opus. But why is it not? It suffers from a glaring flaw: virtually no bottom end. The drums have a clicky sound to them, while the bass guitar is virtually non-existent. I hope one day, Metallica will present remasters of EVERYTHING they have done, but this most of all. It's an album that has five-star music with three-star production, at best. Still, for any fan of heavy music, it's sure to satisfy overall.
B0050CQY1W|4.0|When i first heard this cd to me it didnt sound like beyonce, but then i realized that artist are constantly evolving and so is there music, after listening to it again and really paying attention to it, the songs started to grow on me and then i just started to love the cd. This is good work for beyonce she will always be in business, but you have to keep your mind open to constant changes in music, and then come to appreciate what the artist is trying to convey in there music.
0887307280|2.0|This book could not have had less substance. If I didn't have a college degree and was thinking about opening up a fast food franchise I would find it interesting. But I found this book totally useless. The author goes into excrutiating detail about scenery...\\"the milk stained glass sat effortlessly in the shaded window sill as the pie maker lie awake anxiously\\" that sort of garbage that made the book 3x longer than necessary. I'm pretty sure he completely made up the characters and situations to creatively justify whatever point he was trying to make.      My biggest complaint about the book was the lack of substance, there was no data backing up anything he was saying. It was mental diarrea of pointless stories the entire time. I heard so many good things about the book and could not have been more disappointed. Books like The Goal and Good to Great do such a better job than this self proclaimed \\"expert\\". Here is the book in two sentances, 'if you're good at your hobby its not the same thing as managing people and monetizing your hobby. To be successful you need a vision and you need to execute.\\"  Tada!!! I just saved you $12. Don't waste your time with this one, you'll be disappointed.
B000053VAZ|5.0|My college-age daughter suggested that we watch this film.  I'd heard of it, but for some reason was never enticed by it.  Nevertheless we plugged it in and gave it a look.  I have to admit that I was completely engaged all the way through!<br /><br />Mary Stewart Masterson plays a mentally challenged yet artistically talented woman who lives with her brother who runs a mechanic shop.  He plays poker with three buddies and instead of money they use other odds and ends to ante up and to bid.  One day one of the poker buddies has a relation show up to stay with him (enter Johnny Depp).  He is a classic film fanatic, and has his own unique way of looking and and navigating the world by using silent film legends as his template for living.<br /><br />One thing leads to another, and through a strange twist of events Depp ends up staying with Joon and her brother.<br /><br />If you are at all like me, you will be pulled into the story as you wonder what in the world is going to happen next.<br /><br />The character development is good, Masterson does a fine job portraying her character, and Depp, oh man!  he does an incredible job with the physical humor so common in early films, which in many cases grew out of Vaudeville.<br /><br />This was an enjoyable experience through and through, and our movie-watching company the night we watched it all agreed.  That crew included myself, my wife, her mother, my college-aged daughter and her roommate, my 12-year old daughter, and 14-year old niece.  It was a success!<br /><br />5 stars for a great bit of acting and for a great story!
0887081770|4.0|This is a lovely story and is one of our all time favorites in our collection.  I wanted to reiterate what others have said though, this book is tiny and is not the board book version which is bigger.  If you have younger kids, you may want to search for the board book version that has the pop up and interactive pages as well.
0553801473|2.0|GRRM seems to be suffering from Joel Rosenberg disease; create a great world and interesting characters then kill them off, leave the reader thinking that there will be a great payoff, milk the revenue stream without delivering any closure, dwindle off to nothing with characters that nobody cares about.  This book went effectively nowhere with one key character slain for shock value.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Gave me a different perspective on being womanly, feminist, and a mother. Great read! Very entertaining. Even better if it's the audio book since you're able to pick up on Tina's humor. Recommend it!
B004CRR9G0|3.0|This is by far one of my favorite Miyazaki film. I used it watch it a lot on VHS when I was just a kid. Maybe it's just me but I honestly didn't feel like it was \\"blu-ray\\" quality. I don't think I would have been able to tell if it was a DVD-rip. It pretty much reminded me of the same quality when I used to watch it on VHS. Also, the caption isn't very good. It doesn't match up with the English narrative; slightly annoying. I'd expected something more from Disney.
B00006G8HX|3.0|In the summer of 1984, \\"Star Trek III: The Search for Spock\\" hit movie theaters as the much-anticipated direct sequel to arguably the best Trek ever, \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.\\"  Without the benefit of writer-director Nicholas Meyer, this new film trusted its success to the most logical (pun, intended) candidate available, Leonard \\"Mr. Spock\\" Nimoy.  As his directorial film debut, Nimoy would proceed to make a time-efficient and entertaining film on a modest budget with only 105 minutes of running time.  After twenty-seven years, \\"The Search for Spock\\" still ages fairly well, but its weaknesses become increasingly apparent with repeat viewings (i.e. have you ever noticed how \\"Search\\"'s opening melancholic tone is inexplicably opposite of \\"Khan\\"'s optimistic finale?).    Overall, the largely predictable story often works on all thrusters, including the climatic destruction of the overmatched U.S.S. Enterprise during its showdown with the Klingon battle cruiser, and a devastated Kirk's reaction to his son David's tragic fate.  The sequences involving the theft of the U.S.S. Enterprise from Spacedock and the poignant finale are certainly moments for Nimoy and his team to be very proud of.  The flip side is that Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols) is given so very little to do, as seeing her escape from Starfleet to make the rendezvous on planet Vulcan should have been worthy of at least one quick follow-up scene.  Also, the Genesis set starts off well in conjuring up the illusion of another world, but it becomes increasingly obvious during these 'outdoor' Genesis scenes that \\"Star Trek III\\" was filmed entirely inside a studio.  Interspersing some real outside location footage to simulate Genesis' garden-like environment gone to hell probably would have made a difference here.    The acting, as expected, is solid and consistent, but this time it not necessarily inspired.  As Admiral Kirk, William Shatner's efforts were better in \\"Khan,\\" but his big reaction scene over David's fate is arguably the character's finest moment ever on-screen.  The familiar Trek ensemble cast is true to form, though only Kelley as Dr. McCoy is given anything remotely challenging to do.  With that in mind, Kelley deserves the film's acting MVP award for making the most of his bolstered screen time (i.e. his attempted Vulcan nerve pinch on a less-than-amused Starfleet security agent).  Christopher Lloyd, despite yet another role as the black-hat villain, predictably eats up the screen as the nefarious Klingon, Kruge.  Robin Curtis does some nice but relatively bland work as the new Lt. Saavik, as does the late Merritt Butrick again as Kirk's son, David.  Unfortunately, these two actors have only minimal chemistry together.  Kirstie Alley's more interesting presence as Saavik would have been preferable over the age-old soap opera tactic of simply recasting the character.  Finally, look for an amusing Klingon cameo by a heavily made-up John Larroquette as Kruge's last surviving crew member, who is evidently disappointed that Kirk's sarcastic death threat just moments earlier proves to be false.    Ultimately, \\"Search\\" is intelligent, above-average entertainment that suffers from numerous plot holes (i.e. why is the U.S.S. Enterprise being decommissioned so abruptly? What happened to Carol Marcus?, etc.).  Yet, the movie recycles some classic character elements from the vintage TV series, such as Kirk's fight moves during a climatic battle with Kruge, and the underlying friendship between McCoy and Spock.  The few poignant surprises, unfortunately, come off as sacrificial lambs by screenwriter-producer Harve Bennett to enhance Admiral Kirk's sense of urgency in rescuing Spock (and McCoy's sanity).  Even so, Bennett's lackluster writing efforts at least makes the transition to \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" in 1986 appear pretty seamless.  In my opinion, Kirk gets the best line when asked by Sulu and Chekov, if they have beengiven Starfleet's permission to save Spock & McCoy.  The admiral's nonchalant reply: \\"The word is 'No.'  I am, therefore, going anyway,\\" is simply vintage Captain Kirk.    All in all, \\"The Search for Spock\\" is a Trek worth taking as a bridge to better installments in the ongoing film franchise.    Rating: a solid 7/10 stars (appropriate for ages 10+ for mild profanity and some sci-fi violence).    P.S.  The collection of special features is a nice treasure trove to sort through.
B0050KEVO6|1.0|App has a (intentional?) bug that keeps prompting user to download an update which wont install. I wonder if theyre getting credit for each download making it appear that the app is more popular than it actually is.  The app is somewhat interesting for about an hour or so.

B0017APPSE|5.0|The Other Bolelyn Girl is an acceptionally riviting movie.  In addition to a story about power within a kingdom, more importantly it's a story about the love of two sisters.  Great Film!
B0032UYFA6|4.0|I still like the show but it wasn't as engaging as the first two seasons.  I suspect it's because the focus was more on the inner family conflict and less on the conflict with the drug lords.  Walt spends a good part of this season trying to win back his wife amidst further temptations from a drug lord offering him a sweet deal to continue and even though Walt tries to get out he finds himself being drawn back in.  And what of Jesse?  Well, he's trying to heal from a loss last season but he's still his usual self after a while.  There are some nice supporting characters during this season.  Cliffhanger was compelling.  CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B minus; FOCUSES: B minus to B; OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B; WHEN WATCHED: June to July 2011
B00371QQ0M|4.0|This is exactly like the original theatrical release, cleaned up alot, although some scenes might be clipped just a little in transitions. Comes out the same length tho. No chance to check BD sound, but video was good.  It is NOT the extended version; as I have both the original and extended in DVD format.
B0001CNRBG|5.0|I almost turned this story off in the first 15 minutes because it was kind of boring.  So glad I didn't.  It really picked up.  Anyway, this tale focuses on two married people who meet each other while both off on their solo vacations and after a sudden affair they both agree to meet once a year. Alan Alda does a refreshing job playing an anxiety ridden guilty man and Ellen Burnstyn starts as a naive housewife who develops her own strengths and is sometimes the stronger of the two of them.  The focus is upon their affair from the 50s to the 70s and every interlude has black and white pictures of American History passing including our value changes.  You really get the feeling these two people love each other.  In fact, they might even be soulmates yet both of them are married to others and with children and they're arguably also in love with their spouses.  The Vietnam argument they have is the most heartbreaking.  Slow opening but I think that's because in the 70s musicals and slow beginnings were the way to go.  The real question is whether they'll ever get together fulltime and that's revealed at the end. STORY/PLOTTING: B plus to A minus; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: A minus to A; THEMES/SETTING: A minus; WHEN WATCHED: end of July 2011; OVERALL GRADE: A minus.
B004BBDHEK|5.0|I loved this CD.  While at work, I listen to this CD as background music as I program.  My code just \\"flows\\" - just like Yanni's music.  It's great music - very relaxing and upbeat at times.  I've always enjoyed his music and this one is just as good!
B001EO748M|5.0|The second season of The Tudors was the most innovative and most action packed, as the years that Henry VIII was married to Anne Bolyn were perhaps the most turbulent years of the British monarchy and ramifications in Western Civilization.  Henry divorced his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and married Anne Bolyn, believing that she was going to produce the much hoped for son to continue his legacy on the British throne.  What we do not think about is Catherine, left to rot in her own filth and not even allowed to see her and Henry's daughter, Mary.  Mary, a teenager in this movie, is growing up resenting her father for divorcing her mother and outraged at the political and religious changes that his marriage has caused.  She is foreshadowing her own rule in several years, when she becomes queen and will become fanatical about restoring the Catholic faith to England.  But in the meantime, Henry's second marriage to Anne does not pan out as anyone intended.    Anne will famously not deliver the much hoped for son.  The child that she gives birth to after they marry is a girl, and she apologizes for it.  Henry at first hopes that since they are both still young and fertile that they will go on to have more children; but, so much for Anne, she does not produce another surviving child, let alone a son.  Henry's eyes begin to wander to other mistresses, as he has always done, and soon Anne falls out of favor with him.  It is a rather complicated series of events that unfold that lead to her eventual imprisonment in the Tower, but Anne was never truly accepted by many of the people of England, let alone Henry's political and religious opponents who were already trying to establish powers.  Soon, Henry begins to hate Anne, believing that she betrayed and tricked him into marriage.  Accusations of adultery and incest will follow Anne, until Henry decides, becoming ever more prideful and gluttonous, to forgo another divorce and simply have Anne executed.    Perhaps the hardest parts to watch were the ailing deaths of Catherine, his first wife, who was living in exile in her country estate, saying she would forever be the true queen of England.  And Anne, imprisoned in The Tower, getting to watch her brother's execution from her prison window, only to wait for her own beheading.  There was quite a bit of confusion in the days leading up to her execution, as a special swordsman from France was coming in to do the deed and give her a much quicker and less painful death.  His journey was delayed for several days, and Anne thought that today was her day.  When he finally did arrive, Anne met her maker in the Tower courtyard.  Henry has already chosen what would be his third wife, Jane Seymore, and not making a secret of it from Anne or others.  And, like they say, the rest is history.    The special features show a short tour of the Tower and the place where Anne was executed.  A nice compliment to things other than the obvious soap opera that would ensue of Henry and his wants.
0783230079|5.0|This movie has to be one of the best movies ever made. The cast is wonderful. The storyline is simply perfect. And it will leave you feeling like there really is a purpose for everything.    Like previously mentioned it's about a guy who has four spirits attached to him ... with the intent of having him resolve their unfinished business, since they died prematurely. But to help them, he get's placed in funny, uncomfortable moments, which make for some great lines.     But really this movie has life lessons for us all ... \\"Sorry, Harrison, you died a failure because you never tried\\" is just one of them.     Imagine if you knew tomorrow was is it, what you would do ... what would be your unfinised business? That's what this movie about ... living a life with no regrets.
B004WCTLNY|1.0|Watching this movie is a big waste of time. I must say it had me hooked after 20 minutes because I wanted to see how truly stupid the plot would get. I was not disappointed; it went from bad to worse. If you are like me and only have a limited amount of time to watch movies, stay away from this one.
0880794968|4.0|I bought this deck because I wanted to own a Rider-Waite but I didn't like the coloring of the others. This one is very easy on the eyes and I love the backing. I think this is a great deck for beginners and advanced as it let's you read intuitively, yet there are so many books based on this system alone.
0307716511|5.0|I don't understand why people give bad reviews to this superb novel.  I read many many books including mysteries, thrillers, and literary novels, and I thought \\"Sister\\" was one of the best novels I had read this year.    \\"Sister\\" is not a pure thriller but rather a cross-over. Its' beautiful prose and a complex psychological journey of the protagonist make \\"Sister\\" a very good literary fiction, too. The mystery part is not the strongest of this novel, but it's suspenseful enough to make you want to keep reading. The ending is beautiful and resonant.     \\"Sister\\" was originally published in UK, and Luption's writing style is different from most of the thrillers we are familiar with . This may make readers who are used to American thrillers feel too dull, but I didn't feel that way at all.     Just read it without any preconception or prejudice. Open your heart and let Lupton take you a different place. That's my advice.
0061120073|4.0|This book is very nice, I do not have the \\"Can't put it down\\" syndrome but I often find myself thinking about the Characters and where I think the story is going so I like it because it is not making me stay up ridiculously late to finish it but I do keep thinking about it so I'm happy!
B000FVQM2Y|2.0|What a tedious film. I bought this film thinking it would be interesting - and I love a mystery. It took me a while to figure out the characters are in HS because there is never a scene that takes place in class.  What was that theater group about? And that strange Halloween party with the cryptic \\"performances\\" - where did that take place? Some rich kid's house with the parents gone?     Half the time I could not hear, let alone understand the use of English...if it was English. After the first 15 minutes, I started fast forwarding through the movie and just watched the scenes. You can pretty much get the idea of this movie without hearing a single word. It was like a bunch of young Californites with too much money and time on their hands decided to make a film that would piss of their parents.    The main antagonists in the movie are masochists doped out on lithium or pot - maybe both. The only parent is portrayed as an oblivious  \\"Leave it to Beaver\\" pleaser.  The only other authority figure is a vice principal who comes across as narcotics detective negotiating with his street contact. I hate to imagine meeting any of the characters portrayed in this film. I obviously do not fit into the category of audience that this film targets. Thank goodness I only paid $3.00 for it at the local Big Lots.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|After a long wait, ADWD is here... and unfortunately, it is not worth the wait.<br /><br />Although the pacing is markedly better than AFFC, despite the book's long length, very little actually happens to advance the overall story plot.  Many of the characters end up in circular situations that by the end of the book, leave them similar to where they start, albeit wiser.  Unfortunately, the reader doesn't have that advantage.<br /><br />Also disappointing is that GRRM, well known for \\"no one is safe,\\" is constantly \\"fake\\" killing characters at the end of chapters only to have them saved in the next.  This massively reduces the tension of the overall story and becomes extremely predictable.<br /><br />All of this might be forgiven, if this book wasn't 5 years in the making (ten if you count the pre-AFFC split)-- and if the next book wasn't far off on the horizon.  While the book isn't bad-- it just is too much fluff and no real substance.
0525422943|5.0|I read If I Stay at the end of 2009 and really enjoyed it.  I booktalked it and encouraged my students to read it, and I think my students enjoyed it even more than me.  When I learned that Gayle Forman was writing a sequel, I was definitely pumped and intrigued.  I hate the word \\"closure\\", but that word came to mind when the summary was released.  And, well, I barely have words to adequately express how much I LOVE Where She Went.<br /><br />I know I get gushy often, and I'm always sincere when the gushiness happens, but seriously!  Many people will say that when they really love a book they'll read it again.  There are simply too many books for me to read one more than once, but I will read Where She Went again, maybe even a third time.  I love it that much.<br /><br />I'm a big fan of Elsewhere and The Lovely Bones, so If I Stay was a big hit simply because of the setting and premise.  And I enjoyed Mia and really felt for her.  But Gayle Forman hit a home run writing this from Adam's point of view.  He is so real and troubled and lovesick.  He came alive on the page.  When I had to put the book down to perform important functions like eating, Adam stayed on my mind.  It's not that often that characters and a story stay with me as long as Adam and Mia did in Where She Went.<br /><br />Gayle Forman solidified how talented she is with this novel.  And honestly, I enjoyed her writing from a guy's point of view more than a girl's.  I hope she writes more about guys!  The story moved flawlessly and is full of heart-wrenching emotion.  This is a five star, must read!
B001TIQT98|5.0|I purchased this compliation last year, enjoyed it, but decided to sell it in favor Bernstein's DG set (knowing full well the performances were a mixed-bag interpretively). Well, I just 'repurchased' the Columbia/Sony cycle, and boy am I glad I did. I just listened to the 3rd and I can't believe what a spellbinding performance that is. As I write this, I'm listening to the maligned 7th and growing to like it more and more. The remastering of the original multi-track tapes is exceptional. The sound has been opened-up with plenty of air and clarity of detail. In short, the performances sound newly minted. Unlike many listeners, I don't have my earphones on listening for a lapse in intonation, missed entrance, or errant sour note - that, in my opinion, misses the point of the listening experience either at home or in the concert hall.<br /><br />I attended with unabashed pleasure, and then later purchased, MTT's SFO Mahler cycle; although thrilling in person, upon hearing them again at home, his performances, with the exception of his magnificent 2nd, were emotionally flat - they missed the passion and drive of Bernstein. He was all about the music; MTT, I don't know, but he and Bernstein are simply walking down the different sides of the same street with one bumping into Mahler on occassion, the other, simply walking right by him.<br /><br />The only exceptions to the Sony reissue was Bernstein's 1st and 5th with the VPO - they are both outstanding recordings that easily outshine his earlier efforts from the 60s. Like many people, I've never been crazy about his way with the 9th - I'll take Karajan (1), Abbado, Solti (my introduction to that magnificent symphony), and then Lenny's Concertgebouw performance. I'll probably keep both sets, but if you want just set of Mahler to live with, argue with, drink a glass schnapps with, this is your set!

0307387178|4.0|Initially, it seemed like Krakauer was merely padding out his original magazine article--telling the story, recounting similar obsessive 'into the wild' figures in previous eras, injecting his own story and pointing out the parallels with Chris McCandless, then retelling the story, adding family background, then the story of piecing together the chronology of what happened, picking up clues like a detective. By the last few chapters I realized that Krakauer was adding dimensions, deepening our understanding of who McCandless was and why he did what he did. Yes, Chris McCandless was young, headstrong and idealistic and he made some ultimately fatal, foolish blunders yet, as one of the guides who led Krakauer to the bus where Chris died says, \\"Living in the interior bush for an extended period, subsisting on nothing except what you hunt and gather--most people have no idea how hard that actually is. And McCandless almost pulled it off.\\" What I am left with is immense respect for a man who was not only idealistic and filled with a vision and a mission but the determination to do whatever it took and make any necessary sacrifices in order to manifest his vision. Even in the last photo he ever took of himself, holding up a farewell note, he wears a triumphant expression of accomplishment and serenity. How many of us can say, as Thoreau did, that he lived life deliberately, his own life rather than someone else's version of it?
0553801473|2.0|Most of the reviewers are great fans of GRRM, and even book number IV made them tired, they did not dare to use the \\"b\\" word when describing the \\"Dance\\".<br />But I will do it:<br />\\"A Dance of Dragons\\" is a boring book.<br />I have been reading this book for two weeks and I am on page 298. I need probably three more weeks to complete my reading. And please note that I needed just one week to read each of the first three books. It looks like the author spent last five years enjoying his status and his money, and lost the ability to create an interesting story.<br />And also,<br />maybe because of the dramatic action and vivid characters presented in the recent HBO serial, this book is so painfully slow and boring.<br />When the six volume is available (probably in 5 to 10 years), I will read the reviews first, and then, maybe buy the book.
1579125549|5.0|I had this book for about 3 years now.  I used it to practice pattern recognition of successful checkmates.  Though it is not clear to some readers, the book is didactic: arranged in an increasing level of difficulty, and emphasizing discovery lerning vs. expository pattern recognition. However, to get the benefit of the increased complexity of pattern recognition in checkmating, you would have to go through the whole book.  I have done it several times by solving few problems on a daily basis -I put the book in my personal library, i.e. m restroom  :)

B003ELOQD4|4.0|Having gone to the actual U2 Rose Bowl concert in 2009, it was inevitable that I would pick up this Blu Ray of the concert.<br /><br />The quality of the concert is very beautiful.  The lighting and special effects through were done very well. I loved the use of the blues and reds throughout.  The sound is good, but better when the volume is turned up with the surround sound.<br /><br />The extras are great.  You get 3 music videos from their \\"No Line on the Horizon\\" album along with the makings of, various concert clips from other cities, and other web based goodies.<br /><br />I will say though my only grip with the concert Blu Ray was having actually been there, I was a little disappointed that the songs were edited out of order.  When initially starting the film, \\"Get on Your Boots\\" started to play, and my reaction was that of \\"That wasn't what they played first....\\"  I did enjoy the overall presentation though, despite songs being out of order.  I also didn't like how the beginning was edited.  The crowd shots were nice, but I was disappointed with the fact that they didn't keep the original opening of the band making it to the stage while David Bowie's song \\"Ground Control to Major Tom\\" played.  It is on the extas, but it would've been nice to add that in.  They also maybe should've added the actual Youtube video in the extras.<br /><br />Overall this was a great Blu Ray and it still was able to bring me back to that night.
0385736002|3.0|I have not fully decided how much I liked \\"The Alchemyst\\" I most likely won't know until I have finished the second book. I have read many reviews that said that the writing is awful and there isn't enough of Mr. Flamel. I feel that the story doesn't really center around the Alchemist so much as the twins, but he is there and present throughout the story, the twins are an important focal point though (at least in this book). There is a lot of mythology in the story, but as much as I love all mythos, I am not all that familiar with Irish mythology which what is present in `The Alchemyst'. The writing was ok, it wasn't horrible but I'm sure it could have been better. I am shocked at how many typos or errors were present, especially since this is a `popular book' with some funding behind the editing. I actually think that this book was a pretty good read, I always like seeing history kind of rewritten to fit worlds created by authors. The legend of the Flamels has fascinated so many for years; this story was an interesting twist to that old legend.
B005DN7W4G|5.0|I actually really liked this movie, it kept my heart racing, it kept me glued to the screen the whole time, and made me actually care about what would happen to the characters.
0307913090|5.0|Gripping reader
0142000671|4.0|Of Mice and Men was a fairly good book. I just read it for my Honors English 9 class for my reading list over the summer, and I knew pretty much what was going to happen since my sister read it a few months ago for her English 9 class, but it was still a very good read. There were parts in the story that at first i didn't understand why that needed to be in the book, but they are actually really important in the overall story and they help to understand why certain things are happening.    Everyone who worked at the farm didn't really know what was wrong with Lenny, but they still accepted him for who he was and didn't judge, so that made me wonder what it would be like if everyone was like that now. There is always someone who has to be a jerk and try and ruin someone's life, and in this book it was definitely Curley. Everyone was fine with Lenny until the end when they realized what he could do, and then they took things way overboard.    If you're planning on reading this book, then I strongly suggest having some tissues with you at the end.
0307272702|5.0|According to Gary Taubes, the author of \\"Why We Get Fat and What To Do About It\\", the answer is yes. But understanding why insulin resistance makes me fat requires some deep thinking, at least for a lay person such as myself. Taubes says that most of us have the cause and effect of obesity reversed. We don't get fat because we consume more calories than we burn, but rather we consume more calories than we burn because we get fat. Said another way, calories that are stored in fat are unavailable for burning for fuel, so we need to eat more calories and/or move less to offset those lost calories in the fat.    Ok, what is insulin resistance and how does it make me fat? Here's my interpretation of Taubes' hypothesis.    When I eat a meal, the carbohydrates are broken down into glucose and enter my bloodstream. Glucose, a form of sugar, causes my blood sugar to increase. Since high blood sugar is toxic, my body instantly responds. First, any fat in my meal isn't immediately used for energy. Rather, it is shuffled to fat storage, at least temporarily, until the high blood sugar is reduced. I temporarily get a little fatter. Second, my pancreas secretes the hormone insulin. The secretion of insulin is in direct response to the increase in blood sugar. Insulin's job is to tell my body's cells to take in this glucose from the blood stream to reduce my high blood sugar.    Muscle cells will take in this glucose and burn it for energy and store some for future fuel as glycogen. Liver cells store some as glycogen and convert some to fat. Fat cells convert the glucose to fat for storage. As the cells in my body use up the glucose in my blood, the blood sugar will drop, and so the insulin will also drop. As the process occurs, fat is released from my fat cells so that they can be burned for fuel in place of the reduced glucose levels. I temporarily get a little leaner. My fat cells are acting as a temporary buffer for energy until my body deals with the toxic sugars.    Understanding the mechanism for how insulin communicates with my body's different cells is the key to understanding how I get fat. Insulin works through two enzymes on the cell: lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and hormone sensitive lipase (HSL).    LPL is on the outside of cell membranes and pulls fat from the bloodstream through the cell membrane. In muscle cells, this fat is used for fuel. In fat cells, it is simple stored and makes the cell fatter. LPL does its job by breaking up the fat from a triglyceride form (glycerol + 3x fatty acids) into individual fatty acids. When insulin is secreted due to high blood sugar levels, it activates LPL on fat cells resulting in fat being diverted from the bloodstream to the fat cells. Conversely, insulin suppresses LPL on muscle cell, so these muscle cells cant burn fat for fuel, but rather the muscle cells will burn the gluclose from the bloodstream to lower my blood sugar level.    HSL breaks down triglyceride fat in the fat cells into their individual fatty acids. Unlike the large triglyceride fat, the fatty acids are small enough to go through the fat cell membranes to be liberated into the bloodstream and eventually used for fuel in muscles. Insulin suppresses HSL. When insulin is secreted due to high blood sugar, it doesn't allow the HSL to liberate fatty acids so muscle cells need glucose for energy. When the blood sugar levels drop and insulin drops, then HSL activates the release of fatty acids into the bloodstream to be used for fuel by the muscles.    The reason why some of us seem to fatten more easily is that our body's muscle cells are less sensitive to insulin. Said another way, some of us are insulin resistant. And the reason why some of us fatten as we grow older is that our muscle cells become less sensitive to insulin. When our muscle cells are less sensitive to insulin they do not adsorb glucose as readily from the bloodstream. This makes our blood sugar levels higher which makes us secrete more insulin. More insulin secretion activates more LPL on fat cells so that they accumulate more fat. More insulin secretion suppresses more LPL on muscle cells so that they will not burn more fat. More insulin secretion suppresses HSL in fat cells so that fatty acids are not released for fuel. With more insulin secretion more calories will be stored as fat, fewer calories will be available to fuel the rest of the body, the more we will eat to replace those lost calories in the fat (or become more sedentary) and the fatter we will get.    Insulin resistance leads to metabolic syndrome, which is a condition with several signs besides fattening, including high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low HDL levels, glucose intolerance (trouble controlling blood sugar) and becoming sedentary (from caloric drain into fat tissues).    Taubes argues that there is a way to break this cycle. Reduce the quantity of carbohydrates and improve the quality of the carbohydrates in a meal. These two factors drive insulin secretion and the accumulation of body fat. Not all foods that contain carbohydrates are equally fattening. The most fattening carbohydrates are the ones that have greatest effect on blood sugar and insulin levels. The glycemic index is a measure of how our blood sugar responds to certain foods. If the glycemic index of food is minimized, then the secretion of insulin and fat stores is minimized. Foods with high glycemic index include refined flour (bread, cereals, pasta), liquid carbohydrates (beer, fruit juices, sodas) and starches (potato, rice, corn). Leafy green vegetables are an example of low glycemic index foods. They have more water and digestable fibers that make up their weight. They have low concentrations of carbohydrates.    My only criticism of Taubes' book is that it is easy to get lost in his argument against \\"calories in, calories out\\". He argues consistently that a positive caloric balance (eating more, moving less) is not the reason why we get fat. This seems illogical, and it is at face value. Taubes' argument is merely that a positive caloric balance is a side effect of getting fat, not a cause. The real cause for fattening is the loss of calories to fat cells caused by high insulin levels from too many carbohydrates in our food. An appreciation of this book requires an open mind and patience to follow a unique point of view.

Really glad it worked out for her in the end. Too bad the author died suddenly after he finished the third book, he might have gone on with more of her adventures. I really enjoyed all three books.

B005DC68NI|5.0|I honestly believe this book is a must read for any writer, whether you've considered self-publishing or not.  Very thought provoking.  Gaughran has obviously done his homework and really knows his stuff.  I learned quite a few new things and felt thoroughly inspired.    Well written, intelligent, and with just the right touch of humor.  The section on \\"how to\\" is invaluable and the section on \\"why\\" is an eye opener.
0312330537|5.0|For those of you who are seeking a virtual reality in a book, this is it.  Shantaram is engrossing, educational, very detailed and at the same time, fast-moving, and exquisitely written.  Every night that I climb into bed and pick up my book, I'm in Bombay.  I can smell it, I can see the images, I can feel the fear, and the community of love, respect and support in the slums.  I haven't finished the book yet, but I know I'll be at a loss when I do.  A must-read.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I already have a canon backpack and recently bought this one. Comparatively this one is good. I have accommodated the following things inside. 1) Canon EOS REBEL T1i, Canon 100-400L IS USM, Canon 100MM L IS USM, Canon 50MM, Canon 18-55 Kit lens and a Vivitor Flash. It is very comfortable and still it has enough place for a lens. Overall I liked it very much.
B004XIQIPQ|4.0|It's actually a really good album. I remember this band and all the hype a few years ago straight out of England. Were they worth all the hype? Absolutely not. That being said this album is really solid and I enjoyed it straight through.
B00004YTIQ|2.0|This cover is far too big for the smaller model of pool for which it claims to fit.  Also, the system by which it is secured to the pool is nearly pointless.  It amounts to nothing more than cutting your own lengths of the provided rope and trying to slide it under the pool, which is virtually impossible when it's full of water.  I'm not very happy with it, but I guess one can't ask too much from a $20 pool with $15 cover.
B00518HBD0|4.0|With this band you kinda of know what you are going to get. It's not absolutely ground breaking, but it follows a simple formula. Theres always that 3 Doors Down sound thrown in. It's a good album, but I feel like all their albums are starting to sound similiar. This could be my last album from them that I buy. Thats not to say they have a bad album because they don't. Plus their packaging is always cool.
0553801473|1.0|a Feast for Crows was about the characters you didn't want to read about, a Dance with Dragons has all your favorite characters, but you don't care about what they do. First of, I like his work, the first three books where about the best I have read in a long time I even was willing to forgive the meandering nothingness of AFFC but here we are at book five of a supposedly 7 book series and George RR Goodkind has just doubled the cast with a myriad of until now unknown characters.<br /><br />Many pointed this out but if you combine AFFC and ADWD and edit it down by 50% you actually get a decent novel that I would even call on par with the earlier books, but if you have to wade through the muck of a description of the menu of every, Inn, brothel and winesink in Westeros and beyond it gets old quick. For instance why follow Cersei scheming her way into trouble in AFFC and then have her show up for two chapters. These two chapters alone would have redeemed AFFC whereas here they just appear out of place, same thing with Brienne. Instead of doing this stupid cliffhanger in AFFC show her cut the bargain and give her one more chapter and then finish. Imagine AGOT ending with Dany walking into the fire, not the morning after.<br /><br />And that gets me to the cliffhangers, every single chapter throughout the book seems to have one of these silly contrived cliffhangers whenever something happens, it is an annoying TVesque plot device, the tool of the desperate writer, all that's missing is put in a few ads between the chapters to make it complete.<br /><br />This is poor writing obviously influenced by the HBO series, he has lost his way and I lost interest in this series, I really don't care enough to keep intersted and to wait another 5-7 years for the next installment. I'm checking out of this one...
1439190275|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  By following the advice stated in \\"The New Atkins For A New You\\" it helped me lose that 10 pounds I have been wanting to lose and it only took me a short time to lose that weight. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn a new way of eating to get rid of that extra weight they have been wanting to lose.

1563523302|5.0|I finished this book in 1 month (I'm super slow reader). Overall, it explains the value of saving, frugality, and so on.  This is quite interesting since you are not taxed on the money you keep, only the money you make.    This book focuses on Average Joe American who saved up to $1 -$5 million on a single income. Usually of Self-employed or entrepreneur.  This is not a get rich quick, this is Statistical information on how regular millionaires think and live daily.
B004LWZWEC|5.0|Long time AC/DC collector here! i have had this on vhs & had a kinda a bootleg dvd of this that was dark & had alot of grain in it. what can i say? One of AC/DC's best recorded live show's on dvd for the first time.this should have been done year's ago. But they did it right so maybe there was a reason for the wait.The only thing i think they should of done is this has allway's been one song short of a full concert.they never put t.n.t on the movie i have audio of it so you know they have the video for it. i meen they could of put t.n.t in the extras but other wise great live movie from a great live band.
142311339X|5.0|Just finished Lost Hero, this is my favorite, it has action suspence and a great story to boot.  On a personal note I have given up reading authors like patterson, deaver, and palmer.  Because of the language they use in their books.  So from now on I am going back to what got me into reading, sci-fy and fantasy, with stories form R.A. Salvatore and of Rick Riordan.
0316056863|5.0|This book caused me nothing but headaches....from laughing soooo hard!!  I was literally crying many times while reading and could not put it down.  I have been recommending it to anyone and everyone however I do know that it will be perceived differently by different people.  I love that Tina Fey writes just as she talks, it was almost as if she was sitting there reading it to me.  I love her sense of humor and how she is more than willing to laugh at herself.  Has she lived some over the top amazing life? No. But she does have an awesome job and seems to love and appreciate life and expresses it in a fantastic way.    My only warning would be to not read this if you are somewhere you don't want to draw attention to yourself.  Laughing out loud in public when you are alone is a guaranteed way to receive some weird looks.
B00002SSKI|3.0|I was following three Nicholas Sparks stories, !. A Walk to Remember, 2. Now and Then, 3. The Notrbook.     As to # 1;  The book is extremely well done in the classical style of literature,  a compelling innocent romance of    high school players involved in a high school play with an ominous threat (girls health}.  As a bookk it is as \\"G - rated\\" if books were so     rated  but that does'nt hurt it at all.      But some one involved in producing the movie version in the first half went crazy!  Street mobs, car wrecks violence at the waterfront   prevent any resemblance to the book!.   This improved a little in the second half somewhat but the story was already ruined.                               My advice, just read the book and that's all.                                                                  Sorry, from a senior citizen reviewer
0553582038|5.0|This is the best of the Song of Ice and Fire novels, mainly because the stalest characters are set aside for the majority of the book. It also contains what is, for my money, the best character arc in the series. It's unfortunate that the sequel undoes this volume's most beautiful work.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I sincerely believe that reviewers should be more honest and simply decline to write about films that they don't understand because the only problem with this film is that some people just don't get it.     They only see the gun-bearing hot girls in anime-like clothes and automatically assume it's a brainless visual feast. Well, it IS a visual feast but it's WAY more than that, and by the way, the hot girls CAN act. The problem is that many people are not accustomed to use their brains during films. If it is outside the formulaic storytelling structure that most films use, it's automatically considered bad.     Sucker Punch isn't a film to be simply watched. Like  many works of art it has to be experienced, felt. One reviewer wrote on the web that the director didn't know where he was going, which couldn't be farther from the truth. The whole movie works much like all fables, through the use of metaphors you see a character undergoing some hardship so as to teach us useful lessons in the end, and for those who missed it, the point, or if you prefer, the moral of the story, is clearly stated in the last narration, and this one is particularly aimed at those who are down, depressed and feeling like the whole world is against them. Kudos to Mr. Snyder.
0553801473|2.0|This book is a real drag. The Slave Bay faux-exoticism was tolerable when it came in small doses, but a book dominated by it makes for a grueling read. It takes the first half of this book to catch all of the less interesting characters up with the storyline from the previous book. Very little goes on during this time, however. Just angst and indecision - 500 pages worth of it. The second half of the book is about ten times better, and the last quarter has some genuinely exciting moments. It would take a lot more to make up for the slog that is the first half, though. It doesn't help that Martin has become extremely predictable. Setups are dangled before the reader and then dashed to the ground (does anyone fall for the prospect of the good guys winning even a small battle anymore?), characters are wantonly killed and then resurrected so often that all of the deaths in the book lose their impact. Introducing a character and then killing them before they can do anything worthwhile has become tiresome, as well. I'm sure that I'll still pick up the next book when it comes out, but I won't have much in the way of expectations.

B005D9MUWY|2.0|I downloaded on the day it was free. Then my ATRIX got a system update, now it is not shown as installed.  Now my keyboard is some sort of odd mixture of Swift Key X and stock MOTOBLUR. Very unusual indeed.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|First of all this is considered a young adult series. It is aimed to the tweens/teens and 20 somethings. So keep that in mind when you are scoffing at the pop references and dialogue. The author is establishing some familiarity and recognition to our current \\"pop' culture. Kids (people) like and need to identify with in some way or another.<br /><br />Second, I read a lot of books. I have read a lot of terrible books that were edited and written poorly. I just don't see it with this series. There are a couple mistakes on the kindle version but it was easy enough to let them go and read the books for what they were. Again, I don't see the validation in saying these books were written \\"terribly\\" enough for people to stop reading them. It seems a little excessive. To each there own.<br /><br />That being said.. I am 36 and thought these books were a hoot. I started  this book and kept going, one right after another.<br /><br />I love how he intertwined real characters from history and made them into real and believable characters. The story is a little out there but hey, it is about magic and immortals and 7 headed sea monsters!<br />The imagery and imagination it provokes is just a really fun time. I even enjoyed the fact that there was no swearing or sexy stuff or even excessive violence, it's full of drama, mystery, battles and suspense and stands on its own without them.<br /><br />My only criticism is that he does introduce A LOT of characters, by the end its a little frustrating because he switches between times, worlds and characters quite a bit. However, it didn't make me like it any less.<br /><br />Books of the series in order<br />1. The Alchemyst<br />2. The Magician<br />3. The Sorceress<br />4. The Necromancer<br />5. The Warlock<br />6. The Enchantress (coming 2012)<br /><br />I loved these books. They were a great casual read.

Four awesome books for the price of a DVD, you just can't beat it. And again, the books are amazing. Be warned though... they're at least 800 pages each, and once you start one you won't be able to put them down. Plan your life accordingly.

B0037YOMWS|3.0|I've been interested in getting a financial calculator for awhile. Was hopeful that HP got it's act back together after their recent string fiascos (Read the reviews of the 17BII+ as an example).      As soon as I opened the package and manual, I tried to set it up for RPN mode since that's what I'm used to. I scrolled to the menu item and pressed the \\"input\\" button to change from algebraic to RPN. Nothing happened. Read the manual again. Pressed the button, could feel and hear it click but no change. I pressed harder and finally it registered. Great, a non-responsive button on a brand new product. After pressing a few dozen times, it seems to have loosened up a bit and works better now. But I noticed that it also sticks once in awhile. In other words, one press can end up acting like two presses in series.     I believe I have a defective unit and will ask for an exchange but if the next one has sticky or non-responsive buttons, it goes back and no third chances for HP.     I have a  still working HP15C scientific I bought back in 1985!. Made in Corvallis, Oregon and sold for about eighty bucks, it's case was lost sometime in 1987 and judging from the scratch marks, one can tell that it has been \\"abused\\" through college and several jobs.     Now I'll bet some bright MBA came to the conclusion that you just can't grow your business if your product is going to last 26 years. So naturally, they should just sell crap that needs replacing within a few months. Yeah, get a new HP during every Back to School sales event. It just maintains the impression that products \\"Made in China\\" have a long way to go before they earn the same reputation for quality as those of some other nations.    Oh and manufacturing issues aside, several design annoyances should be brought up. I understand that this is primarily meant to be a financial calculator and it's great that the basic finance functions have their own dedicated buttons and appear to work fairly efficiently. But the %change function has its own dedicated button as well. You think it would be a simple matter (like on my 15C) of entering say 100, then 120 and pressing the %change button to get 20% as the increase. No! Another dimwit at HP decided that the \\"proper approach\\" is to have you enter the % change \\"mode\\". Then scroll up to the initial value, input it, then scroll down to the final value, input that, then scroll back to the %change display, and FINALLY, press = to get your answer. Sheesh!
0553801473|5.0|GRRM has delivered another epic volume in the best fantasy series around today (or perhaps ever).  It's at times grim, funny, exciting, scary, and everything in between.  We discover new lands and cities that previously were only dots on the map.  The prior storylines are expanded and advanced, while secrets are revealed - - - and new questions raised.  There are some cliffhangers that make me want to through the book across the room in disgust as I imagine the long wait for the next volume; but the journey is might fine.  Some of Martin's most beautiful writing, and the return of his most important characters after they were largely absent from \\"A Feast for Crows\\".  Epic in scope - unpredictable - extraordinary.  George R. R. Martin is the master of the fantasy epic.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I am very happy with this product! I hate when I buy used dvd's and the disks are all nasty or scratched, so I was extremely happy to open up the package and have three clean disks that work. The case had very light wear to it and was exactly what I was looking for. This is the first purchase I have made on Amazon, and it definitely won't be my last!
B00127RAJY|4.0|So I may be a bit premature in writing this review as I've only been doing level 1 for a little over a week, but I did want to share that, so far, I really enjoy this video.  I actually received this as a Christmas gift two years ago and it's been sitting on my shelf collecting dust along with a few other Jillian DVDs and a Jackie Warner DVD.  I decided that after finishing grad school, I'd make working out my new hobby since I had more free time.  I compared the descriptions of 30 day Shred and Personal Training with Jackie: Power Circuit Training and decided on 30 Day Shred because the 3 20-minute sessions sounded very doable.      I honestly didn't think I would struggle with the 1st level, but I guess I was much more out of shape than I thought.  It kicked my butt and I was pretty sore the next day, but it was sore in a good way.  I took a day off from the video the next day and just went speed-walking then resumed the 1st level everyday since then.  I do rest on Fridays though.    I have to say that Jillian is very much my style.  I really have a hard time with Yoga and Pilates because they're just soooo slooooow moving that I start to get very bored and frustrated.  The instructors can also be pretty annoying with their plastic cheer.  For me, Jillian's personality totally works and I always find myself smiling and giggling to myself as she coaches me along through the video.  There were times when I was thinking, ugh, I am dying!!!!  But then Jillian would say, \\"I know you feel like you're dying, but you have to push through....you don't get abs like this without working for them\\" or \\"I know you want to turn the DVD off and just quit, but DON'T do it, push through!\\" or \\"this workout will save you hours in the gym, all you need to do is give me 20 minutes!\\"...stuff like that.      I'd read some reviews about people feeling as though she were putting them down while doing the video or her being negative - I DID NOT get that at all.  I actually think she is great.  I need an instructor that provides firm encouragement.  I don't like Disneyland encouragement.  I want someone who's real - a real broad telling me to suck it up and keep going cause the results will be worth it!    Love, love, love this DVD and can't wait to try out the 2nd and 3rd levels.     Just a personal note: I actually planned to do this before work in the mornings since it's only 20 minutes, but found that the last thing I want to do after this workout is sit at my desk for 8 hours since I feel pooped after the video.  So I just do this after work and it's really helped me with my insomniac tendencies.

B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|So,how is The Walking Dead. Well, it's quite good realy. Now if you read the graphic novel be prepared for some liberal departures from the source material. There is alot that made it into the show from the graphic novel but much is close but slightly different. At other times entire episodes are simply fabricated out of thin air. Enough, about that though let's get down to brass tax.    It's made for TV so don't expect Hollywood special efects with a Hollywood price tag. That being said not every zombie is all that great but at times they are down right spot on. Lets not forget we are talking about an end of the world zombie apocaolypse with roving hordes of extras made up to look like the undead. Most shows to attempt this would skimp on the budget and fall flat. Not the case with The Walking Dead it largely delivers.    Violent. It is at times very violent. Fire axe to the melon complete with messy splatter. Yep, that's in there.    That Walking Dead is not a never ending canabalistic splatter fest. It's about humans pushed to the limit and all the best and worst of our nature: the brave and the cowardly, the merciful and the cruel, hope and despair, friendship and loss.     The acting is solid on almost every account. A couple of characters are a bit thin. (Maybe they will be zombie fodder in Season 2.) The writing is good as well. No idiots going off to look for noises in the woods at night stuff.    So, effects are good, violent, has a soul, decent characters, avoids being too campy, and it's the end of the world with zombies.     I'm in! If you like zombies then you should be too. If not well, I think there is like 50 vampire shows on. So....yeah.....have fun....with...that.
B004LWZW4C|1.0|Ok, it's certainly not as bad as X3 and magneto and Xavier are very good in both acting and character.  Other than that, this movie is thinner than the blu Ray it will be printed on.  We all undertand that the original Xmen MUST include cyclops and Jean grey right? I mean this movie is based off the Xmen comic or no? Well instead you get   Havoc- zero motivation, depth, heroics or even a nod to his lineage  mystique- who is now part of the xmen, young, and seemingly only thrown into the mix because she's blue like beast.  Banshee- no accent, depth or motivation  firefly stripper- please god.  Darwin- see above.  And poor beast looking as cheesy as possible and I guess thrown in as a nod to singers beast quote in x3 about his jacket, why does he correctly get added to the first class but not the other MAIN CHARACTERS to the source that your BASING THE MOVIE OFF OF??!!    Now I'll never understand how keeping slight continuity between the original films means forgetting about the most important characters, but at least it's got some good villans right?  A nightcrawler rip off and a wind guy? Ok... But at least Kevin bacon as Shaw was ok even though shaws only purpose is to bring about the phoniex.... Oh wait. Ok so at least his powers look cool ( weeping softly)    In all honesty, I was so excited to see an xmen movie. Instead I got a teenage Anxt movie with GOD AWFUL buffy comedy moments, terribly weak and out of place characters, action and powers we've seen done better in every other movie and tons of cold war exposition that was so bad and out of place I could only shake my head.  Yes Xavier and magneto are good throughout, but that's not enough reason to destroy another Xmen movie.   Oh yeah, and thanks for the wolverine cameo to remind me of what I actually wanted to see but couldn't because you made \\"saved by the bell xmen first class\\"
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is the best book that James Rollins has written to date. He has everything in it. Witchcraft, Shaman's, knights Templar, religion, history and lots of science.<br /><br />I was thoroughly engrossed in this book so much that I was sad when it ended. I had to force myself to stop reading this book at 2AM in order to get some sleep.<br /><br />The title lets you believe that devil worship was a factor. IT WAS NOT. As I said, it is a bad title. It should have been called \\"The Fourteenth Colony\\".<br /><br />Can you imagine the intrigue that goes into this book when you bring Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and the Sigma force into this arena?<br /><br />Once you start this book you really won't be able to stop, especially if you are interested in history and untold facts.<br /><br />I can only say, that this book will be hard for James Rollins to beat. Fantastic reading.

B004ZZS4CC|3.0|The story had me hooked from the beginning, and I finished it in just 2 sittings. She does go into detail about the unimaginable things that were done to her, but I thought she would have given more detail about the living conditions and how she raised her two children in that environment.  She mentioned she has a hard time remembering the details but there are some instances were I think more detail is needed.  Not in the sexual acts but more about being pregnant or those first few weeks of motherhood.  Many things were glossed over, but there are pages upon pages of writing about the animals that she kept. Overall I would say you should read it, but it's not for the faint of heart since she does go into detail about the sexual acts. I skipped over most of the animal journals.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|To imagine - even for a moment - what this brave girl/teenager/woman did to survive...it humbles me. Truly humbles me.    This is an incredibly strong, intelligent, resourceful woman who, despite living through what could only be called Hell on Earth, managed to provide a loving home for her children and never lose sight of her inner self. She is the embodiment of true power and unbreakable will. Proof that love and light will always prevail.    There is so much I'd like to say, but words fail me.     Dear Jaycee, may you and yours be blessed.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|From the first book, I fell in love with the story and the characters.  I read all 4 books and avidly awaited the 5th.  Unfortunately I was disappointed in Dance with Dragons. NOTHING is resolved, NOTHING is laid to rest. And now, I'm left knowing I'll need to buy another book, if not more, just to see how this story resolves itself and what happens to the characters we've come to know and love.<br /><br />Seriously....if J.R.R. Tolkien can write an incredible and amazing story about the Lord of the Rings in three books (4 if you count The Hobbit)...one would think George R.R. Martin could wrap it all up in the 5th book.<br /><br />Come on George....finish up the story of the Game of Thrones and start another series I can sink my teeth into and love.  I know you've got more than one story in that creative and talented mind of yours.

B0000524CY|5.0|I was 14 in 1973 when I went to see this film in Manhattan.  It was all the buzz and I had already read the book.  So I knew what to expect, right ?  NOT !!  I was not prepared for what my eyes would see.  I was terrified and deeply affected in more ways than one.  I actually wanted to leave right in the middle of it, but my friends held me back.  I tell you no lies when I say that for over two weeks, I couldn't get a decent nights sleep.  I just saw that face in every dark corner of my room.  I couldn't stop thinking of her, the mom, the priests, the priests mom, jeez it was something else.  It was 1973 and no one had seen anything quite like this before.<br /><br />If you've done the math, you know my age now and let me say that I will still NOT watch this movie alone.  I just can't.  I was psychologically attacked by this movie and it will always be the one that scared me half to death.  The one I'm still afraid of.  The one where that damned creepy tune with the bells got inside my head and wouldn't leave.<br /><br />I've seen hundreds of horror movies, but none have ever affected me like this one. A movie, Pefectly Executed.
B004A8ZX2I|4.0|Liam Neeson. He took the charactor in the film \\"Taken\\" that was so effective, reversed it, and still made himself a winner in \\"Unknown.\\" I found this film to be a throw-back to the classic spy genre while also holding on to the early cinematic touches of evil lurking around every corner. The snow spattered world of Berlin Germany is where we enter a Dr. Harris (Neeson), who gets a good bump on the head as his taxi accidentally plunges into an icey body of water. The beautiful German actress Diane Kruger becomes his permanant lifesaver.                     Hospitalized, he then makes his way through the European streets after a four day coma seeking his wife (January Jones) whom he arrived with. It is then (without much thinking)the premise of the film is set. Dr. Harris is not recognized by his wife and his ID appears to be stolen. Many twists and turns play out with a surprising caldron of excellent actors who solidify the plot. Bruno Ganz plays a stately detective which is a period piece of it's own.                                           \\"Unknown\\" is extremely well filmed with harrowing car chases, relentless murderers and Hitchcockian imagery. Excellent on screen chemistry between Neeson and Kruger as they strive for survival against ruthless killers. An addendem is the German landscape that becomes a viseral peril. When the director bothered to put in a good old museum spy chase, I subconciously had to applaude. Frank Langella, in one the best roles I've seen him, plays badness like he owns it. Add unique flashbacks and some grand explosions for a spy thriller galore.       However implausible a storyline, the film is grounded enough to connect the realistic dots. The only slight detractor is the one on one chop/cut style fight scene between Neeson and his enemy toward the end. \\"Unknown\\" will one day reach the back shelf, but it's efforts at returning to the sneaky spies of filmdome are welldone.
0321344758|5.0|You could know nothing at all about Usability, and this book can make you proficient enough to run your own. It focuses on Web usability, but the ideas are the same no matter what you are studying.    You can read the whole book in a few hours - it's a highly useable book on usability; Krug pratices what he preaches.    There's nothing more to say on this - if you're in Usability, you should own this book and it's sequel: [[ASIN:0321657292 Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to Finding and Fixing Usability Problems]].    If you are not is Usability, but you need to do some Usability?    Forget other books - these are the ones for you.   They are the best beginers guides, and if you are a quick reader, you could spend a day reading both and be running tests the next.    The only criticism that I have about the book is that Krug does such a good job, that he makes Usability look easy.   The truth is... when you do it Krug's way - it IS easy. And unless you need formal tests, there are few arguements against doing it the Krug way.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|This is a very enjoyable collection of some of her best songs.  After listening to the words of each song, I realize how sensitive and open Adele is about speaking out publicly about the relationship. She does it with great expression and you can feel her emotions through each song. My favorites are \\"Set Fire to the Rain\\", \\"Lovesong\\", \\"Don't you Remember\\". I can't wait until her next album! I really like her voice, her musical style and the wonderful ballads. This album will not disappoint! This album is absolutely epic! I can count on one hand how many albums I can listen to all the way through, without skipping a track and Adele's song really inspires. This album is so personal and sincere that you can't help but be in love with it. I found out that the basis of the album was her hard break-up with her lover.

B0050KEVO6|2.0|the game is random and has little to do with logical choices. it also annoyingly asks for updates constantly. d+
B004EPYZUI|3.0|It's nice eye candy, especially if you like watching hundreds of people shot at close range in eye-popping color and all sorts of sordid near-rapes and so on, but in the end the acting and script are too hare-brained and harshly violent for this to be much fun.<br /><br />It's kind of a women-take-revenge-on-evil-men-flick, and there are some gorgeous CGI effects, but halfway through I was already ready for it to end. After a while it felt like the whole thing was just a set-up for selling the accompanying video game. It's a comic book, true, but even then one wants characters with more than comic book depth to them.<br /><br />And when the incredible effects almost always end up in brutal violence, it gets old and wearing pretty fast. Just because the violence is women killing men doesn't mean it isn't gratuitous. Is this the future? Women becoming as idiotic and blood-hungry as men? Wonderful.<br /><br />If you like watching women in lingerie shoot hundreds of evil men, this is your film.<br />If you like good movies? Not so much.
B003LDKUSK|4.0|This is a classic book that I've never forgotten since childhood. Very easy to read to children, and for them to learn how to read.
B003UESJHY|3.0|3.4 stars<br /><br />I enjoyed this film, but as with last year's wrestling flick with Mickey Rourke, I wasn't blown away as so many others were. First off, despite the accompanying making-of doc showing how much Wahlberg trained to be a believable fighter for this, I just don't buy him as a boxer of this calibre. He's too slow and just doesn't feel like a contender. I've watched fights since the early '70s and know a great fighter, or even a reasonable facsimile; Marky Mark ain't one of 'em. Even Will Smith as Ali was more believable.<br /><br />Second, Bale is good but once again I just couldn't buy him as the crackhead he's supposed to be. I live around a lot of crackheads, watch them walk by my place daily and have seen thousands come and go over the last decade...and Bale just don't pass. He feels like an actor, as does Wahlberg. And this feels like a film. Which is all fine, as they are actors and this is a film, but the cinematic revelation others describe here never happened for me.<br /><br />All in all, I wouldn't put this anywhere near the pantheon of great fight flicks like The Set-Up, Raging Bull and so many others. It's a good film, though throughly depressing despite the \\"happy\\" ending, and my main problem was not the acting or the decent direction, it was that I found none of these characters worth rooting for. They just weren't appealing on almost any level. Maybe that's just me, but in the end I need to like the hero or heroes, and here it wasn't happening.<br /><br />If you like the actors or boxing, you might like this, but I'd never watch it again.

The first third of it completely dragged...and what is this author's obsession with breastfeeding?  Must she mention it every single chapter???  I made myself finish the book out of sheer perseverance. The story did finally pick up, but man I had to stay really committed to get to that point.  My suggestion - still interested?  Save your $10 and get a copy from the library.

B0038M2AZA|5.0|Having worked in the livestock industry for a number of years, I was well acquainted with Grandin's work on animal handling. I'd also had a wonderful opportunity to listen to her talk in person. I only just recently watched this movie - somewhat afraid that the Hollywood glamour would not do the subject justice. Boy was I wrong. Claire Danes absolutely nailed this role. To the point where I, unlike usual, did not see the actress behind the role, I saw only Temple Grandin. Kudos to Danes for buying totally into the role. The movie itself tells the story of Grandin after she decides to further her education and her humiliations and triumphs in working her way into a redneck world that wasn't accepting of her at first. The fact that she has become so successful is a testament to the woman that Grandin is. This movie can only touch upon Grandin's life, but what is represented here is an eye-opener to those who believe that challenged people cannot become a success in this world. HIGHLY recommended to anyone, but in particular, those dealing with autism in the family.

B0050BEM1M|1.0|What a let down from the man who brought us Secrets and Lies, Vera Drake, Topsy Turvy and (from an earlier age) Abigail's Party. Gone is the tight dialogue, gone is the insight, gone is the sometimes almost unbearable honesty. \\"Another Year\\" is a dire and lazy 129-minute mess of a film that should have been cut by at least half an hour. Even that might not have saved it.      The movie is about an old couple, Tom and Gerri, a pair of two-dimensional supposedly intellectual characters who have enjoyed a comfortable life for decades in a nice part of London. In the words of Helen Fielding, they are \\"smug marrieds\\". They have a great time. But they have some friends who are not so fortunate. One is an alcoholic divorced co-worker of Gerri's who frets openly about her various lack of successes and another is an alcoholic friend of Tom's who has screwed up his life. They come for visits and are not so subtly put in their places. \\"You screwed up and we didn't. We're happier than you,\\" is the message.      Well goodness. Do we need more than two hours to tell us that some people are happier than others and that it can be tough being single and short of money as you start to realise the years are running out? No we don't. We need a lot more subtlety than that, since Leigh puts before us a brutal and boring scenario.      Did I say boring? Oh yes. It's boring, largely because the script is so hopeless lazy. Take this example:        GERRI  Don't do your back in.      TOM  I know. It doesn't get any  easier. Job for a younger man,  this.      GERRI  Joe used to love it here.      TOM  Did you speak to my son and heir?      GERRI  I left him a message on his answer-phone. (She plants a  plant.)      TOM  It's going to rain again.            Empty words that don't push the plot forward. Sure, real people speak like that, but that doesn't mean it's interesting. Here's another example:        TOM  You don't want a lift to the  station?      MARY  Oh, no, it's alright.      TOM  Are you sure?      MARY  Yeah, I'll be fine. I could do with a walk.      GERRI  Yeah.      MARY  Sorry about.... you know....      GERRI  It's okay.      TOM  It was good to see you.      MARY  Oh, thank you, Tom.      GERRI  Are you alright?      MARY  Yeah; you know... Had a bit of a  wild night, Joe. (Pause.) Well,  I'd best be off.        (After a few more minutes of blather)            TOM      Right. Ta-ta, then.      MARY  Yeah.... bye.     (She walks off.)      MARY      See you on Tuesday, Gerri.      GERRI  Bye, Mary. Take care!            Whatever happened to \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"OK, see you?\\"        Awful, just awful. I left the TV after an hour and from what my wife tells me, I missed nothing at all. What a disappointment.

B000063V8T|5.0|While not all of the episodes in Season 5 were greats, it has some of the best of the whole series. This series has some of the best morality plays on a wide range of subjects. \\"Disaster,\\" \\"Ethics,\\" \\"The Outcast,\\" \\"The First Duty,\\" \\"and \\"The Perfect Mate\\" show the TNG crew in emotionally charged and ethically challenging scenarios. Meanwhile, in \\"Ensign Ro,\\" \\"Conundrum\\" and \\"The Next Phase\\" we get to see the sassy Ensign Ro at her best. And finally, \\"Darmok,\\" \\"I, Borg\\" and \\"The Inner Light\\" are easily three of the best episodes of the entire season. \\"Darmok\\" and \\"I, Borg\\" take enemies and force viewers to revive their preconceived notions. \\"The Inner Light\\" is heart-wrenching in its ability to force Picard - and viewers - to to reevaluate their priorities in life. Sadly, the only real disappointments were the two-parters: \\"Redemption,\\" \\"Unification,\\" and \\"Time's Arrow.\\" The former two have too much of Sela, an half-baked idea to get Denise Crosby back into the show. Meanwhile, the whole 19th century time-travel story in \\"Time's Arrow\\" seems absurd. Despite these, Season 5 is proof that TNG was still going strong after 5 years.

0756404738|2.0|It took me several months to put my finger on why this book was so disappointing to me.  Here goes:  In TNOTW, Rothfuss set up an entirely different framework than he now seems to be working on.  In the first book, as Kvothe grew up and learned about his world, it looked like he was going to find some kind of ancient conspiracy that ties into his current situation.  This was set up in the present-tense of TNOTW, with  battle sequence where Kvothe kills off some spider monsters that seem to be magical killer drones, and there is a hint they must have come over the frontier where the war is going badly for the local king.  The main narrative recounts Kvothe's discovery of the Chandrian at about age 12.  In the big city of Tarbean, a bard sings the origin myth of their enemies, the Amyr, and is carted away by the soldiers of the priests of whatever the religion is, for heresy.  When Kvothe tries to learn about the Amyr or the Chandrian at the University, he is blocked every which way.  Every time that the story reverts to the present-tense frame for the extended flashback that makes up most of TNOTW, there is mention of a war going badly, and supernatural enemies massing just out of sight. Surely, I thought, there is some critical fact or set of facts being withheld from Kvothe in the past-tense story that will shed light on the kingdom's present-tense difficulties?    One aspect of the world of TNOTW was seeing that the religious/folk myths there are dangerously close to fact.  The myth of of a god chaining the devil to an iron wheel and burning with the devil as he holds him to the wheel is almost duplicated when Kvothe slays the dragon, using an iron wheel.  The Chandrian's sign is blue flame and decay, which Kvothe sees with his own eyes when his parents are killed, and again at the beginning of the dragon sequence.  In the University plotline, Kvothe is enabled to explain the chemistry of the Chandrian's signature blue flame.  It all looked like the major plot line was going to tie myth and fact together, and then the author would link the flashback story to the present-tense frame for that story. I was intrigued.  Surely Kvothe would sleuth this all out to learn . . . something critical.    Then book 2 is all about little feats and little accomplishments.  Kvothe takes a semester abroad, gets l**d, takes an intensive 8-week martial arts course that, like, changes him, totally, forever.  What do we learn about the king?  Nada.  The war?  Nada.  The religion and its tie to a group of priests that have their own soldiers? Nada.  The Amyr?  To be fair, a little.  The Chandrian? Nada. Oh, wait, a butterfly-eating monster on a tree tells Kvothe that he saw one recently, unaware.  Well, you have to admit that's almost nothing.  And the blue flame that we spent so much time and energy on in TNOTW does not appear when Kvothe is fighting the crypto-Chandrian.    There are lots of interesting stories in TWMF.  But none of them is directly connected to the plot line that appeared to be set up in TNOTW.  It's like a group of short stories set in the same world, as if Rothfuss published his Silmarillion before he got to The Dark Tower.  Look at the plot synopses of the two novels on Wikipedia, and you can see how disconnected the second book is from the first.  That's what bothered me.

B004CR5TD0|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best albums i have heard in a long time. With a sound so unique it is true that comparison does him no justice.    Saw him live recently which deepened even further my appreciation of his talent. The album is minimalistic and unexpected, yet so emotional and beautiful. James Blake successfully bridges the electronic and the soul.

0553801473|3.0|Major SPOILERS:<br /><br />Ok, I'm a fan, just love this series, and was even willing to cut some slack for the last book (Crows).  First of, Martin is a great writer so I'm not going to come in here and say this book was horrible.  Nevertheless, it was sure slow.  I cannot help but wonder if he either doesn't know how to end this thing, thus prolonging the story as much as possible, and/or the only big thing left is the battle with the Others and he is giving us a bunch of filler before that happens.  I mean I love to read about Tyrion but how long does it take for him to get to his destination, which now that I think of it, he never did.  Also, the whole Penny thing with the pig and the dog.  C'mon!!!!  Not my Tyrion.  That story line cheapened his character to me.  Yet, there were times Tyrion still made me laugh, like his self given name of \\"Yollo\\" and when he finally slipped the poison mushrooms that were in his socks for around 700 pages into the slave master Nurse's drink.  I love the Dragon Queen.  But the fact that she wouldn't leave Mereen was killing me.  I just kept waiting for that Dragon to come down and burn that whole city to hell so she could get out of dodge and move this story along.  Jon, great character, I enjoyed the chapters but I felt like he was caught in the middle of a book where not much was going on.  And no, he is not dead. No way.  I enjoyed the chapters dedicated to Theon Greyjoy very much.  I found myself supporting him and wanting him to kill Ramsay.  Of course, we never got there.  Finally, Arya, who is my favorite.  Only 2 chapters and nothing really happened.  I still enjoy how he writes about her.  Cannot wait to see what ultimately happens to her.  I guess what it comes down to is this.  I will be buying the next book when it comes out but I sure and the heck will not be waiting for it like I did Dragons.  I am now skeptical that Martin can get back to the level of the first three.

B004Y1USV2|3.0|As a life-long Yes fan, I had to suppress my anger at the band for replacing Jon Anderson with Benoit David in order to break down and buy this album. In my heart of hearts I have a very hard time accepting any incarnation of the band without Jon. Nevertheless, I approached Fly From Here with an open mind. I'm not exactly blown away, but neither am I completely disappointed. This is interesting, highly listenable music and a slick production, thanks to Trevor Horn, but it never soars the way you expect it to. Ultimately, it just didn't strike an emotional chord with me. I expect a Yes album to sweep me away to another place emotionally, which was certainly a defining characteristic of the band's greatest work from the early 70s. I would probably be more sympathetic to this effort if it had at least been an attempt to re-capture the commercial appeal of the band in the Trevor Rabin period, but this is an unabashed prog rock album. The problem is, there are contemporary bands making much better prog albums than this one, including some of the old guys like IQ and Marillion, not to mention newer bands like Porcupine Tree and Riverside. I would implore the band to bring Jon back into the fold. They need his lyrical genius and his vocal distinctiveness, and perhaps they could keep Benoit David to harmonize with Jon and Chris. In the meantime, these Yes-men have created a technically proficient but ultimately soul-less album. Is that really Yes?

B004SGWYW4|5.0|High School of the Dead turned out to be just as good with the english dub as it was in japanese when I first saw it last year. The Anime is violent, sexy and kick-ass. All the things you want in a good anime. (See \\"Corpse Princess: Volume One and Volume Two and Black Lagoon Volume One and Two and a third volume has been released in japanese, but no English dub yet.Last time I checked)<br /><br />Sentai Filmworks did a good job on the American release. The dubbing was dead on and the picture was perfect. And of course all the TV edited scenes were un-edited (is that a word?).<br /><br />It was hinted of a Season 2 verified at Comic Con 2011 panel. Hopefully Sentai Filmworks gets the project for American release.<br /><br />There is an OVA that was released with the 7th Manga issue.You can watch it on You Tube,among other places. Another quality DVD from Amazon.com<br /><br />UPDATE: 07/25/2013: For those of you STILL WAITING for the Second Season, Sentai says it's still coming. In the meantime, On August 6th (Pre-Order this from Amazon.com) Black Lagoon has a five episode third season coming out concerning a blood thirsty maid from the first season back again in 'BLACK LAGOON; ROBERTA'S BLOOD TRAIL'. Try that one out.
0307272702|3.0|This book wasn't what I thought it would be.  But don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking the scientific research that Gary Taubes brought to the forefront on the reason why low fat, high carb diets don't work.

B0041KKYEM|1.0|Ok, reviews were great, but did these people really view this movie. Honestly, the whole movie could have been summarized in about a 20 minute clip. Sorry for the spoiler, ballerina fights with her dark side that only she sees for the fight of perfection and in the end she kills herself to complete the perfect ending to being the principle. The only good scene is the girl on girl one. Even after skipping a few chapters the story line was still clear. Such a waste of money.
0739308742|3.0|This book focuses (mostly) on half of the characters in the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, their victories, and their travails. The pace is slower, and better as a cure for insomnia than an edge-of-your seat page-turner.    The best thing about this installment is, in my opinion, what other reviewers hate most - it's what was done with the audio version. Roy Dotrice narrated the first three \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" books, but for this one it is John Lee. Dotrice apparently is popular for his talent in characterizing each of this story's hundreds of characters, but those who want that in a \\"book\\" miss the point of books versus less intellectual media. You may turn to audio books to reduce eye strain and free up your hands for other activities, but that's no good reason to give up your imagination as well. I have used both my eyes and my ears as I took in this series, and Dotrice's characterizations have done as much to ruin the characters which I first read about. It also helps little that he sounds every bit as old as you would expect a dude named \\"Roy\\" to sound, with a voice which sounds too much like the torturous droning which I had to suffer through in school, while the 80-year-old \\"Septon\\" led the morning prayer.    What nobody else will credit John Lee for, I will. His voice is crystal clear, not the least bit difficult to understand at low volumes. His reading of \\"A Feast for Crows\\" sounds less like a cold read than any text-to-speech program, but he did a fine job at providing just enough characterization so that you can distinguish between the various characters in a scene, while leaving the rest for your imagination. Easy to follow, without hijacking your brain, therefore you get more of the benefit of actually reading the book. Too bad so many reviewers showed their illiteracy by complaining, enough that Dotrice was called back for the next book.

B001NHNG64|3.0|I thoroughly enjoy reading the Jack Reacher series but was overwhelmed by the number of typos in the Kindle version. Jack Reacher was referred to as Readier 62 times. Groupings of letters, meant to be words, also littered the book.  Punctuation errors also added to the challenge of this read.  I usually find a small number of errors in any book I read but this was overwhelming. If this was error-free, I might have given it 5 stars. I hope other Lee Child books don't share this lack of editing.

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Now here's a neat trick: using severed limbs as currency, see if   you can offer to pay off your mortgage/loan/overdraft at the bank.    This was a beautifully shot,neatly directed and edited film with   understated performances all round.   Lawrence's performance is a real stand-out - reminiscent to this   writer of Abbie Cornish in 'Somersault.' The landscape (both of  the film and the scenery) is breathtaking and whilst I understand  how some may feel this film stereotyped the good folk of the Ozarks,  I still won't have that place near my top 1,000,000 places to visit  anytime soon.  Whilst not nearly as gruesome as, say, 'Fargo' there was sufficient  blood-curdling footage to make me want to puke.  I could, perhaps, dump that on my bank manager's desk instead!
B003UESJHY|4.0|Based on a true story, `The Fighter' is the story of two brothers, Micky Ward (Wahlberg) and Dicky Eklund (Bale) who are boxing heroes around their home town of Lowell in the USA.<br /><br />Dicky is renowned for his past boxing career, but has fallen on hard times after becoming addicted to crack. Micky is his younger brother who wishes to emulate and surpass Dicky's success and make a name for himself and his family. Dicky's addiction overshadows his brothers chances of getting respected fights and when he ends up in prison it gives Micky the opportunity get a new support team and start to turn things around. But it is when Dicky finally gets clean, gets released from prison, makes amends with Micky and the family and rejoins his brothers team, that everything really comes together and things take a final upward spiral.<br /><br />This film has excellent performances from all involved and Bale and Wahlberg are exceptional as the main characters. Micky's girlfriend Charlene is a stabilising influence in his life and the actress who plays her is also really good. This film has a superb soundtrack with tracks by The Rolling Stones, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Whitesnake and way more besides, it really lifts certain scenes in the film.<br /><br />The fight scenes are well choreographed and make for a good mixture of tension and excitement and the director manages to make everything look authentic.<br /><br />It is hard to fully warm to some of the characters, but you always appreciate where they are coming from and the influence and impact they have in each others lives. This is a great story of perseverance and overcoming adversity to reach your dreams and for this alone it is quite inspiring. I admit I have seen better bio-pics of this type, but this is perfectly watchable and makes for just under 2 hours entertaining viewing. This well worth checking out at some point.<br /><br />Feel free to check out my blog which can be found on my profile page.
0470450266|3.0|This book goes through the step-by-step creation of a human sculpt in Zbrush in an instructional way (such as what brushes he uses moment to moment, what he moves and adjusts as he builds forms, etc).  If you are completely new to Zbrush and sculpting figures and want an instructional book that will read off exactly how to make an anatomy-based sculpt, step by step, then this book is for you.  If you are looking for a thorough yet concise study of form and anatomy from a digital sculpting context that isn't instructional and is more of an educational resource, then this book is not for you.      While there is some great anatomy info here, the majority of the book is dedicated to being instructional.  You will find yourself digging through the step-by-step material to find bits of anatomy information that is only lightly touched upon.  If you already know Zbrush and already have a workflow for sculpting (in my case using a variety of other programs) then the majority of this content will not be helpful to you, and if anything, will make getting any information very tedious.      I should also mention that most of the pictures are Zbrush sculpts, and many of those are WIP sculpts.  This is fine if you are looking for step by step sculpting reference, but is not enough if you primarily want to be thoroughly educated in anatomy information(there are some good references but there aren't enough, and they are scattered among WIPs).  Pretty much this isn't the 'classical anatomy educational resource for the digital artist' that I was hoping it would be; it's much more of a tutorial book, which is fine if that's what you are looking for (and I don't hold this against it), but in my case it wasn't what I needed.

B0000AQZYM|1.0|First, the product took much longer to arrive than I would have thought.  I ordered a different tape from a different source on Amazon 2 days AFTER I ordered Nemo, and that tape showed up days earlier.  I thought there must be a problem...that they had forgotten about my order or something, but was unable to track shipment or contact anyone from supplier or Amazon about late shipment.  Link supplied in order verification didn't work.  When the tape finally got here, the cassette itself was defective.  It made a grinding noise when played, then rewound grudgingly (making shrieking noises all the way) then ate the tape when ejected.  My Nemo loving kid was so upset I opened up the case and cut off the damaged part and put it back together myself.  If I rewind the tape on a different machine....just to a certain point, I can get the tape out without the tape being eaten.  I'll order another one from a different supplier.  It's too much trouble to send back on such a low cost item...even if I thought the supplier would be responsive. I would not recommend buying from this source.

1400079144|1.0|There are so many things wrong with this book, that it's easier to list what's right. Err... the book cover's pretty? Oh, and there were some interesting facts about freemasonry. That's about it, really. The characters are two-dimensional and most of the time prove themselves to be idiots, rather than scientists of high caliber (still can't get over the sms thing... it just so makes sense to believe that your missing brother suddenly learned how to send text messages and invited his very suspicious shrink to see a high security object).   The dialogues keep repeating themselves every 15 pages or so. Annoying. And then there's this whole noetic \\"science\\" issue which kind of turns the book into sci-fi, since it's so unbelievable.   The book ending... talk about anticlimatic. Good thing I rented the book instead of buying it. 2$ is exactly the right price for reading it.
B0006AVKW6|5.0|The other day, I received a question on facebook \\"Which scene do you like the best in the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's ?\\" At that time, I felt the desire to see this movie again shooting through my body. So I went to see it. The temptation to compare the movie to the original book entered my mind. So I read it in Japanese again too. It was an amazingly translated one by a famous university professor. Eventually, the desire to read the original book in English drove me to buy this book from Amazon.com.<br />This book throws deep questions to me about freedom. Holly Golightly's cat had no name. It was only called \\"cat\\". To have a name means to be identified; defined and stipulated as one concrete existence. It means to lose one's freedom in a sense. Holly avoided being restricted by something. So she printed on her card: Miss Holiday Golightly, Traveling. I could discovered a part of a song from the musical Oklahoma! which Holly sang on the fire escape.<br />Don't wanna sleep,<br />Don't wanna die,<br />Just wanna go a-travelin'<br />Through the pastures of the sky<br />Holly brings me an enigmatic expression: reds. Judging from the conversation with Fred at her home party, the reds mean the horrible mental status different from the blues. She says \\"No, the blues are because you're getting fat or maybe it's been raining too long. You're sad, that's all. But the mean reds are horrible. You're afraid and you sweat like hell, but you don't know what you're afraid of. Except something bad is going happen, only you don't know what it is. You've had that feeling?\\" Of course I don't know the expression \\"reds\\". I have never had the opportunity to feel the \\"reds\\". And this is why I have felt so extremely interested in this novel and its movie.<br />As for the movie Breakfast at Tiffany's, I admire the work of its production staff. They portray the important scenes and phrases of this original novel accurately and honestly. I heard that turmoil occurred after Audrey Hepburn wasappointed to the lead role Holly instead of Marilyn Monroe.<br />Though the scenario was rewritten in a short time, I recall the circumstances of the birth of the Magic Flute by Mozart, the movie conserves author's idea and wears sophisticated atmosphere. The song Moon River is just in the movie and a song from the \\"Oklahoma!\\" is more befitting to this novel.<br />My family loves this movie and my mother loved the Holly's hair style at the Forty-second Street public library and she delighted in adopting the same hair style for herself which she wore for her children.<br />I praise the genius of Truman Capote, I admire the work of its movie production staff and I express my thanks to Ms. Betsy Lewis of BOOK RESCUE LLC who searched this one for me running frantically to and fro between her book barns and gave me the opportunity to read this original novel.<br /><br />Victor Truemann, Japanese
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I finally decided to buy this book after reading its description and customer reviews a few different times on Amazon. I've picked books before with rave reviews only to be let down. I do not typically like futuristic or sci-fi types of stories. This book did not disappoint me! It exceeded my expectations. The futuristic element is there but it's not over done and didn't take away from the characters. I felt like the main characters were defined well and will capture your heart. The description of the \\"games\\" was great. As I read the book, it played out in my mind like a movie. It's fast paced, easy to read and hard to put down. I recommended it to two friends and they both loved it just as much. It's worth reading!

B002ZG975Q|1.0|More than transparent patronizing and ploy that should never come to screen.<br /><br />This really does not have any resemblance to the classic \\"Beauty and the beast\\" nor the T.V. program.  Basic story inartistic youth (Alex Pettyfer) is cursed by a snubbed witch to look like repulsive until someone tells him they love him. Naturally he starts changing attitude.  He protects a girl (Vanessa Hudgens) from her rough life and that adds to his recovery.<br /><br />I have a strange feeling that there will be a sound track.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00007L4I6 Beauty and The Beast: The Criterion Collection (Restored Edition)]]
B003UESJH4|5.0|I will watch any movie with Colin Firth. This film must have been his most challenging. It is truly a masterpiece. I rarely show emotion when I watch movies.  I can tell you exactly what will happen within the first two to three minutes (conflicts and conflict resolutions, etc).  I found myself trying to speak for him during the film, struggling along with him, embarrassed for him, and sharing in his pain and disappointment. Rarely am I drawn into a film as I was into this one.  Geoffrey Rush was the perfect supporting actor.  Absolutely perfect.  His facial expressions were perfectly choreographed.  They showed a softness with understanding which can only come from years of life experiences, while he also displayed a strength and unwillingness to be treated like any other employee of the royal family. I don't think they could have made a better casting call.  Helena Bonham Carter was wonderful as well. She was the lovely graceful cohesion between all of the characters.  I loved her poise mixed with humor in what could have been very awkward situations.  She behaved as we might wish all royals to behave, with grace, humor and warmth when interacting with the people she encountered. I will watch this movie anytime I feel the cards are stacked against me.

0671027344|5.0|I really had no idea how this book was going to be when I opened up the pages. The things I did know were a) it has over a million copies in print, so it's very popular b) it's told in letters to a completely unknown recipient c) there's going to be a movie and Emma Watson is going to be in it. That last one is what made me buy the book! I wanted to read it before the movie comes out. Like I said though I really had no idea what to expect, what I found was one of the most honest and unique narratives I have ever read.<br /><br />Charlie is worried about starting high school and to make himself feel better he starts writing letters to someone. That someone is never revealed throughout the story and I think that only adds to the atmosphere. Charlie is a very unique character. He very, very sensitive. I don't know how to explain it other than at first you get the sense that he has autism or at least some sort of mental health issue. As the story progresses so does Charlie and you really start to forget about his mental state. He definitely grows throughout the story too as he starts learning things about himself and making friends. He is shockingly smart. A genius, really. And he has no idea.<br /><br />There are times during the story when it is so easy to think of Charlie as a normal teenage boy, but then he will tell you a story from his past that will completely knock your socks off and make you realize all over again that this is a very troubled boy. A troubled, very endearing boy. He has went through so much and stood by as bad things happened, but you can't get mad at him for that. Instead it brought out a very protective feeling in me. I wanted to sit Charlie down and have a heart to heart with him.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|Allright, I bought these at Best Buy in May of 2010 and they were a great product overall. The sound was just what I needed and with the built in mic i couldn't go wrong. I'll just go into the problems I had with it for the time a spent using them...and the pros of course    IM A BAD SPELLER BTW(BY THE WAY)    The sound was above par indeed. I never owned a gaming headset but these have a PERFECT price range for what you get.  Comfort - I game for quite a long period of time. I can easily get a 6 hour session if not longer. With past experience with headphones in general I know that I have sensitive ear. About 4 hours into gaming i do feel some slight discomfort. The headphones seem to squish your head a tiny bit to much. I had  no problems with the top head cushion as well as the ear muffs. Both quite comfy, but if you gonna game hard and long (no pun intended) it might get annoying.  Sound - Im not the one to critteque sound but i can say that these were great, I could blast these in my ear with MINIMAL distortion. When the volume is turned extremely low, I did experience a slight hiss which is always annoying but when playing on a normal game volume, you wouldn't notice a thing. the volume controller is awsome also, being able to adjust the game and chat volume is just amazing. Hard to play without.    CONS - Allrighty, there are very few cons but there are some. One of them that started to aggrevate me soon after i bought them was the microphone. The problem was with the swing arm; it originally (kinda) snapped into position so it wouldn't move. But soon after with MINIMAL, and i mean MINIMAL amount of movement, the plastic inside pretty much just rubbed away and there is nooo snapping. And when i move it up/down it makes a \\"nails on a chalkboard sound\\". I just stopped moving it completely and kept it all the way down but it just felt cheap when it broke that fast.  Next one isn't a con, it's more stupidity on my part. DO NOT twist the earcup outwards. There isno leniency. it's hard to explain. Just don't take them off to fast. I broke mine when a raged haha.     Overall - Great Buy indeed. not a lot of money for what your getting
1878424319|4.0|Got a lot out of this book in terms of a new way of looking at myself, my life, and my responsibilities.    Most of the concepts here aren't new: there's a good deal of Buddhism, Kantianism, and Bushido/warrior philosophy, as well as how determination makes for good change.  However, its packaged together in a clear, direct way that I think has enormous appeal and gives a strong focus on change.    The book must be taken with a few grains of salt: the suggestion that someone can get cancer by believing a person who tells them they look like they have cancer is demonstrably untrue.  Certainly an unhealthy attitude can hurt one's health, but that's going a bit far.    Still, I can see this as hugely useful to those seeking a steady, clear-headed drive towards freedom and honesty.  It really helped me in a time when I was overreaching and of course facing disappointment with the results.    A final note: I read it out of order and I recommend reading it that way: I think its much more interesting trying to piece together his views of being human.

0545259088|5.0|This review is spoiler free! Not really any Shiver or Linger spoilers either.<br /><br />No author leaves me at a loss for words more than Maggie Stiefvater. I think the reason is that after I finish one of Maggie's books my head is still filled with her beautiful words. There's no room for anything else. Forever was no exception to that. If anything I am more speechless than I have ever been.<br /><br />Forever is definitely a bittersweet book. I've come to love Grace, Sam, Isabel, and Cole so much that's it's hard to let them go. But I can't think of a book I was more excited about in 2011. All that excitement and anticipation was certainly worth it. I am often disappointed by series conclusions--we could probably analyze that and say that I'm just disappointed that the story is over, though. I don't have even an ounce of disappointment with the conclusion of the Wolves of Mercy Falls series. I couldn't think of a more perfect way to say goodbye the these characters and this world.<br /><br />The writing is as always, beautiful, gorgeous, lyrical, captivating, I really could go on and on, but I think you get the point. It's amazing. I can't think of another YA series out there that is this beautifully told. That's high praise since, you know I read a lot.<br /><br />I have noticed that Maggie also has this uncanny ability to take a huge conflict, the sole conflict of a story and make it subtle and somehow in your face at the same time. I really can't explain it. The conflict really isn't the main focus, the characters are, but everything is riding on this one huge thing that is quietly there. This way of approaching it makes the tension build and build and build until you can't stand it anymore but you love it all at the same time. This is how her books get you, hook line and sinker. Forever might be the best example of that yet.<br /><br />Maggie also has a incredible talent when it comes to writing very complex characters. Sam, Grace, all them are real (no, I'm not crazy). They are so well written and so layered that it feels like you could pick up the phone and call them--if you were worthy enough to have their numbers. It feels like NARKOTIKA should be a real band on the radio. They are not flat words on a page. They're realistic but..impossible problems make them jump off the page. The intense love and connection between Sam and Grace is so believable that you almost feel their emotions with them. Saying these are the best, most well developed characters I have ever read is probably the highest compliment I could pay a book or a author, and that still doesn't even begin to explain how extraordinary this book really is.<br /><br />I want to make it clear that this review doesn't even begin to cover how amazing these books really are. I am saddened by the fact that it is over, but I'm really just thrilled that I got to read them. I know that I will miss Grace, Sam, Isabel, and Cole in the future, but when that happens I'm going to open the pages of Shiver and fall in love all over again.so layered that it feels like you could pick up the phone and call them--if you were worthy enough to have their numbers.

B004ODLUGM|4.0|Judge Clark Douglas, DVD Verdict-- The Gruffalo isn't a particularly ambitious animated short nor a remarkably inventive one, but it's a perfectly charming little tale that should keep the youngsters spellbound. Older viewers will be two steps ahead of the game from the beginning (and I imagine that even the young kids will have figured out the final twist by the time it arrives), but this is a sturdy example of how to bring a children's storybook to life. The story is classical in style and stays free from the pop-culture snark that runs through so much children's entertainment these days (if this were a Dreamworks flick, you know the word \\"Gruffalo\\" would be rhymed with \\"Mark Ruffalo\\" at some point). The animation is low-budget but distinctively designed, which is more or less essential if you don't have the funds to dazzle with technical polish. The voice work from the very overqualified cast (most characters only have a small handful of lines) is exceptional, and the music by Rene Aubry has an appealingly breezy quality.<br /><br />There's not much else to say about this 27-minute short (which moves at such a laid-back pace that it somehow feels even shorter), save for the fact that it probably deserved its Oscar nomination but also deserved to lose the win to The Lost Thing.<br /><br />I do wish that The Gruffalo could have been paired with something else to pad the running time of the disc, but the transfer is very handsome, boasting vibrant colors and excellent detail. Audio is top-notch too, with the pleasant score and sonorous vocal work coming through with clarity. Extras include a 13-minute making-of featurette and some storyboards.<br />-Full review at dvdverdict.com
B00005JKGO|5.0|I had this on VHS with a dubbed in English version. The DVD stated it too was dubbed in English, but it isn't. It is subtitled in English and Italian. I saw there is a version on DVD that is dubbed. I have ordered it and hope it is dubbed. It is a long film and too much reading. A film about Paparazzi in italy. With Anita Eckberg, who had a short career, and Lex Barker, who was one of the movies Tarzans. A good musical soundtrack.<br /><br />Well, the second copy was subtitled too. The seller said to keep it and they refunded my money.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|A fun game that revels in its silliness. Great gameplay, neat weapons, funny dialogue. More than worth the price. Perfect time-killer for travel.
B00005JLIU|5.0|I saw this movie when it first opened.  I loved it then and I still love it after all these years.  It's fun!  It's a hoot!  It also proves (as if there were any doubt) that Julie Andrews is an incredible talent.  She can do it all.  It also shows that when everyone in front of and behind the camera are at the top of their game, wonderful things happen.  The DVD itself is very good both visually and audibly.  I can't recommend this highly enough!
B002KQ6BT6|2.0|I felt as though I was reading a textbook from a symbology class in college.  Had I wanted to do so, I would have taken the course!  This was such a disappointment.  I have had this book for some time but never found the time to read it.  I wish now I had not because I am extremely disappointed in Dan Brown.  I loved all of his other books - especially The DaVinci Code and Angels & Demons.  This book was okay - not great and certainly not a good read - until about the last 10 chapters.  Then I just skipped ahead and read the last few pages.  Anyone who could not figure out almost all of what was coming should just give up.  I think that the success of the DaVinci Code went to Dan Brown's head and all he really saw were dollar signs.  I think the man should just go quietly into the night!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I purchased this game a few weeks ago. I saw it on the amazon app store as the top paid app. I saw it for awhile and hesitated to buy it but I went ahead and bought it and it's amazing! I played it on my T-Mobile MyTouch 4G and it worked great. Quick load times, no issues. Then I switched to sprint but luckily hadn't been playing for too long. I have the Evo3D and it loads just fine. It's very smooth, colors are vibrant and wonderful. I just recently had to get a new 3D due to an issue with the speaker and I have it back. I installed this on my tablet and is very tablet friendly. My ASUS Transformer runs this very smooth. The levels are fun, makes you really think, and doesn't get you frustrated, but makes you sit and think how to obtain all the stars. It's a great and fantastic game! I recommend this game.    If you are having problems with load times it's most likely due to the hardware in the phone. The only load time I have is when it first starts up, and when you select each level. After the level it's just going from round to round. There are 25 rounds in each level. And 7 different levels. Runs absolutely smooth!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This is a hard to find title. Roman Polanski directed his wife Sharon Tate. It is Gothic Vampirism, \\"Pardon me but your teeth are in my neck.\\" Also called \\"The Fearless Vampire Killers.\\" Sharon was a victim of the Manson murders, or the Manson Family murders. Many people don't know what she looked like. Well, she is here and she was beautiful. Roman was young and very handsome in those days too. And he has been a good director ever since his youth. This is indeed a collectible and available on Amazon.
0553801473|1.0|I wish I could say it took me two weeks to finish this book because I was savoring it.  After all I had been so excited that I pre-ordered this book the first day I could.  Heck, I almost ordered it via the UK Amazon just so I could get it sooner, but after the bad taste \\"A Feast...\\" left in my mouth I wasn't quite willing to shell out the big bucks that would have required.<br /><br />I was giddy with anticipation, and having been reminded how good the series is by HBO, I felt like a kid at Christmas when the UPS man dropped off my copy of \\"A Dance...\\"<br /><br />Two weeks and a thousand pages later, George RR Martin has lost me as a reader.  Never mind the five years, the nine other books he published or edited between \\"A Feast...\\" and \\"A Dance...\\", or the slow paced unsatisfying novel that \\"A Feast...\\" was.  It would have been worth it had this book delivered.  I would have gladly gone back to being the GRRM fanboy I was, preaching the wonders that is his Song of Ice and Fire, but no.  I can't.<br /><br />Much has already been said about how long the book is.  Its long and you feel every page.  The words crawl by, the plot and stories advance sluggishly at best, and new characters are introduced to replace characters that have been killed off, brought back, and killed off again.  The existing characters, exist only as a backdrop to the history and turtles that GRRM wants to talk about.  Only rather than telling those stories, through characters, plot lines, and differing points of view, he reduces characters, such as Tyrion, to disinterested third party narrators.<br /><br />Gone is the suspense, missing is the magic, and lost is the laser like focus of the first three books.  It should say a lot that the most interesting plots in \\"A Dance...\\" seem almost tacked on, after thoughts to the story GRRM wanted to tell.  Though rougher, and less polished than the main storylines in the novel, these \\"other\\" stories show flashes of brilliance and a return to storytelling that made GRRM great in the first place.  Sadly though, these stories are few and separated by hundreds of pages, and dozens of chapters about nothing.<br /><br />More tragically its seems that GRRM has found his \\"Wesley Crusher\\", something he had managed to avoid doing (or at least managed to avoid being eye stabbingly obvious) about in his prior books.  This is perhaps the biggest disappointment for me, authors need to keep themselves and their Mary Sue's out of their books.<br /><br />One last note and only because I haven't seen it mentioned in the other reviews.  GRRM interjected quite a bit of his personal views and politics in both \\"A Feast...\\" and \\"A Dance...\\".  There is nothing wrong with this as such, most authors do this, without even realizing it.  They project their world view upon a fictional world of their own making and its impossible for it not to happen.  \\"A Dance...\\" very much became a heavy handed and preachy vehicle for his politics.that made GRRM great in the first place.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|As others have already exhaustively deatailed, comparatively, it's a great book. For GRMM, it's sub-par. I'm tired of the cliffhangers and the teasers. Give me a story with some meat in it and for the love of anything sacred stop with the reality show-like teasers.<br /><br />When I began reading the series I thought it was plodding until I concluded that GRRM likes to carefully set up the chess pieces and then give you a great climax. Not so in the last two books.<br /><br />GRRM is still doing some great things, and it's still a good read by any measure, but the non-resolution of so many strands is starting to grate. The exposition in book 5 is un-needed. If you're beginning the series at book five you deserve to be confused.<br /><br />I guess I'm one of the few that enjoyed AFFC and I enjoyed this novel too. It's just that he spends so much time on wasted events. Hell, half the events that do occur give you no emotional payoff. It's like paying to be tortured.<br /><br />I'm starting to dread that, much like The Wheel of Time series, which gave me weeks of enjoyable reading when I began it in high school, he's just writing and writing and doesn't really know where to go with things.<br /><br />I don't mean this as a personal attack on the author, not by a long shot. I love the series. I love the ideas and the injection of serious adult memes. It just reads like he's losing his way.
B0051OZ564|3.0|I actually don't normally write movie reviews. I felt like I had to with this film...<br /><br />It was so very interesting and had us riveted to our seats during the entire film. But... It was too dark for my tastes. I was expecting something a little different. I had lots of moments during the film where PTSD (from abuse) slipped in and made it such that I did not want to finish watching the film.<br /><br />Personal junk aside:<br />The film was expertly shot, the angles and transitions were superb, and the camera motion never distracted me from the \\"living in the movie\\" experience I always get with films like these. I like plot twists, and this one delivered a few nice ones.<br /><br />This was sort of like a modern Twilight Zone episode with excellent FX, killer song covers, and convincing actors.
B002BE7JEI|5.0|I liked this movie so much that I decided to buy the perfect version on Blu-ray. Kathy Bates is really the only one who could pull this role off. James Caan the writer who is held hostage after his car crash, really looks terrified of her. A good movie and a collectible through amazon.
1416955070|4.0|I have to say I had a hard time with the beginning of this book. It started off slowly and it took me a while to want to get into this book. Once I struggled through the first few chapters, I began to become fascinated with the world created by Cassandra.    The nigh Clary meets Jayce changes her life forever.  Clary is has no idea who she really is, who her mother once was and the world she now must face. All Jayce has ever known is the Shadowhunter world. As Clary's life secrets unravel she must face a world with demons and downworlders and creates she always thought were not real. Clary must find a way to save her mother, accept secretes of a life that she had been shielded from her whole life and find out who her father really is.     Cassandra creates a vivid world of characters and creates alike full of mystery and danger. If you can make it through the slowness of the first few chapters, Cassandra's world will captivate you and keep you asking questions of why, what and how.    Clary is a strong young girl who is forced to understand a world she knows very little about and make it her own. She is only beginning to find her own strength and understand what it is she really wants.     Jayce, a young man adopted into a family because of the sudden death of his father, has built walls around himself to protect himself from heartache. When Clary comes into his life, he is forced to face emotions he has kept at bay his entire life.     It's easy to like Clary instantly and root for her throughout the story. It's defiantly worth the effort to read and by the end I was itching to get my hands on the second book.

0545259088|4.0|I'm not sure I can express my love for this series enough. Maggie does such an amazing job at writing strong characters so beautifully and magically that they float off the pages to stand in front of you.   Forever is the last installment in the series. Sam not only has to find his worries of finding Grace but must find a solution to a sudden development which could destroy the pack, the only real family he has ever known.     Deeper this is a series about love and the amount of hardships it can endure. Maggie has written a story that flows off the pages as if the story is sung instead of written. Her imagery jumps off the pages and sucks you into her world. I was so sad to have to leave Mercy Falls and the vivid world she has created.     SPOLIER ALTER!! ...If you have not read the book yet, please do not continue reading! I hate giving things away and do not want to affect anyone's opinion on reading this amazing series and book.     I have to say, I was so disappointed by the way the book ended. With everything Sam and Grace have endured to be together, I wanted there to be some type of worth wild solution/resolution. I felt the story ended with such uncertainty. It was so hard to know that Grace may not get her red coffee maker and small apartment and never go off to college. I hated the idea that Sam may never get his happy ending, that he would lose Grace forever and in losing Grace lose everything he holds so dear.     I am not necessarily saying that I wanted there to be a happy ending, I just wish there was a better resolution to how it all ends. I felt so much was left unanswered.     My disappointment for the ending of this book is not to say that I do not love the series and Maggie and believe her to be an amazing author. Maggie has created a world I would love to live in and I love the characters she has created. They are strong and flawed and it is easy to love them and cry for them. I think this may be why I feel disappointed in the ending. My imagination will forever be plagued with trying to answer all the question Maggie has left open.   At the end of the day, despite my disappointment in the ending, I was pulled into this book, never wanting to put it down. I felt Sam's sadness of missing Grace, I understood Cole's need to find the cure and his struggle over his feelings with Isabella. I wanted to be standing in Grace's kitchen with her trying to understand how her father could be so cold toward her and I felt Isabella's pain and struggle with her memories of Jack.     These three books are like songs I want to listen to over and over again! READ THESE BOOKS! :)

0061784788|5.0|I've read and loved all the previous Sigma Force novels and this one doesn't disappoint. I stayed up late several nights and then  hid out at home one Sunday morning in order to finish it. Like most of Rollins' books, this one is non-stop action and suspense, with Sigma Force racing to prevent a planet-altering disaster. The usual Sigma Force characters appear, although  some of them take on new roles.<br /><br />James Rollins writes one of my favorite types of fiction - a story that is built on a foundation of fact, then jumps off into what ifs and maybe it could have happeneds. I will say, however, that with The Devil Colony, I did have to push my capacity for the suspension of disbelief a teeny bit further than I usually have to do with Rollins' books. I had to tell myself \\"Don't ask, just go with it,\\" maybe a couple more times than I expected. But, not so much that it interfered with my enjoyment of the book. This book does leave me worried about one thing, though. I fear that the Guild, the shadowy organization that Sigma Force has battled repeatedly, is becoming just a bit too strong, a bit too good. Once your bad guys become omniscient and omnipotent, it becomes very difficult to believe that your good guys can keep on winning.<br /><br />Who should read this book? If you've read and enjoyed previous books by Rollins, then you should like this one, as well. If you aren't familiar with Rollins' books but you love a good thriller, then you should give this one a try.

B001GKJ2DY|1.0|I have seen the theatrical production 4 times and the movie once.  The movie was terrible!  The movie cut songs that were in the play and destroyed the continuity of the music and story.  Pierce Brosnan might be eye candy, but he can't sing and looked uncomfortable.  Worst of all was the direction by Phyllida Lloyd.  I cannot fault the actors and production for her inability to make the show go.  I recently had the misfortune of seeing a theatrical production of this show directed by Ms Lloyd.  Her version chopped up the music and interrupted beautiful songs with inane conversation.  It was painful to try to sit through this movie.
B000OVLINI|5.0|This book is a masterpiece.  The story is so finely crafted that the reader is unable to put it down.  The characters are brilliantly developed and at the end of the novel the reader feels sad to say goodbye to such good friends.

0007250916|3.0|While Dr Mukherjee is to be commended for an encompassing history of the disease we call \\"cancer,\\" for a strong sure handed writing style, for making an abstruse subject readable (I have a graduate degree in molecular genetics) and for a bedside manner that I can only infer as compassionate he is less to be praised for what too often comes across as an optimistic, we're all but to the finish line benediction to his scientific field of study. Too often he unjustly dramatized marginal accomplishments as great victories, \\"response rates\\" ( a surrogate for a more damming term, survival) in the teen percentages, for instance. What for example, is one to make of \\"...In 1971, about half the patients diagnosed with multiple myeloma died within twenty-four months of diagnosis, the other half died by the tenth year. In 2008, about half of all myeloma patients treated with the shifting armamentarium of new drugs will still be alive at five years.\\" Huh? (I can only assume that he meant something more felicitous than that specious phrase.) And what are we to make of a drug, first administered in clinical trials in 1999 that is claimed (in 2009) to extend survival by an average of thirty years after diagnosis? For too long we have given oncologists the benefit of the doubt as they threw one poison after another at their patients in the benighted hope that they could cure, well, perhaps delay a rampaging malignancy. Is it only in a world inured to Zyklon B that poisoning ninety nine to bestow a marginal improvement on one is regarded as rational?    The history of cancer medicine is one of futile, poorly-guided, but savage attempts to save doomed patients, too often ignoring the basic science that might provide a more enlightened therapy.(Dr Saunders who resuscitated the humane treatment of dying patients with the hospice movement and palliative medicine is deservedly praised here.) To the author's credit he acknowledges this as well as the many horrific therapies that failed. Hedetails the problems that interfere with performing well designed clinical trials - the academic and economic self-interests, and the interests of dying patients willing to try any therapy no matter how slender the promise of that therapy. His forays into molecular biology are clear and easily read but deceptively incomplete, an enthusiast's account. Medicine has suffered from a tendency to explain anything and everything in terms of the latest mechanistic discovery - it was \\"humors,\\" hormones,vitamins, calcium, prostaglandins, interferons, now oncogenes - it was never \\"we don't know but we're trying to understand.\\" It is absolute folly to think that we've reached the core of the problem, that we finally understand nature's workings. It was the hubris of the early oncologists that allowed the use of WWI nerve poisons on cancer ridden patients, it was the refusal to see that the emperor had no clothes that led to allogenic bone marrow transplants and for that those clinician should be roundly condemned. I remember hearing that the university I was working at was administering whole body radiation (an LD-50 if I recall correctly) to a young woman in an attempt to \\"prepare\\" her for a bone marrow transplant, wiping our her whole system in a lead-lined basement room - one needn't be an medical ethicist to imagine the horror of that approach, one needn't much imagination to feel revulsion at that scene. As epimethylation adds to the complexity of a nucleic acid biology we thought we understood this book should have counseled a more humble approach, and, to be fair, the author did near the end touch on the possibility that we may never conquer the disease, that it may, in fact, be our biologic destiny, it may actually be how we are designed and not to be avoided. But too much of the book reads as a triumphalist''s version, look what we've done, look what we've accomplished. An honest retelling would conclude, not much.
0061801313|3.0|First off, let me say I hopped on the bandwagon after catching a marathon of the TV show on ABC Family. Lucy Hale's brief role in Scream 4 led me to check the series out and I gotta say, it's one of my favorite guilty pleasures at the moment. The whodunit style of the show is very appealing and both the acting and writing make it a notch above other typical teenage dramas and the best series ABC Family has ever produced (which, given such trite shows as The Secret Life of the American Teenager, isn't that hard).<br /><br />I eventually decided to read the source material and bought this box set to see if the books were as engrossing as the TV series. The first book, simply titled Pretty Little Liars, sets up the main story - it's condensed into the first episode of the television show. Flawless, the second entry, continues the storylines from the first book, and while a little slow at the beginning, picks up steam when it reaches its conclusion. The third novel in the series, Perfect, does a better job balancing the suspense with lighter moments and also divides the four lead character's involvement more evenly. The fourth installment, Unbelievable, is a solid conclusion but suffers from something I'll address momentarily.<br /><br />There are several aspects of the books I enjoyed, primarily that the chapters are short (usually less than ten pages) and the POV shifts between the four girls &agrave; la the TV show. It's also worth noting that the television show and books' storylines aren't completely identical. For someone who began to follow the series on TV first, I appreciated the plot curveballs in the books instead of always knowing what was coming next - one character's death in the second book completely threw me off guard.<br /><br />There are some shortcomings, though. The second, third, and fourth books often reiterate past events from the first book and while this is probably done to help new readers understand what's going on if they're starting out of order, it feels like unnecessary padding for those who read the books in sequential order. Another thing I initially wrote off but then began to notice again was that these girls tear up at just about anything. For example...<br /><br />The following phrases appear in the first 15 chapters of the fourth book:<br /><br />1. Emily was sobbing with fear (Ch. 2)<br />2. Tears dotted Emily's eyes (Ch. 3)<br />3. Emily felt hot tears stream down her face (Ch. 3)<br />4. \\"Hey,\\" Ezra said, noting the tears spilling down Aria's cheeks (Ch. 5)<br />5. ...Suddenly afraid she was going to start crying again (Ch. 6)<br />6. She willed herself not the cry, talking big, gulping breaths...Emily's vision blurred with tears (Ch. 9)<br />7. Tears bloomed at the corners of Emily's eyes (Ch. 12)<br />8. Her eyes welled with tears (Ch.13)<br />9. Tears brimmed at the corners of Hanna's eyes (Ch. 15)<br /><br />While it's understandable that these characters are emotionally damaged, it starts to become comical when, in just about every other chapter, one of the four leads breaks down over smelling a scent that reminds her of a memory. I almost expected to read something along the lines of, \\"Spencer opened the window. A breeze came in and her eyes watered - the cold draft reminded Spencer of Ali flying past her on her bike. She began to sob uncontrollably.\\" It feels like lazy writing on Shepard's part, and I'm surprised nobody who edited the books picked up on this and approached her. \\"Sara, the amount of crying in your books rivals the compressed estrogen of something Stephanie Meyer would write.\\"<br /><br />Despite those quibbles, I do recommend reading the books if you're a fan of the show. After the second book, I made a game out of tallying the \\"crying/tear\\" phrases and it made the novels all the more enjoyable. Hell, I'm looking forward to highlighting the next set of books when they come next week.<br /><br />Personal Ratings:<br /><br />Pretty Little Liars: (7.5/10) Lays down the framework for what's to come. Not the most eventful entry but a necessary introduction.<br /><br />Flawless: (7/10) Lots of retreading at the start, but hard to put down in the final chapters.<br /><br />Perfect: (8/10) Good balance of humor and shock. The ending is easy to predict but immediately entices you to read the next book.<br /><br />Unbelievable: (7.5/10) Emily's a blubbering mess in this one, as evidenced by the list above. The title basically sums up my opinion of her and everyone else's caterwauling.<br /><br />Overall: 7.5/10s of retreading at the start, but hard to put down in the final chapters.    Perfect: (8/10) Good balance of humor and shock. The ending is easy to predict but immediately entices you to read the next book.    Unbelievable: (7.5/10) Emily's a blubbering mess in this one, as evidenced by the list above. The title basically sums up my opinion of her and everyone else's caterwauling.    Overall: 7.5/10
0061784788|5.0|Book 7 in the Sigma Force series brings the author's fusion of action and historical fiction to the U.S., presenting a current eco-disaster whose origins involve a mystery dating back to the founding of the country.<br /><br />This is a fun ride.  It starts with excavation of a lost artifact in 1779 and the discovery of a secret and forbidden Native American site in Utah, two seemingly unrelated mysteries which the author slowly weaves toward each other.<br /><br />The first half of the novel was particularly exciting, and pulls the reader in for all that is to come.  There are lots of twists and turns, an interesting plot, and some new and reasonably well fleshed out characters.<br /><br />Obviously, potential readers should be aware that this book is #7 in the series, and the characters are continued from earlier books.  If you pick this up as your first Sigma book, you might not connect with the characters who have been brought to life over the series.<br /><br />As a result of this adventure, there are some potentially substantial developments for going forward in the series.  It will be interesting to see what the author has in mind for the future.<br /><br />Based on my enjoyment of this novel, I'll be waiting for the next book to find out where James Rollins takes me!
B0011HOEY4|1.0|This is one of those movies where the writers use real events and real people as the basis for what is in fact complete fiction.    Frank Lucas wasn't the protege of Bumpy Johnson. He didn't go walking through the jungle in Vietnam to meet the people who sold the drugs. He wasn't a socially sophisticated guy. He was a hick from North Carolina who figured out a way to smuggle the high quality drugs which became available in southeast asia after 1970 to the US through a friend in the army. He was well known to police. As far as I can tell, he never killed people in broad daylight in the street and then continued his lunch. He wasn't arrested coming out of Church with his mother. He didn't slap around Nicky Barnes. And all the stuff about him feuding with police (blowing up cars and so on) is also made up.    And when Frank Lucas was arrested, he didn't get his sentence reduced by going after corruption in the police. He got his time reduced by becoming a government witness against almost everyone else in the drug trade on the east coast.     Nearly all of the story of Richie Roberts (the prosecutor) is also false. The whole notion of him as the sole crusader who took down Frank Lucas is false. He wasn't even the lead on the case. And many of the stories he tells about himself had no other source but him.    The film is ok for what it is. But people should not use real names and real events in what is an entirely fictional story. And thats what happened in this film. Half the fiction in the film seems to serve no other purpose but to turn Lucas into a somewhat sympathic character. The other half (Richie Roberts) seems designed for little more than providing a way to attack the police.     The film would have been much better if it had sticked to the truth and eliminated the Richie Roberts character. There is enough truth in the story of Frank Lucas to make a good film. But this wasn't that film.    \\"Prince of the City\\" deals with corruption within the police of that era in a much better way.
0439023521|5.0|I passed on this book for months before reading it because of what I thought the plot was about. This book is freaking awesome! It sweeps you into another world and doesn't let you go. I think I read this in one night. It was amazing. I couldn't wait to get my hands on catching fire. read it, don't hesitate.
3442217784|5.0|I state that financial auditors shouldn't read this book because it goes against what they are taught. SAFETY SAFETY SAFETY!!! The only thing is, we don't live in a safe world, so how does money go against the norm? (\\"A ship in port is safe, but that's not what ships are built for.\\" - Grace Murray Hopper)    Also, this book is for people WILLING (not just hoping) to get out of their financial problems. If you are looking to become financially fit, talk to someone who is there, not your broke uncle, or financial auditor who is struggling to get by also. If you take advice about money from someone, look to see how well off they are, if they aren't... walk away. Point is, don't complain that nothing is working for you, when you haven't done anything to help yourself.    I have done many things that were recommended, and, slowly, but surely, things are picking up little by little. If wishes were kisses...
0425242099|4.0|I love LOVED LOVED the Hawke and Sienna part of this book.  I've been eagerly awaiting it, and also not because when you wait for something for so long it can let you down.  I was definitely NOT let down by this storyline, but like another reviewer mentioned I am bummed by the sharing of the story with Walker and Lara.  They honestly probably deserved their own story somewhere down the line and maybe we will get one, but I felt that sharing it took away from Hawke and Sienna.    I didn't mind the war aspect of the story because that is a core truth to who they both are as characters, but give us their love story, and don't force another one in the way of it.  It doesn't do Walker or Lara justice either.  I am interested in who Walker is as a character and what he did with the Arrows he trained and I hope that we will be introduced to the man that Walker was before so that we can see how he's grown into the man he is now.
0062060554|2.0|This book was very boring. A woman wakes up every day not knowing who she is, where she is, or remembering her past. She begins journaling in an attempt to retain some memories day to day. She discovers one day that she may not be able to trust the only person that she has in her life, her husband. Unfortunately, most of the book is very redundant and nothing happens until about the last 20 pages or so. I cannot recommend it. I think it would make a perfect rainy Sunday Lifetime movie.
0547258305|5.0|This book introduced me to kristen cashore. I couldn't put it down. I love strong women heroine characters. I wish there were more books like this!
B0050KEVO6|5.0|My wife and kids all have this game.  We all trying to make cooler &quot;elements&quot; than each other.  And of course bragging rights go to the one with the most combinations.  Get it!
B00008G7UJ|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. The modern day adaptation with guns, the church imagery, the costume party and the music are elements that make this movie special. Leonardo and Claire have great chemistry. It follows Shakespeares original play very well while still being modern and different. I have also read the play and have seen it acted on stage, and this is a great movie.
0307917509|4.0|Jo Nesbø has created a tight, suspenseful novel - bravo! I listened to the audio version and enjoyed the pace and the plot very much. Nesbø is masterful at building suspense - I could hardly stop once I started. He excels at creating a vague sense of unease which steadily builds into horror. Everyday objects become imbued with menace. He really got me into Harry Hole's head - everything that Harry Hole does is unpredictable and yet completely believable! The plot is full of red herrings - no one is above suspicion, which further winds the plot taut. The chemistry between Harry and Rakel is great, and the portrayal of the dynamics at the police department was terrific. I listened to the book as I traveled through Norway and enjoyed the little references to everyday life - the Pakistani presence, the Africa connection, the omni-present ski lifts.<br /><br />Don Barlett does a reasonably good job as the translator. Its a tricky thing to decide whether to retain idioms in Norwegian or English. There were a handful of times I felt like the English version did not quite capture the bite of the moment. For example, the use of profanity was a little stilted. The narrator (Robin Sachs) uses a mostly-British accent, which again works reasonably well for the most part. Nothing to write home about. Nesbø's plot is really the star of the show.
1594484805|3.0|If you're really interested in this, first watch his youtube video and then go buy Predictably Irrational. That's a much better book and something you don't wonder \\"Is there any substance left?\\" and \\"Why am I still reading??\\" Reminds me of papers I wrote in college tons of spacing, large font, and redundant enough to put you to sleep. I'm putting mine back up for sale.
0767836324|4.0|This was always a fun movie to watch as a kid and is still entertaining as an adult. The only difference is that now I notice the graphics are low quality in some scenes, and the movie seems to be a little too long. They could have edited some of it out, since it seems to drag on at times. It is funny seeing Gwyneth Paltrow and Julia Roberts in their roles since they seem so different. A classic Peter Pan adaptation that I do recommend!
B004ZG5F0K|4.0|I received this movie about a week ago but hadn't yet viewed it. After reading the above review I thought it best to check my copy. It is Blu-Ray and it runs perfectly on my Oppo 93.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Old version of the app had a dedicated microphone button for voice to text. This app has a voice button that is shared with settings and voice so you must press twice to use voice. Not good when you are driving. This is how most people I know use the voice to text feature.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I was endlessly interested in the fate of Dexter and Emma from page one and I was touched throughout most of the book.  If felt extremely realistic and that part pissed me off because I found a lot of the story extremely frustrating, just as I find relationships in \\"real-life\\" frustrating.  One complaint is that the flashbacks confused me some and the entire format of the book was a bit all over the place for me.  I also found that a lot of scenes which could have been extremely powerful and dramatic were kind of anti-climatic.  At the same time, I was completely drawn into this powerful story of love and friendship and would certainly recommend the story to others.  I'm looking forward to the movie - according to the trailor, it closely follows the book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|There are several reviews out there about this magnificent book, so I will be brief. The \\"Game of Thrones\\" is just the beginning. We get to know the world of Westeros and some of the characters who drive the story forward; we get a glimpse at the most brutal (hence realistic) side of human behavior, spiced up with a little chivalry and honor. The book, and the story is dark, but never brutal for the sake of scaring. I would say that the Latin saying \\"Homo homini lupus - Man is a wolf to man\\" describes the story best. All the characters have their own agendas, all of them, even the \\"good guys\\", though, and this is the best aspect of the whole story, it is almost impossible to tell the good guys from the bad ones. George R. R. Martin created a story which is about us, all of us, humans, with all the evil and sometimes good that dwell inside us. The only thing that makes the book sometimes a burden to read is its realism, it is a hard task to face the truth about ourselves. And, I have to tell this again, \\"Game of Thrones\\" is just the beginning, if you plan to start reading it, be prepared to continue with all the sequels, because the song of ice and fire is far from finished...
B001EJIMUG|4.0|A very good adaptation of the book, great performances by actors who can act, and wonderful sets.  I don't need glossy, beautiful people to fill out these characters.
1451629184|4.0|This book is an easy read( Not an easy topic, though). I read it in an evening, it definitely can hold your interest. The fact that such things happen and how easily the system can fail you, is something that we should all be aware of. I appreciate Jaycee allowing us a peek into her life. It does give a lot of explanation and insight as to how it is possible to stay in such a situation once she was old enough to escape. I'm not surprised at all that she never left. Those acting so shocked that she never left has not attempted to understand the conditioning and treatment she went through at the hands of her captor. I think he may have gotten lucky taking a girl with her particular personality...but it may have been what saved her. If she had been less cooperative, he may easily have killed her early on.<br />It was edited a little rough, but she is not a writer and explains that she has a hard time with time-lines (which makes perfect sense). It was a little more detailed in ares that I didn't think she'd touch on and then not so much in areas I wish she would have. Of course, the nosy side of me wants to know all sorts of details...you can't help but come up with questions. But Jaycee stated that she wrote this to help other victims of sexual abuse, not to give the general public a play by play of her ordeal. I am glad that she shared this much. The unanswered questions that I'm sure most of us have will probably never be answered, and since they're not our business, shouldn't be.<br />I hope her and her family continue to get the support and happy life that they deserve.<br /><br />BTW: Those calling this book a pedophiles handbook need a reality check. Those details may have been shocking to us but nothing that a pedophile hasn't come up with on his own, I'm sure. There's an entire genre of smut written for such miscreants, they don't need this book.
0307716511|5.0|As other reviewers point out this is not your typical thriller.  It's more of a blend of a mystery-who-dunnit thriller with the tale of a woman coming to terms with the loss of her sister and discovering her inner strength.  Here was why I liked it - and where I think it might not appeal to some based on their tastes.<br /><br />Short Summary: Older sister is unconvinced that her sister's death was a suicide and goes on a hunt to find the killer. She writes an open letter to her sister to tell her of the pursuit.<br /><br />1. For me, this was a page turner - but, not in that normal thriller way.<br />I read this in one day.  I was captured by Beatrice's pursuit of tracking down clues to discover who and why her sister died equally as much as by her blossoming understanding of her sister and the dynamics of her family. Most thrillers are more short chapters of action and suspense.  This one not so much.  So, if that's what you truly enjoy - you're going to like this one less.<br /><br />2. It's well-written with an equal focus on character development and family dynamics.<br />This book shines beyond a thriller by bringing to life the complex dynamics of relationships with her mother, siblings, father and fiancee as she grows to better understand herself through her sister's death. If you're not into well-written more introspective looks at familial relationships - or stories of women finding themselves bore you - this probably won't be your cup of tea - even if it's, in my opinion very well written.<br /><br />3. You don't have to have a sister to enjoy it - but there's no doubt you'll enjoy it more if you are a woman.<br />I don't have a sister, and yet could relate to the dynamics of the sister relationship. And, even more so within all of Beatrices relationships there is something I think most women, but not men, might relate to within themselves. To me, this is the type of book that will appeal to people who also liked [[ASIN:0062060554 Before I Go to Sleep: A Novel]], [[ASIN:031257357X Still Missing]] or other more psychologically relation-based thrillers versus your typcial action or who-dunnit thrillers.<br /><br />4.Don't read it because everyone says it has a twist.<br />Yes, it does twist in a surprising way that I found unique and relevant.  But, more importantly for me is that it really did seem a great way to bring the entire big theme of the book together. That was realy it's true beauty to me.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: A well-written, intriguing book that kept me turning the pages through its combined tale of a who-dunnit mystery with the story of a woman finding her inner self and coming to terms with the relationships in her life. But, you're not going to like it as much if you're expecting twisting suspenseful and action-filled turns on every page - it's just not that type of thriller.or other more psychologically relation-based thrillers versus your typcial action or who-dunnit thrillers.    4.Don't read it because everyone says it has a twist.

B004RC8NXI|5.0|Well first of all, I think this is one of  the second best movies of Ashton after \\"What happen in Vegas\\".  This movie somewhat similar to that \\"What happen in Vegas\\" but better acting this time.  I like everything in this movie, from the funny scene to the love scene.  Great story, good acting, and what can I say, \\"BEAUTIFUL!!!\\".    Gotta watch the movie for yourself and you'll know the rest.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can see how some people would say Abby and Travis's relationship is obsessive and unhealthy, I kinda thought that too at first, but then I read it again.  I fell in love with Travis all over again and this time I didn't see him as obsessive at all, actually I kind of disliked Abby.  She takes him on an emotional roller coaster messing with the head of an already jealous and insecure man.  Towards the end I always love them all over again.  This book is simply amazing.  Travis fights hard and loves harder, if you buy this book you'll fall in love with it too.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a great book. Very fasted paced, interesting charactars and a very good story.  My 13 yr old read this series awhile back and she had it on her Kindle.

B002KKCWP4|5.0|I second the positive reviews. These sandals are fabulous. The part I like the most is that they are so adjustable. I can fine tune the 3 straps perfectly to conform to my feet. I wear mine ALL the time. If I could, I would wear them to work. Great support too.    I'm thinking about getting a second pair just for the heck of it because the price is actually very reasonable. Highly, highly recommended!

B001UV4XIS|5.0|Harry Potter is no more, the last instalment has begun for all. this movie was a long and anticipated wait for everyody. this was really good. i was pleased with the movie. there's a couple of things that i wished that the filmmakers would of put in, like hagrid getting attacked, a more epic battle. don't get me wrong the attle was great. but it was more epic in the book. two thing in this movie i wanted to go right was the battle and the epilouge. come on in the epilouge they didn't mention anything aout harry becoming an ora or neviell becoming a professor. but all in all this is the best out of them all. I think J.K. Rowling should do a prelude to the story. i would like to read more about harry's parents when they were young and more depth story on how voldemort became so evil. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B004JN1D2I|5.0|The HBO series follows the first book pretty faithfully, and it's nice to get more detail from the books now that I know who all the characters are.  if I hadn't seen the show, it would've been very confusing to keep them all straight.  This series is definitely increasing my vocabulary!  I've had to use the \\"dictionary\\" feature every couple of pages because of all the archaic wording - for instances, horses are described as \\"garron,\\" \\"destrier,\\" \\"palfrey\\" etc.  \\"Vair\\" = squirrel.  Definitely keeping me on my toes!!  A thoroughly enjoyable series to far.  Am on book 2 and can't put it down.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|This book kept me interested and flowed well. I thought the ending was rather abrupt though so was a bit disappointed. I wouldn't normally read this type of book but I loved the photographs and thought the content interesting.
0321647440|5.0|Apple Pro Training Series: Aperture 3, is just what its title implies -- a professional level training tool. I had been using Aperture 3 for many months and thought I knew all I needed to know to get the most from my photos using Aperture 3 -- that is, until I read this book and followed each tutorial. Using the many included example photos, the author, Dion Scoppettuolo, leads you through the details of every Aperture 3 feature in a engaging manner, and in a very logical sequence. More importantly, you learn WHY you might use a certain feature, as well as the multiple ways you can access a tool or feature and apply various adjustments. Apple Pro Training Series: Aperture 3 is more like hiring a world-class photographer / instructor to be your private tutor, than merely consulting a reference volume -- which is not to say that this book isn't an excellent reference work, which it certainly is. When I completed Dion's book, I realized how much I had been missing by being a \\"self-taught\\" Aperture user.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has made the investment in Apple Aperture.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|This movie is exactly what it claims to be.  A War Movie, where the enemy are Aliens.  For what it is, it was very well done and enjoyable.  If you are looking for a science fiction movie with depth or meaning this is not it.    They could have lost the subplot about the Sergeant losing his men in the previous war, which was just a waste of time and a bit silly in the context of this movie.  100,000's of people are dying around them, the sergeant has saved them numerous times, but they are looking at him like he is trying to get them killed almost to the very end.   What a dumb subplot.  I guess they did not notice that almost every unit they ran into had lost almost every man, come on if you needed a subplot you could have come up with a better one.  Besides that good movie.

1589795474|3.0|TMND is centered around 7 key similarities among a majority of America's millionaires.  For those who truly buy into these concepts, reading through synopses and reviews of the book online is probably sufficient to get the points across.  For others, 200+ pages of repetitive discussion which the authors present may be more appropriate to drill the ideas home.    In addition to suffering from repetition, the book has its share of quirky statements.  These occasional hiccups can either seem outdated or lead one to believe that the authors are briefly foraying into subject matters beyond their expertise.  A prime example: \\"Many American millionaires have a propensity to purchase full-sized automobiles that have a low cost per pound.\\"  Who would ever buy a vehicle with this guiding criterion?  All else equal, wouldn't a truly frugal millionaire want a lighter vehicle which yielded better mileage?    Some other odd/outdated statements paraphrased: those with low net-worth never skip a meal (are leftovers too expensive for millionaires?), the status symbol of flashy watches (people would rather show off the time on their iPhone nowadays), and the suggestion that one pursue a career as a travel agent for the wealthy (ask any travel agent how their industry has been doing the past 10 years).  Also, be prepared to read the phrase \\"foreign luxury automobile\\" or variant thereof an average of about once per page from beginning to end.    In the end, TMND could be described as 7 solid concepts with relatively poor presentation.  It's a worthwhile read, but don't go in with 5-star expectations.

0307388719|4.0|This is my second Max Hastings read. No question it is well written. We see, better than any other account, Churchill's vanity, his obsession with empire and the Eastern Mediterranean. His thoughts are muddled in racism. It's a book intent on shifting opinions. Churchill's greatness is more of an afterthought. A flaw.    And there's an additional error in Hasting's perception of President Roosevelt. Roosevelt wanted to help England; his country much less so. Contrary to Hasting's words, he liked Churchill except when Churchill upstaged him before press and public. They were both 'prima donna's,' and you can't have two first ladies in one country.

B001Q9E9F6|5.0|I am one of those annoying people who keep magazines around because every-time I look through them I find something new, something that, with a different perspective I see new opportunities or relevance.<br /><br />The Long Tail is a Book like that. There are few books that I will read, re-read and highlight, then listen to the audio-book of. Most are fiction and are purely for entertainment value. The Long Tail, however is packed so tightly with information relevant to the myriad topics in which I am interested. As a result I continue to retrace chapters, sections, and paragraphs for golden nuggets of information. I have also become that annoying person who references the 'latest book I'm reading' in a conversation or e-mail and notes a reference that is topical.<br /><br />I am in the Home Furnishings Industry, specifically I am a furniture designer. The Long Tail provides a plethora of data and insight into the emergence of digital dominance in any media that can be converted from physical to digital from music to movies, to software. It is more difficult to apply this digital paradigm to my industry. However, that isn't to say the digital domain will not and hasn't already become a crucial factor in the Home Furnishings Business. 15 years ago importing furniture from China was considered a non-threat to the North Carolina 'good ole boy' network of manufacturers. 5 years later they woke up to the 'crisis' of their businesses being undersold by equal or superior goods. 15 years later, nearly all domestic furniture factories are shuttered and imports from China as well as a wide swath of South East Asia, South America, and 'Eastern' Europe have become available to US consumers.<br /><br />As I continue to review the book, I continue to consider opportunities for growth in my industry and applications for the rules of the Long Tail.
0525423273|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  I really worried that with all the hype surrounding it, that I wouldn't like it.  That wasn't the case at all.  Anna is a great character, who is sent off to Paris by her Nicholas Sparks-esque (or that's how I pictured him) dad, who had gained his riches and notoriety from a number of successful tear-jerker novels turned films.  Of course she resents being ripped from her life in the U.S., along with a new possible love interest she had been crushing on before being forced to leave.  Thankfully she meets a small circle of friends who show her the ropes and make her time a little bit easier.  Also, it helps that one of them is an English American guy named Etienne St. Clair who is the school hottie and her new best friend.  The trouble is that he has a longtime girlfriend at another school and Anna has established Etienne as her friend.  That's a hard line to cross, even with enough chemistry to light the city.<br /><br />The thing that I most loved about the novel, besides being set in Paris, was the development of the characters and their relationships.  Anna was a fun, unique character who had interesting flaws (a fear of going off of campus alone) and some real sounding conversations.  Her friends were people you wanted to know, and her romantic interest was agonizing and exactly the way any teenage girl could dream.  There is a crazy amount of tension in the story that keeps you flipping pages, praying for a resolution in the story.  Not to mention that there are enough misunderstandings to drive you to distraction!  Then, when it all ends and it has come together, you're sad and wish it would just go on.<br /><br />This is one charming story.  Thankfully, the buzz about this book was spot on and I'll definitely be recommending it to others!

B0050PYNP8|4.0|Graeme Willy (Simon Pegg) and Clive Gollings (Nick Frost) are two English nerds taking a road trip across America to see all the sites where alien activity has been reported. After a quick stop through Comic-Con, they embark on their trip and shortly into their excursion they meet Paul (voiced by Seth Rogen), an alien who has escaped from Area 51 and intends to return to his home planet. He enlists the reluctant Graeme and Clive to give him a ride and they embark on the journey to get Paul to his mother-ship. En route, they unwittingly kidnap Ruth Buggs (Kristen Wiig), a Creationist, whose glimpse of Paul more than challenges her beliefs. In addition to Ruth's father Moses (John Carroll Lynch) chasing after them, they also have government agent Zoil (a stone-faced Jason Bateman) and FBI agents Haggard (Bill Hader) and O'Reilly (Joe Lo Truglio) hot on their trail.     Pegg and Frost previously collaborated with Edgar Wright for the hit films Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, which were comedic homages to zombie movies and cop movies, respectively. Paul follows the same formula of genre-spoofing and is, in many ways, the next logical step after those two films, yet it exists as a separate entity. While Pegg and Frost wrote the script, directing duties are handled by Greg Mottola (director of Superbad and Adventureland), who likely had a hand in shaping the humor of the film as his influence is apparent in the casting and overall tone. Audiences haven't responded to Paul as strongly as they did to Pegg and Frost's previous outings and it's true that this is a much more run-of-the-mill comedy, but that doesn't mean it's generic. It still has Pegg and Frost's comedic sensibility and wit and is more amusing and fun than it's been given credit for.    Both Simon Pegg and Frost have described Paul as a love letter to Steven Spielberg and, in some ways, this makes it the comedic cousin of this year's Super 8. Unlike that film however, Paul doesn't just reference/homage Spielberg. The film has pop-culture references galore, with the majority relating to science-fiction and comic books. These references, visual and spoken, obvious and subtle, will be most enjoyed by fanboys but the casual viewer won't feel alienated. References to science-fiction/comic culture don't stop at the plot, but influenced the casting as well. Spielberg himself makes a voice appearance and an icon of the sci-fi genre makes one of the great \\"I should've seen it coming\\" entrances I've seen in some time. Even Blythe Danner (who it's nice to see in a non-Meet the Parents role) was likely cast because of her participation in the first X-Files movie.    The cast is marvelous, with Pegg and Frost (best friends in real life) carrying the film with an onscreen chemistry that makes the film's message about friendship more poignant. With this film and Bridesmaids, Kristen Wiig is establishing herself as a star comedienne. Bateman, Hader, and Truglio are great as you'd expect, but there are hidden gems in the performances that can't be overlooked such as Jeffrey Tambor's small, but memorable role as science-fiction writer Adam Shadowchild and John Carroll Lynch's hilarious turn as Moses.    The character Paul has physical characteristics that mirror the accepted look of an alien life form, but isn't much of an alien. This may be because he is voiced by Seth Rogen, who also played the character via motion capture until shooting The Green Hornet made it necessary for Truglio to step in. Rogen doesn't just provide the voice of Paul; Paul is Rogen and they share the same vocal facility, physical mannerisms, and character traits. Aside from looking like an alien and having alien abilities, Paul is basically Seth Rogen. I only mention this because some people seem to have a problem with Rogen and if you're expecting him to stretch his range as an actor, this isn't the place to look for that. While he may not stray from his persona, he does give an inspired vocal performance.    Much of the humor comes from the pop-cultural references, but Paul is characterized by a broad spectrum of comedy that has elements of religious, political, gross-out, and satirical humor. What's better is that it is all bitingly clever and has my favorite throwaway line of the year (a reference to a certain 90s documentary directed by Andrew Jarecki). My readings on the internet boards for this film (never a place to go to read anything of worth) have revealed misguided controversy about the film's shots at religion. Yes, the film does ridicule religious beliefs but the jokes are pretty tame. What's more, they're aimed not at innocent churchgoers but satirical religious zealots who attempt to force their message onto anyone whom they come across. In context, these jokes don't poke fun at religion so much as closed-mindedness. Are these jokes essential to the plot? No. Are they funny? I thought so.    Paul is a comedy that would not exist without the films that came before it and as such is predictable, but it can hardly be faulted for this. It's entertaining with a consistently amusing tone and some laugh-out-loud and subtly brilliant humor throughout. It's essentially a buddy/road comedy that happens have an alien, whose function is that of a \\"buddy\\" anyway.     Spielberg's early films are the reason summer blockbusters are released every year. What's so great about Paul, along with Super 8, is that it's a direct descendant of those early Spielberg films but creates something wholly entertaining and fun. These films hearken back to when films were influenced by Spielberg's early films themselves rather than the business model they created. Paul made money at the U.S. box office but has been overshadowed by other comedies this year. It's not a profound comedy classic, but it's a nostalgic, satirical sci-fi comedy with a hilarious cast.    GRADE: B+
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is my first Foo Fighters album and do not have a reference point to say whether this is their best or worst album. If it is considered their worst album, then I want the remaining albums...NOW!!! The plastic wrap on the CD is not lying when it encourages you to listen to it at max volume. I wasn't sure what to expect. I slid this CD into my Subaru car stereo (yes, I am an old bag) and turned the volume up to 17 which is pretty damn loud for this machine. The beginning of the song starts with scratchy electric guitar picking, then a second guitar chimes in with a sort of goofy rhythm, a third guitar trumpets in armageddon then all hell breaks loose with ribcage reverberating choas of drum and bass assualt. Now hear comes the music with meaning...Dave Grohl yells then screams \\"These are my favorite last WORDS!!! My numbers up bridges will BURN!!!\\". The subject of Wasting Light is \\"Life & Death\\". The not so hinden cause of this discussion is Kurt Cobain (died from an alleged self inflicted gunshot wound in 1994). The album continues on a wild bronco bucking ride until the final song 'Walk', where Grohl proclaims \\"I never wanna' die\\"!!!  Dave Grohl has had many years to ponder his existence and fall-out from his former bandmate's selfish demise. 'Wasting Light' finds him here with an incredible bunch of songs to work out his own demons.

0553386794|1.0|I really wish I had been warned before I spent money on this book. If I can sum up my feelings about it, I'm angry and disappointed. I'm angry because it had been so intense and beautiful for awhile, I sensed greatness... but it was bait and switch. Abruptly every story line I cared about was over. VOID and EMPTY.<br /><br />Let's put it this way... If Martin had written Lord of the Rings, Frodo would have been decapitated by Sauron before the end of the first book. If you like stories with a beginning, middle and end, or even a point to them - this is NOT for you. If you like your heroes (at least one person) to struggle, fail, but eventually overcome... FORGET it. There are NO heroes and apparently most everyone dies. Most every storyline that the author sets you up to care about ends in tragedy.<br /><br />While I actually love dark stories, that are full of angst, (violence doesn't bother me either), I HATE stories with empty, tragic endings to this extent. If a story that violates all the \\"rules,\\" after making you endure incest, gore and vile behavior can still be considered \\"well done,\\" then I'll give it that. It was eloquently pointless. But I felt MASSIVELY disappointed and cheated. I guess I'm angry for the attachments I formed before I knew the \\"game,\\" because they went NO WHERE. ALL the story lines I was drawn to are OVER, making me wonder WHY I just wasted my time following them. POINTLESS.<br /><br />There ARE loose ends I wondered about... but I was not going to risk being set up again with a new set of DEAD-END characters, so I googled the series. I REALLY wish I had done that before. I wish that the \\"glowing\\" reviews had also contained a warning... There are NO main characters, NO heroes, NO romance, NO point really, unless the point is that life is random and tragic. You just have to be in it for the twisted, pointless journey... Why anyone would enjoy wallowing in this crap is beyond me. Obviously some are ok with it or they hold out some hope that there will be a satisfying ultimate end. Not me. As they say, fool me once... What a WASTE!!!isfying ultimate end. Not me. As they say, fool me once... What a WASTE!!!
0425241505|5.0|It looks like any other paranormal romance book, but I was surprised to find it full of adventure and very interesting characters.  It occurs in an alternate world where the \\"elder\\" races have been living alongside regular human people.  One group of those elder races are shapechangers known as the wyr.<br /><br />The author starts off strong with a great grabber.  Pia, the heroine, is walking through the streets of New York City thinking to herself that her death warrant was sealed because of something she did that she didn't have a choice in.  The whole book is laid out in this fashion.  One secret after another.  The pace is fast and interesting and very sexy.  Pia is a half wyr and she's stolen something from the leader of all wyrs.  A very strong dragon.<br /><br />I recommend that you go into this book blind, not knowing what the story plot is about because it will add more pleasure to the reading.  I highly recommend this book.
B002N8A14M|5.0|Just got this and it is just what I was looking for. I have been wanting a hard cover to protect my 5th generation and it fits perfectly. The openings are fine. Two of my three earbuds fit in fine. The third won't go in all the way because of the lip on the bottom of the case, but 2 out of 3 is fine.  The armband is comfortable, but I haven't had a chance to run/exercise with it, but I don't forsee any issues with it. Good price, though the day it shipped, the price dropped in half
B003HYSSZK|5.0|Frankly, I was a bit skeptical when they announced that Matt Smith would be the new Doctor. He looked a little young. And I thought David Tennant had been a great Doctor and was reluctant to see him depart. But I have to admit Matt Smith is pretty awesome as the new Doctor. In fact, I think he may be the best Doctor ever.     In addition, Karen Gillan, Alex Kingston, and Arthur Darville are a great bunch of companions. All very likeable, yet different.    The stories are fun and interesting to watch and well written.  It's a great ride. I hope they have Matt, Karen, Alex, and Arthur under contract for at least a 3-4 year period..
1439102724|2.0|I had only read one other Jodi Picoult novel, Salem Falls, before I bought this book based on a recommendation from a friend.   Jodi is a very gifted writer, but even her writing and characters weren't enough to hold my interest through this one.    It started to get tedious about halfway through, and I did something that I never do---I fast-forwarded to the last three chapters to just find out what happened so that I could quit reading...
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Now this is a really good cooler! It comes with everything you need for the amd and intel processors!! It had terrible instructions but if you can install a basic heatsing and processor you could probably figure it out. It only lowered my core temp from 41c to 38c not as much as I hoped but now when i overclock at full capability (from 3.0ghz to 3.1ghz) the temp only goes up to 40c! (notice i used my temp and not how much) I believe this is designed to keep in in a certain area and all not lower it 10.c which is good cause it helped me out a lot and my board is doing great even included cool master cream for it and it was enough for the rest of my heatsinks that needed to be changed as well!!! I love it!!!! For this price it is the best!
1575666286|5.0|There are so many books and products on the health market that culling and picking the right ones is not easy. Let's face it, there's lots of junk science. This is not. Sometimes it amazes me that Amazon items as valuable as this one can be rated 2 or 3 stars.<br /><br />To understand how this book stands out, you have to evaluate how much research, how many \\"test cases\\" have shown the Gerson program to work. Seventy years of study and observation is a long time. Pharmaceutical drugs are often on the market after less than three years. We all consume drugs and foods with grossly inadequate testing of highly questionable substances with little or no data on long term, or even short term effects.  Our doctors, well-meaning but under-educated and themselves \\"sold\\" by advertising, prescribe them to us. If only each doctor, each medical student, were assigned this book.<br /><br />The truth is always simple. The Gerson diet plan is utterly straightforward, if difficult to transition to from a Standard American Diet (S.A.D., and isn't it?). You could read two dozen nutrition books and the Gerson diet underlies all of them. It's basically a diet based on vegetables and fruit and whole grains, with the super-nutrient therapeutic value of organic, fresh-pressed juices consumed in quantity. It's brilliant, fundamental, frightening in its quotient of fact.<br /><br />If you or a loved one are ill, dis-eased in any way, this book is vital reading. Even if you don't have cancer or other serious conditions, even if you are young and healthy, the data you will find will make your life a longer one, a better one.<br /><br />This increasingly healthy and energetic reader is very grateful to Max Gerson and all who are carrying on his work.

B0034G4ORC|4.0|Certainly everyone is entitled to an opinion. Apparently there are some 1 & 2 star reviewers who lack perspective. Certainly B:LA is not the best movie produced, but certainly it is not the Worst either, not even close. Sorry to those reviewers noted above that it did not meet your standards; but what are your standards? If you wanted to see more aliens, there are \\"alien\\" dominated movies available and there are many video games that would probably suit you better. The acting was not \\"bad\\" at all;the characters seemingly acted like people rather than actors. That really rubbed you the wrong way apparently. Within a few hours, Earth was attacked by apparent superior technology in limited areas picked for a specific purpose.  The enemy did not have sufficient technology nor apparent personnel to attack the entire Earth at once. How would the reviewers noted above respond to \\"aliens\\" attacking their houses, with drones/etc and 8+ foot soliders? Like actors or like people under duress in life threatening situations?     I am still constantly amazed by people who choose to pick apart books, movies, etc as if they were completely worthless attempts at entertainment.  Those types of movies and books are out there; apparently those reviewers have never attempted to locate them and obviously haven't been unfortunate enough to accidently view them. I have rated half a dozen movies this year as  1 or 2 star movies. They were far far worse than B:LA, even though only one of them fit the genre: i.e., Battle for Los Angles.  That movie unfortunately lacked what B:LA provided, entertainment.  The Marines in B:LA were not bad either; they acted a lot like.........MARINES. Too bad that apparently most of the 1 & 2 Star reviewers lack perspective and I would suppose they lack \\"battle experience\\" also. Just an opinion.

1597801585|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi is fast becoming one of my favorite writers. Not because he so deftly speculates on the more pressing social and environmental issues currently ignored by most of our so-called leaders, but that he does so with such an effortless ease in mixing his ominous messages with exciting and thought provoking stories. Readers like myself may just enjoy the escapism of a good, suspenseful dystopia without getting depressed that it might actually be true within a few decades.    Bacigalupi's science fiction is odd in that there is an uneasy anachronistic feel to his near-future milieu.  His stories are set against omnipresent backdrops and/or rumors of rising seas, dissolving borders, and energy scarcity (coal,oil). The only energy available is that which humans expend or is inefficiently dissipating within their makeshift and inefficient coils and springs.    Such is the case with Bacigalupi's novel The Windup Girl.  A longer exposition of two stories found within his collection \\"Pump Six and Other Stories\\", The Windup Girl is a novel of totality in a new, yet stagnant-world order.  It is a story of scavenging and survival on multiple tenuous levels: of a kingdom, its government ministries, corporations, and its occupants.    It's a story of archetypes more than anything.  Amid the wondrous, giant lolling megodonts and overcrowded towers of crime lords and suffocating tenants, The Windup Girl describes the ebb and flow of power-hungry generals and governmental ministers, the infiltrating genehacks of farang agri-corporates, the unpredictable order infused with terror by the incorruptible white shirts, the \\"yellow-card\\" immigrant Chinese fighting for scraps within a so-called welcoming Thai society, and the not-so-human consorts trying not to overheat in the incessant, sopping humidity.  It's a story that sparks with every intermingling among these factions, inevitably bursting with the sad disappointment of human predictability, better termed samsara, that Bacigalupi has such a firm grasp of.    The genius of Bacigalupi's writing is found not just in what is necessarily written, but equally in what is evoked by his speculation. Massive societal contractions and expansions in Asia, Finnish anti-corporate insurgence, and the ascendancy of potential seats of power in Iowa, of all places, all due rising hunger and seas. It is inspired with the tension and vision of the Blade Runner worldview, but for a new generation of science fictioneers that is entirely original and engrossing.
0545259088|3.0|If this series hadn't been promoted as a trilogy, I'd be waiting for the 4th book.  A terrific story overall, but the ending was really disappointing -- unsatisfying.  If the story had been a little longer, perhaps the author could have let us in on a definite, all-questions-answered conclusion.  But my favorite in this series will always be the first book, SHIVER.  The ending in that book is what an ending should always be -- totally satisfying even though it may put a tear in your eye!  Unfortunately, FOREVER, just left me thinking, \\"huh?\\"

I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but when I went to the theater, WOW! It was AMAZING! Extremely epic, fantastic acting, and one of the best scores of the year and great visual effects. I saw it again the next weekend and can't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray. Tom Hiddleston was the best actor of the entire film (though they were all great).
0060555661|1.0|To be fair to the buyer, this book would have been better marketed as \\"Extensive Commentary on 'The Intelligent Investor,' Accompanied by its Actual Text,\\" Zweig, Jason (Many thanks to the Estate of Benjamin Graham, which didn't Care what Use I Made of his Book).<br /><br />Mr. Graham's own, classic words can serve as an excellent guide for picking promising stocks with intelligence and dispassion. His manic-depressive \\"Mr. Market\\" is a useful anthropomorphism of the stock markets, and envisioning this hapless character may help one to avoid overreacting to the markets' daily antics. Mr. Graham makes a great case for buying stocks with his \\"margin of safety,\\" i.e. in companies that possess assets undervalued by the stock price. His writing style is careful and economical.<br /><br />Unfortunately Mr. Zweig, editor of this edition, is wordy and full of hyperbole. He is not a great author, but is obviously proud of having landed the gig of explaining one. He repeats Graham's every concept in idiosyncratic footnotes on almost every page, and appends to each chapter one of his own that adds very little except paper. Reading this edition is sort of like having Shakespeare explained to you in great detail by a hack playwright. Mr. Zweig would do us a great favor by backing off in his next edition, and cutting his own verbiage by at least 50%.

Cons:  Can be a little heavy over time  Buttons on headset can not be configured for very many applications - only for gaming purposes.    I love this headset and I use it everyday for work.

B003Z2LAAO|5.0|Do you like the Dave Matthews Band? What about Robert Redford? Ever want to know what makes John F. Kennedy's son tick ?<br />Well for me, I didn't like Dave Matthews (until I saw this), liked Robert Redford n a couple of movies, and liked listening to RFK on Air America. The real reason you want to see this movie is to see the Grand Canyon in 3-D. This movie does an EXCELLENT job of that. The depth is simply jaw dropping.<br />A lot of people who hated this movie called it preachy, and made it seem like this was for latte drinking liberals. Well, guess what folks, potable water is a limited resource, and if you can't come to this conclusion, you have been following the rhetoric of global warming is a scam funded by the Koch Brothers. The truth is we do have some protected land that some private industry can't buy up and exploit. THANKFULLY! Wow, I'm getting off topic, I guess that makes me care about our environment, and some may even call me a tree-hugger.<br />Anyway, take a trip in a canoe with RFK's family and appreciate the beautiful effects of 3-D. Every person I showed this movie to said like they felt like they were going to get wet when the water splashed out. There are a lot of aerial shots that will take you far away from reality. This is my personal favorite of all 3-D movies, and surprisingly one of the least expensive. Thanks for reading my rant. I'm off to watch this movie for the seventh time.

The book was an easy read, but it felt like one long bridge section building up to something that never happened.<br /><br />I hate to say it, but this is reminding me very much so of the last FIVE books by the late Robert Jordan.  He too could write a thousand pages of nothing and make you enjoy it.  You spend your time on what appears to be a hearty meal only to find that you've eaten nothing but filler.<br /><br />ADWD should have been a full meal.  It was barely a snack.
B00003CXCD|5.0|Angel Audrey Hepburn and Gregory Peck are around. With a great story and a world renowned cast, this movie should get more than 5 stars. A must have for any collector's collections despite the fact the movie has been seen by me umpteen number of times.
0670022411|5.0|I chose to read this book after reading a review of it in a newspaper. It was definitely not my usual type of read but the story synopsis intrigued me. I must say I truly enjoyed the book and could not conceive how the book would end. I enjoyed all the characters but felt some were not given enough dialogue, description or character development. They seemed to be just thrown in causing an over crowding of characters - were they ALL important and necessary to the plot - to a point. Could some have been done without - I think so. I also found that a few times I had to go back and reread some pages to understand fully what was being talked about - alchemy is not my strong suit. Would I recommend this book to anyone? It would depend on the person. This book is not for everyone but it definitley was enjoyable for me right to the end.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|Whenever I see James Stewart anywhere, I don't think as he's in movies which have left a mark both in the world of entertainment, art,acting,stories. You can't go wrong on James Stewart.
1612130283|5.0|Like many of the other reviewers here, I fell in love with this story in another format, but this published version is so much better, in my opinion, with out the distraction of the other characters names. I have been able to lose myself in the world of Fifty Shades of Grey multiple times and am eagerly waiting for the next book to be published.    I can't tell you how happy I was to finally get my hands on the paperback version of this beautiful story!
0671027344|4.0|Dear Charlie,    How are you? Haven't heard from you since 1992, hope you are doing great. I guess you must be a writer now. I have to say, receiving your letters is one of my greatest moments, knowing that there is someone out there experiencing something which are similar, make me feel like I'm not alone. You probably won't get this, but still I want to tell you I enjoyed reading your letters very much.    I find it hilarious no matter it was 1991 or 2010 teenage problems are just similar - Love, friends, family, school, drugs and sex. There are not simply teenage problems even adults might sometimes run into these problems. No matter how old we are, we are always trying to fit in. Either in a new school or a new company, it is really hard to live without any friend. No matter how tough we said we were, in a way or two we still need some companies.    Friends just come and go. You guys might be best friends for a few years but gradually you guys will grow apart. I'm not saying you guys argued or not friends anymore but once you are not sharing the same social circle (graduated/ changed jobs), it just happens. You guys will still have a good laugh and talk once in a while, however, it just not the same anymore. I'm not saying friendships don't last. I'm just saying that we got different friends in different stage of our life.     Somehow there must be someone in the old days you loved but couldn't be together, just like you and Sam. You guys might have been real best friends for while, nevertheless, never move on to the next stage. The part that I never could understand was, you both love each other. Then what held you back? The most common reason is either one you were ready but please define \\"ready\\"?     Charlie I want to know more about your life, how are Sam and Patrick doing. Reading your story make me understand what kind of person I should be as a friend - a supportive one. Being there for your friends are very important, no matter how they think about you,it only thing matters is how you think of them. I always know I'm an outcast (sometimes), people could easily misunderstand me It's really hard for people to understand you when you are always so loud and crazy. I know you are the opposite but you've found your way, I hope I do too.     I start reading those books, which are your favourites, and I hope I will be inspired by them as much as you did. I would love meet you in person, I think we could really be good friends. Don't think the day will come, Anyways, hope you all the best, and I will always miss you.    Love,  Your Friend
1572814349|3.0|Kat Black's Golden Tarot is well researched and fun to look at. The image symbolism is derived from the classic and popular Rider/Waite Tarot, but is comprised of collaged images from Renaissance art works. The composition of each card face is easily recognizable, so even a moderately experienced cartomancier/e can recognize the card face and understand its meaning.<br /><br />US Games produces a nice package: The cards come in a hard box with a small book by Black outlining card meanings. The cards themselves have a beautiful gold gilt edge which gives them a stunning presentation.<br /><br />The printing of the cards is lackluster somehow. The imagery seems muted and one-dimensional. Given the extravagance of the presentation, it seems strange that the actual card production should suffer from a mediocre print job. I was disappointed having coveted these cards for about a year now. The imagery, as stated above, is derived from traditional decks, but is comprised of artistic collages; though Black's detailing is truly amazing, and at times it's difficult to discern where the pieces of the collage merge and fall off from each other, the images are not as artfully crafted the Millenium Tarot, based on a similar idea, and which are published at a higher print standard.<br /><br />If you're looking for a really stunning set, a gift, or even a collector's deck, consider Black's Golden Tarot, but don't get overexcited - for me, the lackluster printing really diminishes their appeal. If you're looking for a truly unique and gorgeous Tarot that will draw you deeply into the symbolism, artistry and luscious printing - get the Millenium Tarot.
1451629184|5.0|I can't think of anything I might add to the many 5-star reader reviews that doesn't sound like a cliche.  Jaycee Dugard is brave, adorable, very bright and is a very bright light indeed, not to mention the fact that she is a credit to the human race, and it's been a while since I've heard or read those words!  I cried more than once while reading her book and I am truly shocked at what she endured during all the years of her captivity.  I don't know if I would have the strength, the courage, the guts to live through all of it and emerge able to love the people and animals in her life as she does.  This girl has a lot to give and hopefully she won't just disappear into the masses because she has a lot to teach us.    Welcome home, Jaycee!
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|I'm not a kid anymore but this music certainly makes me feel young at heart.  Vibrant music and superb vocals.
B001UV4XWY|2.0|Spoiler alert here, and by the way the whole movie is spoiled. I should have pushed the off button on my TV, but I stuck it out. You know, this was one of those movies I really wanted to like. It had some good actors, clean production values, great representation of the 1970's NASA. And it had potential, conspiracy sci-fi and horror rolled into one. But someone forgot to write a script. What do you get when you have a NASA lab, and bad guys. But you never figure out who the bad guys are... First they are NSA, then CIA, then a rogue former NASA official, then aliens; no wait maybe they're angels; no wait they are from another dimension, maybe demons... Aaaarghh. All that is bad enough, but they never do answer the question. And why the heck do they have people make a choice of a gateway, telling them one is the path to salvation and the other is to hell, and then start all over again. Why do they kidnap people and put them in these water transportation gates that simply send people back to their house again? And what is the difference between people they call test subjects and people they call employees? Be assured you will have tons of questions that are tantalizing and fun, as you wait for the big payoff..... that never comes!
B003YHSE7W|2.0|I LOVED the first one.  This one had its moments but it was TOO BORING! Too much Tony Stark and not enough Iron Man if you know what I mean. I loved the last 30 minutes.  The fight scene was great, but the overall movie IMO was a bust!
B0017ZAVTC|4.0|Mogadishu  - not a place you want to go and vacation.....at least not in 1992 when this \\"Black Hawk Down\\" disaster took place.    After seeing the film a few times, I thought I'd finally get around to reading all the details about this brutal historical event in Mark Bowden's book. I wasn't disappointed. My only complaint on the book was the maps didn't always seem to jive with the descriptions of the events as they were unfolding, which was frustrating.    Still, it's an amazing true-life account and Bowden spares no details in describing it, both good and bad.
1592536913|5.0|This glossy, detailed book is a fabulous reference for any Steampunk fan. With page after page of sharp photos the reader is provided with a seemingly endless list of names for an Etsy binge, as well as inspiration for his/her own creations. A gorgeous display of artistic talent!
B001LF3YQK|1.0|i added this item to my wish list cause i'm a sucker for cool design.     much to my dismay the folks at skip hop did NOT stick to the tried-and-true credo of \\"FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION\\"    the red dot required two hands to slide (one hand to hold the case, the other hand to do the sliding).    worst of all the wipes dried out after less than one week. i'm so, so bummed. and, my baby's bum is not loving the dried out wipes. back to the plastic baggie for travel wipe storage.
159514188X|1.0|I guess I'm one of the few people who didn't like this book. The narration jumps from character to character, from past to present, from male voice to female voice, sometimes after one or two sentences, which completely chops up the flow of the story. Just as I'd start to feel involved with the character and plot, the story would jump to another place and time, another point of view, then three sentences later it was back to the original character; two sentences later, switches again. Very jarring. Made it hard to get lost in the story. But my biggest complaint is Hannah, who is incredibly unlikeable, very whiney and overly sensitive. Her voice is bitter and spiteful--and not in a way that made me sympathize with her, in a way that made me dislike her (and therefore not care about her). I expected her tapes to reveal something big, some surprising revelations that would create an interesting plot. But her accusations came across as the typical, minor slights that most of us have endured and get past with a shrug and roll of our eyes. I kept waiting for the big event, the climax that would make me think, \\"Wow, now I get it. That's terrible.\\" Nothing. I kept waiting for an interesting plot twist. Nothing. I kept waiting for Clay to react in some interesting way, besides getting on and off a bus and sitting in a cafe. Nothing. I kept waiting to like Hannah. Never. I think the topic of suicide makes people think this book is important. And maybe it is. But the characters were boring and the plotline was incredibly flat. At the end of each chapter (each tape), I'd think, \\"That's it? I guess the next chapter will be the big one.\\" But it never was.
B004OEIL5E|4.0|I love the movies. I'm an HD freak, so it's safe to say I'm satisfied with the picture quality. As far as the Special Features, it didn't have that many, but if you're buying the Blu-ray for the movie by itself, it's a great purchase.
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you like Tina Fey, you will love this book.  It's a funny, easy read.  It provides an account of her life and how she has come to be the person she is, the people she has met and worked with along the way, and how she has gotten to play the roles she has played.  She tells the story about how she received her scar, the story behind the Sarah Palin look-alike roles; she gives insight and hilarious, relateable accounts of using skin products that caused unexpected results, her battle with her own perception of her body, her struggle with contacts and the wearing of those style-setting glasses.  All women can relate to her experiences!      If you are upset by her Sarah Palin skits you have one of two options: (1)read it and find out the truth and reasons for the skits or (2) just don't read it if you don't have an open mind.      The only reason I didn't give this book a rating of 5 is the slow part in the middle of the book that gives a bit too much detail into interaction with family, whereas the rest of the book moved along quickly.  You will find out why the book is titled \\"Bossypants\\", but be ready for an autobiography all about Tina.
1594744769|5.0|Before I get into what I thought of the plot, characters and such I first want to mention how beautifully put together Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is. Keeping with the vintage photographs within its pages, the book itself looks like a vintage book that you might see in an old library if you remove the dust jacket. I love the overall look and feel of the book.<br /><br />I admit to looking through the pictures first before actually reading the novel. I wondered how the creepy (sometimes disturbing and freaky) photos would work in the story but when I finally actually read it they did. The photos were part of the experience that is Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children. I think some might be put off by the pictures though (especially those who don't like to read scary story) but don't let the pictures fool you, this novel is NOT a horror story. Instead it was a fantastic adventure story with a whimsical quality to it and right from page one it grabbed me and wouldn't let go until the very last page. The plot was fast-paced and the back story of how Miss Peregrine's Home came to be was fascinating. I loved the characters, especially the peculiar children and their unusual abilities. All the characters have their own personality and you just grow to love them.<br /><br />This novel has something for everybody: fast-paced adventure, mystery, unusual characters, magic with just a dash romance. It's spooky and quirky and touching all at the same time. The writing was slightly awkward at times but it didn't take away from my enjoyment of the story. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />I rate it a 4.5/5 stars.<br /><br />Reviewed by Michelle for Michelle & Leslie's Book Picks book blog
0316777722|4.0|I love David Sedaris and his work.  If you understand his sense of humor and enjoy him as an author you will love this book.  \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day\\" is a collection of essays each of which cracked me up!  This book provides an account of his life story - which is not what I would consider as being 'normal'.  If you don't like or understand dry humor or if you don't think, or are not knowledgeable, on a global level you may overlook many of the funny moments.  David's work is often compared to that of Mark Twain's.  I have read other books by David such as; \\"Barrel Fever\\", \\"Naked\\", and \\"Holidays on Ice\\".  I have enjoyed all 4 of thes books!
0061997811|5.0|Everyone seems to agree that this is a fantastic book, myself included.  One of my favorite aspects of the book is that the information is presented in a unique style that reminds me of a scrapbook, and includes a variety of fold-outs and inserts.  Some of these inserts can be removed from the book (for example, in case you wanted to display something on your wall).<br /><br />The following is a list of all the \\"inserts\\" included within the book:<br /><br />Harry's invitation letter to Hogwarts<br />Borgin & Burkes catalog<br />Advanced Potion Making manual (with stickers)<br />Hogsmeade Product cut-outs<br />Quidditch World Cup event program<br />Yule Ball program<br />4x Umbridge's Educational Decrees<br />Marauder's Map<br />Weasley's Wizard Wheezes product catalog<br />Ministry of Magic ID Card<br /><br />This is a great book for Harry Potter fans.  However, I should point out that there is another book that is a larger and more complete look at the whole series: [[ASIN:0062101897 Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey]].  The Film Wizardry doesn't include Deathly Hallows Part II, so you may want to wait for this new book, which has more content related to the final film.  Of course, it doesn't hurt to own both books!
0307269981|4.0|Loved the series; all three books were filled with action and detailed accounts of situations.  Pay attention... if you miss a detail or don't remember a character you will get lost.  The entire series is captivating.<br /><br />The story behind Steig Larsson is also quite unique.  After completing this series he died - he was much to young.  Read about the author and you will find interest in him and want to read his books!
B000003S09|1.0|Music = Drug induced hippie acid tripping noise.  Lyrics = Hippie dippy artsy fartsy pipers and fairies hogwash tripe.     And that's putting it mildly.
0307269752|4.0|This is a great book with an intriguing story.  You won't want to put it down!  Even though I read it on the beach I wouldn't recommend it as a beach read.  There are many details and characters to keep track of.  If you are distracted or don't catch one of the details you will be lost and not understand what's going on.  Pay attention to the characters and story line because you will need the knowledge in the next to books.  Once you get started you won't be able to put this book down.  This sounds cliche, but it's a \\"page-turner\\".  If you need your sleep don't keep it on the bed side table because you won't want to stop reading it and the time will pass by quicker than expected.
B004WKOCP8|1.0|I understand Incubus is older and more mature but that doesn't mean they should forget how to write interesting songs.  Everything on this album is just bland, bland bland.  This sounds more like something the late-game, washed-up version of Live or Collective Soul would release, not the energetic group that brought us SCIENCE, Make Yourself, and Morning View.  Just awful all around.
030726999X|4.0|Drama, drama, drama!  This book is full of action and keeps your mind racing!  After reading the first two books you know the characters and their personalities and find yourself hoping for the best for the characters you love and hoping for revenge on the antagonist(s).  Read the first two books before this one as they are sequential.  If you like a mind-boggling book full of twists and turns you will love the series.  Takes more attention than a beach read.
1451629184|4.0|I am glad I read this story from her perspective as I have read other books about this story. I am so impressed that she could write about her ordeal and that she came out of that situation with the ability to see it for what it was. She is able to separate herself from that cruelty and people who have no remorse or sane agendas. Good for her being the great mother she is and for embracing life like she does. She is an inspiration.
0439023491|1.0|If you didn't like the first book, don't waste your time.  If you enjoyed the first book and became caught up in the story, use your imagination and creativity to think of your own ending.  This book was boring and a waste of time.  Highly disappointing.
0553801473|2.0|but I bought it a Borders at their going out of business sale.  I never thought I say this, but too much of the wisecracking Tyrion and little forward momentum of the story.  I found myself fighting the urge to skip chapters to a Daenerys chapter or a Jon chapetr but those stalled also.  The book is in serious need of some professional editing.
0446691437|4.0|This book says what we all know who are trying to create, write, or complete project: we are blocked by resistance.  It is written in short insights, one per page, so it is easily picked up and put down.  It does take a long time to get around to proffering the advice of how to counter the resistance, but it is there.  It is not new information but a fresh way of looking at the situation and then dealing with it.  It may be helpful depending on just what is causing your \\"resistance\\" or it may just point out the problems you were already aware of.
0307474712|1.0|Let me start by saying that I bought this book because of all of the positive feedback it had received, and I feel deceived!  All I can say is, \\"Thank God I bought it at Half Price Books!\\"  This is one of the worst books I have read recently.  The premise of the book is interesting: looking in on the characters lives on the same day over the course of years.  However, it would have been nice to have characters that I cared about.  Dexter, or \\"Dex\\" as he is called, is an awful character, with few if any redeeming qualities, and Emma seems more like a bystander and plot device than a character.<br /><br />Dex was born with a silver spoon in his mouth and has never really had to work for anything in his life (whether because his parents gave it to him, or it just happened to fall into his lap). He refuses to grow up and stop his partying/drinking/sleeping around, because everything is about him--even when his mother gets sick and dies, he doesn't  sober up and think about what he is doing with his life (well, beyond wanting to make lots of money). The fact that it takes him so long to realize that he needs other people in his life just drives me up the wall. He has many opportunities to connect with Emma and create a relationship, but he usually winds up sleeping with another woman. In general, his character never really engages in any growth; near the end when something bad happens, rather than handling it like an adult he drinks himself into oblivion and abandons his responsibilities.<br /><br />And Emma.  What can I say about poor Emma.  Her character does do some growing up and evolving (though it takes entirely too long and I have to deal with way too much of her my-life/job-sucks angst), but I felt that often her story became secondary to Dex's story. Too much of the story revolved around Dex forever recovering from his alcohol and drug use and his emotional hangups, and Emma just sort of became the \\"cure\\" more than a love interest (plus, she didn't really have much going on in her story--she worked in that crappy job she hated for entirely too long...there is only so much of that one can take before your eyes glaze over).  Besides, I never understand why Emma likes Dex--he's an immature, narcissistic, emotionally stunted playboy who is totally in love with himself from the get-go, and then there are the added negatives called alcohol and drug abuse.  Why did she love him so much that she essentially waited around for 20 years (she does date some other guy, but she never seems serious with him)?  And how sad is that: her waiting around for this complete jerk for 20 years? I never understand Dex and Emma's relationship at all, though.  Neither seems to really like the other at first, but I'm supposed to believe that they connected and fell in love over the course of one day they spent together after having drunkenly slept together the night of their university graduation? A strong enough connection that Emma is still hung up on him 20 years later?  I think not.  It just made Emma seem pitiful, really, because Dex was certainly not pining for (or even thinking about) her all those years.<br /><br />In addition to my hating one of the main characters (Dex, in case there is any doubt), I was also highly disappointed with the writing in general. It was boring, overly detailed on stupid things, underdeveloped where it counts (character development, plot, a general theme to the events in the whole book beyond them happening on the same day), not at all funny 99% of the time (I might have cracked a smile or two, I cannot recall), and did I mention BORING?  At times I was wondering why I even needed to read about something (like a lot of the lost years where Emma and Dex lose touch...or the whole book).  I will admit to a lot of scanning and skipping in this book, because there was just so much wasteful filler.  I think I skimmed most of the middle part of the book, right up to the ending.  And oh, the ending.  I won't spoil it foranyone...but I felt it was a cop out.  It wasn't tragic or emotional (because the writing was too bad for me to actually be engaged emotionally) it just...was.  Overall, I didn't understand the hype about this book, because I didn't find it at all enjoyable.  And before anybody who has read it and knows how it ends says anything...I would have hated this book even with a \\"happy\\" ending...although, making those two characters appear happy would have been a real challenge, because they were both pretty miserable most of the book.was a cop out.

076790382X|2.0|This was required summer reading for my son's AP \\"English\\" class. He is an avid reader but is trudging through this book.  At first it seems quirky and interesting but is repetitive and meandering.  He said it is like reading an entire book of editorial magazine columns without the benefit of reading what the editorial is on.
B00020HEG6|5.0|I bought this CD to replace one that was in my car when it was stolen. I love this music! My favorite is \\"The knight bus\\". What a combination of weird and wonderful sounds! The orchestra must have had a ball with that one! The entire soundtrack is befitting of the magical world of Harry Potter!
B0050CQY1W|3.0|I honestly only like 3 songs from the album. If Beyonce was expecting high sales she is going to be really disappointed. The songs are weak there is not one strong single that I can see at reaching top 10. Her last album was so much better. The songs grow on you after a couple of listenings but is not an album worth mention.
192076920X|5.0|This book has been one of the best books I ever red , fascinating history , real one, simple, amazing ,,, wonder if the countinuing of this book will be printed in future. english is not my language, and this book has been so great and easy to read .
B004EBT5CU|4.0|I have heard of Adele before but had never heard her music until her single Rolling in the Deep came out. This song caught my attention, her voice mostly. When I got the album through a friend I thought I wasn't going to like it. Never been into british music like Duffy, Winehouse and her. However I was wrong... I love this album from start to finish. The music, the lyrics are amazing. The way she sings these song with so much passion. I think Set Fire to the Rain is an amazing record better than Rolling in the Deep. This girl has soul and she is truly talented. You can feel her pain, heartbreak and love through her songs. It is an amazing album. I would have to say the best album of 2011.
1589795474|5.0|I definitely recommend giving this book a read. It provides many good thoughts on what a typical \\"millionaire\\" really is in the US.  If you want to get a book that highlights differences between who has wealth and who doesn't, despite their profession and style of living, then this book is a must read.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|SPOLERS:  The final battle should have been done closer to the books.  Harry kills LV ALONE in the movie?  And the body DISAPPEARS?!!  How does he even prove LV is dead?  The book ending was better.  Harry explains about the wand and about Snape to LV in front of a crowd and then kills him.  The body remains.  That's the way it should be.  Some of the most dramatic scenes were altered.  Neville killing the snake was better done in the book than the movie.  When everyone thinks Harry is dead, Ginny is the only one upset in the movie.  What?!!!<br /><br />I still liked the movie, but why take something great (the book) and make it into something average?
B0018TLRTK|5.0|I like this album and listen to it often, I don't have a problem with any song thats on it.
B004ZGI1V0|1.0|Awful. This movie tries to be The Fugitive with a twist. His an assasin that loses his memory and thinks he REALLY is married to his \\"wife\\". Lame, lame lame. Rent it if you must but dont expect to be \\"entertained.\\"
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|When I saw the interview with Diane Saywer, I was rivited to the TV and really wanted to read the details that could not be told on TV.  I was disappointed.  The first half of the book was good, but I was expecting more.  I've read more graphic books before.  I did however have to put it down in the middle because I was bored.  I forced myself to finish it a day later.  It was ameturish in writing and needed to be edited more carefully.  Though I was not impressed with the book, I am extremely impressed with her survival and recovery.  Jaycee is a person to be admired.  I am happy that I have helped her with the purchase of this book.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I got this from Amazon for free as it was free for a day but in retrospect would happily buy. The ability of the app to 1) learn non-words which I use all the time 2) predict what I am going to type makes it very much worth it. Very handy for messaging and SMSes
B000002JSP|5.0|Carouselambra is the best Zeppelin track, ever!  Sorry c@ck rockers....You just don't get this album.  Stick to the Lemon Song.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|GRMM just doesn't seem to care about this series any longer. I honestly think if it hadn't been for the HBO series this book would have never released. Despite the great length of this latest installment, almost nothing gets resolved and little progress is made in the many plot lines. At the end I was left feeling angry and sad that it does seem like GRRM is the next Robert Jordan with how he's treating this series by dragging it out to painful lengths. I'll probably buy the next one if it's released in a year, but if it's dragged out like these last two were, I've just lost faith that they're worth the wait.
B0051MKNV8|5.0|My wife and I saw this in the theater when it first opened.  We saw the trailer on TV and knew we would not be able to wait until it came on satellite.  We were not disappointed.  One thing that makes this movie really great is that it is easy to buy into the premise right away.  A pill that lets you access 100% of your brain.  That is where 99% of the fiction starts and stops - most everything else in the movie is very believable.  The pill doesn't make you fly, or levitate things, or read minds, it just lets you use 100% of your brain.  Imagine how smart you would be if you simply never forgot anything - even the stuff you didn't know you knew at all!  This movie lets you peek into that world.  It also shows how stupid you can be when you are so smart - the trouble the main character gets into could very easily be avoided (but then the movie would not be much to watch!).    The only disappointment was the \\"Extended Cut\\" - I didn't see much besides about 10 seconds of footage that added nothing to the movie.  The trailer shows things that are never said in the movie - why not include those scenes in the extneded cut or at least on a deleted scenes reel.  The alternate ending is not much of an alternate.  Excellent movie, disappointing extras on the DVD.

1452101248|5.0|This cookbook is phenomenal.  It is so creative, I love leafing through it, and the food is very good and comforting.  I think because this cookbook is consistent and really celebrates simple ingredients and methods, I find myself really relaxing when I cook.  I have way too many cookbooks for someone who doesn't love to cook...but this is the only cookbook that seems to be changing that.  Some of my favorites are the shakshuka, the baked eggs with yogurt, the socca, and the black bean quesadilla.  Makes a beautiful gift as well!
B003INBNXO|5.0|I'm surprised by the comments about dubbing. I really enjoy martial arts movies and I don't mind that their lips don't coinside with the spoke script. I love watching the fighting and would be very distracted if I had to keep reading the bottom of the screen.  You can't really do both efficently, so I dont mind...rather appreciate the dubbing
B002IR3PSC|4.0|This DVD/CD package is an absolute must have for any Jethro Tull fan; finally a concert DVD from the classic 1970s period and the closest thing possible to having a video version of Tull's seminal live album `Bursting Out.'<br />The set comes in a fantastic shiny Digipak containing a booklet with photos and linear notes from Jethro Tull frontman Ian Anderson himself as well as manager Terry Ellis.<br /><br />Now for the interesting part; the original broadcast only features 50 minutes of recorded footage, but Jethro Tull played an hour and a half long concert so the cd contains a 78 minute long version of the concert (with all the dead air and segments without music edited out) while the DVD contains the full video concert, plus seven audio only bonus tracks and you can choose to either `play all,' or `play video only.' Perhaps this was an inelegant solution but considering the fact that the rest of the concert wasn't filmed it seems to me the best solution available given the circumstances.<br /><br />It also seems pertinent to mention that there are a few visual hiccups and one audio problem owing to the nature of the very old satellite broadcast from which the concert is taken but this are few and far between, easily forgivable and do not hamper your overall enjoyment of the show. The people putting the DVD together took every care to restore as much of the concert to as high a standard as possible without damaging the music and it shows.<br /><br />Now with all that out of the way, it seems about time to discuss the concert. And what a concert it is, `On Fire,' scarcely describes just how energetic and captivating the Tull performance is, bringing the songs to life in ways the album versions hint at, adding proggy intros to `Sweet Dream,' and `Songs From The Wood,' and sticking extended jam sessions to the end of `No Lullaby,' and `Locomotive Breath,' and adding a flair and energy to every single piece that justifies why fans have been crying out for live material from this era for so long. The band even have two uncredited jam sessions including a `Conundrum,' style piece with full Drum solo after the first performance of `Locomotive Breath,' and `God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen,' with a full band jam session after `No Lullaby.'<br /><br />Ian's voice is magnificent and he rips through different styles from the soft `One Brown Mouse,' to the deep `My God,' with no trouble at all, and special mention must go to the absolutely storming rendition of `Thick as a Brick,' which is absolutely gigantic, if you had your doubts about the DVD they'll have been erased by the time the drums kick in.<br /><br />That's not to say that Ian is the only one going above and beyond the call of duty, Martin Barre absolutely murders his guitar during the solos on `No Lullaby,' `Aqualung,' and `Locomotive Breathe,' while Barriemore Barlow rolls and flails his way across the drum kit like a madman at times, while always maintaining a precise and complicated beat that'd leave many other drummers scratching their heads.<br /><br />When I first saw this package I was worried it would be some poor quality bootleg slapped together with compressed audio, blurry pixilated video and a terrible box and as it turns out nothing could be further from the truth, this is a fantastic package with excellently mixed audio (really clear mix, all elements be they guitar leads, kick drum, piano, xylophone or Mr. Anderson vocals are audible and either clear or punchy where appropriate) as great a job on the video as could be done with the source material (It looks better on my HDTV than even some of the stuff on Tull's `Jack in the Green,' and all of their `Slipstream,' DVDs) and a classy Digipak style box to house it all in.<br /><br />Best of all; the CD/DVD package isn't going for a stupid high price either, so if you want a Jethro Tull DVD from the 70s you can sigh in relief knowing you won't be ripped off either monetarily or in terms of quality..

0425105709|5.0|As with many of Agatha Christie's mysteries, \\"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\\" is known by various titles, but this is perhaps the most fitting, being one of her works that focuses on nursery rhymes.  Elements of the plot and certain clues fit the title rhyme quite nicely, all adding up to the ever present, classic Christie twist.  This is an enjoyable, hard to figure out Hercule Poirot mystery.<br /><br />Readers are given a treat at the beginning of the novel, an image of the erudite and arrogant Poirot in a state of trepidation.  Over some big case?  No, because he must pay a visit to the dentist.  When his dentist is discovered dead later on that same day, Poirot is not satisfied with the ruling of suicide.  There is no way that Dr. Morley would have killed himself, but who had means and motive to do so?  Could it have been one of his high-profile clients, or more likely someone who wanted him out of the way?  Could this possibly be a case featuring international discontent aimed at an important man in England?  What about the female patient who suddenly disappears soon after Morley's death? Poirot takes it upon himself to search out the answers, but too many clues begin to add up all too quickly, with several red herrings throwing him far afield.  But, as usual, by arranging his little grey cells, he comes to the astonishing, and correct, conclusion.<br /><br />\\"One, Two, Buckle My Shoe\\" is a delightful Poirot mystery, fast-paced wtih just enough to always keep the reader guessing.  Sometimes a Christie mystery can feel too dated for today's world, and while this one is definitively placed (I loved a character talking about seeing the \\"new Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film\\"), the story rings timely, and therefore these elements fade into the background.  Readers will be just as stumped and fluxomed as Poirot for much of the read - this is certainly not one that I figured out, which makes me like it all the more.  It is a fine example of why Christie was and still is the queen of mystery.stery.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I am not usually a fan of dark fantasy, but found myself entranced by Beautiful Darkness.  The writing is terrific and the characters are well-developed.  Even the side characters are great, especially Link who is hilarious.  My least favorite character is Lena, but I still find myself pulling for her and Ethan.
B004ZQBOK0|5.0|Finally, a band who takes all the coolest elements of 80's theatrical rock/glam, combines it with 90's metal and mixes in some 00's metalcore and gets it right.  Any of those 3 styles would sound dated or just overdone(metalcore) today by themselves.  BVB takes the best aspects of each and combines it with their own considerable talent to come up with a blend that is just awesome.  Before trying to pigeonhole this band into a certain genre, listen to some of the YouTube videos with Andy talking about what he wanted the band to be.  These guys loved the theatrics of Kiss and Motley Crue and wanted to bring that kind of show back to the fans.  I found this band through the Fallen Angels and The Legacy videos and just loved it.  Set The World on Fire is a great CD.  I also went back and got their 1st CD which I figured would be a weaker \\"work in progess\\" kind of thing but I was way wrong !  The 1st CD is also great.  Specific shout outs to the guitarwork of Jake and Jinx and the killer drumming by Christian.  This band has the potential for superstardom.  Let's just hope they can keep everything together and mature into the longterm SuperGroup I know they can be.

B00005JPUN|5.0|The best thing about the film is, it maintains a genuine atmosphere throughout. Each and every situation taking place, makes us smile, makes us wonder and makes us feel terrified along with the characters and  what makes the whole thing more attractive is, an excellent performance by Nicole Kidman, who gives in enough life and flamboyancy to her character. A v ery good performance from Jackson Bond who plays Oliver  (Nicole's son) with full potential. Overall, the performances in the film are very precise and makes you believe everything happening around. It maynot be a masterpiece, but sure is a tiny gem of cinema.

B004A79JME|5.0|What struck me immediately in the film was the sound track. Especially the song \\"Loving Strangers\\".<br />To say the truth the film left me baffled and confused for the first hour or so. I am not saying that I didn't like the shots of women making love to each other (far from it) or they being naked practically all the duration of the film.<br />I just kept trying to understand the meaning, the message behind all the beauty pictured in the film, represented not only by women making love as if their very life depended on such act but also fairy-like skylines of Rome and a room that felt like a museum of fine arts more than a room in a hotel. It was all majestically opulent and baroque as only Rome can be. And what to say about the waiter that sings operetta....<br />And the song Loving Strangers kept coming back...Maybe we all \\"fall in love\\" in fantasy or reality with a stranger imagining that our lives would be completely different. That perfectness is just a second away from being true. That the solution for all of our problems are there in that stranger we are loving with all the strength that everyday difficulties can generate.<br />Loving Strangers...toying with the idea that somehow life can just for a night be different....and can it be all as simple as that, with no consequences whatsoever?
0307887960|5.0|Hi I'm 63 and have tried many many diets in my life time and this book The Dukan Diet has really helped me on my road to a better life. So far I have lost 20lbs and have about 80lbs to go. It was a little difficult in the first bit but when I started to lose weight it went along just fine. I did have fruit and veggies once a week and it does change the weight loss but I found I needed to have some fruit and veggies from the our garden. But thank you for the chance to lose my weight that I have carried for serval decades.
B004HD61KE|2.0|I have read every single James Rollins book.  In fact, I have read many of them twice.  The Black Order is my absolute favorite of all time.  The Devil Colony is my least favorite.  The nanotechnology aspect wasn't developed as well as I would have liked.  More information about the Damascus Steel would have been welcomed.  The information about neutrinos and the role they play on the earth's stability was interesting.  The Sigma Force team seemed disconnected from each other and the usual adrenaline rush I get from a good Rollins book, just wasn't part of this story.  The villain of the story, Rafael St. Germaine, really didn't seem to be part of the story and his motivation seemed vague.  The codes that were used by Thomas Jefferson and the Lewis & Clark Expedition were an interesting factoid, but just left me wanting more information.  I will always read James Rollins, but honestly, I'd rather wait longer between books if that means the stories and the characters will be more developed and interesting.  Waiting for his next offering, it has to be better than this one.  I can't help wondering if this will be the last book with the usual characters, as Monk and Pierce seem to be retiring.
4789004546|5.0|This book's list price is a bit exorbitant, but so far it's returned full value.  It's serious and scholarly without being needlessly academic, and never loses sight of practical application.    It begins with a 60-page overview of Japanese syntax, with multiple useful examples and charts.  Blessedly, all examples are in Japanese script AND romaji--a learner will pick up many common kanji almost by osmosis, while quickly grasping the pronunciation of words.  The last 50 pages are a valuable set of appendices on verb/adjective conjugation, verb classes (including semantic type and transitivity), connecting forms, compound formation, deictic words, numerals, and sentential units, with index.    The bulk of the book, between the intro and appendices, is a 500-page dictionary (arranged alphabetically by romaji reading) of Japanese particles, function words, and linking phrases.  Each 3-5 page entry includes canonically key sentences, notes on formation, several additional examples, and extensive clarifying notes.  One particularly nice touch is the use of RED text for the entry word/phrase in all the examples.    As good as the book is, a couple of additions would be welcome.  For example, syntax is too essential to dispense with in even a large intro: one wishes those 60 pages had been closer to 160. Also, the appendix on classifers/count words was pretty cursory.  That's one of the most difficult areas for a Western speaker to fathom and use correctly; it deserved a more exhaustive list and an in-depth treatment of usage and related syntax.    Those issues aside, this book is an invaluable companion for Japanese learners--but it's not a primer or lesson book.  It's a priceless adjunct to a class or introductory grammar, but can't substitute for one.  As a secondary supporting reference for the learner, though, there IS no substitute.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|I have seen several polarizing reviews of High School of the Dead.  There are those who cannot stand boobs, those who love boobs, and those who actually watched the series and discovered a great anime.  I am with the last group.  For me great series come down to two things: an interesting story and character development; and HotD has that.  I agree that fan service can be over the top sometimes, but if you are intelligent enough to look beyond the boobs, you will find a great series with potential for greatness.  I will spare you from the details of the story because I do not want to spoil it.    If you are hesitant about buying this series because it is only part of a larger story (this is a manga adaption), I will not be worried because this first 12 episodes are self contained and can stand as complete series with a beginning and conclusion.  I am hopeful that more seasons will come out in the near future.  High School of the Dead is a very appealing story and urge everyone to give this anime a chance.
1932100660|5.0|Simply put, this book is a must read for everyone.  It should be a requirement in High School, quite frankly.

B000AM2L1O|5.0|I bought this doll for my daughter and she just loves her baby doll.  We have had the Corolle Calin doll for almost one year now and she still has the wonderful vanilla scent.  This baby doll is very durable and well made.  My daughter is now 2.5 and loves her \\"vanilla baby.\\"  The doll is the perfect size for her to carry.  I am very pleased with the quality of this product.  I have read several reviews about the Corolle Calin doll and many people comment on the two little yellow teeth.  Although the teeth are not super attractive they really don't detract from the dolls appearance.  The teeth are so small and relatively unnoticeable.  I think the teeth are an unnecessary feature but I would buy this doll regardless.  I think Corolle has made a wonderful product and recommend this doll to anyone who is looking for a sweet baby doll with a wonderful scent and quality product.

B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Let's cut to the chase. This film has 3 things going for it that makes it a pretty good romantic comedy --<br /><br />(1) Chemistry:  Mila Kunis and Justin Timberlake interact with each other so well on-screen that at the end of the film you wonder if they ever were a couple in real-life. Their flirtations don't seem forced; their body language is in sync and they seem, at times to be oblivious to the rest of the world (or at least the cameras) in their scenes together.<br /><br />(2) A Strong Supporting Cast: This movie has an embarrassment of riches when it comes to its supporting cast. Richard Jenkins is phenomenal in his role as Timberlake's on-screen dad. And it's a difficult part. He is asked to play a man who is struggling mightily with a life-altering situation but is trying to live with it with all the grace and wit that he can still muster.  Patricia Clarkson, was excellent as well as Mila Kunis's wildly inappropriate mom. (In fact, her character helps the audience understand why her daughter grew up to be such a tightly-wound, Type- A adult.) But, all of the supporting actors, Woody Harrelson was the star. Playing a sexually-aggressive sports editor, he slyly murmurs off-color lines with fantastic comedic timing but also manages to be the film's thought-provoking voice of reason.<br /><br />(3) A Real Script:  At their worst, romantic comedies are mind-numbingly predictable. Many recycle the same plot, plug-in random actors and actresses and simply expect audiences to flock to the theatres. Hollywood seems to be saying \\"hey, I know you have seen `50 First Dates' but we are rolling out a new version starring Luke Wilson and (whoever the `It- Girl of the Moment' is) that you must see.\\" While we may never be able to escape the same ol' storyline (boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy eventually wins girl back by doing something both ludicrous and sweet), this film does its best to try a few new things and it deserves credit for that.<br /><br />In conclusion, does this movie rival the 90s classics like \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"Pretty Woman\\" or even Mila Kunis's prior outstanding film \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\"? No.  But was it really fun to watch on a lazy summer afternoon?  Absolutely.classics like \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" and \\"Pretty Woman\\" or even Mila Kunis's prior outstanding film \\"Forgetting Sarah Marshall\\"?

Especially since Grace too has seemed to have disappeared.<br /><br />With the looming threat of the wolves being hunted and Grace being out there with them Sam and Cole must find a place to move the wolves.<br /><br />In order to save the lives of the wolves and Grace Sam must do something he hoped he would never have to do again.<br /><br />Although Forever is not always filled with action the ability of Maggie Stiefvater to keep a person engaged in the characters provides a fascinating page-turner. She has a way of explaining the thoughts and actions of the characters that makes you feel their emotional trauma right along with them. The love between Sam and Grace tugs at your heart. When you read about Sam's struggle to get his thoughts out into words you feel empathy for him. The relationship between Cole and Isabel was filled with tension. And the drama of the wolves' peril kept me holding my breath wondering which ones would survive. Great job Maggie Stiefvater!

B004RE29PO|4.0|I was able to buy the Alien Anthology Blu Ray for only $50.00 from elsewhere and love the  look and sound of these movies. The second in the Anthology is Aliens which I watched again tonight.  This is a great follow up to the  original classic.  The sound is incredible, and as others have mentioned the picture with the exception of some grain is perfect.  It would have been nice if this was in widescreen format as Alien, but believe it was not shot in that format.  My only issue with the movie is the annoying kid, \\"Newt\\" whose screaming was like finger nails on chalkboard to me!!!!!!  It got to the  point I wanted the Aliens to get her just so shut her up.......Ok, may be a bit harsh, but sure there are others who feel the same way.  I love these Anthology Blu Ray Box Sets and cannot wait for Jurassic Park!  Cant remember, are there any annoying screaming kids in that.........
0553801473|5.0|Okay. I see that some people are disappointed with this book. I think that much of that though is that the story didn't move in the direction that they had expected and/or hoped it to. Personally, I loved it. I got to see a new facet to each and every of my favorite characters. It is a departure yes, but one that offers a sense of realism and truth to characters that (while enjoyable to read) were once one-note wonders in a world of otherwise symphonic complexity.<br /><br />The story and character development continues to be top notch and the prose style is better than ever. If it was a little heavy on the cliff hangers, and unwilling to tie up its story threads, well, there ARE two more books still to come. Well worth the read. Even worth the wait, I think. (And that's saying something.)
B0034G4ORC|4.0|What if there was a coordinated attack by extraterrestrials on several large cities around the world? Of course, we have seen this story before, and BATTLE: LOS ANGELES tackles the premise again. Los Angeles and the surrounding cities are being destroyed and invaded. Millions are fleeing the city, though it is not clear where they all went and how they got there. A group of marines are sent to Santa Monica to rescue a handful of civilians and then must escape to a safety zone.    It's a simple and basic variation of the same story but yet it was an enjoyable action thriller. It's a study of human nature and of survival. Being from Los Angeles made the movie more interesting..knowing the places mentioned and again wondering how so many people were able to escape on short notice. The streets and freeways are destroyed yet there aren't many bodies. The good citizens got away and now it is time to save the few left behind.    The aliens, their spacecrafts and their drones brings up the question, \\"What would they look like and what would happen if they invaded earth?\\" Interesting premise. Could this ever happen?
B003YL4LYI|1.0|I began to feel about halfway through the third book that this series had gotten away from GRRM - he'd killed off most of the interesting and sympathetic characters and didn't know what to do with the ones who were left. The fourth book was bad and this one is just terrible. A boring, painful slog through a meandering plot, endless details, and tangential stories about random characters, most of whom are either new to the book or so un-memorable they might as well be. I'm imagining our author laughing hysterically about having written as bad a book as he could and still selling it. That's the only explanation I can come up with.

I savored this book, re-reading sentences, and paragraphs, not wanting it to end. I in no way mean to suggest, however, that this novel's appeal is mainly one of sentence-craft and style; it has a plot which surprises, introduces compelling characters, and examines meaningful life situations. Beyond this I will not say, and I hope that you don't read too many reviews and ruin for yourself what could otherwise be a soaring reading experience. Get the book. Read it. And see.

Arnold gets in some good one-liners, Kristanna Loken is suitably spooky as the T-X (a sort of hybrid of the T-800 and T-1000) and there's still a good mashup of CG and model effects. Watching this movie immediately after 1 and 2, it DOES feel like it fits in.    The whole package is pretty minimal. You get the typical less-plastic recycled material blu ray box with no liner notes of any kind, and the disk itself has no main menu- it launches straight to the movie and any special content must be accessed using the (decent) pop-up menu. This wouldn't be so bad, except this disk still blocks the player saving your position if you have to stop the film. WHY? You aren't skipping any ads or trailers by doing so; there are none. In terms of special featurs, you get a blooper reel, a smattering of trailers, Arnold's hilarious but inappropriate \\"Sgt. Candy\\" deleted scene, and a pretty worthy number of commentary tracks (which are still about the most interesting special feature in a movie IMO).    The transfer itself is decent, although it doesn't look nearly as sharp as T2 or many contemporary BDs. I'm not sure if this is a result of lazy mastering or just how the film is shot. T3 is very heavily processed for color in many scenes, and the outdoor shots are all desert and have a smudged, washed out look by design, so it may just not be a very sharp film. It certainly looks better than DVD, but not as clear as you might expect. Perhaps I'm just spoiled.    Overall I can recommend T3 as a worthwhile entry in the series, although not as compelling as any of the others. If you plan to collect the whole franchise, then T3 is a decent stepping-block to the fantastic Terminator: Salvation. If you're just in the market for a sci fi movie, you might want to keep moving, however; there isn't a lot about this film to attract new fans to Terminator.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Strictly in terms of female perfomers the first fully formed new direction in music (aside from Beyonce's innovations which seem to often come from grafts of her influences) I've heard since [[ASIN:B00005LMJU Aaliyah]] dropped a decade ago. It's also quite fitting that Janelle some help and inspirtation here from Antoine \\"Big Boi Pattan of OutKaste,whose sprawling opus  [[ASIN:B0000AGWFX Speakerboxxx/ The Love Below]] took the world by storm several years ago in and of itself. Therefore one can tell Janelle is not coming at her music from a graft of older styles but rather how her influences impact upon her concept. Illustrated in the liner notes,she paints herself very much as the ultimate futurist. The entire concept has certain similarities to the culturally relevent sci-fi ideas of Sun Ra;the idea that a continuum of time and space is involved in Janelle's strong sense of creativity. In this \\"archandroid\\" characterization Janelle plays out the concept,on this her debut full lengh album.<br /><br />  Musically it plays out like something of an R&B/funk time machine,covering everything thats comes over the last three decades of the music with a breadth seldom heard. Janelle and her Mad Minds of \\"The Wondaland Arts Society\\" have excellent tastes across high octane,OutKast-like \\"retro-futurist\\" hip-hop flavored funk such as \\"Dance Of Die\\",\\"Sir Greendown\\",Faster\\" as well as ballads like \\"Cold War\\" and \\"Oh Maker\\". These songs graft a possible future funk groove with some influences of 50's rock n roll and 60's deep soul for a potent brew that works perfectly with the concept. \\"Locked Down\\" has Janelle's jazz oriented vocal stylings in play on a hook filled disco friendly dance-funk number while \\"Tightrope\\" goes down a schintilating rock 'n soul path with \\"Tightrope\\";probably a good candidate for a hit. The rest of the album takes a more exotic path with some fuzzed out psychedlic rock/soul \\"Mushrooms & Roses\\" and \\"Neon Valley Street\\" as well as more 80's dance/post punk/twee rock styled soul-funk hybrids such as \\"Neon Valley Street\\" and \\"Wondaland\\"-all very much in the cut n paste hip-hop style as well.<br /><br />  This sprawling set concludes with the soulful \\"57821\\" and \\"Say You'll Go\\" and the 8+ clooser \\"BabopbyeYa\\",an elongated jazz number that Janelle sings the very soul out of-musically going back as far as this concept geenrally goes. Personally for me I don't run across music with this kind of breadth AND memorability very often. And it has such an aural impact that I actually have had to listen to it from beginning to end several times over the past year to be able to simplify it's music and flavors down to a review here. And I imagine most people will have a similar feeling after listening to it the first time. Because so much recent music in the past couple of decades follow such a limited number of themes,if any,music that tends to go against that grain tends to emmediately be dubbed as \\"subsersive\\" or \\"eccentric\\" and treated accordingly. In all honesty this music lays squarely in the tradition of music that goes from jazz up through hip-hop. And the fact that it's so heavily built around that musical line that a lot of people may not even realize they're hearing a similar song and dance to a somewhat different tune. Because,above it all songcraft and writing are huge priorities for Janelle. And that makes any music in that tradition a big part of why it's there.oses\\" and \\"Neon Valley Street\\" as well as more 80's dance/post punk/twee rock styled soul-funk hybrids such as \\"Neon Valley Street\\" and \\"Wondaland\\"-all very much in the cut n paste hip-hop style as well.

B003L77FYS|5.0|There's witty banter. Inside jokes. Some heartfelt romance moments. Some very action packed episodes. What's not to love? Season 3 of Castle was by far the best season ever. A two parter episode involving Castle and Beckett trapped in a freezer together. Castle and Beckett are ready to die together when there's only 60 seconds left on a dirty bomb in Times Square. The season finale made me cry! The loss of a loved one leads to big moments for the crime fighting duo-including one that ultimately threatens Beckett's life- and those very strong three little words are said.  I'm counting down to the Castle season 4 premiere! One of the very few quality TV shows left. I recommend it to ANYONE. AWESOME SHOW!

B002RVCD6O|3.0|I was going to give this movie more stars, because even with the stupid stuff they added in that NEVER happened in the book, while leaving out or totally twisting other story lines, there were some great parts (I especially loved Daniel Radcliffe's portrayal of Harry on Felix Felicis, so funny!!)and I still love to see the books come to life ...BUT - The fact that they didn't have Dumbledore petrify Harry and instead had Harry willingly stand there without trying to help Dumbledore... unforgivable. It's just INSANE that they changed that part :( Harry would have never just stood there, that is why Rowling made Dumbledore petrify him in the first place, it goes against everything in his nature and in the nature of the books & story as a whole.

The website that had the credits is no longer active (or has the credits listed)and Sony needs to update this or, at the very least, remove the website info on the packaging. It's been less than two years for some of these titles so really there's no excuse. It's just sloppy.<br /><br />Positives: The cardboard case that houses all of these is extremely sturdy and well made.

B003YL4LYI|3.0|I just finished reading ADWD.Some parts of this book are so good, interesting, and intriguing while others are simply bad, dull and boring.<br />For example, I think Theon's plot-line in this book and all that happens in Winterfell with Roose Bolton and his bastard son was excellent. I kept waiting for another \\"Theon/Reek\\" chapter to arrive. I also think that the storyline concentrating on the Wall, Jon Snow and the Wildings had a good twist to it; I liked how the tragic aspect in Jon Snow's character was fullfilled here(his stubborness, willingness, and the ability to think ahead as a true leader must all got the better of him in the end). Uniting the Watch and the Wildings together is something I didn't see coming. Contrary to what others have said here, I rather like the expandment of Martin's world, and the fact that while the seven kingdoms manage a war based on loyalty to houses, in Essos it revolves around slavery. There are wise and complex messages (dare I say political?!) that I read into Dany's storyline, such as the aftermath of a conquest. I dont see any clear viewpoint here and Martin's genius is in showing the complexity of both sides, as befits a postmodern fantasy; slavery is an inhumane practice,and Dany is right - at least morally right - in freeing them and protecting the oppressed. But colonization and conquest also corrupts you in the end; Dany's strength is in her dragons, and these soon start to feed on children. Abolishing the slave trade left Essos in an economic crisis and in the end Dany is forced to return the slave trade(outside of Meereen)and the fighting pits in order to maintain stability. Instead of thanking her like she expected, a lot of the former slaves resent her because they are poorer than they used to be and are actually worst off than when they were slaves. Most of them join the Harpers Sons, a sort of terrorist group. Dany learns the hard way that it's not enough to \\"liberate\\" a place; you have to accept responsibility forit as well, and this comes at a very high cost and not without a great deal of bloodshed and corruption.<br />Now for the bad: Tyrion's story-line was too long, in my opinion. So was Oberyn Martell's and Griff's. They are filled with such tedious details and descriptions of the sea, the coast, the boat, the sky,the clouds, ect.ect.ect. It's so frustrating to end such a good and fast-paced Theon chapter only to start one of Tyrion's chapters that feels like it will never end. In contrast, Arya's, Jaime's, Cercei's, Victarion's chapters plot-lines were too short, and Martin left all of the major cliffhangers from AFFC still open. You can tell the editing is bad when only one chapter is devoted to Jaime's POV and when Sansa, who was such a major character in all of the books, is entirely left out of this one (and while we're on the subject - what in the world is going on with Osha and Rickon?! Why isnt Martin writing about them instead of introducing yet another character with some name you cant pronounce that no one cares about?!)<br />All in all, I can say this: While parts of the book were intriguing, interesting, and wonderfully complex, other parts were dull and boring and difficult to read. This might have been ok if the book was published a year after AFFC. But it's NOT worth the build-up and the wait of 6 years.

1439181780|5.0|The Secret changed the way I look at the world.  It was the most influential modern text I've ever read.  The Power delivered where the Secret left off.  It also honed in on some important things I've learned myself while living the `Secret' life.    1.) Most important, especially for being a woman - stay away from gossip.  Gossip is toxic.  One of my girlfriends loves to gossip, she always meddles in other people's business and has an opinion on everything.  Over several years I've watched her life compared to mine.  Nothing good happens to her.  She goes from crisis to crisis - or at least she thinks it's a crisis at the time.  Her life is a blender with everything being mixed up all of the time.    The Power really hit home on this topic. Over several years I have removed myself from her.  My life and outlook on the world has improved while she is still complaining on the same stuff from years ago.  Removing gossip makes you look ahead instead of staying in the past.  That one topic is worth the read!    2.) Love and giving - I will say that the Secret didn't begin working completely until I started giving.  I began giving small to one charity that I liked. Each month I gave a little.  Something magical happened - the more I gave the more good stuff happened to me.  So I would give more - but then the good stuff stopped.  What I found out was this - when I started I loved giving to the charity.  I did it because it felt good - not because I wanted something back.  When my heart changed so did the outcome.  Eventually I got back to thinking about how I was helping other people and then I began to receive again.     Love is the lesson of the Power.  Do all things for love - not for need and you will see things happen in your life.  Find something that you love in everything you do.  That is the key to success.    It is another great book from Rhonda.

B000000YNZ|5.0|Bill Evans was well on the way as a headline jazz pianist by the time he recorded this 1962 collection of ballads. He had struck gold in 1961 with `Sunday at the Village Vanguard' and `Waltz for Debbie', which was recorded with close friend and bassist Scott LaFaro, who was to die tragically in a car accident shortly after. This album was recorded following his death, so it is not surprising that Evans went in this direction in response. Be that as it may, the compositions are certainly not dour, but rather masterfully gentle and reflective. This album was an emotional and personal experience for Evans, who is well supported by replacement bassist Chuck Israels and Paul Motian on drums. It is definitely one for late night listening, but an album that can't be dismissed as insignificant in Evan's extensive collection of recordings.
B004ZZS4CC|3.0|I read this after seeing Jaycee Dugard's television interview.  I believe she is a remarkable young woman who has somehow avoided sinking into anger and dispair after enduring the unimaginable for 18 years.  Her accounts in this book are detailed and revealing, but the book itself is longer by half than this reader needed.  There was much repetition and page after page of some of Jaycee's \\"journals\\", which I'm sure gave the author much needed catharsis, but didn't add to my understanding of her or her ordeal.  Overall, it is not a long read, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a little more insight on what happened to Jaycee Dugard during those lost years.  Personally, I also don't see this as a particularly \\"inspirational\\" book as written - too muddled and too many apologies and contradictions.  The fact that she survived and is getting on with her life is the inspiration.
0553801473|4.0|*********SPOILERS**********<br /><br />I just finished the book and have been reading some of the reviews by fellow (some now former) Martin fans here on Amazon.  I don't feel as upset about the book as many of the people on this site.  I agree that Daenerys and her storyline was quite upsetting, but I believe this was because Martin was trying to fill a gap of time that he needed to build Aegon and Connington's characters as well as a few others.  He could have done this differently and kept readers more intrigued, but instead he chose to make Daenerys seem like a whiny, wishy washy wuss.  The Dornish Prince chapters were also a waste of time, as they were for nothing.  I don't see his death helping or hurting an alliance between Daenerys and Dorne, since his death was caused by his own stupidity.<br /><br />The book was still entertaining, but I believe that the real fans of this series have waited so long, that we wanted more fire and battle and resolution.  Instead, more doors were opened, and a few were re-opened that were closed before.<br /><br />Griff and Young Griff were some new characters that I was happy to see.  A nice twist, and very unexpected.  The final chapter (Epilogue) from Kevan Lannister's vantage point was one of the best chapters in my opinion and was another twist that came right at the end.<br /><br />My biggest problem was the way Jon Snow's chapters ended, with his life or death being unknown for another 6 years or however long it takes for Martin to complete the next book.  And like the Daenerys chapters, I felt Jon's chapters were often times very repetitive, with Jon creating enemies withing the Night's Watch, while befriending the Wildlings.  His attack was not all too surprising.<br /><br />Overall, the book was entertaining to read, and introduced many minor plots and some larger ones that should prove important in the latter books.  I just hope that in the next book, Martin gets the plot moving along and focuses on returning thosefavorite characters back to their powerful roles.

0061120073|3.0|A TREE GROWS IN BROOKLYN came with such rave reviews that i just had to read it and see what i was missing.  i cannot say that i find myself any more enriched by this story.  it is the early 1900's in brooklyn, NY and francie and her family are forever struggling to make ends meet.  it is interesting to see what things the family had to endure and i stuck with it only because i was curious to see how francie's life would unfold.  but the story was extremely slow paced and not one of my favorites.
0553573403|5.0|This is the second time I read this book and it's still my all time favorite epic fantasy book. I read it again to refresh my memory and keep up with the story plot once I get the 5th one, A Dance with Dragons. I did watch the HBO adaptation of this book and they did a fantastic job I think. If you like epic fantasy this series of books are a must read.<br /><br />The story is great, full of surprises and rich and complex characters. Some of the Lannisters, being the antagonists, give me the creeps, although I do like somewhat the King Slayer, Jaime Lannister. I'm not that crazy about her sister, the Queen, neither her son. The Imp is a wonderful character also, full of surprises and wit.<br /><br />You'll enjoy the development and growth of characters as Daenerys from House Targaryen; Arya Stark, quite a clever and feisty little girl; and Jon Snow, her half brother among many others. The descriptions of places and events are so rich you can perfectly imagine the characters expressions, feelings, mood, etc. In summary, you have it all, the dragons, the knights in shiny armor, the villains, the heroes and heroines, kings and queens, the supernatural and evil forces; the adventure and the unexpected. A real page turner, I fully recommend it.
B000ZBUY78|5.0|I love it
B001OQCV6K|2.0|love the actual movie but the disapointment was in the digital copy, part of the reason of buying this set was that it came with a downloadable digital copy. needless to say when i recieved it the digital copy had expired, i don't know who i'm more disapointed in Amazon for selling it or WB for limiting the download time.
034552554X|5.0|*written by husband*    As I started reading this book, and the constant frustrations that Victoria went through as she got passed along from foster parent to foster parent, I couldn't help but be reminded of two people:    The first is my own teenage daughter, who was eventually adopted by me, but then had the misguided idea that she was loved by her birth mother instead of me.  While she ended up being completely wrong, I know that judging from Elizabeth's example of how much she loved Victoria, I realized that my actions were nothing short of neglect.  I was amazed at the way that she taught her, and loved her no matter what. Ms. Diffenbaugh does a great way of conveying that special love, and it made me realize how much more I could have done with my own daughter.  Luckily, I have another daughter who just turned 4, and I hope that she never goes through any sort of neglect by me.  The book at least provided a teachable moment.    The second person I'm reminded of is the horribly unlikeable Bethany in that hideous book I reviewed a few years back, The Rapture.  That character had no redeemable qualities at all.  Victoria might have started out just as unlikeable, if it weren't for the fact that she was made more complex, made more emotional, that you couldn't help but feel sorry for.  She was also motivated enough to be able to find out what she wanted to do with her life, because someone else showed her a good deal of love, even though she was regretful about what she initially did to that love.  In everything that she went through in life, I couldn't help but want to reach out to her.   In the end, I was in tears of joy based on what I read.      All in all, it's an extremely strong debut for the author.  I hope that she continues pursuing writing for years to come.
6305313687|5.0|American History X stands firmly in one of the most moving films I have ever seen. Despite alot of graphic material this film portrays the destiny of most people in gangs and shows how ignorance can be aboslutley devastating to ones life and family. What a blessing it is to have this movie on hand and to remind myself of the life I was living (using drugs, robbing people, running reckless) and today have been sober for over a year what a blessing. This film should be carefully watched by mature audiences knowing right from wrong and please try to get the overall message behind the film. Which is hate breeds hate and love is the greatest blessing one can do.
0439023521|5.0|I just finished The Hunger Games and went right out and bought the other two.  Beautifully written, it is the story of a 16 year old girl forced to serve in the Hunger Games.    The world, as we know it, has come to an end (first book doesn't go into details about how).  All that's left of North America is 13 districts and 'the Capitol'.  The Capitol rules with an iron hand so the Districts rebel only to have the 13th district completely wiped out.  With the other 12 cowed, the Capitol, to punish them, enforces \\"The Hunger Games\\".  Each district, every year, must send 2 of its children (between the ages of 11-18) so each year there is a lottery in each district to choose the two who will go.  It's a cage match with 24 entering, 23 dying, and 1 left to win fame and fortune.      Can't go into any more detail without spoiling it but the characters are compelling, the storyline is gripping.  Can't say enough good things about the first book (I hope the other two are just as good).
B00129H7VS|5.0|What more can be said?  Band of Brothers brilliantly and beautifully explores loyalty, bravery, duty, loss, fear, and utmost devotion through highly-accurate true life accounts of Easy Company, 506 Parachute Infantry.  In just three years, from 1942 to 1945, during a war that shook the entire world, these young men lived an entire lifetime.  The actual events are almost unbelievable in their intensity and scope.  But ultimately this is not a war story; it is a story of the best of humanity.  Through their experiences they teach us not only how soldiers fight and survive in the most dire and difficult conditions, but how we can all live full, meaningful lives through commitment to cause and those closest to us -- especially during times of our own difficult circumstances.    The writing and acting are absolutely superb throughout.  Relying mostly on a cast of unknowns (including many Brits with flawless American accents and mannerisms), we can truly \\"believe\\" the characters even as they are finally identified at the end of the series with the real veterans 55 years on.  Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, author Steven Ambrose and the veterans themselves ensure that we will never forget or fail to appreciate what they did -- especially the sacrifice of those who never came home to tell their story  or live out their lives.  Many have said this is the best made-for-TV production ever.  I agree.  With each viewing the power of these true stories increases.
0865479186|4.0|Though it wouldn't top the list, this is certainly one of the books that I would encourage everyone to read, along with [[ASIN:B0046ZRNLE Irrationality]] by Stuart Sutherland and [[ASIN:B002BD2UUC Influence]] by Robert B.

B004LWZW24|2.0|*No Spoilers Given*    I watched this movie with a group of friends.  We are all fans of horror and suspense movies.  Sometimes our tastes cause us to argue, but while watching this we were all in agreement: this is pretty creepy.  At least that was what we thought until the explanation was given.  It was all downhill from there.  Not only does the explanation for the horror sound stupid, but the execution is laughable.  Had the film makers stuck to the premise of a haunted boy, it would've been a must-see movie.  Unfortunately, they took a risk that didn't pay off.  After seeing the main haunter (I won't use what it actually is as not to spoil the movie), we all just groaned before laughing at the absurdity of the villain.  If you think that a cross between Darth Maul, Freddy Krueger, and horrible CGI sounds scary, then maybe this is for you.  The special effects went from scary to something on par with a Sci Fi channel original film.    If you want a movie that will build up your expectations and then completely let you down - this is a good choice.  However, if you are looking for something scary (or just plain good), stay away from Insidious!
B004V2S4SS|5.0|I was always a huge fan of \\"Medium\\". For some reason, Patricia Arquette -regardless of the fact that she worked with great directors such as David Lynch- was underestimated in Hollywood. Maybe because she did not act, dress, and did whatever she needed to do the \\"right\\" way, in order to be a Hollywood star...to look astonishing on the red carpet. I liked \\"Medium\\" when it was produced by NBC because it was more suspenseful...CBS had a different approach. They kind of said...\\"We will 'save' this show, and even make people see what a nice family the Dubois family is\\". Good approach (even though one of the seasons was not engaging at all). Well, 'good' CBS did not turn to be so good after all...in the middle of the last season they decided to kill all the characters. Why do they do that all the time? Really? Just because they decide to cancel a show it does not mean that they have to kill the protagonists...the good producers from CBS who cared about family values. At least the people from NBC left Allison on a comma, with a chance for recovery. Hopefully it is true that \\"Medium\\" is more appealing to Canadian and European audiences, and that a Canadian production company is thinking of producing the show. After all, Joe and Allison's death could have been the dream of a dream of a dream...just not true. It is not fair that, after following such an excellent show for years -and I rarely watch TV- not just me, but all the show followers,  have to be left with this bad taste in their mouths. Killing Allison and Joe in the end because CBS made no profit from the show is...what can I say...? Congrats, CBS, for showing us what family values are all about... (and thanks for the 'bitter end'...)... ;)
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|It is inevitable that comparisons will be made with Band of Brothers. Steve Spielberg & Tom Hanks collaborated on both. BOB seemed to be on a grander scale with a bigger cast & couldn't have been better. But I liked The Pacific by just a bit. It informed me to a greater extent. Since we are so Euro-centric the war in Europe has been covered much more extensively. The war of the elite paratroopers carries it. The Pacific has fewer main characters, just battle weary leathernecks & a Medal of Honor recipient. It follows them from just before Pearl Harbor to a difficult integration back into civilian life for one of them. The usual campaigns we have all heard of are covered: Iwo Jima, Okinawa & Guadalcanal (especially Guadalcanal). Other battle-grounds less known to history such as Cape Gloucester & Peleliu are also highlighted. Viewing via dvd is a good choice as you can view it at your own speed & have a copy easily accessible to make your own. The acting is uniformly excellent. The extended scenes away from the carnage,  on leave & at home are a welcome respite from the carnage & make it more than just another docu-drama. The Japanese were not the only enemy. There are effective scenes of unremitting jungle rain, the heat, disease & mud, mud, mud everywhere. all the while enduring deadly sniper fire. The set pieces are of course the all out butchery of  battles in which civilians were often caught between. Realistic? It sure seems so. Hanks & Spielberg did a good job without an day of military service between them. As it was then & every war since, civilians just don't get it. I guess the only ones who really know were those that lived it. You had to have been there. There's not many of them left.
B0011WABIW|5.0|As an angry teen, I would go in my room and put this on the record player and crank it up LOUD.  I wore this poor album out.  Recently, I saw the laser light show played to Pink Floyd music and it rekindled my love for it.  We were a few rows from the giant speakers and just sat back and listened. We did not have any J's but after a couple of shots, we closed our eyes and enjoyed this album at such an audio intensity that I could never achieve at home or in the car. I love love love this album.
0300169787|5.0|Wow.  I mean wow.  What a beautiful, strange, fascinating, tortured soul.  The photos in this book of his designs are fabulous.  His story is anguishing to read, when you already know how it ends.   He truly was a creative genius - some of his designs tear at your heart, some are disturbing, some quirky, but none are boring.  This is a well written, beautifully photographed book.  I will certainly recommend it to friends.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|I am so happy that Bruce Lipton speaks out what others only presume might be true. To me what I know about his work serves as a foundation for my work on the importance of a Sense of Self for personal health, happiness and success but also as a contribution to world peace. I am not a very technical person but the way Doctor Bruce Lipton explains with the help of visual aids what the basis is of all life is very helpful and revealing. His enthusiasm is refreshing and shows that he really cares about his subject. He is curious and smart and that is why it is easy to truly relate to what his findings are.
B000002JSJ|3.0|I don't believe any band has ever made 5 classics (some would say 6 although I felt they slipped a tad on Physical Graffiti) right out of the gun like Led Zeppelin did. Presence was the band's 7th album and while it has its moments and a couple great tracks, it is a comedown. As for the great tracks, \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is near 11 minutes of fury as Jimmy Page's guitar work is great and builds throughout while John Bonham, powerful drummer that he was, plays like a monster on this one. The other great track is a slow blues that the band had perfected over the years called \\"Tea for One\\". After this, the album varies in quality. \\"For Your Life\\" is mid-tempo stoner rock (and not just because they mention cocaine) while \\"Royal Orleans\\" picks it up a bit before it ends abruptly. \\"Nobody's Fault But Mine\\" has a cool riff and some harmonica but is very repetitive while \\"Candy Store Rock\\" and \\"Hots on for Nowhere\\" are okay but you can tell they wrote these on the fly as neither stands out even after hearing them hundreds of times. This isn't bad and I still pull this album out from time to time but you have to be a diehard fan to really get into this. \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" is pretty sick though.
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|If Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Paul Simon, Warren Zevon, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, The Band, etc., are your thing, please read on...     I can honestly say I have not heard ANYTHING from this era (1974) that sounds as modern today as this does now. Way ahead of its time in its tasteful, lush and somewhat unusual arrangement, it is as timely as any bit of songwriting out today - Bon Iver, Iron and Wine, Prince Bonnie, et al.    The lore on this somewhat tragic story behind the making of NO OTHER is that it cost the equivalent of about half a million in 2011 money and that when it came out nobody particularly liked it.     Well, now is the time to appreciate a work of real genius.    Like Keith Richard wisely wrote in his book, LIFE, good music just sounds better with time. I agree. Like Dylan's \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" John Prine's first release, and Van Morrison's ASTRAL WEEKS, this is a deep, deep record that will outlast most - as long as good people like you spread the word about it!
B000089RV6|5.0|AC/DC's Back in Black would be it. Hard rock has never been better than this. Malcolm and Angus Young's riffs were memorable from the get go on every single song. The band played with a passion never heard before or since. Mutt Lange, the best producer in rock music, brought the best out of them and the album is perfectly recorded. And then there's the songs. Well, you still hear all of them on classic rock radio. \\"Hells Bells\\" starts out with an ominous bell and then its killer riff and Brian Johnson's rough delivery. He is one of the keys to this album. No one else could have replaced Bon Scott. \\"Shoot to Thrill\\" has riffs galore, a great lyric, and is catchy as sin. \\"What Do You Do for Money Honey\\" is another killer and this along with \\"Given the Dog a Bone\\" and \\"Shake A Leg\\" are full of double entendres, strong choruses, and great hooks. \\"Let Me Put My Love into You\\" is the epitome of the macho ballad. It's probably the only love song that any man can appreciate. \\"Have A Drink on Me\\" is the band's ode to Bon Scott while \\"Rock N' Roll Ain't Noise Pollution\\" is a great anthem. This leaves the hit singles. \\"Back in Black\\" is as menacing as a song to reach the Top 40 and never fails to excite. This is their best song and right after that is their catchiest, \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", still played every single day on the radio and has not aged one iota. Over 20 million people own this album. What are you waiting for?

B003O85W3A|4.0|What I enjoyed about Arcade Fire's first two albums (and much of the indie rock genre in general) is their emphasis on quality over quantity. When I first heard Funeral, it floored me. Neon Bible disappointed me at first but it grew on me and now I really enjoy it. The Suburbs has the same diversity, mood changes, and smart lyrics as its predecessors but it drags a bit and would have been just as good as their first two albums if a few songs were left off. As for the highlights, there are many. The opening title track brings things off to a rollicking start while \\"Ready to Start\\" is a strong rocker with a great lyric and the keyboards adding a lot of color during the chorus. \\"Modern Man\\" has an oft-kilter rhythm that works well while the excellent \\"Suburban War\\" has a great hook in its guitar line which stays present throughout as the song changes in both tempo and drama. \\"City with No Children\\" is both serious and catchy while \\"Month of May\\" is frantic, kinetic, and catchy all at once.  Other strong tracks include the dramatic \\"Deep Blue\\" and the danceable \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\\". The rest of the tracks are good but \\"We Used to Wait\\", \\"Sprawl I (Flatland)\\" and both of the \\"Half Light\\" tracks drag the album's momentum down. All told, this is still a fine release and many of the songs here are worth owning.
B0018QOIXU|2.0|Quite a difference between \\"19\\" and \\"21.\\"  I absolutely love the latter, can do without the former.  The songs on \\"19\\" sounded rough and some were actually quite irritating.  Adele has definitely grown as a singer between the two albums.  Don't bother buying \\"19.\\"
B002GJT4XW|5.0|Harry Potter is an amazing movie. The book inside the DVD is also wonderful! I really love the books and the movie and this Box is something that I really wanted!
B003Y5H556|1.0|I've reviewed this title on a few different sites and on all of them I've tried to warn people to stay away from this movie.  This is one of the most unpleasant experiences I've had watching a movie in a long time.    I always try to be fair when reviewing any title, so to be fair the setup for this movie is rather pleasant twist on the Red Riding Hood story that we all know.  In this version she lives in a village that's been plagued by a wolf for a couple generations.  The look of the town is rather pleasant even though it look completely fake.    It's rare to find a movie these days that has no dialogue at all, and by that I mean not a single word is spoken that is not necessary to push the plot painfully along.  Now I know a lot of people will disagree with my view on this movie and that's fine.    However if you are on the fence about renting this or buying this I have just one word for you.  Don't.

B001TH16DI|4.0|The Star Trek films have never looked or sounded better than this BluRay release. Paramount/CBS should be proud of what they've done.    Star Trek The Motion Picture, while not being the superior 2000 Robert Wise-supervised director's cut, is still an amazing experience on BluRay. If one divorces oneself from the Star Wars hysteria of the late 70s and watches this movie as its own experience, it actually holds up rather well in its original theatrical version. While there are occasional flaws that would eventually need cleaning up in restoration, the HD picture just sparkles with life I certainly don't remember from the theater. There is detail and color, especially in the visual effects, that render this a hypnotically beautiful film.    STII's restoration is a true eye-opener that demands repeated viewings to appreciate all the colors and textures that never had the opportunity to catch our eyes in previous remasters. The story, of course, is classic, and has never looked or sounded better.    STIII, was a surprise, especially since I had read some reviews saying the picture was squashed with too much DNR. It was bright, colorful and filled with fine detail, and Harve Bennett's script was better than I remember it when I first saw it.    STIV was just as good as STIII's HD master, and of course the story is one of ST's most enjoyable.    STV did not age well at all. The HD remaster revealed the low quality of Bran Ferren's poor visual effects in a way I had never expected, bringing the whole visual experience down two notches. The sound, while powerful, had too much dynamic range, forcing me to do multiple volume adjustments during playback in order to balance dialog with louder action-oriented passages. Even Lord of the Rings, with its ubiquitous battle sequences, had a soundtrack I never had to adjust once in my home viewings. And of course, no amount of remastering can save this horrid script, but I did sit through it all again from start to finish.    STVI wasprobably one of the best looking and sounding movies of this set. I was very satisfied that they elected to go with the original theatrical version of this film instead of the multiple home video versions released in the past. For one thing, the 2.35:1 framing (over the 1.85:1 of the previous DVD) gave it back the grandeur that it originally had when I saw it on opening night back in December 1991. And the plot was better served by the tighter editing--the extra scenes included on past home video releases were entertaining, but totally unnecessary.    The extra \\"Captains' Summit\\" was an entertaining conversation. It is worth one view, but probably no more.    This is a fabulous set, which I recommend to both Star Trek fans and general HD movie buffs. I do have to give Paramount extra credit for honoring the history and legacy of these films in their original forms, as we all saw them in our local theaters way back when, unlike a certain media mogul who's initials are G.E.O.R.G.E. L.U.C.A.S.    Order this set now, if you haven't done so already. Your BD player will be very happy.

B004UOCF3W|5.0|I'd be a Pretender if said that Foo Fighters' Wasting Light sounded just like every other Foo Fighters record. Don't get me wrong...it's got \\"that signature Foo Fighters sound\\", and when Dave Grohl starts singing you know it's Foo Fighters. But the difference between Wasting Light and all of the Foo's other albums is that this one has track after track of great songs, while most of the other Foo Fighters records have a few great songs and a lot of forgettable songs.<br /><br />The album starts off with Bridge Burning and Rope. Thank goodness we're in a digital age, because I'd have already worn the vinyl off those two songs on an LP. Grohl and company start the album and literally kick you right in the face with two superb hard rockers. Then they take their foot off the gas (only slightly) for a track and nail you in the face again with White Limo.<br /><br />The record continues in a kind of decelerate (slightly!) for a track or two, accelerate for a track or two procession, but the key is that every song on the album is unique, enjoyable and...you never feel like skipping a track. Other than the two aforementioned opening tracks, other rockin' standouts for me are Back & Forth, A Matter of Time and Walk, but I would not be surprised if every song on this record eventually gets some radio play...if not become all-out hits.<br /><br />Wasting Light is a real winner and in my opinion Foo Fighters best record to date. If for some reason you're not compelled to buy the entire album at least download the first two tracks and see where that takes you...just Foo for thought.<br /><br />EDIT 10/1/2011: Best Hard Rock Record of the Year. That's right...I said Hard Rock.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|After the critics mostly negative reviews I was a little skeptical going into this flick.  Sucker Punch has a lot going against it from the beginning...young women in skimpy outfits.  I think that many people made a judgement call and couldn't get over it.  In my opinion this is the same as judging a book by its cover.  As I watched the film, in the theater, I was increasingly impressed.  By the end of the flick I didn't notice how the women were dressed, I was completely taken in by the story. The story is what impressed me the most.      In a nutshell a young woman loses her mother and is left in the care of her step father.  The step father doesn't have the best of intentions towards her or her younger sister.  In self defense the young woman accidentally shoots her sister.  The step father claims that she has gone nuts and has her committed.  In order to keep his secret and to keep their inheritance, he pays a crooked employee at the asylum, to have her lobotomised.  The lobotomy will be performed in only a weeks time.  In that week she is introduced to the other \\"inmates\\" and it is shown that the crooked employee is selling the young women for sex.  How would you deal with these situations?  How would you cope?  This is where Sucker Punch shines.  It is a movie about coping and it clearly shows how these young women overcome such horrendous circumstances by not allowing their minds to become broken...Awesome!    From a technical stand point Sucker Punch delivers.  The special effects are crisp and truly epic.  The soundtrack is arguably one of the best features--Emily Browning sings a stunning rendition of Sweet Dreams. The music throughout adds to the aura and the sound effects are seriously something to behold on a nice sound system.  The tactics used by the actors are some of the best I've seen and these young actresses should be praised for their hard work.      Overall I really enjoyed Sucker Punch and recommend that you watch it for what it is, a great story about coping and overcoming horrible circumstances.  My wife ended up liking the film, though she still doesn't like how the young women dress!
0756405890|4.0|1) I use the Amazon rating system at face value. I liked The Name of the Wind, so I gave it 4 stars.<br /><br />2) For a debut novel, I found The Name of the Wind to be an engrossing read. Not compelling, but engrossing. I read it in leiu of pursuing other leisure activities because it kept my attention.<br /><br />3) Kvothe is, I think, an unreliable narrator. Not perhaps a typical unreliable narrator in that he is a liar. Rather, Kvothe's biggest weakness is that he cannot focus much beyond himself. Self-centered. That's not to say that he's any worse than any other person of youth(The Name of the Wind finishes when he is 15 and he is supposedly relating his story at the age of 25), but because the story is mostly related in the first person, this is exaggerated (leading, perhaps, to exaggerated perceptions of Mary Sueism from detractors, though there is probably some lesser level of this, in any event). Kvothe's closeness with himself and his distance from others also has the effect of making those he come in contact with seem flat. He doesn't reach for their essences but simply brushes by them as though walking past on the street.<br /><br />4) I found the magic system in the world to be pretty straightforward. None of it is new, though the names may not be standard (sympathy is a pretty standard form of what other novels call thaumaturgy, sygaldry is rune magic).<br /><br />5) While I don't find Rothfuss's writing especially good, it's not particularly bad either. Except for his poetry. His poetry is not up to snuff for me.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I plowed straight through this book! I can't even begin to say how it affected me. I think back to the last 18 years of my life and try to imagine what all that time would feel like at the hands of two monsters (whose names aren't even worth writing here). The amazing thing about this story, and about Jaycee, is how positive she is. I just don't know if I could be. It is uplifting and refreshing to read about how she isn't holding onto hate or negative emotions over the whole thing. I'm just amazed at that. I had wondered if all of those years in captivity stunted Jaycee's mental capacity at all; however, in reading this book and watching the Diane Sawyer interview I have come to find that she is a very intelligent woman and will do just fine w/ the rest of her life in whatever she chooses to do.<br />To those folks (those very few thank God) that posted negative ratings w/ comments such as \\"too much sexual graphic content, why didn't she run?, she wrote too much about animals\\", etc.: we are talking about an 11 YEAR OLD CHILD here. Strange things happen to the mind after being in a circumstance like this for so long (i.e. not running). I also think that the sexual descriptions were necessary. They do not pollute the book or take up the majority of her writings. But they are necessary... so that people who have never experienced it know how horrendous human nature can be and that victims of sexual assault and rape SHOULDN'T BE ASHAMED that it happened to them and; therefore, shouldn't be afraid to speak about it. Imagine being stuck there for so long alone (before she had children) and the only contact you had was with animals. I'm sure that would take up a huge part of your thoughts - it is no wonder she writes about her cats so much.<br />I'm glad Jaycee told her story and I hope life is nothing but wonderful for her, her mother, and her daughters.
0553386794|2.0|1) I rated this book base on the face value of Amazon's rating system. I didn't like it so 2 stars.<br /><br />2) Martin has Joss Whedon disease. He has too damned many POV characters and this makes the book disjointed and fractious. On top of that, only 1 character in the whole book is actually interesting. The rest are just loud.<br /><br />3) It's BORING. Tedious to read. Just when you start getting into a scene, Martin switches point of view and throws you out of whack. And all the politics is just oppressive. I keep wanting to scream at the book \\"Just kill someone and get it over with!\\"<br /><br />4) Too many of the characters are unappealing. They simply aren't relatable. Beyond the dwarf and the bastard, there isn't a character in the book that I can bring myself to care about in any way. And the bastard is too whiny to be likable.
B003ZHVJFK|4.0|i expected this to be more cheesy but it was pretty good, they delayed the released date awhile over here, but the action was well cheographed, the acting wasnt bad, the storyline didnt really follow the game, it didnt have all the tekken characters in it like KING, GUNJACK, LEI, HWOARANG and probably others im missing. but other than that it was pretty good check it out (and warning do not watch THE KING OF FIGHTERS movie its a crapfest).
0756404738|4.0|1) I rate on face value - 4 stars - I liked this book.<br /><br />2) On the whole, I found A Wise Man's Fear very immersive. I read for hours at a time, losing track of time. This is the kind of experience I most enjoy with a book.<br /><br />3) There about half a dozen plot points that confuse me that I hope will be clarified with the next book. I won't detail them here because I don't want to list spoilers, but they have to do with Ambrose, Denna, Lady Lackless, the Faen, and Bast.<br /><br />4) Kvothe remains an unreliable narrator and highly self-concentrated. The few third persons scenes aren't, IMO, doing enough work. We need to know more of why Kvothe is where he is now and these scenes should be giving us that.<br /><br />5) I see many of the negative reviews concentrating on the sex in this book. Well, that's silly. Kvothe is a 16 year old boy who has reached a point of being over his fear of intimate relations...And there isn't really that much sex and it is mostly mentioned in passing. We only actually see 3 partners (though more are implied) and none of the sex mentioned is at all graphic.
B004LWZW2E|1.0|I have been on the hunt for a movie that could genuinely frighten me and I am sorry to say this will be added to the list of cheesy acted, unrealistic horror-ish movies that have let me down. From the bad make-up jobs on the dead to the ridiculous costume work, this movie will go down as a cheesy paranormal fail.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|Once I started this book, I couldn't put it down. Stephanie Perkins has written some well-rounded and believable characters. In addition, her ability to bring Paris to life made the story all the more believable. A great book and a great love story that shows that not all relationships have an easy start!
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Heretofore  I'd always considered Erich Kunz, whom I had seen in Zauberflöte productions in Vienna and Graz, to be the definitive interpreter of Papageno, but now he's been bumped by Simon Keenlyside, who not only has a powerful bass-baritone voice, but also perfect pronunciation and phrasing in German (I'm a professor emeritus of German) and incredible athleticism. Mozart described Zauberflöte as \\"ein Lustspiel in zwei Aufzügen\\", and Keenlyside puts the Lust into the Spiel with emphasis! Diana Damrau is also magnificent in her coloratura performance as the Queen of the night, and the rest of the cast is up to the task of supporting the principals extremely well. All in all this pro-duction is immensely satisfying musically, dramatically, and comically - I had to laugh out loud several times, a real knee-slapper! I anticipate enjoying this DVD several times a year, and have already loaned it to two German colleagues for their enjoyment.                                 Prof. Dr. Juliian Wulbern
1439153663|5.0|Grissom has really captured a wonderful tale in her telling of this story. It is particularly interesting to see the main character embroiled in two castes in the late 1700's in VA.<br /><br />This is a well written and well researched book.  There is not a lot of history in it, nor is there a lot of discussion of the era or the area in which it takes place.  The strength of this tale is in the relationship of a young child whose parents die in a transatlantic trip in the late 1700's from Ireland to America.<br /><br />She is taken by the ship's captain to his plantation and the story ensues from there.  She is an endentured servant who neither looks like all the rest of the help at the house, nor really understands her role.<br /><br />It is a marvelous book in the human condition - especially when we extend our trust to others. A great weekend read!
0793518326|5.0|The book rocks. Period. People criticize it for having errors and it does but, keep in mind the sheer amount of material they transcribed. (Complete Scores = EVERYTHING in the song). If you want a window into the minds of some of the Greatest Artists of all time, look no further than this book. Use your ears and this as a reference and you will be ripping through Beatles tunes in no time.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Love Amy Winehouse's music. Such a talent!!  May she rest in Peace & away from the \\"demons\\" that apparently tormented her. God bless her & her loved ones during this dificult time.
0553801473|3.0|Well, there is one first thing to say about this book: it is good, but not worth all the expectation.<br /><br />It just seems that Mr. Martin spent years writing about all these eventualities of life of the characters. Somehow, he lost more time describing interesting situations (but less important) than the details relevant to the plot.<br /><br />Much of the book is used to describe the world in its details, whether with people or places. He lacked, however, go further in the plot. The drama that takes place in Meereen is a metaphor for all the big process in the writing of this book. As Daenerys has difficulty leaving the place and can never create anything new, Martin is lost in the fifth book.<br /><br />Not that Dance with Dragons is bad. It is very good, but simply does not meet all the expectations and falls far short of the first three books.
B000H30B2C|3.0|I harbored monumental hopes for this film when I learned that Sir Peter Jackson was finally going to get to make it. I was especially excited to hear Sir Peter comment in an interview that the original [[ASIN:B000EHQTZO King Kong]] was his favorite film of all time because it's one of mine as well. Clearly, this actuality would have inspired him to do a great job on his own interpretation... but, Alas! I fear that this production snowballed and got away from him.<br /><br />This epic-length film reflects the work of many of his former [[ASIN:B000654ZK0 The Lord of the Rings: The Motion Picture Trilogy (Platinum Series Special Extended Edition)]] comrades. He brought along quite a bit of the production crew (as well as some actors) for the ride and so it was natural that *Kong* was produced by much the same process... lots of blue-screen insertions anticipating special effects.<br /><br />To encapsulate the matter, that's my chief criticism of the movie -- it has just way too many special effects. I found myself *enduring* and not enjoying the near-endless unlikely dinosaurs-chasing-screaming-people [and similarly redundant encounters] scenes. From my view, Sir Peter had forsaken the idea of artfully directing these otherwise skilled actors to carry the core story, reserving the special effects solely to punctuate their artful performances. In this instance, the renowned Director has thrown in everything but the kitchen sink and I wouldn't swear that it didn't fly past as well. It was all just too much and I think that Sir Peter's approach significantly diminished this potentially superb adventure yarn.<br /><br />One facet of this movie in particular that I wished to remark on was that the characters under assault seemed far too capable of absorbing punishment by the various critters and other disasters, and still somehow [by numerous miracles?] survive. Kong gave this little gal pretty rough handling and I'm compelled to observe that the first squeeze he gave her would surely have done her in. Yes, it's a fantasy movie of a sort but one still cannot mentally deny the laws of physics and/or biology while attempting to absorb this sort of escapism film.<br /><br />This leads me to my third [and final] point: Sir Peter's *King Kong* yields up an excess of what he intended as *humorous moments* [vignettes of Gimli!] and he obviously chose cast members who could effectively convey this technique, given a quality script. So the approach here was much the same as what we encountered in [[ASIN:B001DTPZNY Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Single Disc)]], another even more unfortunate film production. *Kong* takes the original Fay Wray film and tacks on a one-liner to most scenes. I viewed it all as an aggregation of distraction and mis-spent effort.<br /><br />So, I didn't like the film; however, many others will enjoy it to various degrees. If I haven't provided adequate specifics for you to decide, it might be best if you simply rented it first. Or, you could do what I did and buy it at Big Lots for three bucks! I'll soon be passing my copy on as a minor gift to some appreciative young person.r in.

0062060554|5.0|I was hooked by the first sentence and I read the book in two days. In fact-I stayed up until 3 a.m. to finish it.    I was a great thriller-I kept trying to guess how it would end but I never expected such a solid ending!

0553801473|3.0|I hate to say it, but A Dance With Dragons is not a great book.  It's OK, better than Feast of Crows, but far worse than the superbly paced Books 1-3.  Worse, it seems as if Martin is taking after the great (and tragically departed) Robert Jordan, in that the middle of his great epic is stagnant at best, series killing at worse.<br /><br />WARNING:<br />SPOILERS:<br />SERIOUSLY:<br /><br />A Dance of Dragons returns us to the characters people actually cared about, namely Jon, Daenerys, Tyrion, and Arya to name a few, but it suffers the same fate as it's ill-advised twin, FoC.  It is pondering, and yet at times rushed (the random Karstark girl showing up and then getting married to a wilding because, sure?  Not to mention the weirdly paced and plotted Winterfell/Theon/Asha/Stannis/BLIZZARD stuff).  It's also overly-long, and without any real payoff.<br /><br />BIG SPOILER:<br /><br />Jon's death feels out of place and unearned.  The deaths in the first three books had a deep, visceral, emotional impact on the reader.  Martin made you really CARE about these characters.  After reading the Red Wedding for the first time, I literately threw the book in disgust and paced the room because I was so upset (granted, after about 2 minutes I picked it right back up and read through the rest in one sitting).  When Jon is Caesar'd by his fellow Night's Watchmen (seriously, I'm surprised Jon didn't say \\"Et tu, Marsh?\\" as four dudes stabbed him to death), I re-read the paragraph, went \\"Huh, OK then.\\" and kept on reading.  I didn't care at all that Jon had just died, and it felt extraordinarily random and out of place, like I had missed a large swath of reading, or Martin just has a dart board and, sorry Jon, the dart landed on your name.<br /><br />None of the story particularly intrigued me, which is sad, and I feel that Martin may be running out of gas.  I hope that Book 6 A) comes out within 2 years, and B) that Martin's regains the magic of the first three books.  But I'm notcounting on it.
014241722X|5.0|After many years without reading a Grisham book, I bought this one for my granddaughter.  It was riveting!  It was challenging enough for a kid, but at the same time had a great plot, main character kids can get interested in and just enough legal detail.
0553801473|2.0|This latest installment does not live up to the previous books.  Although there are some interesting parts, another reviewer got it pretty much on the mark--1000 pages of not much happening.  I have read all of the other books in the series and they are all spectacular, but this book falls completely flat.  Not sure what is going on here, how could there be a difference between this book and the others in the series?  Did GRRM run out of any new ideas for the series and is just now writing just for the money.  Unfortunately, I have seen this before.....writers of epic fantasies sometimes just keep the series going for too long.  It has been a long time since I was this bored reading, not sure I will get the next installment.
B000HC2LI0|2.0|The actual series is one of the best to ever be on TV, but about half of the DVDs could not be read by the DVD player or skipped over large sections of the episode despite appearing to be in good condition.
076790592X|3.0|A beautiful story. It is true sharing since the author is able to expose his faults and grow from them, to transform. However the \\"wisdom\\" shared in this book is no more than a few lines so I would say it is more of a pamphlet of wisdom than a book. Still worth reading.
0061784788|4.0|Great book, a lot of action, suspense and mistery. Though it's only the beginning for another book. I just can't wait!
0312600844|2.0|Thoroughly disappointed in this novel after all the hype.     While there are some poignant exchanges and themes regarding family dynamics and dysfunction, overall the characters didn't seem plausible and I ceased to care about them.     Would any company really send a 20-year-old college sophomore to South America to close a deal worth millions of dollars? Would a staunch environmentalist really support mountaintop removal under the auspices of saving that denuded land in the future? (Spoiler alert) Would our couple really go six years without so much as speaking to each other after deep personal pain, then miraculously end up together again? The book is also overloaded with so many sexual escapades that it gets nonsensical.     By far, the best of the book is the family dynamics -- the pain of alienation, the fractures that come from political differences, the scars of infidelity, as seen through the eyes of the couple and their children.     By and large, though, it's a book that badly failed to live up to its billing. My most disappointing read of the year.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|A reinstall after updating will fix the FC issues. More themes would make this my main keyboard but all in all, it's great.
055357342X|5.0|Ok, I'm aware that, in reviewing the previous two installments in this series, I have been careful to note that this series is not for everyone. I reiterate that concerning this particular volume. Storm of Swords follows up where Clash of Kings left off in an epic proportion. That being said, this \\"epic follow-up\\" can be either pleasing to you or you may hate it, depending upon your disposition and preferences. At the end of the day, we all prefer different types of fantasy, so it's not up to me to determine whether you will like this book or not, simply to offer guidance as to the key themes of the book and the points that I, in particular, enjoyed.    CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT: Martin is second-to-none in both scope and in the overall development of his characters. I've read most epic fantasy cornerstone series: Martin's development is the best; it surpasses even Jordan in terms of its believability. That being said, you may not and you will not like all of the actions that the characters take, but the characters all take believable actions. There is not one point where I stopped, saying \\"huh\\" in regards to an action a character took. If you liked the character development in the previous two books, Martin only improves upon it here, transforming the way you will approach some characters.    POLITICAL INTRIGUE: Storm of Swords takes the political intrigue of Clash of Kings and narrows it, both through deaths of many characters but also through sheer writing focus. The whole book is laden with intrigue that is all believable and rational. I'm coming to enjoy the intrigue more, also, because it seems as if it is never left to fester, becoming boring or unbelievable.     PROSE: Martin's prose is beautiful as always, though passages are extremely gruesome and heart-renching.    DEATHS: (BEWARE):  Ok, I won't give any spoilers, but this book is the motherlode of all depressing things capable of happening. Martin kills off a host of characters. If you've read the other twobooks, which I'm assuming you have, you know that he likes to kill off your favorites. I'm aware of this, and I like it. I think it adds credence to the story and brings freshness. But, be warned, the deaths in this book are beyond the deaths in all of the others. Some you can see coming, some you can't, but all advance the plot in some manner. One review noted that at a point in the book the reviewer had to put down the book, rest a bit, and try to comprehend the shifts taking place. The scene in question is brutal. I had to set this book down at two particular points in order to reorient myself. I loved this aspect, but if you want a bit of cheeriness, or at least sanity, while you try to finish this book, it may be hard in coming.    On the whole, this is my favorite of the series thus far. The viewpoints were real. There were some boring spots, but all was believable and I read this surprisingly quickly considering its size. Be aware, however, that its an emotional roller coaster unmatched by the other two books...so read at your own risk!
0061998885|5.0|You gotta read this one!Lehane has made his characters realistic, events piled on each other continually, and delightful dialogue throughout. When you read him, you get believable, humanly flawed, real people; moreover they are three-dimensional. The ending, of course, has a series of surprises and when you arrive there, you leave thinking about the incompleteness of life...no fairytale 'and-they-lived-happily-ever-after', just the knowledge that we all struggle to keep it together. He touched a human commonality - that certain bitter sweetness we all recognize.
B002WPVNOS|5.0|I've always loved OneRepublic, but I've never bought a whole album before. I had purchased the singles from \\"Dreaming Out Loud\\" (Stop and Stare, Apologize), but never really bought anything past that. When I saw this for only five dollars, I couldn't help but click \\"buy\\", seeing there were five songs I liked (All the Right Moves, Waking Up, Made For You, Good Life, Secrets) and figuring the others would grow on me later. I'm happy to say that they did!    Everybody Loves Me: Makes a good ego boost. It has a bit of a rockish feel, and just makes you feel good to sing to.    Missing Persons 1 and 2: I have to admit I didn't think I'd like this one at first listen. It did grow on me though, but I don't listen to it as much as the others.    Fear:I could hear the slight \\"fear\\" as soon as the song started. The entire arrangement was executed beautifully.    Marchin On: Has a great, steady beat. Always makes me want to go a little father, a little longer, when I'm outside running.    Mercy: I was expecting a different song by the same name by them, but instead thought \\"This sounds a lot like that Duffy song..\\" As soon as I realized it was the other song I couldn't help but smile! It made my whole day.    I hardly ever buy entire albums, but this was a brilliant exception. Been listening to it nonstop since I bought it. And, with me being 14 (and very attention deficit), this is a difficult task to accomplish. Congrats, OneRepublic! :-)

B000IJ79WU|4.0|Just saw the Donner Cut DVD and the two things I really enjoyed(among others) about this set were the Marlon Brando scenes and the commentary with Donner and writer Mankiewiez. The commentary gave me insight into the creative minds of Donner and Mankiewiez and also how Donner felt about the theatrical version of Superman II.<br /><br />Of course it makes more sense for Jor-El to be speaking to his son since those were the scenes from Superman I and plus Brando's presence has a sense of authority which gives more meaning to the interaction between father and son. Of course there are minor imbalances in the movie flow and inconsistancies with scenes(understandable since the Donner version was never allowed to finish).<br /><br />But for me these are minor and do not take away from the enjoyment of watching an alternate version(or what was supposed to be the original version) of Superman II. In addition to the movie and commentary there is also a short featurette \\"Restoring the Vision\\" and a few deleted scenes. Lastly there are subtitles in English, French, and Spanish.
B001W6S0C6|5.0|This is probably the BEST of the Batman series. Jack for sure is the BEST Joker of all time. No disrespect to the late Heath Ledger....but Jack tops them all. Michael Keaton...without a doubt the BEST Batman of all time! This is an excellent movie with a great transfer to Blu Ray.
0553801473|4.0|Many folks seem to be complaining how this book \\"set the stage\\" for many an event so to speak, but didn't actually deliver; this is only half-true.  The reason for this is that many people have a pre-determined idea of where the story 'should' be going based on what they've seen thus far in the book, but George has shown time and time again that just as you shouldn't get too attached to any one character, you shouldn't get too attached to any one plot line.  If everything played out exactly as you thought it would, what would be the point in reading the book?  There are many twists and turns on our way to our final destination, and in fact it's those twists and turns that keep us coming back for more.  Yes, certain storylines didn't get resolved.  Maybe they NEVER will, but why they won't is interesting if it's told in a compelling and organic way to the story (which I think in nearly every instance it was in this book).<br /><br />To sum up, this book was very interesting and entertaining to read, certainly worth your time and money.  Don't put a lot of stock in the naysayers, the majority of them are just upset because they've been waiting so long for what they think is little resolution (and as I said before, it's because they already had it in their minds that these things NEEDED to be resolved, instead of letting the author take us down the path while we enjoy the ride).
B003G4W49C|5.0|I like to read all kinds of books. I my youth, I grew up on Issac Asimov, Arthur C Clarke and I recently reread a few books I read 30 years ago.

Now I am into the second book \\"The Speaker for the Dead\\" which is just as good and exciting. I cannot wait to read the whole series from Orson Scott Card.
0553801473|1.0|Terrible...It seems as though he just writes and writes with no plan for his characters. One of the most frustrating books you will ever read. Nothing importance happens in the book. There is no direction... even worse he continues to have his characters take steps backwards. This series continues to be more and more disappointing as each book progresses. He introduces the price to the sereis  when the thought is that he has been dead all this time???? Terrible.. He should be ashamed....
B003X2O6KW|3.0|This is a late review, but I'm going to take a crack at it anyway. Kanye West's fifth album is as dark, brooding, and introspective as the title entails, but this dude just can not let go of the ego. Verse after self-aggrandizing verse belies the self-deprecation apparent in one of the better tracks, namely 'Runaway'. Lyrically, it just feels as if Kanye is giving 'haters' the middle finger and 'fantasizes' about \\"choke[ing] a South Park writer with a fish stick\\", making it impossible for me to feel bad for this guy. Where's the maturity? Where's the growth? In the wake of all the flack Kanye has caught for his 'interesting' public displays, he still musters the audacity to claim victimization (as evidenced by 'Blame Game') which comes across as arrogant and tacky, but not unexpected.<br /><br />Is Kanye West talented? Yes; he samples quite well and blends/mixes/composes (albiet with co-collaborators), a fantastic experimental fifth effort. Some stand out tracks include the title track, 'Dark Fantasy', which leads in with a quirky intro featuring Nicki Minaj, but her performance on 'Monster' is just plain irritating and (in my opinion) drags the whole track down. 'Runaway' is long and not to some people's taste, but the experimental vibe shines through brilliantly complete with distorted vocals, a melancholy plonking piano, and closes with a beautiful bass string section (cellos, I believe). Easily one of the best singles of 2010. 'Power' showcases Kanye's pro ear and proves that sampling, when combined with self-generated material, can be an art form. Afroamerica (chant) and King Crimson (refrain) combine to create one of the most salient tracks I've heard in a long time. Finally, 'Lost in the World' has a great autotuned quartet (something I never thought I'd say), soaring vocals, a pulse pounding drum section, and remains the best radio-friendly track on the album: violence, misogyny and homophobia are absent, and the hook/chorus are both very catchy.<br /><br />On the other hand, 'All of the Lights' opens powerfully with french horns which continues to elevate this 'chapter' of Kanye's morbid fairytale, but overall the track falls flat. Rhianna's presence doesn't add much and the track sounds much more mainstream R&B than experimental hip-hop. I think this should have been placed on Rhianna's latest album and not Kanye's; this track just sticks out like a sore thumb. Overall this album has its ups and down's, and while I'm not sorry I purchased 'Yeezy's' latest effort, I can't give 'My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy' more than three stars. I look forward to what Kanye has to offer in the future after this mildly disappointing lukewarm release.r hand, 'All of the Lights' opens powerfully with french horns which continues to elevate this 'chapter' of Kanye's morbid fairytale, but overall the track falls flat.

1452101248|5.0|This book is both well written and perfectly photographed. Many recipes have a laundry list of ingredients, but most are pantry staples. A few of the more exotic ingredients (in the US, anyway) are things you can make yourself with a little forethought and preparation, such as creme fraiche and preserved lemons. The recipe methods are mostly simple, not requiring special equipment. The handful that I have tried so far (Leek Fritters, Bahn Xeo, Green Gazpacho) have all been amazing. I can very easily see myself cooking through this entire book. The broad range of recipes leave no room for boredom.
B004UXXVQS|5.0|This is a really good album. It's a nice return to form for the Foos. I've been longing for another \\"Colour and the Shape\\" album but all of their other releases seem to fall short. Wasting Light is the closest that they've gotten in recent years. It also gives me a warm fuzzy knowing that Butch Vig produced and Krist Noveselic guested on this one.
B0026PW67W|5.0|There are different versions of the map. My version had some things taken off and other changed or added. That part was a little disappointing but it is still a great product. I wish more things were labelled but you can still manage to figure out where things are in Hogwarts.
B005D9MUWY|2.0|Got this as part of the Free App of the day at the Amazon Appstore. I wasn't impressed. It's no better than Swype, in my opinion. I would only suggest you get this, if it goes for free again. I just don't see enough value in purchasing it.
0345522478|4.0|Hounded was interesting but difficult to get into. I didn't know much about the plot of the book before reading it and I think that's why I was lost (I always do a mini research of the book I'm about to read). This book is mostly about Celtic Mythology and I know nothing about it. After a few chapters and some time I started to get into the book and it kept getting better.    With the help of Wikipedia and the Internet I finished Hounded. I recommend this book if you are into Celtic Mythology or if you like a challenge and learn new stuff. Hounded is a really good book and has awesome characters.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|ok so when i first bought this book i thought it was going to one of those cheap, poorly written, typical love stories. but i was so so wrong, this is now my absolute favorite book. it is amazingly written and has a great plot. i love the story of Abby and Travis. i will not give u any hits as to what happens in the book though, that  you will have to find out yourself by reading the book!

B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using the older version of this app for a while now. I like the ability to customize the keyboard with arrows and changing colors with this version.

Of course it can't ALWAYS get it right.

B0015I2P0Y|5.0|A largely underrated masterpiece, the Seldom Seen Kid evokes the glamour of a past age (the Roaring 'Twenties, smokey late-night dives, mischief aboard an ocean-liner cruises spring to mind).  There's a distinctly Latin flavour to a couple of the songs, despite the singer's undisguised British accent and sensibility.<br /><br />While certainly an entertaining listen, the Seldom Seen Kid is a lot more than that.  On the whole it's an overwhelmingly beautiful and heartbreaking album - especially if one notes the lyrics and real-life inspiration behind the album (ie: the downward spiral and eventual demise of a close friend of the band.):(<br /><br />These songs drip with the syrup of sentimentality and bleed with the wounds of loss in equal measure.  I can't recall lyrics that better capture the earth-bending delight of new love than those of Mirrorball.  But such joyous odes are balanced out by the emotional desolation of tracks like Some Riot and The Loneliness of a Tower Crane Driver (brilliant song-title!) and the touching eulogy that is Friend of Ours.

B003Y5H53S|4.0|I'm not sure what all the negative fuss is about.  What is a &#34;kids&#34; movie, anyway?  Recognizing that appreciation of humor differs, I laughed a lot at this movie, as did my 22 year old daughter.  My in-laws, who are in their eighties, perhaps not so much.  I found the dialogue clever and witty, the photography stunning, and the voice acting terrific.  This film is rated PG, which I would say warns parents of young children to check it out before they expose their children to it. My opinion is that it is perfectly appropriate for age 10 and above (Netflix Common Sense rating says ok for 9+).  Remembering back to films with adult themes I thought exciting and entertaining as a kid, I think of Ben-Hur, Guns of Navarone, Jason and the Argonauts, Hondo and Rio Bravo.  I'm talking about such themes as self sacrifice, bravery in the face of danger, self doubt, and good versus evil.  This film has all of those themes and presents them in an exciting, funny and entertaining manner.  No, I would not take a five year old to see this. I took my daughter to see The Lion King and Beauty and the Beast when she was likely a little young for them.  She was scared a few times, but entertained. Consider the Star Wars films, or the Toy Story trilogy, which also present many of the same themes, and which are considered good &#34;family&#34; (as opposed to &#34;children's&#34;) films. Consider the brilliantly animated films of Hayao Miyazaki, most of which are also rated PG, but universally praised as great family films.  I urge anyone who really likes movies, especially Westerns, to see this film.  If you're wondering if this is appropriate for your children or grandchildren, check it out first.  My opinion is that if you disregard the rating system, and simply assume that a film is appropriate just because it's animated, then any bad surprise is on your own head. You want a good movie for young children, check out Winnie the Pooh.
B001T3RA8M|5.0|This was my first fantasy novel that a friend introduced me to and now I'm hooked.  Great book if you want to escape life for a moment and read about magic and other things. I'm greatful to be able to now say I own the series. :D
0545259088|3.0|Disclaimer: I'm going to try and keep this review short & sweet to avoid spoilers. For those of you unfamiliar with the series, here is the general gist of the first book \\"Shiver\\". Grace was attacked by wolves when she was nine years old, but one of the wolves, the one with the yellow eyes, saved her. Every winter brings the return of her wolf and she relishes in the tranquility of the season and the connection they share. When a teen is found killed by the wolves, the town retaliates and Grace finds an injured, shivering young man on her porch. One look into his yellow eyes and she knows it's her wolf, in human form. Dun dun dun...<br /><br />I loved \\"Shiver\\". It was gorgeous, elegant, and otherworldly. The prose was musical and while the plot wasn't anything to write home about, Ms. Stiefvater's writing drew me in and kept me there until I finally looked up and realized that I had read the entire book in one sitting. The romance between Sam and Grace was tender, yet intense. Then came the second book, \\"Linger\\", and while I liked it, my love was waning. As the plot moved on from the romance to multiple conflicts, the magic seemed to fade away. Unfortunately, in \\"Forever\\", the magic (for me) was completely gone.<br /><br />I wanted to love this book. Normally, I devour whatever I'm reading, especially when it is a conclusion to a series I've been anxious to read. I love Ms. Stiefvater's writing, but \\"Forever\\" felt like the title. It took me forever to read. There were some really great moments and I loved the additional character perspectives. In fact, I really feel like Isabel and Cole were the standouts this time around. I loved reading their stories and would have loved to have had more happen there. Sam and Grace just seemed so one note. Gah, I hate writing negative reviews, but I've stewed over this and it is what it is. I didn't like \\"Forever\\". I felt like the pacing was slow up until the ending and then it was completely rushed. Plot lines were left open in awkward ways and the plot line I really wanted to see tied up wasn't at all. I think one of the major downfalls though is that between \\"Linger\\" and \\"Forever\\", most of the characters have lost their likability. Sam and Grace became boring and a lot of the other characters did pretty iffy things. It makes it hard to read when the characters are one-note and unlikeable. I think I'll just pretend this book didn't happen and pretend \\"Shiver\\" is a stand alone.<br /><br />I hope it's just me and that you'll enjoy \\"Forever\\". The series started out with so much promise!the plot line I really wanted to see tied up wasn't at all.

B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I admire Jaycee Dugard very much for all the work she has put into making sense of an abnormal life experience that she endured for 18 years. Her book made me so uncomfortable while reading that I had to walk away from it a couple of times and remind myself that she was just 11 years old when her ordeal began. It gave me a better understanding of how the Stockholm Syndrome starts and is maintained in kidnap survivors. I liked being able to hear her perspective, in her own words. She has inspired anyone who reads this that the unthinkable is survivable. To me, it was miraculous that she could manage to care for her children in the process. Bravo, Jaycee!
B000NTPDSW|3.0|Regrettably I had to return this item.  In Godfather II there was a lip sync problem.  The scene with the young Vito, and his friends speaking Italian a few beats before you hear the sound.  Maybe some people have missed it because they are reading the subtitles but it was very noticeable to me. I would have requested an exchange but was only given the option of a refund.    I will buy another set, and hopefully it won't have this problem.  While watching I was reminded of Singing in the Rain, when the leads on screen began talking out of sinc and eventually swapping lines, 'yes, yes, yes.'  'No, no, no.'    Picture quality is excellent.
B000001GRE|2.0|The Mahler Seventh is an ungainly beast that has sunk many a conductor and orchestra. It is an obstacle course for performers and listeners alike. Few get it right, and among recordings, only one stands supreme, and that is Jascha Horenstein's with the New Philharmonia Orchestra.<br /><br />Like the rest of Boulez' Mahler cycle, his treatment of the Seventh is interesting but primarily a failure. I no longer feel positive about this performance. Boulez starts out great, with wonderful power and clarity, at a deliberate pace that is not ponderous (a la Klemperer). But several minutes into the first movement, the proceedings stall and flatline for the rest of the entirety of the symphony. The Mahler Seventh, as much as any other Mahler symphony, is a romantic work that demands a mastery of expression. Boulez deliberately provides none. His is a non-interpretation that winds up a strange, clinical examination of the notes without a cohesive unifying spirit. There are long passages in which nothing happens, except an antiseptic, weirdly phrased emission of sounds. Now for those who are familiar with the Mahler Seventh, this Boulez treatment is interesting as an abstract art alternative.<br /><br />Whereas Horenstein's reference recording captures the Seventh in all of its glory----its powerful march rhythms (very specific echoes of Mahler Sixth and &#34;Revelge&#34;) and every emotional corner of the nocturnal journey into morning---Boulez is just weird.
1451629184|3.0|JayCee DuGard went through a terrible experience.  I am so happy for her that her life has turned around and that she has found people to help and support her and her family to heal.     But, sadly, the same support does not seem to have been offered/given/accepted in terms of editing this book.  An editorial eye is sadly lacking.  The story is compelling, but the rendition is chaotic.  There are also huge holes in the story that may have been filled had a capable ghost writer/interviewer been involved.    I would have very much liked, for instance, to read more about the healing and psychology exercises.  There are also years of her life in captivity that are simply not covered.      On a positive note, she is brutally honest without being sensationalist when recounting the uglier parts of the story.      Would I recommend you buy this book?  I'm not sure.  Perhaps second hand, or on sale.

B003ZSJ212|5.0|It amazes me how many film experts our out there. To all new and genuine fans lets enjoy what we have been given at the moment. Sure its not perfect but its not that bad to be trashed the way it is. To the haters wake up morons and get a life no one really cares who shot first and all that crap. I bet that if the original were released the same people would still be complaining about the picture quality. Just remember no one is forcing you to hand over $90.
B005C6NFIG|5.0|I get it that long-time fans are disappointed. But I am not. I choose to let the artist express themselves however they want to. That is the beauty of creativity and expression. I am sure Incubus went into this knowing full well that this new album would not satisfy the hard-rock fanbase, but they went for it anyway. That's fine. Simply put, I am glad they are still making music! This new record has grown on me and it didn't take long. I respect them for making what THEY obviously wanted to make, even though I also would have enjoyed a more heavy sound, at least on a few tracks. 5 stars because the lead vocals are 'stellar,' as usual.

B0055CJ8T2|1.0|Unfortunately Kelly Rowland is another victim of the current trends in the U.S. Music Industry, specifically a victim of Universal Music and now departed executive Sylvia Rhone. For the past 3 years (2 or which she didn't have a record label after being dropped by her former label Columbia for low record sales of her 2nd CD Ms. Kelly) Kelly Rowland has recorded some memorable and catchy songs such as When Love Takes Over, (a huge worldwide hit), Choose (w Ne-Yo) and It's the Way You Love Me all with David Guetta for his CD One Love. More recently she was featured on another great song What a Feeling with Alex Gaudino (this song isn't on the CD, probably due to licensing issues). These songs were catchy, melodic and memorable. Well except for the Red One produced Down for Whatever (which most likely should be the 1st single in Europe)this collection of songs lacks melody and hooks that stays in your head. Today the music industry wants to turn what might be great songs into \\"urban music\\" with gratutious use of rappers on songs. Kelly falls into this trap here a few times using Li'l Wayne, Big Sean etc on songs. Recently Rowland said in an interview that she could include many types of styles for her fans who want Urban, Dance and Ballads. Not a good idea. She would have been better off to fuse urban and dance more like artists such as Chris Brown, David Guetta in the past and the Black-Eyed Peas. I expected that after the failure of Ms. Kelly, an urban-oriented project, Rowland would have taken her music in a different direction. I guess not. This CD lacks identity and seems to reflect Kelly's ongoing problem as a solo artist. In this recent interview she seemed to be trying to satisfy different fan requests instead of choosing her own musical identity/path and the music here reflects that problem.     As a result,  this CD lacks cohesion, is cluttered with too many different musical styles and leaves a person not wanting a 2nd listen. There is an A-list of writers and producers but many seem to lack the ability to write a catchy or memorable hook. The one David Guetta track Commander I believe is one of his worst songs. The chorus seems awkward and forced, unlike When Love Takes Over and What a Feeling (not a Guetta song) which are both glorious, lush and beautiful. Rodney Jerkins continues to turn out B-side type songs and is a mere shadow of the producer who had amazing songs in the mid to late 1990's and into the early 21st century (e.g., the songs recently done for Britney Spears CD Femme Fatale). Rico Love helped to craft a few songs here and they go nowhere despite Kelly touting him as \\"a genius\\". The hit song Motivation is included but again the song has no melody and I guess that's what urban music is about today. On a positive note, the artwork is beautiful and well done. The word on the internet is that when Kelly releases Here I Am in Europe and the U.K. later this year it will be a different version. I will wait and check that CD out and skip this one.
0060005696|3.0|On the advice of a friend, I picked this up, and am glad I did.  The author does an excellent job of supporting his hypothesis that \\"less is more\\" and that an abundance of choice has made our lives harder instead of easier.<br /><br />I learned a lot from the book.  I learned about maximizers versus satisficers, what drives us to make decisions, and tools for simplifying dealing with the abundance of choices we face.<br /><br />The writing style can be a bit wordy, and at times I found myself reading and re-reading sentences and paragraphs in order to fully understand the meaning.  It's not overly complex, but some sections can be a reading workout.  However, the author does support all his arguments in a logical style, and the extra effort required for me to understand some of the more involved points was worth the effort.<br /><br />Worth the read, and hard not to learn something from this.
B0050CQY1W|1.0|Beyonce releases \\"4\\" and this is such an unlistenable CD. There are no songs that stand out or that you remember. Good thing she had a career with Destiny's child. She has chosen the same producers every other diva works with (Rihanna, Kelly Rowland, Mariah Carey etc.) like Tricky Stewart, The Dream, Diplo. They all should take blame for this. Even the Diane Warren track is unlistenable. None of the songs have much melody, most are midtempo to ballads and Beyonce is not the best singer to do ballads anyway. I liked her first 2 solo records. They seemed to have passion and intensity. The last CD except for Single Ladies and If I were a Boy was self-indulgent and tuneless. This CD is even worse. I hoped that the bonus tracks might help but they were equally unlistenable. The sessions for this CD just produced horrible songs. Save your money there are so many other great releases to buy.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|I still can't believe such a film as Thor has been realized!  What a beautiful movie!  So much heart!  It's the rare kind of movie that somehow preserves the storytelling essence of a great book.  It's not spectacle for spectacle's sake, a la Michael Bay.  This is about the complex triumphs and failings of family, and if you know anything about Brannah and his Shakespearian background, you know then that last statement holds weight.  The film's score is as wonderful as the film itself.   What a job by Patrick Doyle!  Like one reviewer said, the cast was just amazing in that everyone seemed genuine in wanting to play their roles out.  Anyway, there is so much good to say about this movie, and so little bad, that  I won't even waste my time nitpicking.  It's a film in earnest, with nothing but good intentions, done the super hero way.  And for that I will be thanking Marvel, et al, for a long, long time to come.

B003HGKJH8|4.0|The technicolor sounds of Tame Impala's first full-blown U.S. release, InnerSpeaker, became largely known last year, as the band released the 12-song record via iTunes. Now finally seeing a proper stateside release on beautiful gatefold LP, the album stands to find an even wider audience in the U.S., their light, dreamy vocals and thick, guitar-heavy sound made perfect for rock n' roll ears worldwide.    I can't help but link Tame Impala, in theoretical appeal at least, to Oasis and The Strokes. Those two bands released very different retro-tinged records whose sound seemed to hit at the perfect time. For Oasis, it was a Beatles and Stone Roses hybrid sound; for The Strokes it was  a Stooges-meets-Cars thing, with all the pop and style you'd hope for. With Tame Impala, the sound is thick and hazy, drenched in reverb and drive by - similar to Oasis and The Strokes - clear pop melodies and nuanced vocal performances by a frontman with personality to spare. The Impalas, I suppose, take influence from any number of psych-rock bands, but in a more faithful way than, say, The Beta Band did a decade or so ago.    On \\"Solitude is Bliss,\\" one of the record's instant standouts, we're greeted with gallons of reverb and a trippy production style that comes off like  a British version of David Fridmann. Just as the first minute of reverb-buried verse ends, we're hit with a big, long hook that feels right out of 1967 - back when even The Stones were getting their psych-rock on. It's a killer track that's ornamented nicely and held together by juicy riffs and big, perfectly recorded drums.    Unlike The Strokes, who had \\"Last Nite,\\" or Oasis, who had \\"Wonderwall\\" (and \\"Shakermaker\\" and \\"Supersonic\\" and so on), Innerspeaker doesn't really have a big single-type of song that offers crossover appeal and could thus push them into mass markets. And even if it did feature such a song, in the year 2011, would that matter? Bands like Tame Impala are made by reviews, YouTube videos, Twitter accounts and opening slots on tours. And, for the most part, they can only get so far unless they're hit with the luck bug.    That said, I wouldn't be surprised if the juicy, psychedelic pop sounds of InnerSpeaker continue to find new listeners for years to come. Now fully available in the U.S., don't be surprised if we look back on this hazy, trippy, fully rocking collection as one of the cult albums of its time.

B00505470O|3.0|With the Sub Pop-issued Within and Without, Washed Out's honcho Ernest Greene becomes the latest in a seemingly endless line of New Saviors of Sound. The vibe and appeal here, however, really isn't that complex; Greene sings quite a bit like Panda Bear, a droning vocal backed by distant echoes. If he sounded any more like the Panda, he'd have to pay the man royalties, his whimsy less and his melody more.    The music of Within, however, is slightly more complex than Greene's derivative vocal appeal. Keyboard and synth layers stack high, creating an atmospheric backdrop that's driven by programmed drums and buried baselines. You don't really hear guitar riffs, horns, piano or even strings on this record. The sound here is straight synthetic - a vibe that, vocals aside, resembles Enigma more than it does, say, Animal Collective. Enigma, that is, had they scored some John Hughes films in the 1980s.    On that note, I suppose it's time to mention the band - nay, the album - that we can only assume is largely responsible for the existence of Within and WIthout, and maybe Washed Out in general. That record, m83's Saturdays=Youth, has been the blueprint for a number of artists over the last two or so years, helping usher in this often pathetic 80s revival trend. Within isn't on the pathetic side of the fad, as it does offer a unique appeal that's made perfect for the more yuppie, more gaggy corners of the indie rock scene (did I really just type \\"indie rock scene\\"?).    What we end up with is a set of nine clever, if simple, compositions that are above all else moody and memorable. One standout track, \\"Before,\\" feels so much like a hipster's version of Enigma's \\"Return to Innocence\\" that I can't help but assume it will eventually find a wider audience, probably via a TV commercial or dramatic film (or, ya know, a \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" episode). It's high moments like these, where Washed Out take the production deeper and give more attention to melody than style, that I understand why a punk- and grunge-focused label like Sub Pop would chance their weight behind such a band.    The only question is: Will the music of Washed Out age well like, say, Portishead? Or will this cinematic 80s sound be another tossed-off \\"What was I thinking\\" moment in the history of modern indie music? Though I have been enjoying the record just fine, my money is on the later. It's simple: hip + retro rarely works, even if the aesthetics all seem just right.

B000000OMB|4.0|I heard a song on the radio and I had to have a bit of the 1980's nostalgia.  My memories of rec dances came flooding back, and some songs are just timeless!  Enjoy, my leg-warmer wearing friends!  :)
B004V6MWFU|4.0|Eddie Vedder's second solo record, Ukulele Songs, is, like his solo debut, a brief and subtle collection that focuses on words and voice, rather than rock and roll. That first record, a soundtrack for Sean Penn's excellent Into the Wild film, proved to be a pleasant surprise full of memorable moments and the best vocal performances of Vedder's storied career. For the Wild record, Vedder was challenged to make moody music that fit the youthful and wandering spirit of the film's real-life protagonist, Christopher McCandless. To say Vedder pulled it off would be an understatement. With Ukulele Songs, Vedder again challenges himself, this time in a much different way. Rather than limit his moods or topical range, Vedds is here limiting himself to two elements - voice and tiny guitar (aka ukulele).    A popsmith at his core, Vedder has no trouble finding his way through the record's 15 vocal tracks (and one short interlude), almost all of which come and go before they have a chance to get old. Opener \\"Can't Keep\\" would, I imagine, be the record's lead single if rock artists still released singles in 2011. It's an instantly accessible and upbeat track that sees Vedder dropping his quiver and wail in favor of a thick, nuanced vocal that highlights his strengths in a way similar to Into the Wild but not too much like his performances on the recent Pearl Jam record, Backspacer. It's a lovely opener that's more or less worth the price of admission.    After the near-perfect opener the challenge sets in. Can the Ed Vedd find a way to keep interest with only voice and ukulele? Many reviewers have been saving \\"no.\\" I'm saying yes. There are songs that take a while to grow, but Vedder has become such a strong writer and melody maker over the years that he pulls it off. Well, mostly. There are, as you'd expect, a few songs that feel like retreads, and a couple that just don't quite hold up as well as the bulk.    The collection hits its stride over four particular songs, startingwith \\"Longing to Belong,\\" a truly beautiful cut featuring some fleshing out by the way of cello. Also, Vedder invites some guest vocalists along for the ride and plays a number of different ukuleles in a number of different styles - all in the name of keeping things interesting. Another favorite, \\"You're True,\\" is so well written and sung that the ukulele fatigue doesn't begin to register.    \\"Sleepless Night,\\" a duet with The Frames frontman Glen Hansard (the guy from Once), is a short and memorable song that will someday be used during a pivotal moment in some hip rom-com movie. And the there's the other big duet, a cover of \\"Tonight You Belong to Me,\\" for which Vedder cashes in a favor Chan \\"Cat Power\\" Marshall has owed him since the duo's collaboration on Cat Power's great 2004 record, You Are Free. On a record with a number of serene moments, this is maybe the best, Marshall's smoky voice sounding as good as ever. Here's to hoping these two perfectly matched vocalists find the time to someday record a full record collaboration.    By keeping the songs short and adding the variety of collaborators, strings, various ukuleles and some cover songs, Vedder has passed his self-imposed challenge with flying colors, creating a soulful and sweet chillout record that flies by. Long known as an album-maker able to mix art and accessibility in interesting ways, Vedder here continues to make most of his 90s peers look lazy and stale. No, Ukulele Songs might not be better than Into the Wild was, but, in my opinion, they're both minor classics that are far more interesting than anything Vedder's band, Pearl Jam, has done since No Code almost two decades ago now.

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I absolutely love this show and was so happy to find the first season at this price. I had missed a few episodes in the first season and now I'm all caught up. Now that I have it on DVD, my hubby's been able to watch it with me and he loves the show now too.     Warning... There may be spoilers for those who haven't seen it.     I am completely torn between Stefan and Damon. Yes, Elena and Damon have so much more sexual tension but I can't help but feel for Stefan as he truly loves Elena and it is thanks to him that she managed to get out of her depression after her parents died. He was also the one who saved her and helped her get out of the drowning car.     Now Damon... He's the highlight of the show, really. He's funny, charismatic and charming. Not to mention, Ian Somerhalder is a hunk and plays him perfectly to the tee. In the last few seasons, we've gotten to see a new, lovey-dovey side of him which I love... but then I go back to Stefan!     Ugh, poor Elena. lol     It's the best show that's on TV right now! If you haven't seen it already, this is a great place to start. :)

1592536913|4.0|\\"1000 Steampunk Creations: Neo-Victorian Fashion, Gear & Art\\" by \\"Dr. Grymm\\" (Joey Marsocci) with Barbe Saint John is a fascinating showcase of the work of over 100 artists of the steampunk subculture.  The work is beautifully crafted  and well presented.  Although jewellery predominates, there are also sculptures, photography and 2-D art, clothing, headgear and accessories, and furniture.  The style is strongly techno-Victorian, with a great deal of gears and goggles, clocks and corsets.     This is a book of a type familiar to artists and illustrators.  After a brief introduction, the bulk of the book is pages dedicated to artworks, with descriptions and artists' contact information in the back.  The artists are overwhelmingly of the United States, with a modest number from the UK, Canada, and Australia and a scattering from the rest of Europe.  There is one Japanese artist.    Actually, that brings up an uncomfortable question.  Although it is impossible to tell the ethnicity of the artists from their works, I wonder if any of them are persons of color.  This is a large book.  There are many people in photographs in this book -- models, mostly -- and every single one of them is white.  There is not a black, Latino or Asian person to be seen.  It may be, apart from Haruo Suekichi, the lone Japanese artist, that some of these creators are nonwhite.  But the lack of any but white models in the photos is troubling.  Where are the steampunk artists of color?    Apart from that issue, \\"1000 Steampunk Creations: Neo-Victorian Fashion, Gear & Art\\" is very pretty and full of inspiring, well-crafted work.  Fans of steampunk, interior designers, and artists should all find it an interesting resource.

0062060554|1.0|I read the free Kindle sample but didn't buy the book because I didn't like Christine, the narrator.  Later, I found the book at the library and picked it up due to all of the great press and other great reviews.  To its credit, Before I Go To Sleep is indeed a page turner, but it feels really formulaic.  I kept wondering if the author read 'Pacing Thrillers for Dummies' (or some such thing) before writing this book.  I continued not to relate to Christine as I read and finally finished the novel.  Mid-way, when I turned to the book jacket and saw no author photo, two initials for the first name, and no pronouns in the \\"about the author\\" section, I guessed that it had been written by a man.  The way the protagonist struggles with her aging body just didn't seem real to me, nor did Christine's references to, um, male body fluids, sex in general, and \\"swinging\\" male body parts.  Also, her statement about having no empathy or respect for victims of domestic violence just did not ring true at all.  I was surprised by the ending, but again, the pacing seemed contrived.  When I was a young reader and finished a book, I had to start a new one \\"before I could go to sleep\\", no matter how late it was.  That is certainly true for me tonight.

With that said, I was hooked after only a couple pages, namely when the reaping took place. Many reviewers commenting on the inability to put the book down once you open it - completely true. I finished the book in 3 days (would've been faster if it weren't for work).     If you're hesitating, don't. It's a quicker, easy read that will keep you engaged. Be prepared to buy the second book as well. ENJOY!    Note: Would caution against younger teens reading due to the subject matter. Point blank, kids are pitted against each other in a very brutal survival of the fittest plot.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I ordered this cable because I have an old Miracle Piano Teaching System with an electronic keyboard and DOS-based software.  I set up DosBox (a DOS emulator) on my Mac and installed the software, but needed a serial (RS232) port, which the Mac doesn't have, to hook up the keyboard.     I bought this Plugable cable, installed the driver, and hooked it up.  The software initially could not connect to the keyboard, so I sent an email message to Plugable support.  The problem eventually turned out to be something rather complicated and obscure, but the Plugable tech stuck with me all the way and, after five exchanges of email, I got it working!    This is a great, modestly priced product.  Probably, no tech support will be needed 99% of the time, but it's great to know that it is available if you do need help.

846631993X|5.0|As one of the reviewers said before, the first chapter of this book is not necessarily Vargas Llosa's best writing, I didn't even care much for his development of the characters up until this point.  However, once you get past this point, it is simply a wonderful, and unusual love story, which you cannot wait to see the end to, you'll also easily relate to the characters in this. Sure, it is no Wuthering Heights, if that is what you're looking for in a love story, but this novel contains some of MVL's best writing and some of his best characters.  I highly recommend it!
B004XQO90O|4.0|\\"What would you do if you knew you only had one minute to live?\\"  Colter Stevens (Gyllenhaal) is picked to be part of a new and secret plan.  He is able to relive the last eight minutes of someones life over and over in order to stop terrorist activity.  The only problem is that he doesn't realize it at first.  His goal is to find out who bombed a train in Chicago in order to stop a bigger and more deadly explosion later in the day, but Colter wants to change the plans, if he can.  This is a very good movie, but one you must pay attention to in order to follow it easily.  This is from the same director of \\"Moon\\", so if you have seen that movie you will know what to expect from this movie.  This is a movie that would get better the more you watch, very layered type of movie and you will be able to catch different things each time you watch.  One of the better sci-fi/thrillers along the lines of \\"Inception\\" and \\"Adjustment Bureau\\", not as good as those, but comparisons could be drawn.  Overall, a very interesting movie that needs to be seen more then once in order to fully get what you need out of it.  I liked it though.  I give it a B+.<br /><br />Would I watch again? - Yes I would, you almost should.<br /><br />*Also try - Speed Of Thought & Moon

0553801473|4.0|It's hard to overstate just how much I have been anticipating this book.  Certainly since Martin's A Storm of Swords, I have been eagerly awaiting the continuation and perhaps resolution of plots set in motion by the Red Wedding, Jon Snow's ascension to lead the Night's Watch and Daenerys' capture of Meereen.  Well, after finishing the book yesterday and a literally sleepless night over how upset I was by certain deaths, I almost wish I hadn't read it.<br /><br />Let's start at the beginning. I'll try to keep this review spoiler-free.  First the good stuff.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin excels at making you care about these characters.  All of people, major and minor, have the ring of truth about them.  They feel real, you care about them or hate them but you understand them.  I don't think anyone does this better than GRRM.  The dragons are growing up and when they appear on the page, they are vivid, fascinating monsters a world away from the empathetic beasts of McCaffrey or Novik.  GRRM also delights in playing with reader expectations.  No one is safe, in this, A Song of Ice and Fire feels more like a horror story than traditional fantasy.  Finally, the world is gritty and real in a way fantasy simply wasn't before, outside of a few Sword and Sorcery tales from Leiber or Howard.  Martin is telling a huge tale and I can't think of anyone else telling a story this big, this successfully.  That said, Martin's reach exceeds his grasp, or so it seems at this point.<br /><br />The book follows three main plot threads with a spattering of scenes that advance the story a tick from A Feast for Crows.  The first is Tyrion's trajectory from Westeros to Daenerys. The second is Jon Snow's struggles leading the Night's Watch and preparing for the coming of Winter and the White Walkers.  The third is Daenerys' attempts to rule Meereen.  An honorable mention should be made for Quentyn Martell's attempt to reach and woo Daenerys but this plot line is buried in the latter half of the book.  Additionally we have: Stannis Baratheon's struggle in the North, the fate of the Iron Born in the north, the ascendancy of House Ramsay and Frey, the fallout from Queen Cerci's stupidity, Davos Seaworth's attempt to woo House Manderley, the fate of Bran and Rickon Stark, and last but not least, a new appearance of a Targaryen quite literally out of nowhere.  This doesn't include additional plot threads that also poke their heads up from A Feast for Crows.  As you can see, there's a lot going on here.<br /><br />One of the things that makes this book so frustrating is how few plots are resolved or even moved along significantly. A Dance with Dragons feels like half a book, despite its heroic size.  There is so much going on that there simply isn't enough progress accomplished.  I have to question some of the plot lines Martin chose to write.  Sorry but there it is.  Readers hoping that there would be a resolution of the legendary \\"Meereenese knot\\" that tied GRRM up and stranded Daenerys a world away from the main action in Westeros will be disappointed. Not only by the fact the Daenerys show no sign of going to Westeros but by the fact she's not even in the third act of the book.  Battles between the Boltons and Stannis are literally bogged down and left unresolved on the page, making a mysterious note from Ramsay Bolton (nee Snow) at the end of Jon's chapter ambiguous to say the least.  Tyrion never even meets Daenerys, let alone advises her.  The Martel plot is so futile and unreceived that I wonder why Martin bothered to write it.  Almost NOTHING is settled in this book.  We are given cliffhangers and `downer endings' but few resolutions.  We aren't even moving towards resolution and with only two books left (supposedly) that is worrying.  Two plot threads appear to be resolved in the most final way possible, which leads me to my second problem with the book.<br /><br />There has been a recurring theme that those who try to do good, who try to act honorably will be killed, mutilated and disgraced.  Time and again, characters you know and love and sympathize with are cut down, corrupted, maimed and murdered.  A Dance with Dragons continues this fine tradition.  Martin is nothing if not consistent.  Again and again in this series, characters are warned but ignore these warnings, to their doom.  In a way, this is a classical tragedy where a character's flaw or virtues even, bring about their destruction.  Or virtues...that's not the way it's supposed to work.  Flaw, yes. In classical tragedy, a character is supposed to fail due to their tragic flaw.  In Martin's world, there are tragic virtues.  Like Honor. Honesty.  Compassion.  Decency.  Humanity. Loyalty.  Any of these qualities will get you killed in these books. The characters that thrive are the most devious, the most ruthless, the liars, the torturers and the corrupt.  I am weary from watching good men die and watching good women suffer.  At this point, I'm not sure who I should be rooting for or if I should even keep reading.<br /><br />I will, of course.  Martin is writing the epic fantasy of the past fifty years.  Even if it fails, it will be an epic failure and be worth watching in the same way that watching Rome burn must have been worth seeing.<br /><br />In addition to the betrayal, murder and torture, there's the sex.  Now, I'm no prude, I write about sex and violence in no small amount myself.  However, this book is particularly drenched in sex and for gratuitous reasons, it seems.  There are long, loving descriptions of random naked women we never see again.  Rape and near rape, both on the page and `off stage'.  Sodomy is mentioned frequently among Eastern kingdoms and sell sword companies.  There's always been a lot of sex and deviant sex at that in this series. So I'm sure most readers won't be put off at this point, but brace yourself. There's a lot of sex in this book.<br /><br />Do I recommend the book?  It hardly matters.  Readers have beenwaiting 6-8 years for this book, depending on how you look at it.  It is essential and that makes it a crying shame.  It is well-written, though not quite to the levels in the first three books.  I worry that the seven books we've been promised will sprawl further, as the later Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series did.  This is epic fantasy and epic tragedy.

B004ZZS4CC|1.0|This book is amazing! I'm still not sure how they did it. This is an account of one of the most terrifying things that can happen to a human being: kidnapping and prolonged imprisonment with sexual abuse. It retells the experience in such a tedious way that it conveys none of the fear, none of the horror, none of the revulsion. What it does convey is the tedium of being held in a room for years. The only surprise is how good the readers are at imagining things that just aren't there. With imaginations like that, perhaps they should be the ones writing books instead of reading them. Thank goodness for amazon kindle e-book returns.<br /><br />(Hysterical fans please note: This was a book review, not a crime or victim review.)

0374290024|2.0|Whilst  I was initially enthused over the prospect of reading Mr Morris' book, I was ultimately most disappointed by it (perhaps I should have saved my time and money for Niall Ferguson's recent release). The book is mainly concerned with demonstrating the West came to rule the world through sheer luck, due to its propitious geography which gave it the tools to succeed as of the nineteenth century, taking advantage of its previous backwardness (violence on the fringes, distance from the core, but also proximity to the Atlantic). Mr Morris measures power in the terms of a social development index which includes war-making capacities, energy capture, etc.     First of all, Mr Morris--an archaeologist and anthropologist from the University of Stanford--has run a tedious repeat of Jared Diamond's \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\". Both make the same point, although in markedly different ways, that geography explains Western domination. Not only is the idea unoriginal by now, but it would be more credible if Mr Morris had first cared to define in no uncertain terms what the West is. For Mr Morris, the West is no more than a geographic concept, this he makes clear in the first few chapters of the book, however, he does not say where it ends, and, consequently, where the East begins. Thus, the original Mesopotamian settlements of the Hilly Flanks are considered as \\"Western\\" and we find out the West was dominated by the Arab world in the two centuries following Muhammad's Hegira and sweeping conquests from Persia to Spain. Not only is this utterly confusing, but it makes the whole question irrelevant; if men are all the same (in large groups)--as Mr Morris argues in an insistent, almost autistic manner--then, what use is it to know whether the West or the East rules? In fact, although Mr Morris did not define the West in precise terms, he seems to imply the East is in fact only China. This Sino-centric perspective overlooks developments throughout the twentieth century when Japan looked like a more serious contender until fairly recently. Nor does the book consider even the remotest possibility that India might rise up to the challenge, and actually overtake China--this would be a significantly conservative theory, considering the book's wild assumptions and extrapolations in the last few chapters.      The book is almost exclusively centred on the assumption that geography--not culture or anything else, for that matter--shapes history. Whilst most people freely confess geography plays a considerable part in determining who holds the sceptre, it seems a tad too narrow as a single explanatory factor. Mr Morris repeatedly contradicts himself; China, he says, could have launched an industrial revolution under the thirteenth-century Song dynasty, had it not been overwhelmed by hordes of Mongol invaders, descending from the steppes onto `defenceless' China. Yet he also admits, half-grudgingly, the Chinese lost because of their bungling military leadership--let us not forget China then had gunpowder, although with limited military applications, the Great Wall, a far greater pool of potential soldiers, and was fighting at home. Hence Mr Morris recognises that political factors came into play, after all. Mr Morris overlooks culture entirely, and does not really explain why and how he came to discard it. Most historians acknowledge proximity to deposits of iron and coal was essential to effecting a successful industrial revolution, but Britain was not alone in possessing such mineral riches, far from it. For one, Poland had significant deposits of coal (which were transferred to its new Prussian, Russian and Austrian masters after it was partitioned in the final quarter of the eighteenth century). Yet Poland was not the cradle of the modern world. Could it be that, inter alia, Poland was held back by the same institutions which relentlessly hounded down and then had Nicolaus Copernicus burnt to the stake, namely the Catholic Church? Mr Morris does not seem to acknowledge the momentum lent to what he contemptuously calls the \\"northwest fringes\\" (or \\"backwaters\\", sometimes) by the Protestant Reformation, which in effect unleashed the potential of northwest Europe and conspired with the Great Discoveries to open new markets for Europeans. In this, he lags two centuries behind Max Weber. However, without the proper ethos, Europeans may not have been able to take advantage of these new opportunities, and Protestantism turned out to be far more liberal in terms of capital accumulation than the Catholic Church had ever been. Getting rich became a sign of God's favour--especially in Calvinistic congregations clinging to predestinarianism--where it had formerly been little short of a sin. After all, Jesus claimed it is harder for the rich to go to heaven than for a camel to get through the eye of a needle. In turn, capital accumulation made possible large-scale investment in new manufactures, which then tried to maximise output while reducing costs. Obviously, Mr Morris is not interested since he believes China also experienced an awakening of sorts, but he does not puzzle and wonder why China relinquished Enlightenment thought (that is, its national equivalent) and instead descended into foot-binding women and obsessive contemplation of its antiquity. At least, he could have lent somewhat more credence to his theories by trying and dismantling the alternative explanations (i.e. that Chinese rulers and scholars had become complacent and thought there was nothing else to invent after their ancestors and Confucius had done the job).     Mr Morris displays a strikingly Marx-like propensity to see history as broken down in phases that ineluctably succeed one another; farming replaced foraging, agriculture was supplanted by industry and technology will end up trumping industry. In Mr Morris' dialectical view of history is nothing short of Hegelianism and Marxism, in that it discerns the End of History (so did Francis Fukuyama,after all) around 2045 when we will all happily descend into either \\"Nightfall\\" or the \\"Singularity\\" (which I shall further explain). History is a triumphant, unstoppable march towards progress and bliss. Mr Morris overtly pushes for an internationalist agenda and praises the current drive towards a world government, yet another manifestation of his scorn for cultural differences, as he assumes we can all be governed by the same people applying the same laws derived from altogether different civilisations and ways of thinking, destroying centuries of tradition, whether it be Western or Eastern. Instead of Marx's ultimate communist society, we swap our world for a nightmarish one where \\"organic\\" humans have vanished and will be replaced by robots endowed with artificial intelligence. Hypothetic threats are agitated as standard straw men and scarecrows, without the slightest attempt at grounding them on hard facts--a most unscientific behaviour for an academic. Mr Morris' future sounds like a genuine dystopia, for all his heavy criticism of Leibnizian-style Panglosses.    Mr Morris--again, no trained historian--says there is no such thing as bungling idiots or great mean, that they only speed up or slow down the historical process. Examples of how this is not so abound. In the Punic Wars between Carthage and Rome, Hannibal, unlike what Mr Morris claims, could have easily overwhelmed the Roman capital, had it not been for his patent hesitation (he had smashed the Roman army at Cannae). World history would have looked different altogether--sorry, I forgot Mr Morris does not care about cultural differences, after all, all civilisations are all the same once we are all united in the bliss that consumerist society promises to be (matter takes precedence according to Karl Marx). His rejection of both long-term lock in theories (that the Western lead in social development always was a foregone conclusion) and short-term accident theories (that we groped all the way long to industrial revolution in a completely haphazard fashion) sounds convincing, but he frequently demonstrates his is a kind of long-term lock in theory as well, considering geography sweeps all it surveys (which is even more deterministic, by the way).         Mr Morris seems to have expended too much of his time reading science fiction books--he openly professes his admiration of von Däniken and Asimov. Therefore, he has come to believe that the future will either deliver \\"Nightfall\\" (atomic war descending upon earth and catapulting us all back to the Stone Age) or the \\"Singularity\\" (a rather far-fetched theory that purports humans will eventually merge with machines, and pretends to pass as \\"science\\"). Discarding the obvious question as to whether the \\"Singularity\\" would be a desirable occurrence, this sounds like utter wishful thinking--which it actually is--and struck me as quite unexpected from and unworthy of a Stanford academic.    Mr Morris' feeble references (contemporary \\"cinematographic\\" flops) are matched by the shallowness, even vacuity, of his analysis. While getting to grips with \\"Second Axial thought\\" (at long last), the author skates over all cultural differences as if they were meaningless. As a matter of fact, cultural differences do not exist in Mr Morris' rose-tinged fantasies about our contemporary world. Muhammad and Confucius' exponents and opponents alike are thrown together in a confusing, motley catalogue of influential thinkers. No consideration whatsoever is given to what actually makes them distinct from one another. Since culture is partly shaped by men's surroundings, this significantly impairs and quashes the author's emphasis on geography (his obsession with it, really).     The only real advantage of reading this book is that it allowed me to brush up on my archaeology and Chinese history, although in a rather sketchy way--which is excusable for the sake of brevity and because it was never meant to be the crux of this book. Actually,this is the only reason why I gave the book two stars instead of one. The last few chapters, on the other hand, were completely useless in my opinion. This could have been a far better, more balanced book, had it not been for the obvious bias the author gave it--academics should consider facts in a somewhat colder attitude of detachment instead of giving vent to quirks of theirs--besides, Mr Morris seems to have done a lot of research to support it, but seldom uses the evidence he collected to useful ends. A pity, really.

1595141715|1.0|In his debut novel, Thirteen Reasons Why, Jay Asher submits his entry into the adolescent literature genre that has boasted such modern classics as The Book Thief, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, and Speak in the past 15 years. The book is an International best seller and has been translated into 31 languages.     Which is frankly mind-boggling.     The premise is intriguing enough - after killing herself, Hannah Baker sends 13 tapes to 13 different people detailing her story and how each one of them was in some way responsible for her decision to commit suicide. The story is told through Clay Jensen, one of the 13 who receives the tapes and contributes to Hannah's demise. Now that we got through the best part of this book - the summary on the back - let's move on to where it failed, which is everywhere else.     Though the plot does make for an interesting dust jacket read, stylistically, Asher fails. The entire thing reads like chunks of exposition. We are getting Hannah's story in Hannah's voice, through the tapes, through Clay. This choice leads to a feeling of too many degrees of separation, a disconnect between the readers and the girl we're supposed to feel sorry for.     Speaking of Hannah, rather than sympathizing with her, I spent the majority of the book wishing this petulant brat had chosen a more violent end (she only takes pills). The character's tone throughout the novel is spiteful, vindictive, and petty. The girl on the tapes sounds, not like a depressed teenager truly wanting people to understand how their actions affected her, but more as if she just wanted to send all the mean people in high school on massive guilt trips. She takes some sort of perverse, villainous pleasure out of all this; I was picturing her twirling her cartoon mustache. Asher's depiction of a teenage girl is so laughably farcical that it seems as if she was written by someone who gets his views of what high school is like for girls from 90210. The reasons that Hannah kills herself are ridiculous. For an example of this sideshow drama, one of the reasons she commits suicide is because a boy puts her name on a list saying she has a nice ass. I'm not kidding. I think you should just shake that money maker, but apparently this is enough to start the snowball effect that leads to her pill-popping. Moreover, Hannah blames everyone but herself throughout this entire book (eventually saying she made the decision, but still implying or outright stating that other people's roles were in the forefront). I don't know how people see this as inspiring for young adolescents; I walked away from the book thinking more about how Hannah foisted all her issues onto other people rather than how our actions affect those around us. Additionally, I feel this book almost glamorizes suicide - high school girls that want to relate to this self-important drama could possibly view this as romantic. Another poor lesson involves a guidance counselor's reaction to a conversation with Hannah. I find this fictitious encounter neither encouraging, nor likely.     Even the \\"good\\" character sucked. Clay is some prototypical nice guy with a sensitive side and all that bull. The dude is just not believably written. Not one character in this book lives and breathes on the page. Instead they all feel one-dimensional; thus, dialogue and would-be emotional scenes fall flat. They also share voices - for example, Asher writes his descriptions the same, regardless of it is Hannah speaking on the tapes or Clay observing something. It got to the point where I was seriously irritated that not one of these characters even had an interesting name. Hannah Baker. Clay Jensen. Justin Foley. Christ.     Put in the hands of a more adept writer, I feel the concept behind this novel could have succeeded. While Asher's most obvious flaw in this effort is his inability to write truly human characters, the writing itself is also dry, and for the most part, emotionless, not exactly the tone I would use in writing about a teenage girl's suicide, but perhaps Asher should write about sociopaths in his next attempt at well-written literature.     I doubt Asher would care about these criticisms. He's laughing all the way to the bank with a giant canvas sack adorned with a dollar sign and filled to the brim with tweeners' allowance money. But if you want a good account of a high school girl who isn't an attention-seeking nitwit and has an actual problem, pick up Speak by Laurie Halse Anderson because I can't think of one reason, let alone thirteen, why you should put time into reading this drivel.

B0015AARJI|5.0|The playstation 3 controller is amazing. Not only is the controller a lightweight compared to the xbox's controller it easily and naturally feels right when using it to play a game. It is wireless so that's amazing and it has motion sensors! How awesome is this controller...well it might be the best controller out there. I give it a 5 star rating. Moreoever, it has vibrations too. All these things make up this wonderfull controller. If you can buy a new one. There's nothing like getting a new one!
0553801473|2.0|This is now typical sci fi trash, on the level of Robert Jordan and other mundane sci fi.<br /><br />Nothing happens. There is nothing compelling that makes you want to turn the page and read more.<br /><br />The longer Martin takes to write the book, the worse it is.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book reminded me of my Golden Retriever, Bo (who looks identical to the Golden on the cover of the book!) and my husband, who races cars as hobby. It was wonderful! I missed the characters as soon as I finished the book! I recommend this book to everyone.  I could have done with out the lying cousin and the plot surrounding that situation. The rest was wonderful!!!!!!!   I loaned it out to a friend...and I think I will have to get it back...i have the itch to read it again :o)  2 barks Enzo!!! 2 barks :o)
B001TWT0AE|5.0|Viewing this movie again after so many years brought back memories on how great the old westerns were which are not made anymore. John Wayne, James Stewart and Lee Marvin played outstanding roles in this.
0374532281|4.0|This book provides an interesting look at depression and disfunctional families.  The main character was sad but often laugh-out-loud funny, a sign of good writing.  I read this book quickly which is unusual for me.  It was very entertaining, pretty much a page-turner.  I did foresee the ending, however.
B0051QIGP4|5.0|For those of you who do not like Lady GaGa then you want to skip buying this. For the little monsters that love her music and have a taste for something different then buy it. There's a mix of anger, lust, happiness and the tracks all range from something you want to dance to belting out in your car and not caring who hears you. There's something on this album for everyone.
0385738757|5.0|Why I read this: I absolutely loved the Maze Runner and had to read the sequel.<br /><br />Plot: The Scorch Trials starts with a theatrical beginning, one that blew me away with the mind-blowing and gore level I really didn't anticipate. What happens at the beginning of the novel sets the stage for a gruesome addition to the Maze Runner series. There's twists that are added, a new set of characters in the same situation as the boys, as well as some gruesome new ways to die. My favorite of which was the head-eating slime. Definitely a series I can't wait for more of.<br /><br />Characters: The new female characters are fiercer and you're not quite sure of their background while reading the story - but something fishy is going on. WICKED is as ominous as ever, pulling invisible strings in the background and making you unsure of the main characters as well as the supporting one.<br /><br />Relatability: Fans of a more horrific dystopian series will enjoy Dashner's The Maze Runner series.<br /><br />Cover Commentary: Definitely gives you a picture as to what type of scenery you'll see in this book.
B0057A6GA6|2.0|I wish game developers get this:  If you want to display HD graphics in a game ,  ZOOM IN,  like in Zombies vs Plants  If you want to zoom out then make it as an ABSTRACTION,  like in Hex Deffence  Attempting to make a zoomed out,  graphic intensive game on a phone, will always look like crap!
0525421580|5.0|Why I read this: Two great authors must equal one great book. :)<br /><br />Plot: I don't read a lot of books with a GLBT theme, but this one caught my attention. I love the dual characters - both with the same name - and how they end up connecting at a porn shop. Both have some issues - one being moody and looking for love online - and the other caring too much how everyone views him. Definitely a book that is filled with realistic teen drama and hilarious to boot.<br /><br />Characters: I loved the diversity between the two Wills and Tiny really cracked me up. Definitely a set of character I won't be able to forget.<br /><br />Relatability: I think everyone has had a friend like one of the characters in these books - so it's easy to relate to.<br /><br />Cover Commentary: Love it! Makes me think of city-living. :)
B004WCTLNY|5.0|I was pretty much blown away by this movie, which is surprising to me because when I saw it out on video I could barely remember seeing any ads or buzz for it while it was in theatres.  While I can't say it rises to the level of say The Departed or True Grit, this movie deserves some high praise and a very enthusiastic recommendation because it is so entertaining and inspired.        The plot of this movie (general spoiler's upcoming) revolves around a New York Senate candidate played by Matt Damon.  Don't cringe, he does a tremendous job in putting together a very down-to-earth and believable politician.  He then meets a woman who he is instantly drawn to--only to find out the the Powers That Be will do everything they can to hold them apart.  The rest of the movie explores Damon's desire for free will, and whether it actually exists.  The pacing in my opinion is excellent and the story-telling and dialogue are as well.  I won't spoil anything else and will conclude just by saying that this movie is well worth watching.       Reflecting on this movie and the career of Damon, I have to say that Damon is fast becoming the best actor of our time.  I can't think of any actor that has put out as many classics over the last 15 years as Damon has.  With the Bourne Identities (particularly #2), The Departed, True Grit, The Talented Mr. Ripley, Rounders, and Goodwill Hunting, Matt Damon has actually outproduced Leonardo DiCaprio in quality movies over that time.  (He was also one of the few good things acting-wise in Saving Private Ryan, but I'd be doing the aforementioned a dis-service by inluding it in that list.)  I have to give DiCaprio credit for playing the lead in two of my favorite movies of all time in Blood Diamond and The Departed, but Damon's work as a whole exceeds his.  Both of these actors have put forth such impressive and consistent bodies of work that I feel like they are already comparable to the tandem of Newman and Redford.  Despite modern-day Hollywood's struggles in putting out good movies, these two actors are finding incredible scripts and talented directors and actors to work with that are letting them put together extremely impressive performances, ones that will be remembered for years to come.      In sum, this is a highly enjoyable movie and I would tell anyone that likes suspense to watch this movie.  I can't believe it didn't do better in the theatres.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|Awhile back my friend got this game and then it disappeared for no real reason. So I decided to buy it, and o-m-g was this worth the money.<br /> But let me explain something first, if you're the kind of person who doesn't like reading, then don't get this game. This game is mostly reading, with puzzles thrown in.<br /> But people who like reading, get this game. It has a FANTASTIC plot, and FANTASTIC overall story line. There is also 6 different endings, meaning that you'll have to play through the game several times. But, the creators actually put something good into the game, and that is if you have already been through/read a part already, you can fast-forward it!<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Great story<br />-Lovable characters<br />-Challenging puzzles, that are still fun.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-What are these \\"cons\\" of which you speak?<br /><br /> All-in-all one of the greatest games I have ever played, and one of the few new games that gives me hope for the gaming industry and makes me glad that I'm gamer and that I bought a DS.

0307266303|5.0|I listened to the audio version of this book to get some inspiration for my marathon training.  I found the book very entertaining and it did make me want to go out for a run.  The writer is a big fan of over-the-top adjectives and descriptions but that didn't bother me much as that seems to be common in the genre.  My favorite sections were the ones about the development of the modern running shoe, the writer's account of relearning how to run and the evolutionary research about man as a running species.  Given that the Tarahumara are highlighted in the title, the author should have given more depth to those characters and their history.  Some of the Western ultramarathoners described are more interesting (Scott Jurek) or more annoying (the pizza eating \\"kids\\") than others but all in I found it interesting to hear about their backgrounds.  While the writer spends a lot of time on barefoot running, I think the real take-away is that maintaining good running form is key to running ultra distances.  Barefoot running seems to help people find that right form.    Highly recommended book for runners.
034544678X|5.0|I have read this book, loaned this book, recommended this book, and bought this book for other dog owners. McConnell is a good writer (making the reading easy) and she includes a lot of anecdotes as examples throughout the book.    I've owned dogs all my life, and have always been a \\"good, responsible\\" owner. But this book made me a much better owner, with a different level of respect for dogs. I now understand in a new way how those canines perceive the world around them -- including we humans.
0375842209|5.0|In my Sophomore year of high school, i was given a list from which I was to pick a book to read and then write a paper about.  After reading the excerpt on The Book Thief, I decided to give it a hot.  I had to read one of them right?  It probably would just be another terrible school book...<br /><br />I was wrong.<br /><br />This book is truly something special.  I was transfixed through the whole thing; I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I found myself sobbing as I read through to the end, which isn't something that I normally do.  All I have to say is that it is definitely worth the read.
1594744769|4.0|Look at the cover of this book. Do you see the girl on the cover just standing there, minding her own business? Wait a minute! Is she standing or is she levitating? Somebody must have photoshopped that picture right? There is absolutely no way that photo is genuine. But what if? What if it is real?   Jacob has spent his whole life listening to his grandfather tell him stories about people who couldn't possibly be real. Not only did Jacob's grandfather have stories, he also had photographs of the most peculiar kind. However Jacob isn't a baby anymore and definitely does not believe in 'fairy stories'. When Jacob's grandfather dies under mysterious circumstances, Jacob has a bit of a melt down. Jacob sees something or someone that has him utterly frightened. Jacob's parents are convinced that he needs to let go of the past. To do so they plan a trip to a remote island off the coast of Wales. This island is where Jacob's grandfather grew up. This island is the key to unlocking the mysteries that surround Jacob.  I absolutely love Miss Peregrine's Home For Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs.  Not only is it exceptionally bizarre and wonderfully strange it's also really unique. Jacob is the main character in this novel. He longs to unlock some of the secrets of his grandfather's past. On the island he discovers something more than he had ever hoped to find. Something so astonishing he can hardly believe it himself.  This book is full of fantastic characters. Ransom Riggs includes many photographs in this novel. I love looking at them. The photos are interestingly strange. They really added to the novel and the storyline. I could have done without the creepy clown children pictures though. The storyline in this novel is really good. It's full of mystery and adventure. It's quite a paradox. If this book is not in your to be read pile, you need to put it there.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I have read this book multiple times since I first picked it up in Middle School. I love the way this story is told and love the unique point of view in which it is told from. It's not everyday you can pick up a book and read it from Death's POV. Since I've read it, I've recommended it to many people who have loved it as much as I have.

B0025UHKNS|3.0|I had this item only for a day. I charged the battery and installed the software from Garmin. Everything was going great and I was exited with it. Next morning I went out on my first exercise and after running 30 minutes or so the screen went blank and the watch died. I tried a hard reset and other tricks with support from Garmin but the item was deemed damaged.     However, I guess I'm that unlucky 1 out of thousands of individuals who get defective items from stores. I didn't use this item enough to test it, but I did a lot of research before buying it and it is a decent piece of equipment.

The quality of the book wasn't what was listed in the add...Over 50 pages were highlighted, notes written in the margin, and pages bent and folded. Horrible. I wouldn't use them again or recommend them!
B00009W0U4|4.0|What's life? What a non-sense, fragile and terrible existence can a normal life become?  The feeling after watching this movie were of horror and shocking despair.  The sense that all our life, the pursuit of happiness, can be destroyed so unmercifully and with huge cruelty is overwhelming.A movie to face with horror.  A movie to wake you up from your dream and complacence. This is real and is happening now in this world.    In that sense the movie is excellent!  I was shocked a coupled of days after watching this movie. My wife had to go to the bathroom twice during this movie (to vomit). A friend whom I recommended got shocked and complained with me (he didn't believe my warning)  So be warned.

B002V091IO|3.0|I was really excited by the premise of this book and enjoyed the way it was written.  Dexter and Emma's stories are told really well and you get a good sense of what has been happening in their lives even though we only here about them once a year.    What I struggled with in this book were the characters themselves - I really didn't warm to them at all.  This was particularly true of Emma, to the point where I got quite frustrated in parts at her behaviour/attitude.    This changed towards the end however and I was pleased with how the book ended.  Great concept and lovely writing, just not my sort of characters.  I'm looking forward to seeing the movie, it will be interesting to see how it's done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simply put, one of the best books I've ever read. The entire trilogy is absolutely riveting. I never wanted it to end.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|I love the layout of this keyboard. It's not often that you find a properly laid out numpad when you go to the numbers mode of the KB. I also like the idea of it \\"knowing\\" which word you will use next, but it's this very feature that kinda doesn't sit well with me. With SwiftKey X, not only am I slower at typing than I am with Swype, but I feel like I have to think too much to use it. Typing for me is brainless. Using SwiftKey isn't, because you look up and your next word isn't there. So you press the first key and look for your word. Still isn't there, so you press the next key and look for your word. Lather, rinse, & repeat. Add to that the fact that I feel like it's sometimes trying to tell me what my next word *should* be - rather than me typing the message I want, I end up saying something else and then wondering what on Earth I meant to say...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I would preface this review by saying that I would consider myself to be an Android enthusiast for the last 2 years and have had experience with several different android phones and keyboards. This by far is the best keyboard I have used. Not only does it look great and perform well, but the word prediction is awesome. I would say about every other word while typing emails or texts is predicted accurately. This feature is the key to faster composition.
B0058P7KUA|5.0|This game is an example of a perfectly executed app. Developer should get every bit of the revenue from this.     The game controls and premise are simple, and it provided a few hours of fun for me while allowing me to show off some of the fun things that I can do with my phone - thus assisting me in luring iKool-Aid drinkers away from their madness for a short time to entertain the idea that Android is a solid, fun platform.

B004J4WN0I|5.0|High praises for Kevin Hearne, and quite frankly, I do not know what I am going to read now.....  I have just finished the last book in the series, Hammered, and while glad to see the outcome, I am just sad it is over.   Please Please Please MORE MORE MORE.  I am already missing Atticus and Oberon.  The characters were so expertly flushed out, with consistent behavior and personalities.  I don't like it when characters do something so out of \\"character\\".  Atticus stikes me as a big kid and the whole world is his candy store.  He takes his status as the last Druid seriously, and feels deeply for the few people and animals he allows into his life. The author drops little hints about his past, and I would love to learn more about it.  I would like to see him fall in love. The best part of this series is that it is slick and extremely humorous.  I found myself laughing until tears were running down my cheeks.  I would run in and read these sections to my teenage son who would just look at me like I had lost my mind.  I am trying to convince him to read the series.  The dialogue and thoughts are witty, hip, and poking fun at some other characters odd behavior, dress and speech, as they have not caught up with the times.  Atticus shows himself to be a very protective and caring person, someone I would love to hang with.  I hope the author writes more, and has certainly left the last book open to it.  Keep up the fabulous work Mr. Hearne!
B000063KM1|1.0|Harold and Maude is one of my all time favorite movies, loves everything about it.  It is also a favorite of my favorite neice so when I saw it on amazon for a good price I checked it out.

I am so dissappointed, so now I have 2 copies of a DVD that I just look at the cover and feel used!
B0057A6GA6|2.0|this app was a little entertaining but there is a major flaw in its programming. With any other app if i pause the game then set my device down the gane stops consuming cpu and battery. Today i paused this game and turned off the screen thinking it would be fine i then put my tablet in its case and stored it for about 45 minutes. When i returned I noticed the light on my tablet was blinking.  when j pulled it out of its case is was burning hot. for some reason the game was still running like it was bieng played even though it was paused and the screen was turned off. im sure it would have killed my tablet if it had been left in this state for 15 more minutes. make sure to close the game before leaving your device. sont just pause it.

0002247402|2.0|Disclaimer: I am not yet finished with this novel. I'm currently on page 579 and finding it very difficult to go on. There will be some spoilers pertaining to what I've read so far so read at your own risk. Now onto the review:<br /><br />After reading A Feast for Crows, I remember simply feeling disappointed and rather apathetic towards the book. Nothing of significance really happened and too many of the characters just felt like unneeded extras in a series that already has enough characters and houses to keep track of as it is. After the emotional rollercoaster that was A Storm of Swords, it was simply an uneventful disappointment. Looking back on it, I can't recall many significant scenes or plot events from it. With Dance, this trend unfortunately continues.<br /><br />Though the characters that we all loved who were absent in Feast have returned (Tyrion, Daenerys and Jon Snow), they all seem uncharacteristically static and just not interesting, and when Tyrion chapters aren't interesting you know something is wrong. It feels like they all got lobotomies since we saw them in ASoS. Jon sits around on the Wall, Tyrion gets hauled around like a sack of oats and falls off a pig and the once charismatic Daenerys suddenly becomes a passive damsel in distress who spends all her time second-guessing herself while pining for a mercenary all with the personality of a post. This is not compelling character development.<br /><br />And on the topic of Daenerys, am I the only one who completely gets pulled out of the story whenever one of her chapters pop up? Everything happening in Meereen just seems so far removed from the events at the Wall and Winterfell that I just don't understand why we're being told about it. I understand Dany's story arch and her significance as a character, but she's been doing nothing crucial to the overall plot for so long that her chapters are becoming a burden to the pacing of the series. At this point, we need to see her making some progress with her dragons and getting ready to head to Westeros already. Instead she's smashing a slave trade and falling in and out of love with a mercenary with the personality of a brick. She's completely regressed as a character. With a title like A Dance With Dragons, I thought for sure we'd see her character develop in some major ways, but nothing.<br /><br />What happened to make the three main characters so boring though? Maybe it was just me...So I flipped to a random chapter from ASoS and sure enough, the writing and pacing there were still as excellent and tight as I remember it. If Feast showed us one thing, it's spending an excessive amount of time on a novel does not guarantee a higher quality product. If anything, the opposite is true. Many felt Martin was taking his time to ensure a quality product, but just like Feast before it, it's the opposite. I think the reason behind the wait was Martin simply doesn't know where he wants to take the series anymore so he's stalling, and that's what a lot of ADwD feels like, stalling.<br /><br />Many reviews have already made mention of this, but it bears repeating. This novel reads more like a travelogue or restaurant menu than an actual novel with any meaningful progression. I've passed the halfway point and it's amazing how little character progression has been made. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Martin was being paid by the word. There's so much padding and simply meaningless rambling that I've been half-tempted to just skim paragraphs, something I make a rule to absolutely never do when reading. Here's a particularly bad offender from a Jon chapter that literally made me sigh upon seeing it. Located on page 219 of the Hardcover, it reads:<br /><br /> \\"In the granaries were oats and wheats and barley, and barrels of coarse ground flour. In the root cellars strings of onions and garlic dangled from the rafters, and bags of carrots, parsnips, radishes and whire and yellow turnips filled the shelves. One storeroomheld wheels of cheese so large it took two men to move them. In the next, casks of salt beef, salt pork, salt mutton, and salt cod were stacked ten feet high. Three hundred hams and three thousand long black sausages hung from ceiling veams below the smokehouse. In the spice locker they found peppercorns, cloves, and cinnamon, mustard seeds, coriander, sage and clary sage and parsley, blocks of salt.

B0057A6GA6|1.0|I can get past the terrible English, but the game play itself is nothing good.  if you want a good tower defense, get Fieldrunners HD.  Halfway through each level the touch screen would start to flake out and the tap would not register 90% of the time.  switching apps also caused the graphics to scramble and make the game completely unplayable.  but if you an get past all the bugs, the game play is still less than acceptable for a tower defense game.
0446560065|5.0|So much to love in this book!  Some really excellent cartooning and insight into the experience of having a pet cat!  Lots of giggle-inducing and laugh out loud moments!  Warning: your mouth may get sore from smiling while reading this book!
B0044XV3R8|4.0|I've had this copy of the collector's edition DVD of Avatar for one whole month now and i'm pretty happy  with it. the only bad side is that when you play it on a full HD (1080P) monitor you get crappy video quality if you stretch the video in full sceen mode, otherwise you'll be forced to have a tiny window where the film is displayed for good quality. the Movie itself is a masterpiece and the 16 minutes extended collector'S edition is blastingly good. I'm not gonna get through detailed info of the \\"added\\" scenes to reveal you the \\"punch\\" of it, but it worth the etra buck you'll pay if you're an Avatar fan, or because u really loved this movie. The best case scenario would be to buy a Blu-Ray version with a blu-Ray Disk reader, but they cost around 100$. The most sensed alternative would be to play it on a tv screen with  a decent 5.1 home theatre system.    But you can always buy [[ASIN:B0044XV3QY Avatar (Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live) [Blu-ray]]]    Or buy the Blu Ray/DVD Combo [[ASIN:B002VPE1B6 Avatar (Two-Disc Original Theatrical Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo)]]    At some point i got so immersed in the movie, so immersed it would be like i was feeling what the characters were feeling      In conclusion. i would recommend this movie and DVD to anyone but if you can afford to pay the extra money for the blu ray version and all the hardware to play it, go for it. Nevertheless, this movie Rocks      Hope i helped some ppl    Best regards, Samuel G.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|These are brilliant live interpretations of a huge cross section of Genesis's work. Their early stuff from the Gabriel years is musically faithful - and even without Steve Hackett and Peter Gabriel they deliver the same musical magic. In fact Daryl Stuermer adds a fluency to the guitar parts that keeps them fresh and astonishing (see Firth of Fifth and Los Endos). Their later stuff was a pick of the best and the concert plays as a seamless celebration of the Genesis muse.     Several reviewers have criticized the key changes but these did not bother me a bit. Phil Collins is no longer in his 30s and if he tried to sing in those original keys, we may feel as embarrassed or disappointed as I do when I hear Art Garfunkel fail to carry the high notes in Bridge Over Troubled Water. Hats off to them for revising the arrangements to work within the limitations of Phil's natural voice. Good musicians have to find their way to the best key for the voices and instruments being used. It is a skill, not a cop out!    For me this is easily the best Genesis live collection after Seconds Out, and the only one I know that captures their later work on an equal footing with the early stuff.
0002247402|2.0|Like most GRRM fans, I couldn't wait to get this book.  I pre-ordered months ago, and reread the entire series in anticipation.  So, I am reading along, not quite sure about the book.  For example, Tyrion, my favorite character, seems less cynical and more annoying in his first couple chapters.  This seems kind of true of the other characters too - the author seems to have spent less effort making them likeable for all their faults.  Also, I am not sure what the point is for all the stuff about Sam and Gilly and Maester Aemon when we already know how that whole storyline turns out.  But, hey, I waited years for this book so I am still in the honeymoon stage.  But then I get to page 100.  This is one of Jon's chapters, and I am thinking... I read this before.  The conversation between Jon and Sam about the history of the Others.  So, I go to my handy dandy Kindle and do a search.  And the exact same conversation (with a few minor changes) is in A Feast for Crows.  So not only is GRRM losing interest, he is trying to fill pages by stealing from his previous books.  So how much of the rest of this book a literal rehash of the previous books?  Was it too much effort to write a whole new book?<br /><br />How George can get tired of such an incredible story, I don't understand, but maybe its time for him to sell the rights to one of his devoted fans who can give it the attention it deserves. It is a shame since up until now this series has told a story  on par with anything else I have ever read.
B00006EXDM|5.0|This two CD set is the best Stones compilation I have heard to date. There are some songs I would like to have been included, but then it would have been a four CD set!

0739302752|2.0|Listened to the audio version and found it to be generally a waste of time.  Very few legitmate new ideas or takeaways.  Almost exclusively aimed at very large organizations.  In addition, Bossidy sounds like Rick Moranis's accountant character in \\"Ghostbusters\\" and Ram Charan has such a thick Indian accent that I found him difficult to understand.  Not recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|***This review only concerns the formatting for The Hunger Games Trilogy-Kindle edition***    I downloaded this ebook trilogy collection on 7/23/11 and have found the same inconsistent font defect as other reviewers. I noticed that the font would suddenly change when beginning a new chapter or if I returned to the page I was reading after viewing a highlight or dictionary defintion.     And like another reviewer, I have also found that once I passed page 377 (the actual page 377 is the cover of the second book in the trilogy, Catching Fire), the trilogy always indicates that I am on page 377 of 379, even though I am well beyond that page, and it is clear from the final location number that there are obviously more than 379 pages in this collection of three books. The locations, however, do seem to track properly.      Although these formatting defects are not dealbreakers and I really enjoyed the books, they are annoying (with the ever-changing font size being the more annoying of the two). I hope the publisher will fix these defects and reissue a corrected version.
0316056863|5.0|Anyone who has ever seen Tina's work whether it be SNL, Meangirls or 30 Rock knows that the woman is quirky, brilliant and hilarious. When I saw the cover of Bossypants, I immediately started laughing and realized that I would be buying it soon. I'm glad I did! Tina did not diappoint. The only thing missing from Bossypants was another 100 pages so I could keep laughing. I literally laughed out loud so much while reading this book that my husband said one night, \\"What the heck is so funny?!?\\" Um that'd be Ms. Fey. If you are at all a fan of Tina's, this book is a great behind the scenes look into her mindset, her opinions (on everything from being a women in comedy to how to properly groom yourself), and how she went from being the greek girl with big eyebrows (which left unattended grow together) to the comedy writing genius she is today is a great story and makes for a wonderful read.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Regardless of whether the narrative is enjoyable, the accompanying maps are totally illegible in Kindle - too small, light and blurry. Especially since much of the action takes place in the East, a lack of a good map is a serious handicap.
0811875040|2.0|Disclaimer....I am a pastry chef and owner of a successful bakery/ pastry shop, so I don't judge a book based on it's adorableness, but on the usefulness and innovation of the recipes within, and Miette is indeed, high on charm, but the recipes really don't deliver. Because it's kind of a survey, rather than a book about just cake or just entremets etc. it's a little basic basic, and really obviously written by someone who isn't a trained chef or baker.<br /><br />If you're one who likes \\"coffee table\\" cook books with pretty photos and cute prose, this certainly does fit the bill, but most of the recipes lack any real originality and fall a little short on flavor, IMO.
B0055CJ8T2|5.0|A great collection showing her musical versatility.  Where it's obvious that she shines on mid-tempos such as \\"Motiviation\\" (1st single) & \\"Feeling Me Right Now\\", she has also gives us a magnificent ballad like \\"Keep It Between Us\\".  And any Kelly fan knows that she also has a propensity for the dance tracks...so she gives us a taste of that with the funky \\"Commander\\" & \\"Down for Whatever\\".  Also not to go unmentioned is the very radio friendly 2nd single \\"Lay It On Me\\" which should Ms. Rowland stay around the top of the charts for even more weeks to come.
B004EPZ070|5.0|I loved this movie!! I would really recommend reading the book & others by Emily Giffin. Of course the book is better than the movie, but the movie was really cute. It's not like most chick flicks, which are predictable. If you haven't read the book, the end will surprise you. My boyfriend went w/ me & actually said it wasn't bad, but I think he secretly really liked it (he was laughing through the whole thing). Can't wait for the dvd to come out!!
1614270775|2.0|It's difficult to know the purpose of this edition of Wilde's novella.  I didn't notice when I ordered it that it's not the size of a regular book--it's more the size of an academic journal or magazine.  Nearly 8 X 10 inches.  Further, there's no named editor, no introduction, no apparatus at all.  Just the text of the story--and that is printed in two columns on the page.  The result is a book that won't fit on the shelf and that is unpleasant to read.  Baffling.

1607886278|1.0|I faced a 10 hour drive on my own and decided to try an audiobook to pass the time. I picked this book because I'd read reviews and frankly, the price was right. Now I know why. The casting was not good. I do not understand the thinking behind the Ma character's voice/intonation. Flat, unemotive, far too \\"professional\\" for the character portrayed...Ma is smart, for sure, but this sounds like a lawyer or some professional, not like a mother actually talking to her child. Old Nick - just not believable as a scary predator (and I think he surfaces later as the voice of a doctor/policeman or something...?). He sounds a lot like Keanu Reeves, very distracting. And finally, the person who performed Jack's part did an admirable job for an adult sounding like a 5 year old.....but....it just didn't work for me. Maybe a book narrated by a 5 year old is just not a good candidate for an audiobook. I'm glad I only paid 19.95, but I'll never know what I would have thought of this book if I had read it instead of listening.

B00006LI4S|5.0|Prior to the release of the marvelous \\"Live At The Royal Albert Hall\\", this DVD is also something special. Biased as this review may be, since I am a fan from David Gilmour from his first solo release to his last effort \\"On An Island\\". The acoustic versions of some well known songs, \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" for instance, gives this set a feeling that you are witnessing an artist filled with divine inspiration and good taste. The DVD includes performances by Richard Wright and Michael Kamen, both brilliant musicians that departed too early!
0553801473|3.0|The recent popularity of HBO's Game of Thrones adaptation left a lot of my friends interested in the books the show was based on. As a long time reader of Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series I recommended the books, quite enthusiastically. When A Dance With Dragons was released I got quite a few questions from my friends wondering how I liked it, as they had not yet caught up. And for the first time I really struggled with recommending one of these books.<br /><br />ADwD is clearly a middle book in a series; no one should dispute that. But even so I don't think it's unreasonable to expect some resolution within the story. Since the press is set on dubbing Martin \\"The American Tolkien,\\" I'd like to draw some comparisons between Dance and The Two Towers. Both books are the middle books of a series and serve to set the stage for the coming conflict. The difference is that the Two Towers provides resolution where Dance does not. By the end of the two towers Helm's Deep has been defended, Isengard cast down, and Frodo captured by the enemy with the stage set for the larger battle to come. We are provided with resolutions to plotlines contained within The Two Towers as well as forward movement of the overall plot arc. However, had The Two Towers been structured in the same was as Dance, Helm's Deep would still be under siege, Gandalf would hear about Isengard after the fact and the book would end as Shelob bites Frodo. The stage would certainly be set for the next volume, but the reader is robbed of conclusion within the current one. That is the heart of the trouble with Dance. It feels like the characters are spinning their wheels, waiting for the pieces to be set up *just right* before anything happens.<br /><br />Hand in Hand with this issue are the chapters and chapters of traveling and world-building. I love the Song of Ice and Fire series,so normally I would love getting all these details about the rich world in which it takes place. Yet how much do I really needto know about the tortoises Tyrion sees in the river? How many types of Lamprey pies and other sundry foodstuffs need to be described to me? The end result is that I do indeed have a good idea of what the world looks, smells, feels and tastes like. But I got those same impressions in the first books too in a lot less space. I didn't need multiple chapters of Cersei wandering aimlessly around the Red Keep to get a feel for it. Whereas before such descriptions were worked in almost seamlessly, augmenting and enhancing the story, here they seem to push the story out of the way. And that, for me is a problem. Yes, the journey can be as important as the destination, but that implies we actually reach the destination. Even then such segments could lead to giving us more insight into these characters. That would be something I wouldn't mind. Yet the characterization here seems all over the place. Tyrion, Daenerys, and Jon all seem to suffer from shifts in personalities. Tyrion goes from the shrewd, witty and confident character we all loved, to riding pigs and wondering endlessly about 'where whores go.' Daenerys, the mother of dragons who has from the start wanted to reclaim her family's throne, instead sits in Mereen and leavers her dragons chained and forgotten. I guess after teaching them to shoot fire on command in ASoS she just gave up on training them. Jon actually makes some interesting decisions (between checking the food-stores), but his story line is left on a cliffhanger so we only begin to see the fallout of his actions.<br /><br />It's not all bad though, in fact there are very strong portions in Dance. Davos remains one of my favorite characters, and his chapters with Manderly are some of the strongest in the book in my opinion. The Reek chapters are also incredibly well written and illicit a visceral response that makes me both love and dread reading them(for all the right reasons). I would have liked to have seen more of them, but I was happy with what Igot. Even in the chapters I found less interesting the prose was as strong as ever. The problem was too much of it in some points, I think some cuts would have really strengthened the book as a whole.<br /><br />This has already gone on for longer than I intended, so let me bottom-line it for you. A Dance with Dragons is a good book. Only good though. That's a shame because the previous books were great.
B000UD08HW|5.0|What more can I write in order to convince people to buy this title? The answer is simple: nothing! This DVD (I got both versions, DVD and Blu-Ray) is something that makes you feel happy to be in this planet at the same time as this wonderful musician, which plays the guitar like no one else in the whole progressive rock world. The musicianship displayed in this concert, from the special guests to the veteran players, is awesome. Buy it now!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Best game. Waited forever for it to get on the Android market, but was well worth the wait. Runs perfect on the Samsung Epic.
B0055D3EOG|5.0|A movie with some real genuine scares. I'm 44 yrs old, I've found some of the younger generation have been de-sensitized when comes to at least horror movies. The movie has genuine scares relying on sounds, lighting, good costume and make-up, an overall atmosphere set nicely for a some good scares. Horror movies are not all about blood splatter, gore & CGI effects. Real horror movies that want to scare you will have a good atmosphere, good acting and a decent script, this movie has it all.<br />  For the reviewers that complain about the ending, it's an ending thats in-line with a \\"Twilight Zone\\" twist type ending. For most those that are in their 20's they probably won't understand that. Basically not every movie has to have a happy ending, or even one that will answer every single question for you throughout to the end of the movie.<br />  If a movie ends with an un-expected event that may leave you hanging....then the writers did their job...they caught you off gaurd and you'll have to use your imagination to finish the story.<br />  My 22 yr old step-daughter told me when I asked her if the movie was any good? She said \\"your not missing nothing and a dumb ending\\". I took that chance and watched it. I found that she did not grow up with shows like \\"Outer Limits\\" or \\"Twilight Zone\\" which often had a slight twist at the end. If you have no clue on how those shows generally ended up, then you may not get this movie at all.<br />  I will agree with some reviewers about the scene when the Father checks the front door the first time and it wasnt even locked to begin with, then he doesnt even lock it after closing it back, but only puts on the chain lock, that would be poor scene on part of the screenwriter, aside from that no issues with this one. Be sure to watch it in the dark.
B0057A6GA6|1.0|This type of game has great appeal, but the premise is just off-color. It could have been more of an all-ages game minus the zombies and imagery. Some may not care about this detail, and perhaps that is the point in itself.

B004RJMUJO|4.0|Fruit Ninja might hit the sweet spot for mobile games -- instantly playable, a lot of high-score appeal, decent enough options to keep it fresh, and the inability to put the game down.  For $0.99, fruit ninja is an excellent game and a total steal, one of the best Android games available.<br /><br />I am docking 1 point only because in the port from iOS it just doesn't seem as high res as some of the other new Android games.  Compared to Cut the Rope and even veteran Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja looks like it's not as sharp on my 4.3\\" AMOLED.  I could be crazy, but I think it's true.

B004A8ZX28|1.0|Big Liam Neeson fan here, but this movie is below stupid. Based on a French novel that's probably much better, the film follows a professional assassin who, after a car accident, forgets his true identity and believes he is his cover identity, an agricultural biologist. Along the way he meets a displaced Bosnian illegal immigrant who shows some incredible fist-fighting skills (and who just seems too German to be Bosnian), and his real boss who turns out to be a gentle gentleman. And of course, the \\"bad guys\\" never kill the protagonist without a long speech and, therefore, a chance to get killed first. The last 30 minutes are especially pathetic. It's also a pity that handsome German actor is never put to good use.

0062060554|4.0|Imagine starting every day with no memory of what happened yesterday, the day before, or even the last 20 years? Where are you? Who is the man sleeping beside you? When did you get so old? This is what happens to Christine every morning. Every day her husband Ben has to explain who he is and why she has no memory. Years ago, Christine was in an accident that resulted in her inability to form new memories. Though she can remember facts through the day, once she sleeps, her mind resets and she has to start over again. In an attempt to recover some of her memories, Christine starts journaling the facts she learns each day. She soon discovers that the stories she's being told just don't add up.    SJ Watson does a fantastic job of creating suspense as Christine gathers evidence to uncover the truth. Will Christine start her day with panic, disorientation, or a niggling sense of the recent past? And even more unsettling - will Christine put her trust in words she can't remember writing, or in the believable stories being told to her by those around her? Before I Go to Sleep takes the reader on a psychological journey fraught with unanticipated hazards, and once you are hooked it's a difficult book to put down. A great summer read!
B0050I2PQE|4.0|I have just watched the concert footage and the documentary for the second time. On those two parts I would give a 3 star rating. But I added another star for the remastered CD live tracks. Wow. There are some great moments culled from those two concerts from Japan and Long beach California. Dec 75 and Feb 76 respectively. The tracks from the California concert are especially good. Tommy Bolin was hampered by his drug use on the first concert mentioned. I've read various accounts of why he could barely play on that night, still the other four carry the load very well. And on the Long Beach tracks, they are all just smokin! Come taste the band has long been a favorite album of mine. Though its not considered a proper Deep Purple Album. Whatever! It blows away their previous record Stormbringer. And I say that as a total purple fanatic. The best part of the Stormbringer album was jon lord's keyboard solo on the song \\"Highball shooter\\". CTTB is molten Rock and It just gets better with time. The live tracks show what could have been if they did not self destruct. A shame really. But thankfully they reformed with the mark 2 line up and have made tons more great music since the 70's. There is a bootleg show of their's recorded on the same tour in Miami in early febuary 76. The sound isn't too great but its listenable and there are parts that are just even better. It would be great if they would remaster that show and put it out. You can check it out on YOu tube. Keep on Rocking.   Richard from Bradford PA
B00479SVBU|5.0|Satechi's Sound-Fly Aux is everything I'd hoped.  I've tried it in two cars and it works flawlessly.  I have some of my favorite music on a USB flash drive and as soon as I dialed 96.3 into it and tuned my radio to the same frequency the music was playing!    I was also considering replacing my car stereo so I would have a USB jack available for my USB flash drives.  However, this would cost considerably more, especially with labor, and isn't really even an option in one of my cars because the car stereo in it is proprietary and can't be upgraded without upgrading the whole car.    Sound-Fly Aux makes it possible for me to play my music from a USB flash drive (or SD Card) with minimal expense or fuss!    Turning the car off and then back on again, I was pleased to find the Sound-Fly Aux starts playing at the beginning of whichever song was playing before instead of going back to the very first song on the USB flash drive every time.  This is much better than expected!    As I say in the title, it's as if I've installed a multi-cd changer in my car, and all this for $40, plus the memory, but they're practically giving it away these days!    The Sound-Fly Aux was able to stand up in a Honda Fit, even with a USB flash drive installed.  Because the USB flash drive looks a little like it might get bumped I'm going to switch to using SD Cards, which will likely work equally well.    In my older Geo Prizm, the cigarette lighter is in the bottom left corner of the countoured center console, making it impossible to have the Sound-Fly Aux standing up, especially with a USB flash drive plugged into it.  Still, I was able to plug the Sound-Fly Aux in on its side and it worked just fine.  If switching to SD Cards will help I will consider doing so, however I actually prefer the USB flash drive because I'm able to grab hold of it better with my medium size hands.    I plan to take the the Sound-Fly Aux with me when I travel and use it in the rental car!  How else would I be ableto play music that's on my USB flash drive in a rental car!?  :-)    The thing I also really like about the Sound-Fly Aux is that because it plays music that's on my USB flash drive or SD Card, I no longer have to play cd's in my car.  So no more having to avoid every pothole in the road to avoid having the cd skip.  No more cd's = no more skipping!  :-)    The Sound-Fly Aux seems to be one of those products that just works!!  I'm able to press the next and previous buttons easily to get to the next song and holding them down for 2 seconds is all it takes to get to other folders!    I haven't even tried using the remote control, something that could prove useful for backseat DJ's.    I'm so happy with the Sound-Fly Aux already, anything else I discover about it is going to just be a bonus!    Hint:  I looked far and wide to find the Sound-Fly by Satechi.  At around the same time, I also found and purchased a Zenex portable media player.  Like the Sound-Fly Aux, the Zenex media player plays audio from a USB flash drive Or an SD Card, the difference being the Sound-Fly is ideal for playing in the car, while the Zenex media player is portable.  I recommend both so be sure to check out the Zenex player (ZN-SP5569) also.
B001DHE9KG|5.0|La boh&egrave;me, by Puccini, was first performed in 1896. This performance from 2008 at the Met has great set designs for the scenes. The Paris street scenes, the large crowds in the street, and the snow scenery. Ram&oacute;n Vargas plays the tenor Rodolfo and Mimi is soprano singer Angela Gheorghiu.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|A longtime YES fan -- I well remember waiting in the rain to see YES play at the 1975 Reading Rock Festival -- I was more than prepared to HATE this new incarnation of YES. Truth in lending: From what I can make out, \\"YES\\" treated Jon Anderson abysmally. So while I'd never invite a one of them to dinner...<br /><br />FLY FROM HERE is shockingly good. What YES may lack in interpersonal skills they make up for with superb musicianship. FLY FROM HERE is a joy to put on \\"endless repeat.\\" Yes, even open-minded YES fans will find much to love and admire in the music. Benoit David is a fabulous front man. Great voice.<br /><br />And FFH has a fabulous Roger Dean cover.<br /><br />Hoping YES rock on. Another creation of this quality would be wonderful.<br /><br />And now... to dust off my DRAMA CD and give it another listen. After all... the Buggles are back!

B0007PAMR4|3.0|I've heard of this film for years, but not until recently, did I realize how much of a dud this film was considered by critics, and even by the director himself.  After all, I've never heard of a film this epic, with this kind of budget, being pretty much disowned by it's director. Even to the extent that he requested his name be removed from the credits. This immediately intrigued me. Is this movie THAT bad? I had to see for myself.<br /><br />Now first off, I want to say that I didn't read the novel before watching the film. Again, I've heard of this film for years, but quite honestly, didn't know it was a film adaptation of a novel until recently. That being said, I know that I might get some criticism from die hard fans of the novel and/or of this film. In fact, I might come off sounding ignorant while reviewing this film simply because I haven't read the novel. There's absolutely no doubt that I would have understood a lot more, and perhaps enjoyed it a lot more than I did if I had.<br /><br />The prologue that begins the film tries to explain the overall back story, but for me, all it did was confuse the heck out of me. The crazy names, places, and events the narrator were describing seemed like it was in a different language. For me, it was a lot of stuff to take in all at once and most of it went over my head. Now I'm not saying I'm the smartest guy out there, but I'm not a moron. And I can say there's been very few films that I've just felt lost while watching. But in the beginning of this film, that's what I was. Even with the beginning narrative, all the character's names sounded like made-up gibberish, I still didn't know who was who,  and I still didn't know what the heck they were all talking about. But as the movie went along, I began to get the jest of most of it. Even though there's a bunch of things said, that just seem nonsensical: \\"He who can destroy a thing, controls a thing\\" or \\"Try looking into that place where you dare not look. You'll find me there, staring back at you.\\" There's a lot lines like these where I just chuckled to myself. Part because of the actual verbiage and part of the over-dramatization of the sentences themselves.<br /><br />Now as far as the complexity and weirdness of the plot, this film equally matches that with it's elaborate sets, costumes, and special effects. There are undoubtedly some of the craziest costumes I've ever seen in a film. Weird hairdos, nasty warts and blisters, unbelievably bushy eyebrows, tubes in nostrils, and leather outfits galore.. This movie has it all. And special effects aren't too bad for its time either I suppose. Though I can't say I'm overly impressed. Especially the shield effect that was used, which was just way too bulky and box-looking. It looked just plain bad. However, for the most part, this is what I enjoyed most about the film. The crazy costumes and effects.<br /><br />As far as the cast goes, it contains a decent array of actors, including Patrick Stewart, Brad Dourif,and Max Von Sydow. But actually, none of the cast really stood out to me as far as great performances go. For me, a lot of the characters were played overly dramatic, almost Shakespearian. Maybe that was the point, but I thought that it was a bit too much. But again, this is Dune. I don't think the words \\"too much\\" are in this film's vocabulary. After all, in one scene you have Sting holding a cage with a cat and rat tied together, while a real ugly fat guy is telling the other ugly bushy eyed-brow guy that he's has to milk a cat daily otherwise he dies. Yeah. I rest my case.<br /><br />Ultimately, I think what hurt this movie the most was that there was simply too much information crammed into the film. Too much plot, too much explanation. And too much use of narration to try to speed up the story. It just didn't work. Characters and their relationships with other characters seemed hurried to develop far too quickly. Especially towards the end where it just felt like a hurried, jumbled mess. That's why in most cases, I think its difficult to adapt novels into movies, especially this kind of novel.  Because you risk ruining the film by leaving too much stuff out, or ruining it by cramming too much stuff in. I think this should have been at least a 2 part film, perhaps a trilogy, much like Lord of the Rings. With that, you would have plenty of time to develop a story and characters. And I think because of that slower pace, it would have been a lot easier to understand for those who hadn't read the novel first. So is this film as bad as critics said it was? Is it worthy of having its director David Lynch basically disowning it? Well no, I don't think it is as bad as that. But its certainly not great by any means. The crazy weird plot and characters aren't really the problem. Its just with so much information and plot to absorb while seeing all this stuff happening on screen, it makes it hard on grab onto. Its clear that this movie has a certain fan base, but the way the film is made, it makes it almost impossible to win over a causal moviegoer, or anyone that hasn't read the book first. And that's what I recommend for anyone who's interested in watching this film for the first time. Try reading the book first. This will undoubtedly help your cause.cases, I think its difficult to adapt novels into movies, especially this kind of novel.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|I think if you put a Feast for Crows into a single interwoven volume with Dance with Dragons, and if Dance had been 200 pages longer, there is a fine story there.<br /><br />Without a doubt there are great story lines and good characters in Dance. What is lacking is any discipline on the part of the author to honor that unspoken pledge with his readers to \\"get the whole story out there\\" in manageable form. Just when things get interesting ... he ends it.<br /><br />Feast had too much action. Dance not enough. Put them together and I suspect they balance out - if you could \\"sell\\" the public on a 2000 page or so book.<br /><br />7 volumes should be enough to tell the story. But at the rate plot development is going, it seems like at least 12 volumes will be needed, unless things get totally rushed at the end.<br /><br />I wouldn't care if Martin worked with a good writing panel (call 'em ghosts if you want) since he is a wonderful story teller (but perhaps not a wonderful writer). Then the \\"database\\" of character insights, backstory history, could be woven into a more compact, more disciplined book. Or books.<br /><br />Things I didn't like about Dance:<br /><br />Daenerys, the second best character in the series, seems incapable of being tough enough to rule, and ditzes around, then makes a horrible choice to avoid a war that is inevitable anyway. The \\"real\\" Dany only comes through in her last chapter....<br /><br />We didn't get enough of Tyrion at his best, showing off what a wonderfully smart administrator and keen politician he is.<br /><br />Jon Snow is acting like he is 20 years more experienced than he is, but makes some incredibly stupid choices at the end.<br /><br />Arya, a really interesting character in the previous books, has chapters that seem \\"tossed off.\\" What was arcane and mysterious, a \\"girl's best adventure\\" feel, that somehow seems mundane on this re-visit.<br /><br />This book is about a 3, Feast was about a 2, the series is better than a 5. In this case the sum is much greater than its parts, but I no longer have hopes that Martin will ever finish it. Clearly he has other projects (not only HBO) and at the same time he seems unwilling to take guidance from his editors and just get the book out there.<br /><br />On the other hand if he can get the next book out there in less than 2 years, he will certainly probably win me back. I mean Dickens and Dumas pounded out great pulp fiction, pulp fiction that was at the same time art, and Song of Fire and Ice clearly has that potential as well.this case the sum is much greater than its parts, but I no longer have hopes that Martin will ever finish it.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|The Maze Runner was such an addicting book that I would sneak into the bathroom at 3am to continue reading (the other members of my household don't quite understand that teen boys attempting to escape a horrific maze is much more important than petty things such as \\"food\\" and \\"sleep\\").  After having this book recommended to me by a close friend, I decided to try it out. I'm a big fan of Dashner's 13th Reality series, so I went into this book with high expectations. I was not disappointed. Dashner has woven a creative plot with characters that have depth. He created a world full of horrors that modern Americans like me can only dream of- literally. I had a few nightmares about being trapped in mazes after this, so beware.   In 24 hours, I demolished TMR and am now eagerly tearing through The Scorch Trials. This is a phenomenal read for anyone who is a fan of dystopian YA sci-fi.  Totally worth the money:)

Her courage, strength, and determination to survive against all odds, makes it a story to remember.  I just want to wish Jaycee, her daughters, and her family nothing but good things for the future.  You all deserve that and more!!!
1451629184|5.0|Well first of all, I have to say that I think Jaycee is an amazing person for what she went through, and it must have taken incredible courage to be able to write her story. The book is very well written and spares no detail. Although what happened to this young girl is very upsetting, it is unbelievable how a person can cope in such a difficult situation. I was shocked by how the Garridos forced Jaycee to live, and how she made it through those conditions. It also gave me insight into what Phillip Garrido was really like and how he was able to manipulate people, and get away with what he did. This book is definitely inspiring.

B004Y1USV2|1.0|WARNING: This is *not* a Yes album, it is a Buggles reunion album (as evidenced by the song credits), using former Yes members as session musicians. And... it... is... so... booooooooring. Uninspired songwriting, bland vocals. Benoît David is NO Jon Anderson, that's for sure. This album serves only one purpose - to prove once and for all that any Yes lineup without Jon Anderson is not Yes. Anderson's absence is painfully evident in everything from the vocals to the songwriting.     This album will only collect dust from now on, and everytime I see it on the shelf it will send pangs into the deepest recesses of my heart with longing for what once was.     But... Hope springs eternal. Yes - the true Yes - have reformed before, against all odds. Will we be lucky enough to experience one more true reunion before old age starts to reap our one-time heroes?

0670022411|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and tried to read it in stages rather than all at once in order to make the story last as long as possible.  I found this book to be more intelligently written than those of the Twilight series, etc.  As someone with an advanced degree, the fact that it made me think about many words and theories brought forth in these pages made it for a more interesting read for me.  I would have been upset at the ending if Ms. Harkness was not planning to write a sequel.  As such, the ending simply made me that much more anxious for the publication of the next in the series.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes the idea of fiction of the supernatural, but prefers a more complex read than most others that are popular right now.

I can't believe it's actually a disc from Sony, the originator of the BD format.  Do NOT buy the Blu-ray disc!  It won't play in any BD player (even the newest ones), although some have had luck getting it to play with external memory (USB flash drive or SD card, 2GB or less) plugged in.  I can't get it to play on any of my latest BD players, even with memory plugged in.  This just sucks big time.  Should have stuck with the DVD format.<br /><br />UPDATE: After writing the above it occured to me to try playing it on my PS3 and Sony BD-equipped PC. Voila, it played fine on both.
B004EWFV9K|1.0|In the last year, I became a fan of Henning Mankell's series of Swedish mystery novels featuring his iconic character, detective Kurt Wallander.  As fans of the series know, Mankell decided to bring the series to an end, publishing the last of his Wallander books, \\"The Troubled Man,\\" in late March.  I wish I could say that it's a worthy end to the series; alas, it's not.     In this book, Wallander is weighted down throughout by his sense of the encroachment of old age (but he's only 60!) and a weakening of his mental powers. The melancholy this sense stirs up pervades the whole book.  The central narrative involves Wallander's efforts to discover what happened to a former Swedish submarine commander and his wife, both of whom suddenly disappear without a trace.  As things unfold, the wife's body is soon discovered and Wallander deduces the whereabouts of the husband.  The investigation takes Wallander deep into spy plots and Cold War espionage.  None of it is particularly suspenseful or interesting.  And the whole plot seems draggy and tired (like poor Wallander himself). Worst of all, after he wraps the whole thing up rather hastily, Mankell ends up disposing of our beloved hero/detective with one lousy paragraph.  Talk about a rude send-off!
0670022411|1.0|This was so bad. And then the ending just summed it all up. There was no ending. I felt like a chump with good reason.

This book zips along in wonderful, taut prose, thanks in part to Bartlett's work.

The ending, although satisfying is also frustrating.  The cliff hanger is great and made me want to start reading the second of the trilogy immediately.<br /><br />Also frustrating to me is the translation and the fact that everything happens in foreign countries, which I know very little about and can't even begin to pronounce their names.  The settings are described beautifully, although sometimes I thought a little too thoroughly.  Due to the books' origin, most of the characters also have very foreign names.  However, even with those irritants, I really enjoyed this novel.<br /><br />Shelley Dawn, author of [[ASIN:144954892X Sweet, Sweet Jessie]] and [[ASIN:1451549725 Dark Nights]]
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|As I read this book, I alternately winced with pain and laughed out loud. Kevin is such an evil kid; his malevolence is evident even as a toddler, and his mother's reaction to his character is delicious.  I read this book on my Kindle and I bookmarked so many passages that I thought were fabulous -- something I don't usually bother to do because I know I won't go back and read those paragraphs again.  But I did, and I did.     Shriver is an exceptionally fine writer.  This is not a frivolous novel at all.  Nor is Shriver a frivolous writer.  This book is full of important insights about the parent-child relationship, about marriages, and about American society.  Shriver is a journalist, and this book reveals her journalistic sensibility.  If, like me, you somehow missed reading \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" when it came out in 2003, do yourself the favor of reading it now.  This is a compelling, breathtakingly impressive book

1439148953|5.0|Colm Tóibín's \\"Brooklyn\\" is the first book of his that I've read. This is a sad failure on my part. After finishing \\"Brooklyn,\\" I'm now committed to reading more of Tóibín's work; he is an exceptionally fine writer.     Tóibín's Brooklyn is the 1950s story of Eilis Lacey, a young Irish woman from Enniscorthy, Ireland, who finds herself packed off to Brooklyn, NY, at the urging of her older sister Rose, to find what America offers: work, opportunity, adventure.   With the help of an Irish priest in Brooklyn, Eilis finds a job at a small department store, lodging at a boarding house for young women, and enrollment in a certificate program at Brooklyn College that prepares her for work as a bookkeeper.  She also finds herself in love with Tony, an Italian-American fellow who is smitten with Eilis and is patient, kind, and loving in his courting of her.  Difficulties ensue (of course!).    This is a moving and heartfelt story about the immigrant experience in America.  It's about fitting in.  About the power of place: Brooklyn and small-town Ireland. About heart and home.       Tóibín's prose is so restrained, so calm, so simple and clean as to be unusually elegant.  This novel is packed with emotion; it's a careful study of regret.  But Tóibín's story unfolds with such understatement and control that the reader doesn't feel its full force sneaking up until the powerful ending.  This is a magnificent novel. I loved it. And now I will read more of Tóibín's books.

0307472841|2.0|I'm a fan of Henning Mankell's series of novels featuring master detective Kurt Wallander.  I've just finished this great Swedish mystery writer's recent stand-alone novel, The Man from Beijing.  It's a big, sprawling narrative, spanning centuries and continents.  It's also a big disappointment. Mankell's exceptional talent is on display through only part of this long novel.     The story starts out like most of the author's works -- with the discovery of some sort of horrific murder, in this case a mass murder of 19 people in a remove Swedish village. The first hundred pages or so move along fairly crisply, in typical Mankell fashion.  But then the story shifts to the 1860s in the American West, later to contemporary China, to Africa, and to London.  But the plot twists are often so incredible and artificial as to defy the laws of possibility, much less of probability.  Worse yet, much of this novel seems like a platform for Mankell to deliver mini-lectures on China's political and economic developments and its imperialism in Africa.  It's crudely didactic, sometimes laughably so.  We get lengthy disquisitions on Mao and Deng, as well as on the brewing discontent in China on the part of rural masses whose continuing poverty belies the riches increasingly on display in the cities.  Okay.  But none of this is at all necessary to this narrative. Too often here Mankell reminded me of weak students who pack their term papers with irrelevant information simply because, by golly, they learned it and they want others to know they went to that trouble.  And, as I say, Mankell sometimes does this so ineptly that it's like product-placement in a movie that is so blatant that you can't help but laugh when you see it.  Near the end of the book, smack-dab in the middle of a tense conversation between two characters about a threatening situation, Mankell has a Chinese character deliver this little gem:    \\"China is no more secretive than any other country.  It's a Western myth that our country is incomprehensible.  The Europeans have never accepted that they simply don't understand the way we think. Nor that we made so many crucial discoveries and inventions before you acquired the same knowledge. Gun-powder, the compass, the printing press, everything is originally Chinese. You weren't even first to learn the art of measuring time.  Thousands of years before you started making mechanical clocks we had water clocks and hourglasses.  You can never forgive us for that.\\"     And instead of somehow responding to this, or even reacting to the absurdity of being treated to this little historical lesson in the middle of this conversation about other things, the other character simply resumes the discussion where it left off, asking \\"When did you last meet [her]?\\"   Sheesh.  Come on.
B001POX73C|5.0|I picked this book up because it was a free kindle book (temporarily).  I had never heard of Georgette Heyer before reading it.  I loved it!  It was sweet, charming and a nice afternoon escape.  Loved it so much I bought Grand Sophy which was just as good.  I think it's very smart of the publisher to put books as free even for a short time - this allows people to pick up the book who otherwise wouldn't (as I did).  Now I'm hooked on Heyer's books.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Slow and monotonous for the most part.  It may have middle book syndrome, but that doesn't excuse it for being a sub par book.
0316044938|5.0|Lovely, beautiful prose - so achingly sad that it made me cry, which is rare. What a gift this book was, I cannot explain how much I loved it. From the very believable flight of Susie's mother long after her death, to her father's self-destruction, to Susie's version of heaven, it was all lovingly and beautifully portrayed. I cannot say enough good things about this book.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This story is honest and heartbreaking.<br /><br />The story was difficult to read at times, the words are hers and hers alone, and that in itself is compelling.<br /><br />While her story is heartbreaking, you can tell that in her writing she is still a vulnerable child and it strikes a chord with how much of her life she has lost in captivity.<br /><br />She has a long road ahead of her.
145150506X|4.0|First thing to say is that I was surprised when a saw the book, it was quite bigger than what I thought I would be. I just did not read the Product Dimensions in the description, be sure whether you want to buy a big book or not. I have to say I was dissapointed because I expected a smaller book to carry it everywhere. About the content of the book I just have to say that it is amazing, Edgar Allan Poe is a GENIUS, this is the kind of author that catches you from the first page to the last one. The best thing about the book is that you do not have a selection of the tales that only shows one side of Poe. If you really want to get into the world of Edgar Allan Poe this is the book you must buy. You will not regreat it, it is worth to buy it, and you do not have to worry about the price it is really low compared with the quality of book and reading you have in this product.<br /><br />One thing that really could be a problem is that the print is very small, some people will find that really annoying.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I actually bought this game on the Android Market when it first came out a few months ago and I thoroughly enjoy it.  Seeing as to how it's free on Amazon today, you have no reason not to try this game if you are a tower defense fan.  It's no Defense Grid, but for a mobile platform it is very good.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Outstanding app. One of my favorites: very customizable, intuitive, easy to use. love the 'shake to snooze' feature!!  Ads aren't overly intrusive.  Great product.

0811875040|1.0|When I first saw this book on Amazon, I knew it was exquisite.  It was just the way I bake.  So elegant!  I ordered two books--one for myself and one for someone very  \\"SPECIAL\\".  I thought perhaps a great shower gift!   I was not aware of the \\"ERRATA\\"  issued on this book--a full page OF ERRORS IN MEASUREMENTS    I was very, very disappointed.  I called Miette Bakery and I was told  Miette would be reprinted in the Fall. I am planning on writing to Chronicle Books and requesting two new books--CORRECTED ONES.  Unbelievable.  Thank You.  CLC
B001VLXNLU|4.0|I just finished the last book in this series. While this is not my FAVORITE author or series of books they did get better with each installment. But the first one didn't start off very well, in my opinion.<br /><br />Zoey immediately finds herself marked as a vampire - or rather vampyre (why this spelling?) - fledgling and realizes she's going to have to leave her school to attend The House Of Night. My first thought was that she didn't seem nearly as freaked out by this turn of events as she should have been. She seemed to roll with it pretty well. There wasn't any building of the plot at first. We didn't get to know Zoey as a \\"normal\\" girl and it didn't lead up to her becoming a vampyre fledgling. It sort of went from zero to eighty in the first few pages.<br /><br />I also agree with another persons review that the \\"hee hees\\" the author included throughout the book(s) were stupid and annoying.  \\"hee hee\\" would have been bad enough but \\"hee hees\\"?? But - I stuck with it and read the book to the end and then purchased the second one (on my Kindle).  I found each book to be better than the last, in spite of the \\"hee hees\\". I actually enjoyed #2 through #8 and look forward to #9.<br /><br />I hate reading a book I like and have it truly be \\"the end\\" because it's so hard to then find another one I can get into. So I like it when I can find a series of books, such as \\"The House Of Night\\" since I had 8 books to read. I also enjoyed \\"The Morganville Vampire\\" - Glass House series and felt that they too got better with each one.<br /><br />One thing I did appreciate about \\"The House Of Night\\" and it's sequels is that it DID hold surprises. Things happened to the main characters that I didn't see coming. It wasn't predictable or full of sugary gag inducing, one guy/one girl, teen romance stuff.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|Test devices:<br />Samsung Epic, Android 2.2 official<br />Viewsonic gTablet, Calkulin+Clemsyn 1.5ghz Froyo Combo V6<br /><br />It's hard to say what is best about this game, because there is just so much.  The graphics are outstanding, especially when view on my gTablet.  Full on sound effects and background music, little power-ups, and a bunch of small additions which made GRave Defense HD that much better.  On both devices, the game runs smoothly, not a single hitch or hiccup.  Seriously, couldn't be more pleased.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful, and if not, feel free to leave comments/questions.
B003UESJH4|5.0|The entire film was very well done. Most of my students have Speech/Language Impairments and I saw a lot of what they experience in Firth's character. My school's Speech Pathologist actually recommended it to me.
0307716511|3.0|I didn't really enjoy this book.  Just personal taste.  I like my mysteries to take me on a ride, and move me along in the story.  I felt this mystery moved slowly forward, then backed up, then moved forward slowly again.  Gave it 3 stars because of the good prose.  However, a very, very slow mystery.
B0053YEM7U|3.0|I reviewed this after a couple of listens and commented on the difficulty of replacing a voice as unique as Jon Anderson. I am now revising my initial response. The more I have listened, the more I have grown to enjoy this record. The songs are melodic, well performed and produced. I don't think this is quite the bold move Yes intended, but is certainly a welcome addition to the canon. If one listens objectively, Benoit David holds his own very well here. He does a much better job singing this material than he does with the back catalog. If I were to see the band play live today, this material is what I would want to hear. So, my knee jerk response was wrong. If you listen to this own its own terms. you will find it worth the price.
0439023521|5.0|Finally broke down and read this trilogy while on vacation a few weeks back. Did not expect to read the entire series in a week, however, once I started I just could not stop! I enjoyed this authors previous series as well, so I guess it should not have surprised me, especially with all the amazing reviews, that I loved this one too. It might not be for everyone, there's definitely no unicorns or rainbows in this series, but there is raw emotion that makes you care deeply for these characters and the horrific obstacles they have to overcome.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|I love this season of Gilmore Girls! It is full of drama, boys, and really emphasizes the fact that Rori isn't a kid anymore. All that you would expect and more from Stars Hollow.
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|Four years after the Harry Potter book series concluded, the accompanying film series finishes up as well with this second half of the screen adaptation of the Deathly Hallows novel. The movie series was overall an impressive achievement and has added to the overall experience of the Harry Potter universe. Nevertheless the films seldom reached the consistently high level of execution that the novels did, and comparisons aside, there have been some false steps along the way. Part 2 of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows contains its share of miscues. But overall it entertains and is particularly successful as an action and adventure experience. Its ending satisfies even while leaving fans wishing the story could continue forever. This review is of the content of the theater release of the movie. It does include SPOILERS.    The movie is anchored by several key action sequences. First the infiltration of and escape from the ultra-secure Gringotts Bank, where Harry and his friends hope to find one of the pieces of dark wizard Voldemort's fragmented soul. Then a battle royale at Hogwarts, where former students Harry, Hermione, and Ron join their friends, teachers, and other allies to take on Voldemort's \\"Death Eater\\" minions - and to frantically hunt for and find a way to destroy another Horcrux or two. Finally comes the long-anticipated showdown between the leaders of the respective sides: Voldemort, the most accomplished wizard born in the last century, versus teenaged Harry Potter, who has somehow bested Voldemort on half a dozen prior occasions without ever being able to finish him off. This meeting is of course different than any of their prior encounters, even the one that took place almost 17 years earlier which cost infant Harry's parents their lives. Each side knows that at least one of the two archenemies will not be walking away from this long-prophesied meeting.    In between the action sequences are sprinkled some explanation, a little romance, some attempts at humor that often fall flat, and a little bit of detection. This movie is light on puzzle solving compared to some of the earlier installments. By this time Harry's group has a pretty good idea of where most of the existing Horcruxes are, and it doesn't take long for them to successfully guess where any remaining hidden ones might be. Although the Deathly Hallows - powerful ancient magical adjuncts - provide the story with its name, by the time this final visual chapter of the story opens Harry has realized what his mentor Albus Dumbledore also eventually realized - that to hunt for the Hallows in search of even more power is not the correct path. The Hallows are mainly dangerous and treacherous, and besides that, the goal is not to amass power but to stop Voldemort's murderous ambitions. The Hallows are not the correct tool to use toward achieving that goal. Voldemort himself has provided such a tool by fracturing his soul into multiple parts, the finding and destruction of which (the Horcruxes) will eventually render Voldemort himself mortal.    The romance between Harry's best friends Hermione and Ron has taken forever to get off the ground - largely because of Ron's cluelessness. Somehow he eventually realizes that he likes Hermione, begins to suspect that she might return his interest, and most importantly of all realizes that Harry and Hermione have only a platonic and fraternal friendship and they do not care for each other in that way. Although the long-anticipated kiss between the two cannot possibly live up to expectations, at least it provides resolution. Less successful is the seemingly tacked-on romance between Harry himself and Ron's younger sister Ginny. Where director David Yates and some of his predecessors have really dropped the ball is in failing to develop the Harry-Ginny storyline over the final four movies, in favor of repeatedly hinting at a Harry-Hermione-Ron love triangle and feinting at setting the two best friends up as rivals for Hermione's affections. The result is that it suddenly seems as if Ginny is nothing more than a consolation prize for Harry after he loses out in the Hermione sweepstakes. There is no on-screen spark between Harry and Ginny.    The explanation of events within this film is in somewhat short supply and doesn't always occur at the appropriate time. In particular, when Harry finally defeats Voldemort by commanding the allegiance of the wand that Voldemort is wielding, it is not immediately obvious why the wand would suddenly obligingly leap from the dark wizard's hand and toward Harry. Only in a post-fight explanation does Harry detail the chain of events that had already made Harry the true master of this powerful Elder Wand (one of the Deathly Hallows). There are several other such moments, where devoted readers of the book series can probably fill in what happened or at least should have happened, but where movie-only patrons will be left behind.    On the other hand, viewers who come to the movies mainly from a book perspective may be disconcerted to find that in the film, Harry defeats Voldemort almost in private, rather than in front of all his followers as in the book. That was key, in order to dispel the myth of Voldemort's invincibility. The book's Voldemort died openly, after first having been reduced to his human origins by Harry, who reminded the self-styled Lord Voldemort and his disciples that he is after all only a man once named Tom Riddle. The movie version of these events leaves the witnesses out and also fails to fully demythologize Voldemort. Although Harry does (bizarrely) call Voldemort \\"Tom\\" in almost chummy fashion at one point, he never spells it out to Voldemort and his followers that he's really just Tom Riddle, a dark wizard who split his soul into too many pieces and killed way too many people.    Another example of a false move is Harry casually destroying the Elder Wand after the battle by snapping it in half. But if the Wand had been that easy to destroy, Dumbledore himself would gladly have performed the deed, since he recognized the extreme danger posed by the Wand and was very alarmed at the prospect of either Harry or Voldemort getting his hands on it.    One aspect of the struggle that was not explored thoroughly enough was the recognition of the sacrifices that many of Harry's allies made. Some were injured in the struggle, others were killed - including some who were extremely close to Harry and his friends. The film could have used some formal recognition of these characters and their contributions.    The extended Harry Potter cast has grown steadily over the years. There are a large number of well-respected and famous actors occupying the adult roles, in addition to the important roles filled by the younger performers. There has never been enough screen time to give all the characters and their portrayers their due, and in this final chapter there is even less than usual as the overriding emphasis is and must be on the epic struggle between Harry and Voldemort. Actors such as Emma Thompson and Maggie Smith are barely on screen at all. One performer who does receive more than a cameo appearance is Helena Bonham Carter, still playing Bellatrix Lestrange, Voldemort's most murderously effective - and demented - lieutenant. The choice of the slightly dotty Bonham Carter to portray Bellatrix was probably the most inspired casting of the whole film series, and it again pays dividends here. Ralph Fiennes had his work cut out for him in trying to act, and to be menacing, while wearing a somewhat goofy snake-man mask. He manages to surmount the difficulties of the task and provide Harry with a serious foe.    But the film ultimately relies on the performances of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry, Emma Watson as Hermione, and Rupert Grint as Ron. All three are at least adequate. Grint will not be making the transition to adult film star, but the shortcomings of his character (immaturity and anger) should not be lain at his feet. He succeeds in depicting Ron as well as is reasonable to expect, especially given that he was cast in the role half a lifetime ago. Watson is the film series' breakout star, and she has already achieved success outside the film series, in the world of modeling. Whether she sticks with taking advantage of her striking profile and cheekbones by that route or continues her acting career as well, she seems destined to be a celebrity for a long time.    Daniel Radcliffe, like Grint, will not ever be a conventional adult movie star. He is not tall enough, for one thing. But he was the perfect choice for the role. I can imagine other actors playing Ron and even Hermione. The series lost one excellent actor as Dumbledore and continued with a replacement without a pause. But Daniel Radcliffe took the role of Harry Potter and made it his forever. The story has repeatedly called for Harry to do impulsive, stupid, angry, and unlikeable things (as well as acting heroically and generously at other times of course). Radcliffe's unenviable task was to keep Harry still basically sympathetic throughout even the worst throes of adolescent petulance. He deserves to be lauded for his success in doing so.    The series is over for good, and its like will not soon come along - if ever. The only cure for Potter deprivation is more Potter, and the films, including this one, should have a long lifetime. At some point soon I'll revisit the excellent first movie and then go on from there.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|First off, \\"Blast From the Past\\" has a sterling cast - Christopher Walken plays oddball like no one else, Sissy Spacek is delightful as the \\"Suzy Homemaker\\" of the 1960's, Brendan Fraser is the son I always wanted, and Alicia Silverstone turns in a perfect street-smart-girl-goes-happily-ever-after performance. Then the writing is sharp and witty and just plain funny. The degradation of San Fernando Valley from 1962 to 1997 hits all the low points. This movie should be a permanent part of anyone's home DVD collection - \\"Write That Down!\\"
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I love this game. Very addicting. Heard a lot of good things about this before getting. Only real con is it sometimes pauses a lot during game and slow loading. This is on a Droid X2.
B000FBH3XQ|5.0|I bought this set to use with my Mozart quartet sheet music so I could have fun playing the music with my cello and have a great quartet to play with. I have had the sheet music for a long time but never was able to get together the musicians capable of playing it with. This way I get to play all of it with a quartet that is world class anytime of day or night in the privacy of my basement and my stereo. The one possible problem with the system is that this group really plays fast! Their allegro movements are much faster than my allegro so it is all very challenging.
0764137433|5.0|I recommend this book as a companion for first and second year Russian students. It has great exercises and lists 501 verbs in every form for your reference. If you want to get a good handle on russian verbs, I recommend buying this book and \\"The big silver book of Russian Verbs (555 Fully conjugated verbs)\\". These two, paired together, give you a run for your money and will drill verbs and all their usages into your memory.
0060555661|5.0|I liked this book. I read the editor's commentaries as well and they offered some interesting insights as well. There's definitely good substance here.
B0053F042G|5.0|It has all been said in the numerous reviews posted here. Be careful reading these reviews in advance - there many spoilers without warning. I would advise skipping the reviews before you watch this, but on the off chance anyone actually sees my review I suspect it will be too late for that. I went into this movie with out knowing anything about it. I saw the high ratings & thought - I should watch this. It's suspenseful and original. The first 10 - 15 minutes felt awkward to me, but the film quickly takes you into a comfortable groove. It is a bit like being on a roller coaster. You know that drop is coming again, but it doesn't make it any less thrilling. The writing, acting, editing and direction are all extremely well done, but it is the premise that makes this movie special. I recommend it.
B002VKE0XA|5.0|As a horror flick fan, I like to see things that a) scare me and b) are different than the crowd. PA succeeds on the second aspect but doesn't do a lot on the first one.  There are things that are cool about this movie, although it's debatable whether its the most scariest movie of all times.  Good-  1. In a low budget and simple setup, the director manages to make a good horror flick enough to chill your bones. The effective use of single camera is a worth try and it succeeds too.   2. No use of stupid masks, effects, blood, murders, dead bodies whatsoever. That's a relief. This movie purely relies on your imagination and just the feel that \\"something is gonna happen\\". Wonderful!  3. Excellent use of realistic sounds rather than using unnecessary bangs/howls/screams or unnecessary sudden loud noises to make you jump from the seat.   In short, a nice blend of nearly realistic horror. It's effective in its own ways. However, i thought it was more of hype than the material itself (as another reviewer has stated as his review title).I think the biggest success of the movie lies in its after effects. THIS ONE IS BOUND TO BRING YOU SLEEPLESS NIGHTS. The fact that it has been shot as a home video and in a typical US house, it makes the movie so much true-to-life that you see your own house reflected in it, and thats what will scare you the most.  Bad-  1. Stupid character development. At one point (actually at several points) the guy annoys me. How can one be so stupid and one-directional even when you notice things going in the wrong way all the time? Plus, that idiot remains adamant throughout the movie and drops it exactly when he shouldn't? I couldn't gulp it.  2. How can the \\"helper\\" (trying to avoid the details) simply walk away when he is actually supposed to do something? If he wasn't meant to help, why he is there in the plot at the first place?  Altogether, this movie surely succeeds as a good horror movie because it's different. I guess if you really looking forward to get scared,  watch it without listening to the excessive hype about this flick. Then it will serve the purpose. This may not live up to the expectations that the media publicity may arise.  UPDATE- Recently watched PA2. Now PA1 makes a lot of sense. The story fits and the recent release of PA3 makes the story more believable. Together, PA can serve as a cornerstone for horror flicks.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|I got the product pretty fast.  I only saw a few episodes, due to being overseas.  When the season came in, I was surprised how few episodes there were and the focus on non zombie issues.  I was also surprised to see the lack of zombie interaction with the characters and how the series was more focued on living human interaction.<br /><br />There were times in many of the episodes where it seemed the actors were only on a camping trip, or marooned on a tropical island, rather than living in a world overridden by zombies.  I'm more into the zombie on your tail, constant fighting to survive, destroying hordes of zombies type genre.<br /><br />With that being said, it was awesome to see one of my favorite book genres playing out on a television series.  The zombie scenes and action was as gruesome as expected.  Though the focus is on the actors mainly, and how they deal with the outbreak, I do enjoy seeing how they cope with their situation and keep on surving.  I am going to watch and buy season 2, and I hope it's more action packed than season 1.  I'd love to see episodes showcasing the first few weeks of the zombie outbreak, the government/military trying to contain it, and seeing the society break down to how you see it now in the series.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|I feel like Tron would not have worked without the talent of Daft Punk. The music MADE the movie. The darkness, the programming, the tension and the heart were all found in the score. I love \\"The Game Has Changed\\" and listen to that track frequently. Not all the songs stand on their own two feet, however. While they work in the film, upon listening to them solo, they lose some of their luster. Overall, I found the soundtrack to be worth the purchase.
B003Y5H542|5.0|I am truly surprised by the number of reviews here saying this movie is horrible and not for children etc. If perhaps we didn't inundate our children with the truly simpleminded pablum that is most of the childrens movie market, they would be up for this film. It is beautiful to look at, finely crafted, fun and funny, and is a comic gem for both the young and adults. And it is PG, not G, so maybe (as stated in other reviews) it *will* be boring to a 4 year old. But then again, maybe not. Try exposing your kids to something more than a morass of mindless jump cuts!
0002247402|1.0|I'm glad to see I'm not the only one who is sooo done with these books and hopefully can save someone else the pain (and money) of starting to read Fire and Ice. I travel and reading passes the time on the planes so that is my excuse. I just read Book 5 hoping for some conclusions or directions.  A big book and NOTHING REALLY HAPPENS of consequence other than the usual.  What I got is more characters (at least 4) that Martin writes about in exhausting detail about their life and feelings and their grand plans suddenly dying within half a page. Quite a few are killed off by a \\"note from a raven\\" so it is not even covered, then another is killed just as quickly and then their story ends and that is it and Martin SUCKS!!!<br />DO NOT BOTHER READING THIS BOOK.<br />(Do I sound bitter?)
B0032Y0OH0|2.0|It does work with Corel video studio x4. But I prefer power director. This device works with some very expensive video editing software, but who in their right mind would use a $45.00 device on a $300.00 software. The manufacturer should of understood that in this price range it should work with the consumer rated video editing software. The only reason it woek with Corel is becaus it works with some expensive Ulead software. Corel, Ulead, same company. Nothing specific for Corel and definatly nothing for Cyberlink products.<br /><br />So if you are using Corel you are fine. just tried it on Windows movie maker 2.6. Again a no show. I have an email into the Mfg. about this issue, lets see if they reply and hopefully fix this
0345529057|1.0|DO NOT BOTHER WITH THESE BOOKS!!  You will meet characters and delve into their lives in exhausting detail and then they disappear, either killed off rather quickly or disappear, probably never to come back again.  I love how they picture Sean Bean on the cover and you think he is a major part of the books but he doesn't really do much in the books but he dies early on without accomplishing anything.  And no, this does not deserve a spoiler.  Everyone dies in these books so it is no surprise. I just foundered through Book 5 (someone gave it to me) to see if anything changes and it is so redundant it is painful.  Multiple characters are covered for hundreds of pages from their POV with all their feelings and grand schemes and then you turn the page and they are dead, usually without much of a warning or a struggle.  They usually don't even get to fight for their lives.  WHAT A WASTE OF TIME.  Several characters were killed off without even a description, just a \\"note from a raven\\".  Then their story ends, with no further resolution.  I will say it again.  DO NOT BOTHER WITH THESE BOOKS!!
1926778103|3.0|this book wasn't as amazing as it could have been. for starters, there is hardly any character artwork. most of the character pictures are early sketches/renders. War has the most pages dedicated to him (of course), but a lot of it is what he looked like before now (in early stages of production) and not his finalized appearance, along with different armour. other characters (like Watcher and Vulgrim) have hardly anything dedicated to them (with the afore mentioned only having ONE page each with 2-3 pictures and small CG renders plopped on a page with a buncha others), and most of them are just B&W sketches. i was expecting a lot of Joe Mad colour artwork of the characters, what i got was disappointment. there is a lot of very nice colour pictures of War and Ruin, but that's about it. there so many interesting characters in Darksiders, its a shame most of them got the shaft in this book.    the bulk of this book is even worse, its just environmental artwork. basically pictures of backgrounds, objects, areas, etc., along with logos, item icons, etc., nothing that is too exciting to look at in large quantities, nor anything i would want an art book just for.    the quality of the book itself is shabby, as well. from just normally looking through it, the spine becomes unglued and pages start to fall out. i even returned the book and got another, and it still did the same thing. i am very gentle with my stuff, so it certainly wasn't from rough-handling. i am not sure how the Hardcover version fairs as i have the Softcover.    i would really love to see another Darksiders art book released, but dedicated to only the characters, with lots of new artwork done especially for the book. now THAT would be a book worthy! here's hoping the Darksiders 2 art book takes a lesson from this one and turns out to be MUCH better! (hopfully, if there is one).    in the end, its still a nice addition to one's Darksiders collection, even though the book could have been MUCH better (in bothcontent and quality) and its only worth looking through once.

The fur is separating from the ear, there is glue on both the eyes, there are random strings coming from the neck and head, it doesn't dance or even move for that matter.  It only sings.  I tried changing the batteries, in hopes that was the problem, but not the case.  I am going to try to order another one and return this one in hopes that we get one that works.

B003R4ZGJ6|4.0|\\"City of Ashes\\" is a read so action packed I think I'm still trying to sort through all of the details. Very entertaining with the introduction of a few new characters and some extra Downworlder action which was awesome.<br /><br />  City of Ashes picks up with Jace and Clary, now aware that they are siblings, trying to thwart their father, Valentine, in his efforts to steal a second Mortal Instrument, a sword. Clary is thrust into the Shadowhunter's world and she has to learn quickly that vampires, werewolves, faeries, and daemons all exists.<br /><br />  The wonderful thing about this book is that something is always happening.  This is definitely not one of those books that weighs you down with monotonous everyday routine. However, sometimes Cassandra Clare rushed through some pretty interesting events that could have been expounded on. I would have enjoyed more detail with the werewolf, vampire, and faerie characters.<br /><br />  There are so many characters that the story effortlessly bounces between that I really got to know all of the characters well. Everything fit together seamlessly and I thought the point of narration she chose for this book was perfect. Simon really steps out into Clary's life and leaves behind the annoying, immature boy that was constantly begging for her attention.<br /><br />  My largest problem with this novel is the disgusting romantic involvement between Clary and Jace. Ew! I can't even allow myself to feel the romance because I am so disturbed by their lack of repulsion at the thought of dating their sibling. I can only assume that sometime in the series we will discover that Jace is not indeed related to Clary (foreshadowing is heavy enough) and I truly expected Cassandra Clare to give me that in this novel so that I could enjoy the romance. I am repulsed that Cassandra's mind could even go to that place.<br /><br />  The book had a great ending that was a cliff hanger and I can't wait to read the next book in this series. Cassandra has created such an intricate world that is simply magical and amazing! Unfortunately, something tells me she has really shot herself in the foot with the whole brother/sister romance bit.<br /><br />  Knowing that Cassandra Clare previously wrote \\"Harry Potter\\" fan fiction made me really appreciate the bit she interjected into the Epilogue, I thought it was very tongue-in-cheek and loved it. I think this is a wonderful and creative fictional world to be able to escape to.dra has created such an intricate world that is simply magical and amazing!

So far my favorite recipe is Basic Chocoalte Cupcakes with Peanut Buttercream frosting...I dream about these cupcakes. Everyone asks me to make them for parties, and none of them are Vegans. People cannot believe they are vegan! I have made others in the book with great results and I plan on trying them all. Buy this book, you won't regret it!!!
B003EEMIV8|5.0|This is a very well made toy. Its pretty perfect for my 2 and half year old. He loves to dump the cans in back over and over. Very durable also. Great toy. Between this and the \\"Garbage Truck\\" app on the iphone my son is entertained for hours!

This WAS MY FIRST eREADER AND I LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It has LONG BATTERY LIFE UP TO 1 MONTH ON A SINGLE CHARGE AND IT IS THE LIGHTEST eREADER ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I HIGHLY RECOMMEND LOOK NO FURTHER FOR YOUR eREADER!!!
B004DMIIVO|5.0|This film not just has an amazing plot but wonderful graphics as well... If you have a blue ray player, i would definitely recommend buying it in BR. I love all anime movies and this one has to be one of my top favorites. It has action, romance, sorrow, and etc. It's everything you would ever want in a anime film.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|If you have already enjoyed \\"Band of Brothers\\" which was focused on the European theater around the time of D-Day through VE Day, then you will surely like this story of the other side of the world during WWII.<br /><br />The environments and conditions could hardly be more different. The enemy and the terrain was a just as brutal but so dissimilar. In this series, you get to see the conclusion of the largest war ever fought, told from an insider's perspective.<br /><br />This is a must-see documentary.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I don't really do reviews, but I just wanted to say that this book was way better than I had expected it to be. I read some reviews before downloading it and since it was also under five dollars I gave it a go. I finished reading it in two days, wanted to finished reading it in one sitting but work has called. This is one book that you never expected what would happen next and the characters were very real in my head. I gave it five stars for a awesome story and never wanting to put it down. I fell in love with this and I agree with all the other reviews that this is a MUST read for any kindle loving person.
B00006CXSS|5.0|So many reviews have already been written. All I can say is, if you haven't seen this mini-series, put it on your top priority list.
0684857219|5.0|This book gives you everything you would ever need to know about what moves work to what body part.  Thank you Arnold you are still inspiring people today and I thank you.
1439102724|5.0|I first read My Sister's Keeper by Jodi Picoult and have continued on to read all of her books. I really enjoyed reading this book. She always takes on controversial subjects and allows you to see both sides of the story. I did read some of the views that were against her using stereotypes. I guess I did not think she overdid it though. Religion is constantly brought up in the arguments against gay marriage so I do not think there was anything wrong about her taking both drastic sides into the story. I look forward to reading her next novel!
B0000C3I6U|5.0|This was ground breaking and a great Movie to watch.  It is the first an only of it's kind to really show body building for what it is.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I'm seventy four years old and, as the title says, I just discovered P. G. Wodehouse (in a rare moment of truth-telling I'll admit I've been devouring everything \\"FREE\\" since I got a Kindle several months ago). Anyway, I fell in love with \\"Dear Old Bertie\\" and his \\"Man Jeeves\\" right away.     Then, when I saw the DVDs on Amazon and discovered the series, this too for the first time ( I honestly don't know where I've been!), I ordered it immediately. Well, as has been said repeatedly in past reviews Hugh Laurie is the perfect Bertie and Stephen Fry is wonderful as Jeeves. About the only minor niggling I can think of is that Fry doesn't quite have the ability to \\"glide\\" into the room like Wodehouse's Jeeves but that, however, is such a tiny critisizm I retract it immediately. Well, I would retract it if I hadn't typed it out already.    By the way, I watch these disks on a 60\\" HD TV through an excellent Oppo upconverting DVD player and, while the video quality does vary somewhat, from episode to episode they are all very watchable, fine in fact.
0670022411|5.0|Finally!  A vampire/romance novel for the 30-40 somethings! This book had tons of science, history, family bonding, romance and a touch of smut to keep us \\"twi-moms\\" happy.  It's a great novel with an amazing story and I look forward to the next book in the trilogy.
031603441X|1.0|I can't believe I wasted my money on this crap. It's exactly what you might expect; the words of a junkie. This book is so all over the place I had no idea what he was talking about half the time. Unless you are a die hard Stones fan and know everything there is to know about the band, don't wast your time on reading about this pathetic sod's life.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Somehow Floyd was buried in the 80's and 90's by new wave, punk, grunge and heavy metal and I completely missed this show. The Pulse concert is special in many ways. The music is played so perfectly that I enjoy listening to Pulse versions of the songs over the original recordings which is no small feat considering in 2011 most singers/rappers/bands can't approach this level of perfection at live shows even when they rely on prerecorded music/voice tracks/auto tone.  The concert is visually stunning, standing up even today which again is no small feat considering they used 90's era state of the art lasers and lighting. Gilmour is in peak form, understated while at the same time filling the concert with meaty space riffs and fantastic bended notes full of distortion proving he is one is the top 5 rock guitarist of all time making it speak in ways few others can.. The rest of the Waters' less Floyd and supporting players are wonderful. Overlooking a few of the 90's period videos and wishing they shot it on film instead of video, the sound is perfect and shines on a good surround sound system and sub. Turn up the sound, turn down the lights and enjoy this rare gem of a show.
B004Y1USV2|1.0|I don't understand, how serious Yes fans can consider this 'Fly From Here' to be a REAL YES ALBUM.<br /><br />Step back to the real world, dudes: This is nothing else than an album that could be better titled as \\"DRAMA, Vol 2\\"...<br />... But this time, the performing band name is MAYBE.<br /><br />... Hey, but... What can you REALLY expect when there's no more Jon Anderson and Rick (or even his so-talented son Adam) Wakeman, back in the full gang???<br />In addition, Trevor Horn has 'Buggles-ed' the music once again...<br /><br />This 'Fly From Here', definitely, only has the cover art (another excellent work of the maestro Roger Dean) of a Yes album... The music, really performed by the band MAYBE... And ZERO stars.
0060760273|5.0|Loved the board book and the bunny is my daughter's favorite new lovey. She hangs on to that bunny and falls alseep with it. She's only 4 months old, so I can't wait for her to understand that's the same bunny in her book.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|stay with free version. pro has very limited capability. Can not skip forward/backward the recorded audio. Audio can be listen to through Tunein app only. propritary format that can not be played with mp3 players and can't be moved to laptop either to listen to. Slow &amp; Lousy tech support too.
B004EPYZUI|4.0|If you like a lot of action and hot girls kicking ass this is a pretty good movie. If you like to pull apart movies and find underlying meaning, also a good movie. The only argument I would have would be that the movie wasn't put together in the most meaningful manner. Other than that it was quite entertaining, and had a good soundtrack.
B000O8OTNC|2.0|I can do better with traditional sharpening stones.  Of course a good edge is only found on a good knife.
B003Y5H542|3.0|This was only an OK movie. I was expecting it to be fairly entertaining, and it's not that it wasn't, it was just a tad bland at the same time. Also, if you are sensitive to some adult language this is not a movie to show your kids.. personally, i didn't find it offensive but, could see how.
B000051VWW|5.0|I've been a heavy metal guy for years. Recently I've been listening to chill music like 311, Sylvan, Mogwai, Explosions in the Sky, and now Sade. She is so talented and chill. I just started studying for a test and put this cd on. Didn't skip a single track. Usually music takes a while to grow on me. Not this cd! Peace

0896898288|1.0|If you're interested in this book for the history, you're likely to be disappointed by the historical inaccuracies. The letters are reportedly from 1922 but instead of using reproduction fabrics of the era, the author used Civil War reproduction fabrics for the blocks that illustrate the book. The quilt block patterns weren't necessarily available in the early 1920s either. For example, the Century of Progress block used in this book wasn't published until 1933 - more than a decade after the letters were written. Instead of this book, consider something by Barbara Brackman - a noted quilt historian. Ms. Brackman is very likely to have her facts straight!    If, like me, you thought this book would be a good way to learn about using traditional piecing techniques, save your money. The book offers no tips or instructions for using the templates and diagrams. (If you order the Kindle edition, you won't even GET the templates!) There's a Yahoo! mailing list but heaven help the quilter who asks THAT group for help. In the few weeks I've been a member, I've seen responses ranging from \\"Take a class!\\" to \\"Buy the companion software if you want instructions.\\" I'm no longer a beginner and wasn't looking for a beginning-level project but a few pages of general instructions about the author's chosen construction technique or suggestions for organizing the 106 templates required would have been useful. The back cover says \\"everything you need\\" so I expected the book to be reasonably complete.       I've made over 100 blocks from Sylvia's Bridal Sampler by Jennifer Chiaverini. In my experience, it's a much better project for learning about traditional techniques. Chiaverini includes instructions to make blocks using several different methods: rotary cutting, templates, paper-piecing, and applique. Blocks range from the simple 9-patch to the complicated Mrs. Cleveland's Choice with 65 pieces. I've learned a lot from working on that project and have enjoyed the Yahoo! mailing listcommunity that focuses on Chiaverini's books and patterns.      I think I'll donate my Farmer's Wife Sampler to a library. The historical inaccuracies, coupled with the shortcomings of the templates and piecing diagrams, have led me to conclude it's not worth the space it takes on my bookshelf. I will not look at any future publications by this author.
B000L3CHC0|3.0|The watch arrived on time and as described. Great service from Amazon. The watch looks nice, great details, classic crown size and it precisely gives the time. My only complain is that the wrist band and the crown are VERY VERY VERY shiny. It is a matter of taste. I personally don't like shiny watches and I was not able to tell how shiny it was from the pictures. Now that I have it and that I can see how shiny it is I would rather go for a Victorinox Chrono. Hope this helps.

0545259088|5.0|In the final installment of the Wolves of Mercy Falls trilogy, Grace is still a wolf after being turned in the previous book. After many tough complications and unfortunate circumstances, she manages to find her way back to Sam, the love of her life. Meanwhile, Isabel is still furious at Cole for refusing to sleep with her. The characters are stronger than ever before in Forever and it is an action-packed book, bound to have you on the edge of your seat in anticipation and fear.    With Isabel's father planning to murder all of the wolves in Mercy Falls, Cole takes it upon himself to experiment in order to find cures. He wants to be able to turn Grace back into a human, as well as force humans to transform into wolves. Their plan depend on him and they're all doomed if his vials of chemicals don't work. As always, Maggie drives us completely insane with worry. She loves to make us yell, \\"Oh no, (insert name)'s going to die!!\\" and she certainly does not hold back in this book. My heart stopped a few times whilst reading this and I'm sure you'll be shocked at the ending. You've never seen twists like this. Heart attack rates went up this month.    I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Forever is my favourite novel out of the three and contains everything that you enjoyed in the first two plus a little more. While the ending was left quite open for readers to come to their own conclusions, I felt that it was suitable for this series, which is based on chance, possibility and fate. A line or two on the final page still leaves me scratching my head but I'm sure I'll come to a logical explanation soon. I really will miss this series because Sam and Grace are one of the sweetest couples in YA fiction. This series isn't all about smiles and light-heartedness, but it sure does have the ability to make you clutch your heart in both happiness and in sadness.
0307887960|1.0|Oh my goodness.  I hope people don't waste their money on this book.  This is just another gimmiky diet, like all the others I have tried over the years.  This book was a waste of my time and I have learned my lesson.  The mystery of losing weight is as old as Adam and Eve.  Calories in/Calories out.  I don't care what diet you're on, it all comes down to calories (unfortunately).  I finally woke up to this fact after Atkins, Weight Watchers and Nutrisystem (which worked for me by the way because the calories are limited and the meals are filling).  So don't waste your money on this book.  I'm not even giving mine away, I'm trashing it. If you want to be really slim, you have to record your caloric intake and stick to it.  If you fail one day, get right back on.  The first 3 digits of your daily caloric intake determines what you will end up weighing.  1,200 calories a day will get you to 120 lbs.  1,000 calories a day, 100 lbs, 2,000 calories a day, will have you weighing 200 lbs.  No big secret here.  Again, calories in/calories out if you really want to be successful.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|When I was searching for an ideal survival knife I discovered the Bk2.  It was bigger, heavier and thicker than I was looking for but it looked like a bullet proof and indestructible beast.  I showed my wife pictures of the knife and she decided that she had to have it.  Of course she was excited to have it, but she doesn't really use it much.  I love the knife and use it as sturdy camp tool (not hiking).  I get a kick out of showing friends and family my wife's little knife.  The response is priceless.  This knife comes adequately sharp, batons through timber with ease and I wouldn't be afraid to pry with it if the occasion presented itself.  It's a heavy knife and not something I'm interested in carrying on hikes but it would be a functional work horse around the house and yard.  The knife locks into the sheath solid and takes some force to remove.    All that said, it is not my ideal knife but I love it.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|I wasn't going to see this or any other Woody Allen movie, but friends whose opinion I respect told me it was wonderful. I left Woody Allen behind when he took off with Soon-Yi, but since they have been married for 15 years, I have decided to get over it. I also am not fond of Owen Wilson, but then again it was the more the silly roles he has played that I didn't like.. I loved this film. It is beautiful, it is so obvious that Allen loves this city, he caressed it as he filmed it. You felt every plane and every curve. The cinematography was incredible.  I wanted more and I will probably never see Paris but I can be a voyeur and watch this film again and again, to get my Paris fix.  Those who gave this film one or two stars, please your name must be Paul, as in the pedantic fool in the film, brilliantly played by Michael Sheen. I loved hating him especially when he was wrong which was most of the time.  The back in time characters were so much fun. I came home deciding to reread Hemingway and Fitzgerald. Oh, if you like costumes, they were wonderful, I love twenties era fashion.   We have a small theatre in our town, $5 bucks and you can get can get popcorn and a soda for less than $5, so i think if it is still there next week and I think it will be considering the crowd on a Monday night, I will go back to see it again. This movie is pure entertainment, it is a joy.

B005DD7H50|3.0|The cinematography for Limitless is great, but the story ultimately doesn't hold up its end of the bargain. Still, the acting is generally good and the storyline (although kind of dumb on reflection) kept my attention through to the end. It's a B movie, maybe a B+, but it's not a complete waste of time.
0307474712|4.0|ok so i definitely liked this book. I've read many reviews that have been bashing dex because he is an \\"unlikable character\\".  I personally liked dex.  In my opinion he was a very real portait of what some people are like during their 20's and maybe even early 30's.  Not everyone has the realization that their behavior is detrimental to both their own personal development and their relationships with the people around early. Dex got wrapped up in the life of a media personality which happens very often.  I don't think he was a bad person, I think he just made some very bad choices but it's obvious that he still had a good heart under there somewhere.  As for Em, i loved her! She was so witty and honest about how she felt (at least to herself anyways).     There were parts of the book that definitely stood out to me that I must talk about briefly.  Dex's mothers death/illness was so extremely sad for many different reasons.  First, because of the obvious, a parent/spouse is slowly and painfully dying which is hard on anyone.  Second, because Dex  was not going through the process well at all.  He used alcohol and drugs to take himself away from the situation which made him spiral downward even more.  I honestly felt awful for him.  And then his desperate phone calls to Em when he's on the edge of breaking down.  It made me so sad for him.    Another part is Dex on that tv show with Suki Meadows.  I felt bad for him there too because it was like the people/media were turning against him (which is so real to life because its like the media build people up to tear them down shortly after).  He definitely made it worse by getting drunk but that was in an attempt to calm his nerves.  It was like a car crash happening in slow motion.  You wanna tell him to stop drinking before its too late but theres no way. And how he wishes Em was there so he could feel comfortable enough to go through the show.  You can tell how much he loves her even though they were still not together.    The chapter where they \\"break up\\" was gut wrenching.  He was being so unbelievable brash the whole time.  When Em finally got up and left I was glad because she didnt deserve that and he took her for granted.           The chapter where they are at the wedding was a great chapter as well.  While they were talking in the maze you can tell they still had feelings for each other but then Dex dropped the bomb or bombs (that he was having a baby and getting married).  at that point my heart dropped for Em cause I can imagine how hard that must be for Em to hear even though she put on a brave face.  However the whole time i knew that it wouldnt work out for them because Sylvie was changing him almost to the point that he was no longer really himself anymore.    Now I cannot review the book without talking about the end.  I was so unbelievably upset that Em died just when things were looking up for them both.  it was so sudden and out of nowhere (yes i know that that's how life is sometimes but it wasnt the desired ending).      For these reasons im giving this book 4 stars out of 5.  I loved the book but the ending was so gut wrenching and i almost felt like i was manipulated throughout the book.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|This series started out great, then the second book was ok, the third and fourth were pretty bad. This one is middling good. It started out as if it were on fire, then the end totally bit. Once again, characters who are good and honorable and likeable - end up dead. What is Martin's problem? Is he clinically depressed? People have called him the American Tolkien - hah. No way. He doesn't have half the talent. It seems as if he's making this up as he goes along. Everytime he seems to have written himself into a corner, he pulls some rabbit out of his hat and goes off in another silly direction. I may not even read the rest of the series until it's in the Kindle bargain bin. I'm really tired of the endless ways he finds to just drag things out. It snows, so everyone stops. We sail from here to there. Even Tyrion is starting to be a boring character. Unlike the Lord of the Rings, which this can't even hold a remote candle to, I get no sense of history from this. He throws a bunch of names about, events about, how about a LOTR like timeline in the back of the book, rather than those endlessly dull repeats of the houses. Does anyone really not know who Robert Strong is? I'm surprised he even killed of Tywin Lannister, since he seems to hold such love for the evil characters. Now what he does at the wall, and leave us hanging... well, I'm fed up with this crap. It took him six years to write this? I think he has a dart board in his office and he hits it and says \\"Ok, that'll happen.\\" This started with such promise, and it's going down hill so fast. The sad thing is for at least half the book, it was far better than 3 and 4, the ended just like them. Also, little tidbits like Brienne showing up for two paragraphs, are not fulfilling. Now we have to wait? Where's Bran's little brother? I'm rapidly not giving a damn. I wish Daneyrs would show up with all three dragons and lay waste to all of Westeros so this whole endlessly, needing some serious editing, series would come to an end. Color me unhappy.an end. Color me unhappy.
