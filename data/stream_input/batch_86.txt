B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural is a compliment to the Pearl Jam catalog.  This record is for people who simply enjoy Pearl Jam making good music.  It would be fun to hear a Pearl Jam/Daniel Lanois collaboration in the future.  Their are many  avenues for this band still to explore.
B00000ILDE|5.0|Aliens is NOT a rehash of Alien. They are completely different films. While Alien used suspence and shock factor to get the audience (I didn't drink milk for weeks after seeing it!), Aliens is an action-packed powerhouse. Heart-pounding, edge-of-your-seat cinema at it's finest. My hat is off to James Cameron for directing and re-writing the script.<br />Quick rundown of the plot of Aliens:<br />Flight Lt. Ripley (Sigorney Weaver) wakes up after an unusually long hyper-sleep to find out that the horror she left behind in &quot;Alien&quot; has taken on massive proportions.<br />You'll see a bunch of familar faces in Aliens:<br /><br />Michael Biehn (Terminator, The Abyss) as Hicks<br /> Paul Reiser (Mad About You, Diner) as Burke<br /> Lance Henrikson (Millennium, The Quick and the Dead) as Bishop<br /> Bill Paxton (Twister, Titanic) as Hudson<br /> ...and a few others that will make you do a double-take. -See if you can figure out what other movie &quot;Private Vasquez&quot; was in with Bill Paxton.<br />The visual effects are astounding. Thanks to DVD, details can be seen that were blurred in the VHS format. (I can finally read what is written on Ferro's helmet!) This film takes clear advantage of the DVD format and its THX re-mastering. I feel sorry for you if you don't have a large screen and full surround-sound at home for this one! Watching it in wide-screen format reveals all of the detail that has been missing for so long in the pan-and-scan format.<br />The Special Edition goodies include scenes that were cut from the theaters. The &quot;new&quot; footage (previously only available in LaserDisc format) blend seamlessly into the film. They all add value. I kept thinking &quot;I don't remember that&quot; and &quot;HEY! NOW I get it!&quot; If you've never seen the 17 minutes of added footage, you're in for a treat!<br />You'll also find Behind the Scenes footage and a photo gallery in the Special Edition. All perks that make this purchase worth while. Even the main menu on the DVD is a treat.<br />Do yourself a favor, buy this action classic and watch it the way it was intended to be seen!on the DVD is a treat.<br />Do yourself a favor, buy this action classic and watch it the way it was intended to be seen!
B000002TQV|5.0|&quot;The Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot; have always been two of my favorite albums, mainly because Radiohead can mix sometimes depressing but always clever lyrics, guitar-filled pop music, and ounces of mellow  folk into an album with a combined intelligence that can only be them. (My  other favorite artists-David Bowie, Frank Black, Beck-are similar, but  Radiohead's got their own thing going on). The songs on here are sad, grim,  somewhat bitter, and dreamy, which is the great thing about it. I always  lapse into a deep ponder and float away while listening to &quot;The  Bends&quot; and &quot;OK Computer&quot;. If it wasn't for the neverending  thinking of Radiohead, I might have never have gotten into alternative  music in the first place. So sit back, turn the creative parts of your mind  on, and sit under the stars with &quot;The Bends&quot;. And, while I'm at  it, do the same with albums by David Bowie, Frank Black, Beck, They Might  Be Giants, Brian Eno, and other great visionaries of the alternative music.  That's the whole basis of prog music to me.
0449002632|4.0|I didn't know Edward Rutherfurd before buying LONDON. I was attracted by the subject - a city, heroine of a novel - and by the desire to learn something without being bored by another historical book I would surely  abandon in my library after the first 50 pages.<br />And I've certainly  learned something. Now I have a notion a little bit more accurate of what  is hidden behind such great names as TUDORS, STUARTS or PLANTAGENETS. It  has been such an interesting experience that I've already bought RUSSKA  !<br />Of course, it's not literature at its best, one often feels that the  little stories invented by Rutherfurd are no more than a - good - pretext  to present to the reader an historical fact and that they could have been  more profound.<br />In short, I don't regret the numerous hours dedicated to  LONDON.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer is still one of my favorite albums because of its entire essence. The music is progressive, abstract, and filled with feeling and artistic depth. Radiohead's guitars are excellent, at times sounding like  Pink Floyd, and at other times becoming the products of their own passions  and visions. &quot;Airbag&quot; starts it out with Yorke telling of a  near-death experience of his and how his life was majestically changed. The  guitar solo here is wonderfully appealing. &quot;Paranoid Android&quot;  continues his loathing into schizophrenia with his views of how he would  get revenge if he was king for once and the lying government was down on  their knees. Great acoustic guitar here. &quot;Subterranean Homesick  Alien&quot;, one of the more supernatural numbers, has Thom looking down on  how humankind is so sane and not willing to believe that something great  could be possible, as he is abducted by spiritual beings, who show him the  stars and the meaning of life...although his friends don't believe him.  Beautiful Floydesque music on this one. &quot;Exit Music&quot;, a great  mellow song about the horrific ordeal of Romeo &amp; Juliet, will seep into  your brain and get you depressed. It also includes a nice mix of acoustic  guitar and gregorian chant like background music. &quot;Let Down&quot;  reflects upon different types of transportation which seems to captivate  Yorke in the most unusual way, while the music is wonderfully spaced-out.  &quot;Karma Police&quot; is a great piano-based ballad about a good person  named Karma getting revenge on the people that treated her bad. (In a  non-violent way.) &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; is both strange and strangely  captivating, with a ranting computer voice that reflects Thom's  complaining. &quot;Electioneering&quot; is another conspiracy-oriented  number, with Thom rambling about the corrupt working of politics over hard  guitar music. &quot;Climbing Up The Walls&quot; is on the scary side,  sinking deep into his paranoia/schizophrenia, worrying about monsters in  the closet. &quot;No Surprises&quot; is most likely the most beautiful of  their collection, a great remorse &amp; regret ballad. &quot;Lucky&quot; is  a grim look at the demise of civilization, while the last number, &quot;The  Tourist&quot;, urges people to slow down and try to live. The music of it  is progressive soft-rock at its best. All in all, you end up with a highly  artistic, highly prog rock based album. Excellent. It's even better than  &quot;The Bends&quot;.
B000002U82|5.0|I just got into Pink Floyd a few weeks ago, after purchasing this album, and already it's one of my favorite albums of any band ever.<br />I'd already heard a lot of stuff by The Alan Parsons Project, which is similar, but  Pink Floyd is spacier and trippier. It's at once both more amorphous and  floating, and more tight and graceful. Not to say I don't still like the  Alan Parsons Project. =)<br />This album is great... I wish it had a longer  play time, but it's a flawless masterpiece as it is... the album flows  together really well, and has a really pronounced beginning and end.  Everyone should buy it.
B0000000LI|5.0|I love this music! I have never seen this guy in concert but if I could it would be a dream come true.  And, please, don't compare Yanni to Kenny G.  Kenny G is boring and repitative, while Yanni's music has lots of variety  and real changes in pace between songs.  Yanni also uses more instruments  and explores a greater range of styles and moods in his music. This CD is  worth every penny.
B00003CWL5|5.0|I have waited for the video version of this film for quite a while, and I'm not disappointed. This is one of the best dark comedies I have ever seen. The  quirkiness in the film is both hilarious and unsettling at the  same time. I love Kevin Spacey in this film -- he deserved every bit of  that Oscar. His protayal of the sexually frustrated, unhappily married  Lester was precise. Annette Benning was also great, one of her best  performances. The supporting cast members were incredible, especially Thora  Birch. Indeed, a great film. But I have one objection: where is the DVD  version of this film?
B00002Z88D|5.0|Hey Metallica Maniacs, Go out and buy this CD (I think you did already)! This CD features some of the best Metallica tracks ever. But this isn't just an ordinary best of CD, the difference is that on this release  Metallica plays together with the SanFrancisco Symphony Orcestra. A real  masterpiece (like every Metallica CD). All I have to say is, that this  double CD is worth it's price.
B000001ESN|5.0|This album marked the transition between old Rush (Hemispheres, long songs, sci-fi lyrics) and new Rush (Moving Pictures, shorter songs, more mainstream lyrics). In turn, it ends up having the best of both worlds. For  example, the great opening combo of Spirit of The Radio and Freewill gave a  taste of what was to come on Moving Pictures with Tom Sawyer, Limelight,  etc. And Natural Science was a sort of mini-epic comparable to (and  actually better than) Hemispheres. Those three songs are absoulte classics,  but Jacob's Ladder is nearly as good, and Different Strings and Entre Nous  are about as close as Rush ever got to a ballad, and they are both adequate  songs. Geddy arguably turns in his best performance ever on bass here (with  the possible exception of MP), and, the lyrics are, of course, excellent  (especially Natural Science with it's usage of tide pools as a metahpor for  the human race in a sort of future Utopia). Overall, just an excellent  album.
B00003CX6P|1.0|I couldnt find words to express how disgusting I feel about that movie, very boring long, unconvient... you realy dont believe any of what happening, the actors were so bad, I dont know how to explain the suffer i  feel while watching it.
B000001ESF|5.0|Rush's last album before 2112 was Caress of Steel. And while it is generally looked back upon as one of their worst albums, it paved the way for 2112 with it's 2 multi-part suites. Needless to say 2112 improves upon  it to the point of near perfection. It's one of the best &quot;long  songs&quot; of all-time. In fact, I'd say that if it wasn't for Pink  Floyd's Shine On You Crazy Diamond it would be the clear-cut winner.  However, although the album is worth the price for that song alone, there  are two other good tracks. A Passage To Bangkok is a great song, with some  good guitar work. Also, the closer Something For Nothing is one of Rush's  classic tracks. If the songs in between the first two and the last one  (Tears, Lessons, The Twilight Zone) were as good as them, then this would  probably be the best album of all-time.
6305416249|5.0|THis is a great video for new parents. I myself have the whole set of videos from SafetyTech. I have used this videos not only for personal use but also for teaching new parents about home safety. They are VERY thorough.  The only drawback is it's long...
B0000025C0|5.0|OK.  Raise your hand if you bought this on 8-track when it first came out.  Remember how the music faded out near the beginning of \\"It's Easy\\".....  (click,clunk) ....and then faded back in on channel two!  <br />I imagine  everyone who's wincing from this brutal (and totally uncalled for) lurch  back to August, 1978 already has this on CD.  <br />So for anyone who's wading  into Boston for the first time, let me say:  there are no bad songs on this  album!  It's short (a mere 33:42).  It's famous for Tom Scholz declaring  that he released it before he was finished (under pressure from Epic  Records).  But there's nothing lacking about the tunes, the playing or  production.  It's pure Boston and every bit as great as the first album!
0887308589|5.0|This book is an outrageously funny look at corporate life. If you work or have worked in an office, this book is for you.  At some point or another, every corporate employee has worked with one or more of the characters from  Dilbert. Scott Adams pokes gently fun and along with multiple cartoons to  illustrate his points, he make the reader laugh and say &quot;I've been  there&quot;. This is a funny book. I didn't expect Mr. Adams to be able to  pull it off. I thought the cartoons were great but that he would not be  able to transfer his skill to bookwriting. I am delighted to say I was  wrong. This is a delight to read and re-read. Thank you for making me  laugh.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD rocks! Anyone who hasn't already, I strongly recommend you buy it. Its better than BOMT. Not as bubble-gum<br />Oops! I Did It Again-Great song. The music video 'as some funky dance moves :D<br />Stronger-FeElIn' THE  R&amp;B FEEL OF THIS SONG! I hope Britney makes it into a single!<br />Don't  Go Knockin' On My Door-The 'tude in this song rocks! Reminds me of  Pink.<br />(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction-A halfway point from OK and GREAT! I  love how it goes from slow then to fast.<br />Don't Let Me Be The Last To  Know-Slow song. I'm pretty sure Britney will probably make it into her next  single<br />What U See(Is What U Get)-Hm, OK song. I like the chorus a lot.  <br />Lucky-Great song. It shows that fame does not always bring  happiness.<br />One Kiss From You-Funky song. . .Not much to say. <br />Where Are  You Now-Mushy, mushy, mushy. LOL JK. But it is a little  cheeeeeeeeezy.<br />Can't Make You Love Me-OK song. The title kind of makes  you think its another lengthy love ballad but its a wonderful song with a  dance beat.<br />When Your Eyes Say It-&lt;Claps&gt; Another great song penned  by Dianne Warren herself who has written songs for many other accomplished  artists.<br />Dear Diary-Written by Britney herself. Hm, I'm impressed! =) ITs  a song that can apply to anyone.
0812931017|2.0|I liked this book.  It was fun and breezy. But for all of Branson's highjinks, and the laughter these hijinks entail, I felt there was still something missing.  A soul, perhaps?  <br />This book is almost all  positive--about Branson's life, choices, business acumen, etc.  While I  don't doubt that he's achieved incredible success, I also have to say that  his book reads like the biography of a superficial person. There's no depth  and no soul.  Understand that depth and soul aren't defined only by  tragedy--they can find their high points in many occasions--like the birth  of a child or a momentous epiphany about the true nature of one's situation  in life.  I had lot of chuckles throughout the reading of this book--but I  experienced no moving moments.<br />I grew up in an affluent neighbourhood.   However, my own family was relatively poor.  Occasionally, I would try to  engage my well-off neighbours in philosophical discussions about the world.   They couldn't respond in kind because it was clear that their map of the  world was fairly limited--limited to their own experiences. I don't blame  them or resent them for it--they simply didn't possess the tools (or at  least it seemed so) to question their purpose in life. I had the same  feeling reading this book.  It seemed a bit self-serving and  purposeless.<br />Let's face it--Richard Branson is rich and he possesses  great business acumen. No doubt.  But he's certainly not deep.
B000001FN3|4.0|I will not review every song and I will not critique the musical value of these songs, but I will say this..........If you happen to be one of the few who appreciates APP and EAP, you must listen to this.  This is better  than the Pink Floyd/Wizard of Oz thing.  This album has so much feeling  that it takes you to another place, if only for awhile.  It will make you  appreciate EAP, even if you think he is the most drunken Opium obsessed  poet/writer in history.  It does not ROCK, it will NOT make you GROOVE, it  just needs to be something to experience, just to say you did it.
1573226521|4.0|Garland's Beach is good and sometimes astonishing story of people escaping from their usual life trying to find a paradise, which, under the inner human factor abruptly fails to be so. Is a good book for every traveler,  who think he is smart and special traveling 20.000 miles from their home  and in particular moment recognises that he is just non-special bunch of  hundrets with same special self-recognicion. But to participate in a real  adventure? Book is more then that, it is a precise description of moral  standards of a society gathered from the whole world, dealing with normal  situtation in non-normal enviorment. Garland's work is special of  describing a society, with modern-breed moral standards, but easily  forgoten and declined without any superior social agreement. In this part  it's needed for every law student to understand practiacal issues of lowest  social agreement. Beach become at the end very dull and sometimes  pointless, but still very strong in shocking the paradise environment. At  the end narrative was very flat in the same lower level, slightly boring  and nonsensly dull, and without it this book would be really good.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops, I did it again is a great album, Britney has done it again.  These songs are great just like her. Once you get this cd you will never want to stop listening to it.  Great Job Britney, keep it up!  :)
0684852756|5.0|Kureishi minimalistic descripiton of protagonists Jay last night before leaving his familly is a sad and sometimes dull, but really honest and accurate. Kureishi is not just being very sincere but also dealing with  side of somehow tabu question about leaving family and two children in  order being with another person. Story of his courage taking a decision  which will not deterine just his and his spouses life, but as well will  much determine his children is a sublime emotional voyage on this last  night. Kureishi is sending us a message that taking one side is not just  leaving the other behind. As story is sometimes really painfull to stick to  it, so is the described siutation. This book is recommendet to those people  who are stock in their lives with partners, not admiting there can be life  'afterwards', that they would live that kind o a life, beacuse it's hard to  admit that they made a wrong decission in past life. Having children is  making it worse, and leaving someone with this 'burden' is almost  impossible. But, as Kureishi pointed it out, leaving in a milieu of  constant fighting is no good for anyone, specially not for chidlren.
0790729970|5.0|This is the God's truth right off the bat...this is not your average comedy. This is a wild, cartoony movie. It's about your average work-a-day bank teller, Stanley Ipkiss, who finds a strange mask in a small chest that  was buried there a mess of years ago. But when he first puts it on (which  is kind of an intense scene for kids; parental discretion advised), he  becomes a man with a green face and a snazzy suit; a &quot;love-crazy wild  man&quot; with the combined personality of Bugs Bunny and Alfred E. Neuman.  <br />Ssssmokin'! <br />And this movie has bang-up special effects, including the  scene where he bounces off the walls (literally) and comes crashing through  a window, and the scene where his jaw drops (also literally) at first sight  of Cameron Diaz, who also fits this movie well. <br />If you love to watch  crazy and totally unpredictable movies, see The Mask. It will blow you  away.
B000002L68|4.0|This was the first Prince album I've listened to, and I must say has most of my favorite songs on it.  And although my most-loved on the Purple Rain soundtrack is of course the title song, &quot;Purple Rain,&quot; I must say  that I have offically dubbed &quot;Darling Nikki&quot; as my theme song.
2253005274|4.0|The adolescent (late teens) narrator, Francois Seurel, recounts the adventures of two of his friends of the same age, Augustin Meaulnes and Frantz de Galais.  Augustin falls asleep while driving a horse and cart to  a railway  station and wanders into a mysterious &quot;domain.&quot;  The  word refers to a manor house, and to a symbolic domain of both childhood  and romantic adventure.  A fancy-dress party lasting several days is in  progress.  Since anyone seems to be invited (and since the horse bolts)  Meaulnes stays.  At the party's end he is given a lift home (at night)  without ever discovering the domain's location.  He spends most of the rest  of the book trying to return to the domain, in both its literal and its  symbolic sense.  Frantz is also associated with the domain and searching  for a return to it.<br />The book draws a magical picture of rural France  around the turn of the 20th century.  As to the domain--it must be my  middle age showing, but I wanted a clearer moral position from the author.   Augustin and Frantz both unhesitatingly sacrifice the happiness, health,  and money of most of the other characters in quest of their romantic  ideals.  Not excluding the narrator; but especially they sacrifice the  women they profess to love.  I find it hard to accept this as any kind of  ideal.
B00000255F|5.0|In addition to being the album that made Bruce Springsteen a superstar, &quot;Born to Run&quot; is also the best American rock album of the 1970s.  Every song is a classic, even the ones that didn't receive extensive radio  airplay.  The album starts with the amazing &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; an  ode to a girl who Brusce tells &quot;you ain't a beauty but you're all  right.&quot;  It climaxes with &quot;Jungleland,&quot; the most  well-written long long of his career.  Along the way, tales of the streets  abound, lending the record a gritty authenticity.  Any discussion of  Springsteen's amazing career must start right here.
B00002E23E|5.0|Zeppelin rules, and this video shows it. As many people say, this may not be the best live footage, but it certainly kicks .... If you play guitar and you've heard Jimmy Page is sloppy, get a load of \\"Since I've been lovin'you\\" you'll be blown away. This DVD is not in Dolby Digital, but what's the point anyway, it's music recorded in the 70's, all you need are two speakers and a whole bunch of watts; anything else is just for show. This video is enough for any Zeppelin fan and should convert almost any non-believer who insists on talent behind his music.
B000002BFL|2.0|I was excited when I heard that Bruce Springsteen was going to record another album in the &quot;Nebraska&quot; mode.  My excitement turned to disappointment, however, as I listened and realized that there are no songs  here close to the power of that album's &quot;Atlantic City&quot; or  &quot;Johnny 99.&quot;  What you get instead is a lot of standard  folk-singer-stands-up-for-the-downtrodden tunes that fail to achieve any  transcendence.  Bruce's stand for the oppressed would be a lot more  convincing were he not already a multi-millionaire rock star.  This is a  well-intentioned but ultimate self-indulgent effort from an artist capable  of much better.  Never was the need for Bruce to bring back the E Street  Band more evident.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|These guys ROCK!  Pretty Fly [for a white guy], She got Issues,Why don't you get a job?,and more!  Take my advice,play these guys at a party. It's a very cool album.
B0000028SU|4.0|Bruce Springsteen fans were left feeling a little hungry by their hero in the decade of the 90s.  He released only three studio albums, of which this one is the best.  Unfortunately, it was released simultaneously with the  lesser &quot;Human Touch.&quot;  Combining the best songs from the two  would have given Bruce another first rate album to rival &quot;Born in the  U.S.A.&quot;  Seperately, each has good songs but is not uniformly  excellent.  &quot;Lucky Town&quot; came out for the better as each of the  first six songs are uniformly fine.  The second half lags, however.  Overall, this is a good Springsteen album that makes you wonder about the  missed opportunity for greatness (again).
B00000AFWW|4.0|It's amazing how Courtney can change from a Punk Queen to a suttle vocalist but still get her messages accross.
B0000024ZT|3.0|On his debut album, Bruce Springsteen trys out his hand as a folkie with decidedly mixed results.  Although the complex verbosity and masterful storytelling was already there, the music has little of the power that he  and the band would generate so effortlessly later on.  Sadly, Bruce's  versions of &quot;Blinded by the Light&quot; and &quot;For You&quot; were  trumped (at least in terms of sheer bombast) a few years later by Manfred  Mann's Earth Band.  Overall, this album features a future rock superstar  just starting to get comfortable with who he is as an artist.
6305810109|5.0|This movie is nothing short of a masterpiece.  It is such a simple, moving tale that Richard Farnsworth plays with such greatness, he transcends the role of actor.  This film gives hope to those who believe that the human  spirit and human kindness still have a place in the world.  It will fill  anyone who has lost there way in the world with meaning.  I am a better  person for watching the film.  You will be too.
B0000025KI|4.0|&quot;The River&quot; is another Springsteen triumph, featuring as it does his most popular single to date, &quot;Hungry Heart.&quot;  The album is chock full of classic performances, the best of which include the title  track, a lament to getting married too young, the mournful &quot;Wreck on  the Highway,&quot; and &quot;Independence Day.&quot;  Inevitably the double  album length means a few of the songs aren't quite ready for the  &quot;A&quot; list.  Nevertheless, this is a fine album well worth the  extra cost.
B00003CWRX|4.0|I think that the war against Nicotine is not an easy one to engage in.<br />This film is very interesting and touches the life of an individual who had to go through hell to do the moral thing.<br />Both Pacino and Crowe  did a good job.  However, the movie was VERY slow paced; and could have  possibly been covered in half the time.<br />Good point nonetheless. I am a  Nicotine Addict by the way, and I have been living without Nicotine for the  last 4 months.
B0000028SR|3.0|Unfortunately for the album &quot;Human Touch,&quot; the simultaneously released album &quot;Lucky Town,&quot; received the bulk of the great songs Bruce Springsteen had to offer at that point.  The absolutely fine love  song that is the title track is the highlight.  Beyond that the quality  drops off considerably.  By the end you find yourself longing for the since  departed E Street band.  Maybe Bruce got too contented as he approached  middle age and found out that it was time for him to stop running.
B000002KM6|5.0|THE BAND: David Lee Roth (vocals), Eddie Van Halen (guitars), Michael Anthony (bass), Alex Van Halen (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1981) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 31 minutes. This digitally remastered version released in 2000. Included with the disc is a 3-page foldout containing original album art/photos, and song credits (no lyrics). All songs written by VH. Label - Warner Bros.<br /><br />COMMENTS: I rank \\"Fair Warning\\" right behind VH-1 and VH-2 as far as my favorites go. As the cover art would indicate, the music is tough, mean, aggressive and good old fashioned hard rock 80's style. Dare I say this is Van Halen's hardest and crunchiest album. 3 songs made it to the radio with frequency back in 1981-82... \\"Mean Street\\", \\"Unchained\\" and \\"So This Is Love?\\". They were solid hits, but by no means VH's biggest or highest chart toppers. \\"Mean Street\\" and \\"Unchained\\" attacked the listener - Ed's trademark guitar work on both is second-to-none... some of his finest chops on any album. The deeper album cuts like \\"Dirty Movies\\", \\"Sinner's Swing\\" and \\"Hear About It Later\\" are gold. The only 2 question marks I have are the last 2 songs... \\"Sunday Afternoon In The Park\\" and \\"One Foot Out The Door\\" - both short at under 2 minutes and each deemed as 'filler'. All of the David Lee Roth era VH albums are short - and \\"Fair Warning\\" is no exception. Many record/disc companies are re-releasing old classics - like this 'remastered' edition. I for one have mixed emotions about bonus 'unreleased' tracks being added... especially when the bonus tracks suck. 'Live' tracks are okay if the songs are related to the album and they capture the band in peak form. Most 'unreleased' songs are unreleased for a reason (simply not good enough to make the grade in the first place). Only once in a while do you get a pure gem. So with each of the Van Halen albums being re-released... I don't mind the shortness of them and no bonus tracks... why mess with a classic (5-stars)!
B000002513|4.0|Bruce's sophomore album is a huge improvement over his debut release, but it is still a little rough around the edges.  His signature sound was just starting to become fully developed and he was also still figuring out where  he wanted to go as a songwriter.  The album contains at least three classic  songs, the early concert fave &quot;Rosalita&quot; and the street anthems  &quot;Incident on 57th Street and &quot;4th of July, Ashbury Park.&quot;  Still a bit shy of being in a league with &quot;Born to Run,&quot; this is  a very fine album nonetheless.
B000001EKX|3.0|THE BAND: Gene Simmons (Gene Klein), Paul Stanley (Stanley Eisen), Ace Frehley (Paul Frehley), Peter Criss (Peter Crisscoula).<br /><br />THE DISC: Released 10/22/74. Recorded at The Village Recorder in Los Angeles, CA. 10 songs clocking in at approximately 33 minutes. Hints of Japanese culture on the cover in conjunction with the band's kabuki style make up. Originally released on Casablanca Records in 1974; this remastered edition was released in 1997 on Mercury's label. Slightly improved sound in my book (deeper bass guitars and crisper highs)... but that's not saying much - the production on this album (and their first release) are downright horrible. Liner notes are slim - a 2 page fold out with song titles, writing credits and times. Underneath the disc on the inside cover, there's an informative 5 paragraph history of what the band was going through at the time.<br /><br />COMMENTS: No radio hits here, however \\"Alive\\" (1975) featured 5 killer songs from \\"Hotter Than Hell\\"... the title track, \\"Parasite\\", \\"Let Me Go, Rock and Roll\\", \\"Watchin' You\\", and \\"Got To Choose\\". The deeper album cuts were very good as well - like \\"Goin' Blind\\", \\"Mainline\\" and \\"All The Way\\". In my opinion, the song writing here is/was top notch for Kiss. However, Kiss proved ultimately, that their live show was without question, far superior to their vinyl release(s). Great songs; flat production; a sign of greater things to come.
B0000025D0|4.0|A lawsuit held up &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town,&quot; for several years.  It was just as well since the album was bound to suffer comparisons to the masterpiece &quot;Born to Run&quot; that proceeded it.  Overall, the  title is foreboding as lyrically this is Springsteen's darkest album.  There are some classic Springsteen performances like &quot;Candy's  Room,&quot; &quot;The Promised Land,&quot; &quot;Racing in the Street&quot;  and the title track.  Certainly not a let down, this album is a fine  addition to Springsteen's discography.

B0000025T6|5.0|Bruce Springsteen is a folk singer at heart who happens to have a lot of rock energy bursting out of him.  With &quot;Nebraska,&quot; he indulges his folkie side, and the result is not only stunning but unlike anything  else he had recorded up until that time.  Full for the most part of quiet  understated perfomances and minimal accompanyment, this album is a grand  artistic statement from a master.  The best songs are the serial killer  narrated title track, The down and out &quot;Atlantic City&quot; the  childhood statement of purpose &quot;Used Cars,&quot; and the bleak yeat  hopefull &quot;Reason to Believe.&quot;  This is not Bruce at his most  commericial.  Instead it is Bruce at his best.
6303201954|1.0|In 1979 people lined up to a film that was destined to become legendary for it name alone Star Trek the crew that we have love for years is now in a major motion picture for the silver screen and major isn't even the word as 55 millon went in to the making of this film, it set a record of being  the most expensive film of its time.<br />    Incredible Visual effects ,  incredible use of models but unfortunately Robert Wise focuses to much on  the effects and makes the ploit to long and to laking in depth to make it  intresting to watch in stead the movie plays out like a poster child for  insomniacs because the movie is far to long and overblown for it's own good  the ominous cloud that threatens the universe , that the enterprise must  stop before it's a threat to earth.<br />    Vger the ship is named is in  constant search for its creator sending out signals for it to answer and in  one point of the movie it takes them 20 minutes of the movie till we  finally see what  VGer is.  Star Trek 2 is an ultimately  more superior  and awsome Star Trek unlike this lagging excuse for a movie to bloated for  it's own good and very dull a dud.
0312932081|5.0|My resolution this New Years was to read the classics, the great novels that everyone ought to read once in their lifetimes.  Along with Shakespeare and Dickens, I started to read ask my friends what their  personal favorites were, and read them as well.  The name 'Enders Game'  came as a suggestion from one of my friends, and I reluctantly agreed,  expecting yet another unrealistic and mediocre sci-fi epic, drenched in  spaceships and overplayed heroism.  I was amazed to realize that this novel  was actually one of the most engrossing and well-written of all of the  books I had recently read.  Card's clear, concise and descriptive writing  tone made the story believable and fast-paced.  I above all commend him for  not patronizing  children.  All too often their ideas, quite occasionally  as clever and intellegent as adults, are swept aside and discarded purely  for the reason that the person was below a certain age.  This was truly a  remarkable book, and I urge everyone to read it.
0061002747|5.0|This book smells good, it is very cool and I like cheese. You better get this book or I will eat more cheese then will have some pepsi then I will go to sleep then wake up and go back to sleep. This book has a totally  radical ending and climax. The beggining is good but a little boring but it  is still intresting and remember EAT CHEESE OR EAT SOMETHING LESS  CHEESY!
6301967992|5.0|I first watched this film on the television at Christmas in about 1982 (under the title &quot;Dance Of The Vampires&quot;), and even then, as a 12 year-old, was impressed by this superior vampire 'caper'.  The film starts  with a beautifully haunting score (by the late Christopher Komeda) and the  arrival of a pair of intrepid vampire killers to a Transylvanian Inn.   Throughout the film, the viewer is treated to a visual and musical feast,  enhanced by brilliant acting from the likes of Ferdy Mayne, Jack MacGowran,  Alfie Bass, and of course, Iain Quarrier as the token gay vampire!  The  enchanting qualities of Sharon Tate as the inn-keeper's young daughter,  Sara, add to the overall enjoyment of the film; which, in my opinion, is  easily the best vampire and/or Polanski movie to date.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Her new cd is exacly like her old cd. If you know those songs than all you have to do is relearn new words because it is the same turn (almost:&gt;)) But i do like some of her songs. I don't like &quot;Opps...I did it  again&quot; because it is treating a guys feelings like gum...u throw it  away after your done. They are humans too.
B0000062FJ|5.0|In the musical candy store that was 1969 America, this Album stood apart. Th mature style and tight-knit fabric of the band was and is pleasingly apparent! Carlos, young, energetic and still a few years before he became  so spiritual (and boring) was in his prime . Santana rips through the  listener on &quot;soul sacrafice&quot;, becoming a true &quot;guitar  hero&quot; to the fans of that day. Todays rockers should take heed and  perhaps try to inject their own music with such brilliant, uncluttered,  straight-from-the-guts riffs of CARLOS,CARLOS!
B00004SCX6|4.0|This CD is no sophomore jinx.  Obviously, Miss Spears has aligned herself with all the right people:  writers, arrangers, producers.  I actually like this CD better than her debut CD; the songs seem to have more substance.   Her  special spin on the Rolling Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is a  delight to listen to because it's no retread; Britney knows how to make a  song her own.  I particularly like &quot;Lucky&quot; and I am sure it will  be a big hit.  Kudos to Miss Spears for a nice follow-up CD!

B0000020C4|1.0|This is the worst redording of Les Miserable I (and my friends) have ever heard. Lea Salonga performance of Eponine is horrible. It's as though she didn't really understand Eponine or feel her. Her songs doesn't have the  emotion of Frances Ruffelle. Eponine is supposed to sound like Ruffelle,  even Victor Hugo himself described her as having that kind of a voice (I  can't remember the exact words). I was also digusted with Gavroche. He is  an adorable little street urchin (that means he is skinny as well)not the  fat, tall kid who sounds horrid, they have portraying him in this cd. Well,  those are my only problems. They may not seem like much, but Eponine and  Gavroche are my favorite characters and I hate to see them ruined. *Don't  get angry Lea Salonga fans, but you must not identify with Eponine that  much either. I wouldn't talk, but I go through the same things Eponine  does. Forgive me...
B00004T8RK|3.0|I miss the old Pearl Jam.  Focused fury, a raw but multifaceted sound, a rip-roaring rhythm section (Dave Krusen and Dave Abbruzzese were marvellous drummers), thoughtful lyrics that ranked among the best in rock, and a  vocalist of unparalleled depth and richness -- all these assets made Pearl  Jam's first three records (Ten, Vs., Vitalogy) looming giants in '90s  rock.<br />But on the last studio album, Yield, Pearl Jam started writing  simpler, jammier songs that still worked on their own terms.  On last  year's terrible single &quot;Last Kiss&quot;, the band debuted Soundgarden  drummer Matt Cameron on skins and sounded positively embarrassing, Cameron  unable to lock into the energetic groove that served as this band's engine.   And on Binaural, it's as if the band is now playing while sitting on a  couch, with Eddie Vedder still shining in his vocal performances, but the  songwriting now meanders a whole lot, the recording is bad and muffled, and  the overall effect is a classic-rock feel without the passion that made  this band great in the first place.<br />I listened to this album twice on the  first day.  On first spin, I was just playing it as background and it  sounded pretty good.  But on the second time through, I listened intently  -- and was promptly disappointed.  I started nodding off, something that  never happened before when I listened to Pearl Jam.  It used to be that  Pearl Jam always stayed in top form from beginning to end on an album.  On  Binaural, it took until Track 4, &quot;Light Years&quot;, for me to wake  up.  The first three songs were like ambient noise, Vedder's great voice  mixed into the background.  The songwriting is devoid of hooks and real  structure, and Cameron's drumming is bland and out of character with the  rest of the band.  The most thoroughly damaged performances on this record,  however, are guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready.  Since Vitalogy  Pearl Jam has been steering away from the incisive, fiery solosthat  McCready excelled at, but on Binaural this is too much, the guitars  sounding more like distortion waves than notes and riffs.  And Stone  Gossard seems to have lost his knack for killer riffs first exhibited on  Ten.  Just like the awful &quot;No Way&quot; from Yield, Gossard's work on  Binaural is a pale imitation of its former glorious self.<br />Lyrically Pearl  Jam can still write some great imagery and Vedder's vocal quality remains  superb even if the awful production job doesn't give him the centerstage he  deserves.  It's been said that producer Tchad Blake likes to mike  &quot;binaurally&quot;, the way the human ears would hear a piece of music.   Well, microphones aren't ears, and recordings aren't concert experiences.   The murky recording on this record does Pearl Jam a huge injustice.  But  that is only partially symptomatic of the sense of malaise that has plagued  Pearl Jam's music since No Code.  The fire, the distinctiveness and the  passion are much diminished now, leaving only an amicable haze that wears  off awfully quickly.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Well except for Vitology there albums are getting better and better. Ive been a pj fan for awhile and this was what I expected. There is no hard &quot;rearviewmirror&quot;,&quot;evenflow&quot; or &quot;animal&quot; type  tracks but there are a plentiful num of rock songs. I would have to say  that this album is very very Neil Young, cant get any closer. I relly like  &quot;of the girl&quot;, &quot;light years&quot;, &quot;Igsinicance&quot;  and well all the others. Its relly great, even better if your a pearl jam  fan. I mean you will get plenty of Yeild on this album but some vs. as  well, ENJOY
B000002BFZ|5.0|All you people who think it's been downhill since Ten need to get lost.  Don't say that you love Pearl Jam and that you're a big fan.  They don't love you and they don't want you for a fan.  They probably recorded No Code  not just to create another masterpiece, but to scare away all the shallow  people like you.  Ever heard the Nirvana song &quot;In Bloom&quot;?  I  wouldn't expect for you to know what it means but it's especially for  you!<br />No Code is a classic.  I'd like to leave you with a quote from Oscar  Wilde which sits well with this album and it's mixed response.<br />&quot;All  art is at once surface and symbol. Those who go beneath the surface do so  at their peril. Those who read the symbol do so at their peril. It is the  spectator, and not life, that art really mirrors. Diversity of opinion  about a work of art shows that the work is new, complex, and vital. When  critics disagree, the artist is in accord with himself.&quot;  -Oscar Wilde
6305627401|5.0|While some people have written off South Park as a low(er) brow Beavis And Butthead, I tell them this. This is not Beavis and Butthead Do America people. This is the way South Park was meant to be, totally uncensored. If  you are turned off by swearing in some movies(watch any Quentin Tarintino  movie and you'll see), I still recommend this movie. While it does have the  aura of um...dirty language(and this surprising fact, there is a swear word  in this movie every 2 minutes or so), it is hilarious take on modern  society. It pokes fun at almost everything we hold sacred, and well,  everything we don't. It ribs God, Satan, Saddam Hussein, Jewish people, and  even our Canadian friends to the north. Despite its shoddy animation, it  really makes up for that with its very sharp writing and dialouge. I highly  recommend this to anybody who likes the show and even people who don't  watch the show. But watch it cautiously, YOU WILL BE OFFENDED in one way or  another.
6304342586|5.0|The absolute BEST!  It is best to watch this movie on widescreen. Wish that the VHS edition of this film include scenes which were cut out from the theatrical release, which sometimes TV broadcasts restored...you  actually see Fred Astaire gave the flowers to Jennifer Jones, you get to  see a lot more of Susan Blakley, for example.<br />As expected, the fire and  the building is the real stars of the show. Most of the other characters  have thin storylines that you really don't care about. Some of the dialog  are really stupid, but who cares?  You just want to see if they can make  it out to the finale. As expected, Steve McQueen and Paul Newman do most of  the acting here while most of the other cast just stood around, trying to  act like they are doing something.<br />Special commendation must be made to  Jennifer Jones, who gave one of the best performances in the film. Or  prehaps because her character is one of the few who actually HAVE something  to do other than standing around.<br />The special effects are  phenomenal...sometimes you can't tell that what you seeing is not a real  building at all. And all done before the advent of computer technology. Now  imagine what they can accomplish if they have film the movie today.<br />But  Towering Inferno is a classic, and can never be remade. It has its own  special brand of magic, special brand of feel and look.<br />It is just  special.
0792839730|5.0|After watching A BRIDGE TOO FAR, the only thing a person can think about is the great sacrifice every service man did in WW2 for us all. I don´t want to write down a real review of this movie, I´d rather like to point  out the lessons this movie gives. Ever since I watched this masterpice, I  vividly recall many scenes: The ultimate sacrifice of the British  paratrooper when he tries to retrive a container that has just landed on  the No Man´s Line, beliving there are inside the much needed supplies, only  to be killed by a German sniper ( from the SS, I guess) when he is only  inches away from the British lines ( there were only useless red berets  inside).<br />I too remember when Max Schell, playing the role of an  aristocratic German high ranking officer (a remembrace of THE IRON CROSS),  when he offers a piece a chocolate to a British POW:&quot;Take it. It´s  good chocolate, your planes dropped it over our lines yesterday&quot;.   Yes, Virginia, there still can be chivalry on the battlefild.<br />If you have  ever known whatever happened to GEN. Sosabowsky (masterly played by Gene  Hackman)after the war, you´d understand the psychology behind the role. I  cant think of any other actor more suited than Hackman to play him. <br />The  same goes to Liv Ullmann and Sir Lawrenece Olivier. They two depict the  spirit of the Dutch people. Liv is is really superb in the role of the  gentlewoman who unselfishly lends her home so it can be transformed into a  field hospital, open to every wounded man, no matter his uniform or  ideology; and she also lets his garden to be transformed into the last home  of this fallen heroes.<br />Definitively, as I told the soldiers under my  command ( I myself became a paratrooper, inspired in the heroic deeds which  appear in this movie)this is THE war movie (with the possible exception of  THE IRON CROSS).
0061002747|4.0|This book was ok, the begining was really boaring then it got really interesting. The evedance is really fun to read. But, i didn't like the end. It sounded like Christie just gave up and desided to stop writing the  book. It was a fun read and i do recomend it to other young readers.
B00004SCX6|1.0|&quot;Oops!...I did it again&quot; is what you will be saying to yourself if you buy another Britney Spears CD.  There's so much bad about this one, its tough to know where to start.<br />So I'll start with the most egregious,  heinous musical crime of the still-new century -- Britney Spears covering  &quot;Satisfaction.&quot;  I know, if you haven't heard it, you must be  thinking, &quot;it can't possibly be as bad as Madonna's cover of 'American  Pie.'&quot;  And you would be right.  Its not as bad.  its about ten  thousand times worse!<br />On Britney's last CD, she covered a Sonny and Cher  song.  Sonny and Cher are generally regarded as a joke.  The song,  &quot;And the Beat Goes On&quot; is (unintentionally) a laugh-fest.   Accordingly, Britney covering such thing makes sense -- its insulting to  you, the listener, but it makes sense.<br />But &quot;Satisfaction&quot; is  the best rock song in all of history.  It is the best rock song in the  universe.  Devo can get away with covering it because they were making a  joke out of how good the song is.  Britney, however, attempts to (and I  hesitate to write this) she attempts to do justice to it.  This is like  McDonald's attempting to do justice to steak.  It is so hideous, so awful,  that after listening through the whole album you will have trouble getting  the horror out of your head.<br />I realize as I write that some readers may  be so young as to be unfamiliar with The Rolling Stones or the original  version of &quot;Satisfaction.&quot;  All I can say is that you are  deprived children who don't fully appreciate exactly what ears were made  for yet.  The other thing I can say is that the next song Britney covers  should be from another classic band, the Who.  The song should be  &quot;Won't Be Fooled Again&quot; and it should be dedicated to all her  &quot;loyal&quot; fans.
0790729733|5.0|This is not really a movie at all. It's a screed. A statement. A  howl of pain. I know of no other movie to which it compares. Stone seems tortured by the event, and doubly tortured by an official explanation that insults  his intelligence and that of the American people. Unfortunately he buys  into the rather spacey &quot;High Cabal&quot; theory of J. Fletcher Prouty,  and that's a problem. He doesn't even understand the state of the CIA at  that time in history. To put it simply, it was profoundly f'd up. As we are  now well aware, they had the Mafia on the gov't. payroll, and the agency  was itself split into many factions and filled with a lot of crackpots and,  shall we say, &quot;eccentrics.&quot; The sane people - people like John  McCone - were not entirely aware of all the shenanigans that were in play  at the time. The inmates ran the asylum. A truer film would have revealed  more of the tragicomic nature of it all. There clearly were more people  involved in the murder than the silly little fellow with the fake Russian  accent. The evidence is now abundant that Oswald probably shot no one. And  at least Stone accomplished this for the man. But there was no  &quot;grand&quot; conspiracy. That's not how conspiracies work, anyway.  There's a new book about how Bill Clinton was &quot;hunted.&quot; It's a  great book, a serious book, and shows how conspiracies are loose affairs  connecting like-minded people with similar goals. The wonderful thing is  that such conspiracies are rarely if ever &quot;covered up.&quot; The JFK  affair is an instruction manual in how NOT to do a coverup. The official  story was silly from day one.  But it was a tense time, and they didn't  want to find out where the trail might lead. The government carrying on  with the Mob was very embarrassing. Reputations and careers were at stake.  I do not think it is too late to search for living conspirators and bring  them to official justice. Garrison took a wild stab at a difficult timeand  made mistakes. There's still time to adjudicate the matter with more  success than Garrison.
B00001OH80|5.0|After the hype and success of Let's Dance and all the money made from the Serious Moonlight Tour. It appeared Bowie could relax. He was in no immediate financial trouble, and it appeared, for once in his career, he  had absolute freedom. Bowie made several skiing vacations during 1984 (the  year he had talked over and over about in his album Diamond Dogs), and it  seemed he was happy. <br />But he was still tied to the albums he promised in  his contract with EMI, thus Tonight was born. It has long been remembered  as one of the worst Bowie albums. This I disagree with. There are some  wonderful tracks on this LP. Including, &quot;Blue Jean&quot;, &quot;Tumble  and Twirl&quot;, &quot;Neighborhood Threat&quot; (an excellent cover of an  old Iggy Pop song), and &quot;I Keep Forgettin'&quot;. If you are at all  interested in 1980's pop music, this album is for you!
B00000099Y|5.0|Grungy metal meets art-rock on Tool's stunning third release, and it's great! But let me adress some complaints of this album. The Non-music and &quot;intermission&quot; tracks- Personally, I love em. I think they're  quite atmospheric and provide good buildups to the next track. As for the  &quot;ugliness&quot; of the album, yeah sometimes there's some distorted  guitar noises and other things that aren't particurly pleasing to the ears,  but I suppose it just depends on the person whether they'll like that or  not. But along with this &quot;ugliness&quot;, there are several very  beautiful moments on this album as well. Take for example the little guitar  solo in &quot;H.&quot; or the opening of &quot;Eulogy&quot;, absolutely  breathtaking. Of course, Maynard's voice is quite pleasing to hear as well.  I love this album, everyone may not, but I think most metal, hard rock, and  even some prog-rock fans or fans of music that's a little deeper than most  should enjoy it.
B00004SCX6|4.0|The original pop princess is back with her second album 'Oops! I Did It Again', and her tunes are funkier than ever.  Included on the album is a cover of a huge Rolling Stones hit '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction', as well  as Britney's first attempt at song writing on 'Dear Diary'.<br />Britney has  already topped the charts in many countries with the very up-beat and all  too familiar sounding 'Oops! I Did It Again', and it's no surprise.  For  those fans who have not yet purchased this album, you may want to consider  purchasing the Australian version, which contains 15 tracks (Girl In The  Mirror, You Got It and Heart) as well as a limited edition facsimile  Britney Spears V.I.P. pass.<br />1. Oops! I Did It Again - This song may  contain a    hint of 'Baby One More Time' and 'Crazy', but    it is  excellent.  A very up-beat and catchy    song. 5/5<br />2. Strong - A very  funky up-beat song, and    some unusual vocals.  It's very  &quot;Britney&quot; and    extremely catchy. 4.5/5<br />3. Don't Go Knocking  On My Door - An R'n'B    flavored song.  Definately grows on you the     more you listen to it, but a good song. 4/5<br />4. (I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction - The much talked    about Rolling Stones cover.  It really  could    have done without the talking at the start    though.  The  &quot;La La La&quot; vocal at the beginning    sounds a lot like the  beginning of Mandy    Moore's 'Not Too Young'.  The song itself, is    one  I think you'll either love or hate.     Personally, I really like it.  A  lot different    to the original which I think is a good thing    for cover  songs.  It's mid-tempo, and quite    impressive. 4/5<br />5. Don't Let Me Be  The Last To Know - The start of    this almost sounds a bit oriental.  It  is a    ballad, that was co-written by Shania Twain and    her  husband/producer &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange.  There is a    certain bit of  music in this chorus that    reminds me of the instrumental section in  'From    This Moment On.  It'sa lovely song, and shows    her music has  really matured since her debut    album. 4.5/5<br />6. What You See Is What  You Get - Another up-beat    funky song.  The beginning has a 'Paula Abdul'     sound to it.  Very catchy and yet another great    pop song. 4/5<br />7.  Lucky - One of my favorite tracks.  It's    another catchy mid-up-tempo  song, but the intro    could almost be mistaken for 'Stand By Me'. 5/5<br />8.  One Kiss From You - This song sounds like it    belongs on 'Baby One More  Time'.  It just    doesn't have the feel of this album, but isn't    bad.  3.5/5<br />9. Where Are You Now - This is a really nice    ballad.  It's quite  slow, with a lot of backing    vocals and nice guitar. 4/5<br />10. Can't Make  You Love Me - Yet another of     Britney's very up-beat, danceable,  singable,     catchy tunes. 3.5/5<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - This song  has a Sophie     B. Hawkins sound to it.  It's a slow and calm     song.  4/5<br />12. Girl In The Mirror (Bonus) - I don't know why     this wasn't on  the general release of this     album, it's a really nice and 'pretty'      sounding song.  Definately worth getting the     version with this song.  4.5/5<br />13. You Got It All (Bonus) - The beginning of this     sounds a  little like 'I Will Still Love You'     from Baby One More Time.  This is a  mid-tempo     average song. 3.5/5<br />14. Heart (Bonus) - A slow-mid tempo  song.  It's     quite a good song, with a nice string section.      4/5<br />15. Dear Diary - So, is Britney more than a     performer with a good  voice?  This is her     first released track written by herself.  It's      a slow track about a boy, and not a bad     attempt with a nice finishing  touch to the     album. 3.5/5<br />It's not a matter of if this album will be  successful, but a matter of counting the countries it will top the charts.   Britney has definately matured, and it can be heard in most of the songs on  this album without losing her special touch.  <br/>Leaving 'Baby One More  Time' for dead, 'Oops! I Did It Again' is a fantastic follow-up album, and  is evidence that all the imitators just don't have it.  An album definately  worth purchasing if you've enjoyed past Britney Spears hits, you will not  be disappointed.
B00000JG41|4.0|I can't pick a favorite Bungle album, so I won't say if this is better or worse or anything. One thing's certain though, it's damn good. You've got sweet, relaxing tracks such as &quot;Sweet Charity&quot; and  &quot;Retrovertigo&quot; and then you've got your wacked out little numbers  i.e. &quot;Goodbye Sober Day&quot;. Even though a track like that or any  other of the schizo tracks jumps genres and changes tempos rapidly, it's  done smoothly and is pretty easy on the ears. Anyone looking to get into  Bungle, get this album first, if you like it then check out &quot;Disco  Volante and the self-titled album.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I'm not sure why, but I found that the second album by Britney Spears, &quot;Oops! I did it again&quot; wasn't as powerful and good as her debut album.  I think the main reason, in my opinion, for this is because all the  songs sound too much alike.  They all have that &quot;oops! I did it  again&quot; beat and melody.  There isn't much variety in the music.  The  slow songs are nice and all, but just don't have as catchy of a melody as  the &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; songs had. The best comparison would  have to be the 2nd Britney Spears album with the 2nd NSync album.  I liked  the second NSync album very much, possibly because they were able to pull  off &quot;changing styles&quot; (you'll notice 3 slow songs, rest fast).   For &quot;OIDIA&quot; it's the same, more fast songs and less slow songs.   And as bad as this sounds, the sappy songs that we all have come to love  (hey, it's a pop song) are lost and they try too many new things without  pulling them off too well. I'm not saying this CD is terrible, but just not  great.  I'm not giving it 0 stars or something like that because it was  worse than the first one (my opinion), but just from a listeners point of  view.  If you liked her first album, don't expect to find the same kind of  tunes but rather more tunes around the formula of &quot;Drive Me  Crazy&quot;, &quot;Oops! I did it again&quot;, and &quot;Hit Me Baby One  More Time&quot;.  It's that fast, upbeat, style (and mind you, the lyrics  this time around are mostly different attidude too).
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I can't believe I waited so long to get this album! I first considered purchasing it about 3 years ago but never did. Now that I have though, I see what everyone is raving about. Every song on London Calling is packed  with energy and emotion, and not one track is less than good(even if  &quot;Wrong Em Boyo&quot; and &quot;Lover's Rock&quot; are a bit cheesy).  Plenty has been said about this album, and I really don't know if there's  much else I can add. So I'll just sum it up and say buy this album!
0425107469|3.0|The book's plot was unbelievable.  Even though the story was intended as a sci-fi, things got too weird when the antagonist of the book was introduced.  Another thing to look out for is a sketchy transition from one  plot to the other.  I have to say there are about five different scenarios  to keep track of.  The fact that new sub-stories are added through most of  the book makes reading and comprehending more difficult.  <br />Despite the  flaws Koontz still managed to keep the reader's attention with great  suspenseful twists throughout the story line.  He did a great job in tying  the different lives of the characters into one exciting ending.  The book  is much better reading it the second time around.
B000007T1M|4.0|A variety of styles, a singer with psychotic vocal tendencies, politcal lyrics, all wrapped up in a neo-metal package. Sounds cool? Well it is. It's a bit &quot;out there&quot; at times, but hey, that makes it even  better! Buy it.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I would suggest this CD to anyone who is looking for a more liberated Britney. She has really grown up alot since her first album. In songs #2&amp;3, she shows off her new found independance. The remake of (I can't  get no) Satisfaction has a very catchy beat to it, you will find yourself  tapping your foot to it. She shows off her new views of life through the  majority of the songs and if you listen to the words, you will agree that  she has grown up very much. For all you Brit fans, this is a MUST BUY! Its  that good.

B0000032LS|5.0|&quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; es posiblemente uno de los discos mas divertidos de la historia (divertido pero con calidad, claro).Es histrionico, es ironico, es infantil, es claramente afeminado pero sobre  todo es puro glam-rock (que no te de miedo en decirlo  alto:&quot;Glam-Rock&quot;. Sus canciones en ciertas ocasiones bordean el  cursi mas quinceaero y repelente como en la inmejorable  &quot;Touch-a,touch-a,touch me&quot; (adoro esta cancion a pesar de lo que  digo)y en otras como en &quot;Hot patootie bless my soul&quot; arranca  grandes momentos de rocknroll al servicio de la potente voz de Meat Loaf  (cuyo &quot;Bat out of hell&quot; es deudor en gran parte de este disco).En  mi opinion, el nivel de los primeros 9 temas del album son impresionantes,  mientras que la 2 parte (sobre todo esa especie de Opus compuesta por 3  temas)es algo mas flojita, ademas de mucho mas triste y melancolica  acabando bastante con ese aire de alegria que habia. Que pena.Y si tuviera  que destacar algun tema,por supuesto cogeria &quot;Science Fiction/Double  Feature&quot; (que pedazo de letra cinefila),las dos siguientes, la  &quot;no puedes parar de mover los pies&quot; &quot;Time Warp&quot; y la  mejor por supuesto &quot;Sweet Transvestite&quot;. Esta sola cancion  mereceria la compra del disco. Que descaro,que fuerza, que machote,que voz,  que interpretacion (bravo,bravo). En definitiva compratelo ya de una puta  vez y no pienses en lo que puedan pensar tus amigos y familia.
0783241569|2.0|Ordinary guy meets famous movie star girl and they fall in love, like a fairy tale. The premise seemed like a feast for hopeless romantics ... seemed. I found Anna Scott, the 'famous movie star', to be arrogant and  unapproachable to begin with, conceited, insensitive and indecisive to  continue with and totally unattractive, in character I mean, throughout the  story, which is compounded as William was sweet, understanding and devoted.  At the end, the movie did not achieve in making me understand William's  attraction to or obsession with Anna. She jumped on him with such  bitterness when she opened the door to the world's pressmen in the morning  after ! Throughout the story, she &quot;begged&quot; for him to come close,  then pushes him away cruelly, then begs him come close again, then pushes  him away again, that it pained me to watch. Most of all, I could not feel  the love between them ... yes, William was surely smitten with Anna (the look  of wonder on his face each time she was near was well portrayed by Hugh  Grant) but Anna surely lacked the same kind of devotion for him (Julia  Roberts was contrived and `uninspiring')<br />Granted that the script was  above average and some scenes were witty/humourous, but romantic movies are  supposed to give you that warm glow within, make you smile dreamily and  reinforce your faith in love, and this story DID NOT do that for me.  Instead I felt immense dislike for the leading lady and much empathy for  the leading man. So, as a romantic story, it surely failed.
B000001IPL|5.0|This is definatelly the best CD i own. I got it when it first came out but never listened to it. Just about a month ago i did start listening to it, and i'm glad i did. If you like any kind of rock, you have to get this CD.  The best track is #7, Come out and Play.

B000002JAX|3.0|Peyroux is great.  Here comes the but...the arrangements and the background music are terrible.  In that, the accompanying music is often too loud, and the arrangements don't really fit her fabulous voice.   Peyroux's voice, in my opinion, lends itself to a piano, bass, and snare.   In others words, do some of the old standards and &quot;torch&quot;em.
B00011CZRE|5.0|Seven\\" is a film that achieves the rare distinction of being a thoughtful crowd pleaser. Unfortunately, the public seems to have been taken largely with the surface elements only, the suspense and the gore. The film is indeed a visual masterpiece, in look and feel borrowing inspiration from the nightmarish works of such photographers as Joel Peter Witkin and Matt Mahurin. Director David Fincher is clearly in synch with Andrew Kevin Walker's riveting screenplay. All of this makes for superlative entertainment, but there's much more here than just an exciting story. The message of \\"Seven\\" is the primary reason for it's importance.<br /><br />On the surface, \\"Seven\\" is an ingenious thriller detailing the hunt for a particularly pernicious serial killer who, with great aesthetic imagination, dispatches his victims using the seven deadly sins as his model, one victim per sin. The hunters are two detectives. The first is Somerset (Morgan Freeman), a tired, very jaded man only days away from retirement who sees little good in human nature and has given up hope of ever improving the world around him. The other is Mills (Brad Pitt), green and full of fire for righting the many wrongs in society. This attitude provokes only sad amusement from Somerset, who views it as the product of a naive mind. The two are made partners in the search for John Doe, the mysterious psychopath of the piece, and the opposing viewpoints held by these two men form the basis of the conflict in the film.<br /><br />\\"Seven\\" poses these questions: Why is the world so full of darkness, violence, selfishness, and cruelty? Just who is responsible? Is the act of sinning the exclusive domain of serial killers and other extreme reprobates? Or is it possible that we ourselves, in our own less noticeable way, contribute to the everyday hell that the nameless city in the film represents? In a moving scene early in the film, the investigative styles of the two detectives are contrasted. Somerset sets to work in a public library, edifying himself calmly through the study of books as to the killer's possible inspirations for his murders, while the young Mills mentally struggles with the case at home using a brain so lacking in knowledge and education as to be utterly useless. It is a sequence celebrating the beauty and power of learning, without which wisdom and compassion are likely to be developed. Without these things, the chances for a better world are slim.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Seven\\" is a deeply moral film, a dark cry of anguish over the state of human behavior. It sees very little hope of ever reversing the natural self-serving impulses of the average human being, yet it demands that we not turn away. It demands that we make the effort to improve the world and ourselves.ary, edifying himself calmly through the study of books as to the killer's possible inspirations for his murders, while the young Mills mentally struggles with the case at home using a brain so lacking in knowledge and education as to be utterly useless.

B00004T8RK|2.0|Binaural is a major disappointment both musically  and lyrically. Pearl Jam is a very talented band and could have done alot better.
B000002L75|5.0|i bought 2 days ago this album and i've suddently fell in love with it! songs are really fantastik, full of passion and lyrics are ok too. the best songs of the album are &quot;something to do&quot; &quot;lie to me&quot;  &quot;people are people&quot; &quot;stories of old&quot; &quot;master and  servant&quot; and the absolutly wonderful &quot;blasphemous  rumours&quot;!  a must for all the dm fans! believe me, this is ok!
B000008M54|5.0|In spite we get all new stuff pretty soon down here in Argentina,The Waterboys were never famous, perhaps not even known. I just picked Fisherman's Blues from the lot to give it a try.

I have a little Scottish blood somewhere back in my ancestry and got  to learn that Scott is from Scotland Well done, especially in Go Away and  Stolen Child, anybody there who would like to share some thoughts about  this CD ?
B000002L9M|4.0|so, it's a very good album, my fav songs are: &quot;here is the house&quot; and &quot;but not tonight&quot;. this one could be my fav dm songs of all time....but i don't know it yet. in italy &quot;here is the  house&quot; was covered by an italian band called Bluvertigo. the song in  italian is &quot;Complicit&quot;. it's very nice, but dm original version  is better!
B000000H57|5.0|ok you would have to be crazy to rate this album any less than 5 stars. Actually, it deserves at least 50. I just cant get enough of their beautiful melodies, deep &quot;choir style&quot; vocals, and just the immensely strong emotions that radiate from the music. When i first heard  &quot;Die With Me&quot;, it almost brought tears to my eyes!  if this isnt  great music, then nothing is
B0000047BA|5.0|I BOUGHT THIS CD ON A PURE WHIM, NEVER HEARING OF THE MOVIE AND HAVING NO IDEA OF WHAT TO EXPECT.  WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE.  THE CD FEATURES JOHN LEE HOOKER ON VOCALS, TAJ MAHAL ON GUITAR, MILES DAVIS ON TRUMPET, ROY ROGERS  ON SLIDE, EARL PALMER ON DRUMS AND TIM DRUMMOND ON BASS. THE CD IS A  COLLECTION OF SLOW BURNING SULTRY MUSIC THAT COMBINES BLUES AND JAZZ AS  ONLY MILES DAVIS COULD PLAY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE MOVIE, BUT DENNIS  HOPPER DEFINETLY KNOWS HOW TO THROW A BAND TOGETHER.  GO AHEAD, BUY THE CD,  INVITE OVER THAT SOMEONE SPECIAL, OPEN A BOTTLE OF WINE, DIM THE LIGHTS AND  FIND THAT HOT SPOT. A GREAT FIND!
B00004T8RK|5.0|If your looking for an album with the reinvention of &quot;Alive&quot; and &quot;Evenflow&quot; then you are barking up the wrong tree with the wrong band.  Pearl Jam has matured into one of the most well rounded and diverse  bands going.  Binaural shows this maturity.  Different from other PJ  albums, yet distinctly PJ.  If you open up your ears as the Binaural title  suggests and listen to the music without any preconceived notions, then you  will certainly enjoy this album.  If you are looking for another  &quot;Jeremy&quot; filled anthem album that is going to be played to death  on the radio, then you might be dissapointed.  Pearl Jam is far beyond the  cookie cutter approach of taking a hit and molding it into 10 other songs,  hoping for some airplay.  If you are a fan of music and like to be  challenged, then you will love this album.  If you are a fan of Pearl Jam,  you should already have it.  Buy the album just for it's initial standout  track, though far from it's only one in &quot;Light Years&quot;.   Distinctly Pearl Jam.
0792156684|1.0|Ugh! This was a recommendation for me!   How?  This was by far the worst movie I have ever seen. I wanted to give it it no stars but this program would not let me. I could not wait for the boat to sink.  It trivialized the true event by turning it into a trite and unbelievable love story.
B000002LGA|4.0|Lou Reed's New York is a modern day Sodom or Gomorrah on the brink of self-destruction. There's little hope of a Shakespearean romance for `Romeo And Juliette,' because Romeo Rodriguez is a street fighter who's future is  either death by the sword or a life in prison without Juliette. The  neighborhood freaks and perverts (Halloween Parade), devastated by AIDS,  are dwindling in number. The `Dirty Boulevard' swallows all that is just  and good leaving the city with a bleak and filthy landscape. Although  there's no super hero to save the city from the rot eating at its core  (Strawman), Reed still has faith for survival (Busload Of Faith): his call  for immediate action to avoid Amagedon is the center of `There Is No  Time.'<br />The mellower tunes (Endless Cycle, Last Great American Whale, Xmas  In February) are ideal musical backdrops for Reed's street talk delivery  and street wise poetry. Once I read a quotation from Reed defining rock and  roll as `four chords and an attitude.' Reed's alienated attitude is the  framework of New York including the brutal straight-up rockers (Dirty  Boulevard, There Is No Time, Busload  Of Faith). These electrifying  compositions are among the most brazen in the genre of  Rock/Singer/Songwriter: the music is stripped to the core leaving just  guitars, stand-up bass and a drum kit. And yes, the most significant  element of this admirable CD is attitude.

B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is so great!  It is completely different from her first album with more edgier tracks, etc.  Her sound is awesome on this album and numbers 2 and 3 really make you want to get up and dance....<br />Totally worth the  money...  Especially since Amazon.com has it at such a great discounted  price!
B000002G8N|5.0|This CD has been remastered from the original 1981 master tapes using a state of the art 20 BIT Analog to Digital converter.  The result is a vastly improved recording.  The songs are a mixture of slow rock and blues from Clapton's early days.  The CD is worth purchasing and adding to  your collection. &quot;Blow Wind Blow&quot; and &quot;I Can't Stand  it&quot; are probably the best known tunes on the CD, but the others are  equally good.  I have seen this CD in stores for lower and was  skeptical at first. But now that I own it and have listened to it, I  whole-heartedly recommend it.
B0000067L2|5.0|First of all, at least one of the negative reviews here (I will not mention which) is typical of many youngsters who think they know something about the 60s, but who were probably not even born then. Disraeli Gears was  so far ahead of things that it wasn't until after the band broke up that it  gained its deserved large audience.<br />Sunshine of Your Love was the  &quot;hit&quot; (and still haunts the band as their signature piece, to  some extent), but is not the best song on the CD. Tales of Brave Ulysses  and SWLABR are more indicative of EC's excellent playing. And remember the  EC was just a kid at the time!<br />Those of us who are Clapton/Les Paul  Guitar fans will hear Gibson tones like no others in recording history (100  watt Marshall stacks in isolation booths at full volume, that great Les  Paul/SG); and that strange mix of blues and English 'folk' gives the  overall sound a quality that Cream never matched again.
B00004S6GL|5.0|Figure 8 was an album I purchased on a sheer whim. I had happened upon Ms. Misery several times, and had heard of Smith's songwriting prowess from friends.  From the first spin, I was floored by the depth of this album.  Normally, I use the term 'Beautiful' sparingly, (usually only referring to  women, sports cars, and the occasional landmark), but Figure 8 is  devastatingly beautiful.  The arrangements are nothing short of  incredible, lending the album a set of songs that provide joyous and  melancholic continuity. This album makes me want to check out everything  else Smith has worked on. Figure 8 is a breath of fresh air considering the  homogenity now plaguing the radio waves. Elliott Smith fan or not, you must  buy this album. You will be floored.
031286504X|3.0|Richard Matheson is a new author for me until recently, and it was only after I'd read _I Am Legend_ that I found out he was responsible for _What Dreams May Come_ (though I must admit I've only seen the film).<br />The title  story in this collection is an eerie and fascinating exploration of our  society after it is overcome by vampirism.  The main character, Robert  Neville, lives locked away in his fortress of a home by night, and kills  vampires by day.  He explores their affliction scientifically to determine  the origins of the &quot;germ&quot; as he calls it.  In fact, this is an  interesting aspect of the story; vampirism as a simple bodily illness blown  into the proportion of a legend.<br />_I Am Legend_ is a good read, and the  ending, though abrupt, is worth it as Neville finally comes to understand  his place in this new world ruled by gruesome enemies of humanity.<br />The  other stories in the volume are entirely forgettable, in my opinion.  Most  are enumerative horror at their core, and simply list all the horrible  things that happen to someone because of African curses/cursed  statuettes/witchcraft wielding teenage solider-girls/fiery temper/etc.  The  words sound right, but the stories suffer because of the bland laundry list  of cuts, bruises, and lacerations that the characters endure.<br />Again, read  it for the title story; I was disappointed in the others.
B00004STPT|5.0|Hans Zimmer and Lisa Garrard so skillfully integrated their music into Ridley Scott's epic Gladiator that it might be underappreciated if not played separately.  Two moods are masterfully created by this soundtrack:  Zimmer's powerful martial orchestration, so stirring it will send you in  search of your samurai sword in the attic trunk; and Lisa Garrard's  emotional themes that sweep you with an unforgettable after-battle  melancholy and sense of loss.     This is certainly a soundtrack in the  tradition of Miklos Rozsa (Ben-Hur, El Cid), Nino Rota (War and Peace), and  Dimitri Tiomkin (The Fall of the Roman Empire).  But it perhaps owes more  to James Horner's recent Titanic. In his battle music, Zimmer employs a  sustained bombast, at times punctuated with piercing bell strikes that  remind us of Horner's rivet-popping, and Garrard employs the human voice as  a musical instrument in much the way Horner so masterfully loaded his  Titanic soundtrack with emotion.      Fans of Zimmer may recall that he has  something of a reputation for orchestral bombast. In The Whole Wide World,  for example, writer Robert E. Howard is at his typewriter pounding out a  Conan the Barbarian story, when Zimmer steps in with his stirring  soundtrack to deliver the audience to the world of sword and sorcery. And  who could forget Zimmer's burst of music as the nuclear submarine takes to  sea in Crimson Tide?      The Gladiator soundtrack is Zimmer's best, and  stands with or without the film.
B00000K0EA|4.0|Brosnan's second outing as 007 is better than decent, yet, it lacks the punch of some of the Connery films. This time, the villain is Jonathan Pryce as Elliot Carver. Pryce is campier than Christopher Walken's Zorin  and has worse lines than Alec Travelyan, but, is a lot of fun to watch.  Even more impressive is Michelle Yeoh as the new Bond girl, who does much  more than just look sexy. She kicks, punches, shoots and even turns Bond  down more than once. The story is engaging, if slightly implausible. The  most overlooked performance is that of Gotz Otto as Carver's Aryan sadist  henchman named Stamper, who is a formidable adversary that would give Jaws  a good fight. Plenty of pretty women, exotic locations and clever gadgets,  including an ill-fated BMW with self-inflating tires, unbreakable windows  and a buzzsaw hood ornament. The action sequences are stunning, including a  motorcycle chase as Bond flees from a chopper. Some of the fight scenes,  however, are a little tedious and Sheryl Crowe's title song has to be the  worst since Moonraker. (Why, oh why did they not use kd Lang's more  appropriate end credit song instead?) Still, a fun-filled, rip-roaring and  entertaining film for 007 fans.
B000021Y7W|4.0|Hope no-one here minds if I put in a different opinion. At this stage the Heads seem to be going through the motions. If your favourite Heads albums are from the mid-eighties then go ahead. Their performances at this stage  were ... safe. If you're a fan of &quot;Fear Of Music&quot; and  &quot;Remain In Light&quot; (or the earlier albums), however, don't expect  to see them at a time when they were at the cutting edge.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I think this is pj third best album tied with vs. but not reaching the heights of yield and vitalogy.<br />ups: a little more heavy than others, darker, every song is good in it's own way, no fillers, it's good to see  that every member of the band is contributing, matt cameron is the best  drummer pj has had, good rhytms and good lyrics; light years, grievance,  insignificance, breakerfall, thin air, NAIS, evacuation.<br />downs: blake  didn't do a great job producing, it's better with brendan obrien, not  enough guitar solos, only NAIS has a standout lead, uneven album not as  strong; maybe sleight of hand, I just find it kind of boring.<br />so not the  best from pj but certainly the best one to come out this year (nothing good  has come out actually) so it's good to see there are still true rock bands  out there, and like they say: have respect for their fans. peace
0385486804|3.0|INTO THE WILD is a confusing book with a great plot for discussing. About three plot lines are carried on at the same time, where the auther Jon Krakauer is telling his story, side charectors stories are added in for benefit, and the main plot that continues on through the entire story. The  main plot focuses on a young man, Chris McCandless, who has money and  sucess and gives it all up for a life of wandering and freedom.  While this  may be the plotline for thousands of other books, INTO THE WILD was  pleasantly (or disturbingly) twisted by Jon Krakauer into a complicated  dance of really living, and death.  Chris McCandles dies, we find that out  in the first chapter.  After we find out about his death though, the reader  gets a chance to meet the people who played a role in McCandless' search  for self.  Starting out with Jim Gallien, &quot;Gallien wondered whether  he'd picked up one of those crackppots for the lower forty-eight who come  north to live . . .&quot;  As readers, we meet a  chain of colorful charectors who help him along the way.  The problem with  this plot line is that the charectors are not always introduced in a  logical way.  They also do not necessarily make sense when they are  introduced into the story line.  Start a new chapter, such as chapter nine,  and an entirely new plot is started.  We have a new charector named Everett  Russ.  He wants to climb around a place called Davis Gulch.  The language  is beautiful in this section &quot;Tall grasses sway in the breeze.  The  ephemeral bloom of a sego lily peeks from the toe of a ninety-foot stone  arch, and the canyon wrens call back and forth in plaintive tones ..... . . .&quot;, the language is beautiful in the rest of the book. This is a very important  fact. Sometimes the eloquent language is the only thing binding a reader to  this book.  One of the most important thing about INTO THE WILD is the  ending though.  In the last 100 pages many important issues are brought up  that make the book worth reading.  1) We learn about the how starvation  affects the body  2) We hear the effects of McCandless' adventures on his  family, and how they deal with his death  3) Much moral thought is  addressed about the passions and desires of young people and 4) (the most  important :) ) we learn wild sweetpea and wild potato information.  Take my  word for it, if you have the time to really think about this book, and the  friends to read it with you to help you understand the difficult parts,  then it is a wonderful experiance with a lot of good thinking.  If you want  an easy read though, this is not the book for you.
6303481272|5.0|This movie is the greatest! It kept my intrest from begining to end. The animation has to be second to none! I have never seem so much creativity in every character in my life. Ninja Scroll is the perfect length (94  minutes). However, I dont recommend this movie to everyone. some may find  certain parts offensive or just down right gross. It is an unjustice to  only be able to give this movie a 5...it is more like a 10! If you liked  both Ninja Resurrection flims you will love Ninja Scroll! 10 stars!
0399208534|5.0|The Very Hungry Caterpillar is a beautifully illustrated, simply told story of a caterpillar who turns into a butterfly.  The caterpillar eats through everything and the book actually has holes through all the food; my  8 month old daughter is fascinated at the colours, the repetition of the  STILL hungry part and the holes that she tries to fit her fingers through.  She gets very excited as the last page draws nearer and the beautiful  butterfly is revealed.  This book is a classic; I loved it as a child and  it will continue to be loved by children twenty years from now.  A  wonderful book for children...of all ages!  This is a must have.

0385486804|3.0|INTO THE WILD is a confusing book with a great plot fordiscussing. About three plot lines are carried on at the same time,where the auther Jon Krakauer is telling his story, side charectors stories are added in for benefit, and the main plot that continues on through the entire story. The main plot focuses on a young man, Chris McCandless, who has money and sucess and gives it all up for a life of wandering and freedom.  While this may be the plotline for thousands of other books, INTO THE WILD was pleasantly (or disturbingly) twisted by Jon Krakauer into a complicated dance of really living, and death. Chris McCandles dies, we find that out in the first chapter.  After we find out about his death though, the reader gets a chance to meet the people who played a role in McCandless' search for self.  Starting out with Jim Gallien, &quot;Gallien wondered whether he'd picked up one of those crackppots for the lower forty-eight who come north to live out ill-considered Jack London fantasies.  Aslaska has long been a magnet for dreamers and misfits. . .&quot; As readers, we meet a chain of colorful charectors who help him along the way.  The problem with this plot line is that the charectors are not always introduced in a logical way.  They also do not necessarily make sense when they are introduced into the story line.  Start a new chapter, such as chapter nine, and an entirely new plot is started.  We have a new charector named Everett Russ.  He wants to climb around a place called Davis Gulch.  The language is beautiful in this section &quot;Tall grasses sway in the breeze.  The ephemeral bloom of a sego lily peeks from the toe of a ninety-foot stone arch, and the canyon wrens call back and forth in plaintive tones from a thatch of scrub oak.  High above the creek a spring seeps from the cliff face, irrigating a growth of moss and maidenhair fern. . .&quot;, the language is beautiful in the rest of the book. This is a very important fact. Sometimes the eloquent language is the only thing binding a reader to this book.  One of the most important thing about INTO THE WILD is the ending though.  In the last 100 pages many important issues are brought up that make the book worth reading.  1) We learn about the how starvation affects the body 2) We hear the effects of McCandless' adventures on his family, and how they deal with his death 3) Much moral thought is addressed about the passions and desires of young people and 4) (the most important :) ) we learn wild sweetpea and wild potato information.  Take my word for it, if you have the time to really think about this book, and the friends to read it with you to help you understand the difficult parts, then it is a wonderful experiance with a lot of good thinking. If you want an easy read though, this is not the book for you.
B00003CWL6|5.0|few movies can express such artistry and retain its mainstream appeal but american beauty seems to do it well. it is a beautifully crafted portrait of america with all of its flaws kept intact. and beyond all of the  negative aspects of our culture is points out to us it never weighs down.  it also really makes you appriciate the beauty that surrounds us that so  many of us forget. it is a gem of a film that i would recommend to anyone  who cares about the medium.
B00004RFFU|5.0|When I first saw this movie I couldnt get past the first five minutes because of the gore.Then a year or so later I forced myself to see the whole movie I was captivated . . I was actually disapointed that it  ended.The movie starts in our time, as a reporter (christian Slater)follows  Louis (Brad Pitt) to his home . From there on the story unfolds as Louis  tells his tail . He was a vampire , and was made so by Tom Cruises chareter  Lestat. Majority of the movie shows you their relatonship and Louis denial  of his situation . The story takes a turn when they both come across  Christan Dunst , a poor girl who is bitten by a hungry Louis . In ordre to  save her life Lestat makes her a vampire. The two men , both lonely treat  her liketheir daughter . It is Louis though that the girl grows a liking to  . Tom cruise is a villan in this film and prbabaly the most complex  charecter of them all. He is introduced as as an uncaring bloodthirsty  vampire but in some places you see him do things that are ever so slightly  good .We acnt blame him for Brad Pitts position for he gave him a choice.  Loui's charecter is probably the most basic charecter . He was easily  manipulated first by Tom Cruise then by Christan Dunst . I think Brad Pitt  aws probabaly the worst actor in the movie. Despite having the biggest role  he is overshadowed in all the scenes even by some of the extras.I really  loved this movie because of Tom Cruise , he was amazing!  I am not  refering to his looks but his acting and portrayal of witty Lestat.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Oops she's done it again!  The music on this CD is a lot of fun and less bubblegum like her first one.  The music is a mixture of r&amp;b, pop and techno. I like Oops I Did It Again, Stronger and Satisfaction.  It's nice to know she wants to reach out to older listeners like me. Ha! Ha!  I like  this album better than her first one.  I saw her at the MTV Studio from the  street in Times Square.  She seems sweet and takes rumors in stride.
B000002NBY|5.0|I first bought Graceland when it cane out in 1986. It opened my ears to the wonderful rhythms and sounds that South African music has to offer.  Simon brought his own inimitable skills as an observer and wordsmith to  bear and created one of the great albums of all time.<br />At the time his  mixing of western popular music and South African musical traditions seemed  to be unique.  However, if you liked Simon's work then you must also listen  to the work of Johnny Clegg and Juluka who were there years before  Simon.<br />Clegg, born in Britain, but raised in SA from his early years  broke the apartheid barriers in the 1970's by seeking out Zulu musicians  and culture - to such a degree that he became a lecturer in anthropology  specialising in Zulu culture in the late 70's before taking up a full time  career in music with his Zulu friend and mentor Sipho Mchunu.  First as a  due then as the full multiracial group Juluka, Clegg brought western music  and Zulu traditions together.<br />Clegg's music was amongst the examples Paul  Siomn listened to when he developed the Graceland concept.  Graceland  remains unique but in comparison to Clegg's work it is less a fusion, more  a welding together, with Simon's clever New Yorker lyrics sitting on top of  the South African music.<br />Clegg's work with Juluka and later with another  multiracial group Savuka broke the ground that Simon ploughed so  sucessfully and is a far more genuine fusion of two musical traditions such  that they complement each other rather than strain against each other.
0553108034|4.0|This book continues the stories of the first - and by continues, I mean in every sense of the word.  Few new characters are introduced, but those are colorful, and engaging, and the women of the stories start to come into  their own.  While Theon's characterization in this novel came as a bit of a  surprise at first, like everything else in the book, it made sense after a  while. You get the sense though, reading this, that it's mostly a set up  for the third (and possibly final) book.  The story is so engrossing  though, that you don't care. As a bonus: Sansa develops a brain.
B000001OAA|5.0|I love this album! I bought version 2.0 first and thought it was awsome but when I bought this album I knew that garbage was the best band in the world! Shirley's voice is soooo deep and I simply love it! Butch  plays  great drums and Steve and Duke play really good guitar and bass.. My fav  song on the album is &quot;Vow&quot; musically and lyricaly.All the songs  are great! BUY THIS RECORD! I can't wait for a new release by garbage!
B000002AVF|5.0|I just want to say i purchased this album 5 years ago and i still LOVE it! I think Mariahs latest albums have been let-downs. She's going WAY too r'n'b/hip-hop.
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Like fine wine, Rage seems to get better with age...their previous two albums are great, but The Battle of Los Angeles is by far their best.  I rate this as a close second to STP's NO.4 as the best rock album of 1999.  The album starts off with a bang and never lets up, each track a  guitar-laden piece of art with a message that enriches the song.  My  favorites include &quot;Guerrilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Testify&quot;,  &quot;Maria&quot;, and &quot;War Within a Breath&quot;.  &quot;Maria&quot;  is an especially poignant track, a hip-hop driven, bass-heavy groove that  bitterly satirizes the mistreatment of Mexican migrant workers. Whether you  buy into Rage's political ideology, or you just appreciate an hour's worth  of ass-kicking, teeth-rattling metal (with unbelievable lead guitar work by  Tom Morello), than you will love this album, and it will stay in your CD  player for weeks.
B000020617|5.0|Many people who like the previous Foo Fighters CD's say that this one just doesn't match up to the rest of them.  Well, this CD is definitely a lot different from the other two, but it's just as good.  Sure, the tracks may  be a bit softer.  But don't throw away the CD because of that, at least  listen to it closely a few times first.  The first time I heard &quot;Learn  to Fly&quot; and &quot;Breakout&quot;, I wasn't too impressed, but the more  I listened to them on this album, the more i liked them.  I can't count the  hundreds of times I've heard these songs, and everytime I listen I find  something more enjoyable about them. Other songs that are great include:  &quot;Stacked Actors&quot;, &quot;Gimme Stitches&quot;,  &quot;Generator&quot;, &quot;Aurora&quot;, &quot;Headwires&quot;, and  &quot;MIA&quot;.
0440180295|4.0|I chose to read &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; because I thought it was science fiction, which I enjoy most.  However, when I began reading I realized that Vonnegut used time travel and alien abduction as if it were  the regular thing, not something futuristic or high-tech.  Still, even  though the book is not true SciFi I still enjoyed it.  Billy Pilgrim, the  main charictor, was in WWII and survived the bombing of Dresden.  Later in  life he was abducted by aliens who see time in a very unusual way.  It is  &quot;structured&quot;, so that, while they can see everything happening at  the same time, they can do nothing to prevent it.  The experiences and  knowledge Billy gains from these two events are what make up the plot.  You  travel with him troughout his life to see how he learns and deals with  these and other events.     Slaughterhouse-Five is suppost to be an  anti-war book, but I do not see it as such.  Vonnegut says throughout the  book that war cannot be prevented, but instead that people should learn to  deal with it.  This is good advice that helps people cope with many events,  not just war.  Another thing that makes the book interesting is how  Vonnegut puts himself into it.  Vonnegut, like Billy, was a prisoner of war  and survived the bombing of Dresden.  The entire first and part of the last  chapter are about him and he even mentions himself in the story line.  This  allows you to see how he feels about the war and also provides wisdom from  someone who has gotton a lot out of live.   The last thing that I enjoyed  about the book was the historical information.  Before reading it I had  never heard of Dresden.  I was upset to learn that 135,000 Germans, mostly  civilians, were killed there by Allied planes, which is almost twice as  many killed in Hiroshima by the atom bomb.  This type of information seems  like something everyone should know.   This book would be good for people  who like to look at things differently.  The ideas in Slaughterhouse-Five  are strange, but could possibly help you deal with your own life.  The time  travel and aliens serve only to promote Vonnegut's view and people  considering this book should understand that it is not really science  fiction.  I do recommend this book, however, there is some vulgar language  and situations.  I could not see Slaughterhouse-Five as required reading  for school.

B000000OTU|5.0|This is one of the better greatest-hits compilations that I have listened to, and I've listened to many.  In my opinion, Steven Tyler and Joe Perry are rock's best one-two punch since Page and Plant, and I would use this  album as Exhibit A in my case to support that statement.  Unless you are a  rabid Aerosmith fan (like me), just pick up this album and save yourself  the money of buying Permanent Vacation, Pump, and Get a Grip.  Big Ones  showcases Aerosmith at their blues-rock-boogie finest, with classics like  &quot;Love in an Elevator&quot;, &quot;Janie's Got a Gun&quot;, &quot;Dude  Looks Like a Lady&quot;, and &quot;Eat the Rich&quot; leading the way.  The  previously unreleased &quot;Walk on Water&quot; is a great cut, and should  fall into your normal listening rotation.  This album is strong from start  to finish, packed full of 100% genuine American rock-n-roll, and should  defintely endear Aerosmith to any music novices who are unititated to the  band's music.  Big Ones, packaged with Aerosmith's Greatest Hits, provides  a great overview of the band's work and does a great deal to prove the fact  that Aerosmith may be American's greatest rock band of all time.
0800128052|5.0|I rented this movie in 1995 and was expecting some silly football story that we've seen numerous times over.  Instead, I saw a touching, true-life story about a young man we can all relate to.  Rudy was told he was too  small to play for Notre Dame.  He persisted and listened to his heart and  proved everyone wrong.  Sean Astin (who is an under rated actor)  beautifully portrays Rudy in probably his best performance yet.  This film  is touching, emotional, and uplifting.  A moving experience worthy of  everyone's attention.
6305807930|4.0|Anchor Bay have done the most amazing job bringing Argento's films back to his fans. Inferno is probably the best transfer I have seen so far. <br />Inferno was not as widely embraced as Argento's other films but it is a  beautiful and haunting film.  I have seen this film 10 or 15 times and each  time I find myself being absolutely fascinated.  It's a crime that there is  no director's commentary on this dvd and on Deep Red, but there is enough  quality in this DVD to keep any fan happy.  <br />Bring on the DVD release of  Suspiria!

Rarley, a soundtrack makes a movie worth  watching. This is one of those rare cases.
0060194995|5.0|I first read this wonderful novel as a teenager while waiting for the movie starring Gregory Peck to be released that same summer. Again and again over the intervening decades since have I pulled down my hard-bound  copy to read in whole or in part on a rainy afternoon because of its sheer  drawing power. In today's complex world one tends to lose perspective as to  how explosive, provocative, and sensational the issues of cross-race rape  was in the early 1960s when Miss Lee's novel was originally published. Yet  despite the sizzling if subdued sexual content and the divisive issues  surrounding the book, it quickly rose to best-seller status and easily  delivered the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for Harper Lee with this, her  first novel.<br />  It is probably the character of Atticus Finch who  deserves most of the credit for the novel's enduring popularity. Seldom has  such a quietly heroic figure been so favorably and memorably described in  such loving detail in an American novel as is fortyish Atticus Finch, the  highly principled and somewhat befuddled widower-lawyer trying his level  best to raise his two young children alone in the midst of the deep South  during the early years of the Depression. As daughter Scout remembers,  there was little that Atticus couldn't charm or talk his way out of. And,  as played by Gregory Peck in the memorable movie, this thoughtful, moral,  and courageous man became a model of modern American manhood for all who  read or watched his story unfold.<br />  Of course, the other characters  are also lovingly and carefully drawn and described, and the way in which  the importance and relevance of the mockingbird parable is sown at a number  of different levels with a number of different characters is also one of  the enduring treasures  found within the pages of this book. Whether  considering Tom Robinson, Boo Radley, Scout, Jem, or Atticus himself, we  all come to better understand the ways in which all the individuals'  stories and fate are intricately and inextricably interwoven with each  other and into the fabric of a particular time and place.<br />  Thus, we  see the degree to which Atticus  relies and depends on their black  governess, and the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well.  On the other hand, we watch as  Bob Ewell acts despicably to mistreat  people of color. There are volumes of wisdom herein regarding the treatment  of human beings and the problems associated with trying to live in any  particular place at any specific time. So well and accurately drawn are the  characters of this fable of the life and times of Scout Finch in &quot;To  Kill A Mockingbird&quot;, that one can only hope it continues to be widely  read and appreciated as a modern American classic.'  stories and fate are intricately and inextricably interwoven with each  other and into the fabric of a particular time and place. <br />      Thus, we  see the degree to which Atticus   relies and depends on their black  governess, and the degree to which he is concerned for her welfare as well.

Plenty of single choices, but if your local radio is like ours in Western Maryland, the only PJ song they'll play is &quot;Last Kiss.&quot;  Which is  OK, but enough is enough...Gems like &quot;Light Years&quot; &quot;Thin  Air&quot; &quot;Insignificance&quot; and &quot;Parting Ways&quot; should be  heard!
B00000AFFI|5.0|This is an answer to the question &quot;What albums would you have with you if you were stranded on a desert isle?&quot; It's sad, mean, beautiful and terrible. It requires many listens, and then its hypnotic, almost  narcotic dark qualities urge you to continue. This album is like listening  to the grimmest of fairy tales set to a disturbing and tragic soundtrack.
B00000J8EK|5.0|There are moments on this album where it fails. There are moments when they practically give meaning to some life. But even where it fails, we're still overcome by such breakthrough songs like &quot;music: response&quot;  and &quot;sunshine underground.&quot; It just feels right. You'll  completely feel at home. My favorite song on the album would definetly have  to be &quot;sunshine underground&quot;, a mix of emotional soft-beats with  a cutting edge mix of techno. The music here feels calm, situated, much,  much more relaxed and it completely rocks.
0684857820|5.0|In 1980, as a college freshman at Syracuse University, Alice Sebold was brutally raped as she walked home through a park one night, and the event profoundly marked her life from then on. In this powerful memoir, at times  shocking and other times humorous, Sebold recreates the event that scarred  her life in grim detail, and recalls the decision she made to find and  pursue the conviction of her attacker.  With the help of her poetry  professor Tess Gallagher and fiction prof Tobias Wolff, she was able to  identify the man who robbed her of her virginity and left her physically  and emotionally damaged, and to testify at the trial that sent him to  prison. The opening chapter, in which the author details the brutal attack  on her, left me crying, and the remaining chapters read like a gripping  suspense novel and a triumphant account of justice.  A powerful, moving  read.

6300183971|3.0|man. this is a weird movie. i admit, my disapointment is mostly my fault for hyping it up by reading all these reviews for it. it made it look like some kind of masterpiece. and though it WAS pretty good, it was no  masterpiece. some movies are cult hits because they should be. let me  briefly walk you through the DUNE experience. the first hour and a half is  hazy, confusing, goofy, boring, weird, and all-out retarded. then, the plot  starts to make sense, and you get a real feel for it, and BAM!  it starts  to suck again. the ending is lack-luster, unsuspenseful, and unexiting. i  at least expected the sting character to have a cool fight, but NOPE!   it's just predictable, unexiting, and sting really demonstrates with his  acting that he should stick to singing. so at the end of the day, dune has  some really creative traits. the worms, the ships, the idea of channelling  energy through your voice to fight, the little girl (she kicks azz!), but  it falls short on the acting, dialog, and direction. definitely worth  renting just for the weirdness (we could all use more weirdness in our  lives), but only a keeper if you've already seen it and are a confirmed  psychotic.
0790729725|5.0|As a person who sees a lot of movies I tend not to exagerate how much I actually like a film. I can say that of all the films I have actually sat through that &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is probably my absolute favorite. This  is a complete masterpiece, Scorsese's best film and undoubtedly a timeless  classic. Anyone who has seen &quot;GoodFellas&quot; will surely know what  I'm talking about. <br />What makes this film so good? For me I suppose  &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is the ultimate combination of humour and violence,  having it all and losing it all, and factual information. The casting is  absolutely flawless. &quot;GoodFellas&quot; also moves with a certain  energy which is totally uncommon in films. It is so enthralling and  completely entertaining that the first time I saw it I did not want it to  stop. <br />Although Scorsese has previously made many great masterpieces,  (Raging Bull, Taxi Driver, King of Comedy) none of them move with the same  kind of frantic pacing. &quot;GoodFellas&quot; is so aware of everything in  a criminal lifestyle that it simply continues dispensing this  surge of  information throughout its two and half hour running time. Scorsese is  fully in control and a total master of his art in this film. The camera  work is beautiful, the costumes are perfect and the soundtrack is wonderful  as well.<br />Never before have I seen a movie that gets everything so right.  Each time I watch &quot;GoodFellas&quot; I take away something new from it.  &quot;Casino&quot;, although many felt to be a retread, is actually just as  good. <br />Maybe because this is my favorite film does it sound like I am  over-praising it. Normally I am not this excited over a movie but if you  haven't seen &quot;GoodFellas&quot; yet you are really missing out.

It paints a vivid picture of the days he was writing about, and reading it is like being there for a moment.   Kerouac shows a lot about himself in the book also.  Each time I read it,  it is as vivid and as new.<br />This is a good book to read if you are looking  for what Kerouac's books are like. It's a quick read and I recommend it.

0385491026|3.0|Margaret Atwood once wrote, &quot;Sisterhood is powerful; women are always supposed to get along with each other.  It's not true any more than it is for men.&quot;  Cat's Eye is basically about jealousy and cruelty between girls, as remembered by Elaine, now an adult, who has returned to her  hometown to visit.  As Elaine is walking through the city, she remembers  scenes that are each centered on a specific theme.  Some of these topics  include victimization, cultural dislocation, power struggles and violence  against females.  Atwood's main theme explores how girls can be fiercely  competitive and very cruel.  Atwood makes it clear that girls are not made  of &quot;sugar and spice and everything nice&quot;.  In one scene,  Cordelia, the leader of the group of girls who torment Elaine, throws  Elaine's hat into an icy cold stream and orders her to fetch it, and in  turn, almost kills her.  In the end, Elaine rises above her tormentors and  becomes more socially acceptable than her so-called friends.  During her  high school years, Cordelia actually tries to befriend her, but Elaine  holds control over her now.  The last half of the book is then devoted to  her life beyond her cruel friends, and also to her guilt for not helping  Cordelia.  Although this may seem like a fun and exciting plot to some, the  intense descriptive language is actually somewhat disturbing.  Atwood  vividly describes incidences such as Elaine peeling layers of skin off her  feet and also how she feels while having sex.  I gave it three stars  because although Cat's Eye is very long and disturbing, I thought that  Atwood incorporated some surprisingly true statements that I had never  thought of before.  I was surprised at how much I related to some of these  statements, like pain keeping people in reality.  Cat's Eye is very lengthy  and at times monotonous, but I actually like it now that I've finished  reading it.
6304126344|5.0|Unlike many sequels this one lived up to the original with some added super special effects.  The characters in this film were very much more developed and the special effects did not overwhelm the story. You see that  Sara Conner has become in many ways Kyle from the first film and no longer  the naive waitress from the first film. The orginal terminator has also  developed more fully as is the character of the new liquid metal  terminator.  There is a little of everything to satisfy audiences: action,  special effects and characters.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I was not particularly impressed with Britney Spears latest offering.  The title track &quot;Oops! I did it again&quot; is an almost exact replica of &quot;Baby one more time&quot;.  In fact, you can substitute the line  &quot;I'm not that innocent&quot; with &quot;Hit me baby one more  time!&quot; without missing a beat! It lacks originality and seems to be  copying the style of the first album in order to rack up sales.  However,  applause must be given for Ms Spears's attempt to have a more mature sound  on this album.
0880381736|5.0|When I first got hold of a copy of this book, I got it from a complete stranger. He raved about it and said it was really good. I read it in the next two days. The best thing I ever read.  My only copy is all torn up and  battered because he read it so many times. so I got a new one and the rest  of the series with it.<br />This story describes the quest of a group of old  friends and some new friends as well. The main charicters, Tanis, Raistlin,  Caramon, Sturm, Flint, Tas, Goldmoon, and Riverwind travel far and wide on  the land of Krynn in order to solve the mistery of the magical staff taken  from a broken city where death flew on black wings.<br />The group of friends  encounter many interesting people on their journey, such as the  forestmaster in Darken wood, Tanis's old friend Gilthanas, and a funny old  magician named Fizban.<br />All in all I would highly recomend reading this  book if you enjoy a good adventure, as well as a few laughs.<br />   ~ ~ ~  Patty
B000002LE6|5.0|This was Prince's last great album, coming at the end of an amazing creative streak encompassing Parade, Dream Factory/Camille/Crystal Ball/Sign o' the Times, The Black Album, and this hastily realeased but  lushly brilliant substitute. At the time, it was a let-down from Sign o'  the Times, and everyone made sure to get their hands on a copy of the Black  Album boot, but in retrospect it clearly belongs to the fertile Sign  period, rather than to the decline that began with Batman.

I can tell her the story even when we don't have the book handy and the spot where the zookeeper's wife discovers  the animals always gets a laugh. Sometimes when I have a figity baby on the  changing table, I'll tell the story turning off the bathroom light when the  wife is turning off the light and saying all the animal   &quot;goodnights&quot; in the dark, and my daughter thinks it's hilarious.  Even great books can get annoying for the parent on the 100th telling, but  because there isn't much text, I can vary the story to keep it fresh. This  book is a favorite for both of us.
B00003OSSM|5.0|RANDOM HEARTS, proves to be the most well acted, directed, paced, involving picture of the year. This picture proves to be nothing but a milestone on Harrison Ford's and Kristen Scott Thomas's reputations. This  is a story about betrayal, passion, and obsession. While investigating the  truth behind his wife's affair with Kay Chandler's lawyer husband, Dutch  forms a relationship between Chandler that is something more... something  great... something all to rare. Harrison Ford is great as an obsessed truth  seeker, and Kristen Scott Thomas is wonderful providing a character that  straightens out Dutch, showing him truth... happiness... but most of all...  love.  The only thing that is wrong about this movie is the stupid and  distracting subplot about a corrupt cop. RANDOM HEARTS.
B00000IOSU|5.0|&quot;Mirrorball&quot; is a CD, NO one should live without.  It's soulful, emotional, spiritual, classic and inspiring to listen too.  Sarah has one (if not the best) voices of the last 10 years.  She's unbelievable.  And,  this CD brings all the things that are remarkable about her, to the fans.   This collection of live performances show her range and talent as no other  CD can.  There are no bad tracks on the whole CD.  Each song is worth the  price of the CD alone.  No one should pass up on this one.  It's one of the  best CD's ever.
0061002747|2.0|the beginning of the book is boring until you get to the middle were it gets a better but not much the ending wasn't as clever as Agatha Christie is known for but the alibi's for all the characters are cool. the  detectiveHercule Poirot isn't close to being as good as Sherlock Holmes.  This is a letdown compared to &quot;And then there were none&quot; but  agatha is still cool but if i was you i wouldn't read this instead of  reading stuff by Bernard Cornwell or other books by The Queen of  Crime!
0399143904|5.0|T. Clancy has been dissed for writing in too much detail. But in Rainbow Six, he has seemingly found a fine balance: He has been able to avoid too much technical minutae which led me to skip whole sections of other books (like The Sum of All Our Fears). At the same time, he has still included enough information to give the feel of authenticity. This combination makes for a very informative and still entertaining book. This cannot be read in a day, or on one plane trip. But it is great to take on a vacation, when one has several hours over several days to devote to it.<br />The story has been discussed above. Suffice it to say that Clancy has put together a string of plausible ideas (save perchance the eco-terrorists overall grand design). Unfortunately, we are so used to terrorism these days that each of the other terrorists acts are things we have come to expect on the evening news.<br />Like another reviewer, I find Domingo Chavez and John Clark to be a couple of engaging recurring characters. I wonder what will happen to them next, and worry that like John Ryan, they may get to the place where there is nothing left for them to conquer. We ain't there yet, though, and like thousands of others, I anxiously await their next adventure.
B00004T8RK|2.0|I've purchased most of the Pearl Jam catalog, and I've got to say this one is a disappointment.  There are some good songs here, but there are also some that just aren't interesting enough to keep me away from my CD  player's skip button.  They just seem so wrapped up in making artistic and  meaningful songs that they're missing the fact that they aren't any FUN.   There's nothing wrong with being deep, but sometimes you need to break a  sweat and jump around a little.  Too many of these songs lie there like a  beached sea creature.
B000000I0D|4.0|Of course, Mike Oldfield is probably best known for the long-form works he pioneered in the 1970s, beginning with &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. And on here, half or so of this release is taken up with one such work, the title  track &quot;Crises&quot;. Instrumentally, this piece recaptures the musical  drama that was the spark in those earlier long works, but...sigh...I find  myself wishing that the vocal here wasn't present. The music is so powerful  and evocative that it really proves more of a distraction. The second half  of this contains some of Oldfield's shorter songs. &quot;In High  Places&quot; and &quot;Foreign Affair&quot; are interesting, mantra-like  pieces, with vocals from Jon Anderson and Maggie Reilly respectively. And  &quot;Taurus 3&quot; is a short guitar and flamenco-stomp workout that  hearkens back to Oldfield's &quot;QE2&quot; release. But &quot;Shadow on  the Wall&quot; is...oh, I hate this track. I'll admit it. The vocal is in a  very dated-sounding and overwrought late-prog style that really grates, and  the piece overall just sounds weak to me. But that's the sole clinker here.  Still, it's not the real back-to-form release; that would come later on, as  Oldfield would revisit his old &quot;Tubular&quot; turf on &quot;Tubular  Bells 2&quot;, and then follow this with the amazing and beautiful  &quot;The Songs of Distant Earth&quot;. I'd rank either of those over this  one, and also &quot;QE2&quot;, &quot;Incantations&quot;,  &quot;Ommadawn&quot;, and of course, &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. But this is  one to get after those, to be sure.
6305075492|5.0|This is an incredible film! For many years I was under the impression that silent films were all jerky, funny looking and boring. Then I saw Fritz Lang's Metropolis and all that changed. I was introduced to the world of  the German Impressionist film...and this is the Granddaddy of them all. A  great transfer of the film to start helps in viewing. A lot of the problems  with the old silent films are that the light levels keep fluctuating. But  when a company takes the time and expense to clean up and restore a film  the results are wonderful. The film is color tinted. (Not colored ...it's  like the siepa opening to the Wizard of Oz kind of thing) to make the  contrast level pop. The tiles are very cool to look at, as they were  recreations of the originals used. The commentary track is extra  interesting to point out the wonderful bits that can be over looked by the  average Joe. (Like the reasons some sets have angles and some have curves,  The light patterns following the footpaths..etc..) A wonderful piece of  filmmaking is a must for all film buffs to see the origins of a bunch of  toady's more artistic shots in cinema.
0780622545|5.0|If you haven't seen dark city. The best piece of advice I could give you, was given to me before I viewed this movie--KEEP THE VOLUME ON THIS MOVIE TURNED DOWN UNTIL YOU SEE THE BATHTUB. The strength of this movie is not  knowing what's going on. The beginning of the movie presents you with a  narration by Kiefer Sutherland's character that explains everything, a very  poor choice. The movie is creepier and the suspense continues to build when  you are like the protagonist and just don't know what's going on. And  contrary to some of the buzz, Dark City is not a Matrix knock-off. It is a  great movie, and destined to be a cult classic.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Sorry to dissapoint the Amazon reviewer, Ms. Turman, but this album is great. And yes, there isn't an &quot;ALIVE&quot;  or &quot;better man&quot;  on this album because those songs have already been made on other albums.   That is why Pearl Jam doesn't want to be in the limelight, because critics  dis their music and constantly compare it to what they've done in the past.  The band does not care what these critics think.  Each Pearl Jam album has  its own unique sound and feel to it.  If you are a true Pearl Jam fan, and  a fan of timeless rock music then get this album.  Pearl Jam makes music  that is good.  They don't make music &quot;to be popular,&quot; and they  don't care if their album is the top selling because  they have already  been there and done that.  The real fans of their music &quot;got on the  bandwagon&quot; (so to speak) when Ten came out, along with the fairweather  fans.  The only difference is the fairweather fans got off an album or two  later.  Pearl Jam rocks and this album is great.  It is unique and I liked  it very much.
B000002KLP|5.0|&quot;Dirty Mind&quot; in my opinion is the greatest Prince album ever. With a mixture of funk, r&amp;b, soul, sexuality and glitter, it represents the best of post 70's music. My only complaint is I wish it were somewhat  longer, maybe 15 minutes to and hour. But other than that... it RULES!
B00003CWN2|5.0|I grew up in Falls City (where the real events took place).  I read the book &quot;Everything She Wanted&quot; by Aphrodite Jones (which is about Brandon Teena's story.  Very gripping book, I couldn't put it down!  I can  relate to the fear that Brandon had there (for my own reasons).  The movie  was gripping because I knew some of the people in the story.  I didn't know  Brandon.  When I was a child, I used to play with Lana's sister, she was a  good friend of mine.  My mother was good friends with Tom Nissen's mother  for years.  I know of all the people, even if I didn't know them  personally.  It is sad what ended up happening.  Despite all the bad  reviews about that town though, (other than a few bad incidents)I had the  best childhood there! <br />I know  life was confusing, but I hope  Brandon/Teena rests in PEACE!  God Bless!
B00002Z88D|5.0|Wanderful concert, great album!  Such mixture of two completely different music worlds turning out so well was a nice surprise. Both the S-people and the M-guys worked so good together - a harmony of sounds. The song choice  is right too (I only missed The Unforgiven). A thing to enjoy for a long,  long time... forever!
0684857219|3.0|The book describles the individual bodypart exercise in details.Very outstanding! It includes the chapter of bodybuilding history, which is quite interesting.       But majority of the information in the book is not based on scientific and the suggested training programs is too intense. He  suggested that advanced trainees train each bodypart 3 times per week  .However, this is too intense and easily  cause overtaining. For advanced  trainees, training each bodypart twice or even once per week is enough to  stimulate maximum hypertrophy.         Anyway, the part of individual  bodypart exercise is so valuable that the book is still good reference in  your own library. ....
B00000J6AG|2.0|This is one of the most boring albums I've ever heard.  I've read some of the reviews, and this is not even close to techno/trance/electronica.  Not only that, but most of the album wasn't even done by Moby.  It's old  recycled stuff with a bassline and drum beats spliced in.  It does have its  redeeming songs like Porcelain, Natural Blues, and the radio-friendly,  Bodyrock, but on the whole, this is NOT the album its been hyped up to be.
B000002MG1|4.0|Take a look at the sailors fighting in the dance hall. Oh my - look at them doggies bark! It's important in this case that they're my dogs, not anybody else's - mine. You can't say fairer than that, and when my dogs are  barking there's no stoppin' them now, they're on the move, on the rise, the  dogs will rise up from the land. Dogs do not go to heaven - they go to  Berlin, the portal to the underworld, where Kennedy himself declared his  allegiance with the underworld, with the land, and where he promised to the  world that he was one with the land, and that he would rise again, rise  again to make order where there is disorder, with his dogs - a fleet, a  veritable army of wolves, and when the ice comes, and the snows don't stop,  and the sun goes behind a cloud and never comes back out, Kennedy will  stand, wolves at his side, with Jimmy Carter and James Stewart as his  deputies. Where is my place in all this? I don't know - I'm just the  observer. I can see it coming. The world will hold its breath and wait for  the outcome. Against them, who can stand? Kennedy - the voice of youth;  Carter - the voice of strength, of raw animal power; Stewart - the voice of  bad dental work, of mushy sentiment and a kind of drawling  slurpiness.<br />George Raft.<br />A nuclear error. I have no fear. London is  drowning, and Kennedy, Carter and Stewart will rise from the dead to lead  an army of wolves against the forces of darkness. Can't say fairer than  that.<br />But enough of this. You want to know about Captain Beefheart. And  his Magic Band. And 'Trout Mask Replica'. Facts first. It's an album of  music containing 23 songs. There are avant-jazz with free-association  lyrics. Enough of the art. Let's get down to the nitty-gritty, the  Scritti-Politti, which is Spanish for 'political writing', something I  always found hard to reconcile with the group, we were just one person with  a floppy hat who sang boring ballads and stuff. Reminded me a bit of  'Steely Dan', only less hateably bland. The nitty-gritty. Then. In  particular, the crucial frequency range between 18,000hz and 18,250hz, the  so-called 'sweet spot' where the higher harmonics of Alpha waves resonate  in pleasing ways. Most modern albums have flustered brigades dancing  mightily in that rarefied spot on the edge of human hearing, although the  limits of vinyl mean that the pre-digital is a wasteland of uselessness.  'Trout Mask Replica', recorded in 1970, exhibits a few random sputtings in  the 'sweet spot', due no doubt to the encoding process, but there is no  order, and thus the album is pointless. Shame. The actual music itself is  fine, but without an alpha channel there's no point listening to it.<br />Next  week I plan to review the range from 20 to 22.25hz present in the  currently-available CD presentations of The Who's 'Who's Next'. After that  I shall review The Shamen's 'Boss Drum' by listening to the left stereo  channel of The Human League's 'Travelogue' whilst telephoning the speaking  clock. Wish me luck.
B00004T8RK|5.0|On hearing Binaural for the first time, I was prepared to give it the title of 'best ever' for Pearl Jam.  Not so sure on that now, but this is at least the equal of anything they have done.  &quot;Breakerfall&quot;,  &quot;God's Dice&quot; and &quot;Grievance&quot; are hard hitting rock  tunes, carrying on from &quot;Evolution&quot;, &quot;Spin the Black  Circle&quot; from years gone by.  &quot;Light Years&quot; is a beautiful  song and &quot;Evacuation&quot; has every chance of becoming the catchy  tune of the CD. It falls away slightly with &quot;Sleight of Hand&quot;, a  meandering 3 star track, but the rest is top notch.  Matt Cameron (ex  Soundgarden drummer) has not only influenced the drumming, but the whole  music sounds very much like Soundgarden in parts.  Overall this is a  fantastic CD, with a great little ditty at the end - Eddie's ukelele sounds  great!  And just think how good some of these songs are going to sound live  - the first three in particular.  Can't wait for the tour!
6305263248|4.0|Odd film. Twenty years ago it would have been unremarkable, but nowadays it's almost unique - a straight-faced, serious, 'thick-ear' cold-war thriller, played like a cross between John Le Carre and Alistair McClean,  but not quite as good as either. Everything looks grim and gritty, and  despite the post-cold war setting there isn't any post-modern irony here,  it's square jaws all the way.<br />A top-notch cast make it what it is,  although it's not really a film about people - it's a film about action and  intrigue, but mostly action. Despite the odd way in which the main  characters can commit mayhem in public without anybody seeming to notice,  the gun-fights seem realistic - brutal, confused affairs - and the two car  chases (featuring an array of exotic European saloons, even a Citroen XM),  and in particular the second, are stunning, draining, and exciting.<br />(Not  many films have Robert DeNiro and Jean Reno pootling about Europe in a  stolen Volkswagen Golf, come to think of it.)<br />Ultimately though, it goes  on too long. The film doesn't seem to care much for the plot, and in the  end it all seems strangely forgettable - it goes in one ear, and comes out  the other easily enough, but you probably won't remember it much in a month  or so.<br />Watch out for some of the ugliest 'heavies' ever committed to  film, too.
B0000028RR|5.0|This album gets a 110% definatley one of the best albums I own (out of about 300). This is their best album by far so your best off getting this one first, everything on this album makes it perfect from the inovative  guitar by tom to the lyrics by zack
B00003CWQ2|5.0|A fascinating, stylish and incredibly brave film that has touched a nerve amongst a generation brought up to work in useless jobs for 12 hours a day, this film is great if, like me, you've ever wanted to just smash something,  anything, into a million pieces and laugh at the mess.<br />It's not just  about fighting, though - it's a dark comedy of contemporary society, filmed  in a dazzling, incredible style, and acted with panache by a series of  people who portray ennui compellingly. Edward Norton is fantastic -  half-dead, zombie-like, wandering through the film without any recognisable  personality, he's nonetheless compellingly cynical and world-weary,  especially in the few moments of office-bound, repressed rage he allows  himself. Both Brad Pitt and Meat Loaf (Meat Loaf!) are excellent too - Mr  Loaf being the only likeable character of the lot.<br />These players move and  talk through a strange tale of a rebellious underclass, terrorism and soap,  culminating in an ending which, if not in the mind of the protagonist, is  the most astonishing ending to be at the end of a modern Hollywood  film.<br />The music is great, too - the Dust Brothers do the spartan score,  which veers from stomping techno to soul and back again.<br />Like it or not,  this film will stick in your mind.
B00003RQNJ|4.0|Love this movies for a long time, just got a DVD. It's in THX but MONO sound, unfortunately, because the original picture was mono. Picture sharpness is much better that the VHS version I had. I like the scence  index the most, it contain the moving pictures instead of the oridinary  picture of that scene, quite a technology. <br />Star interviews (1993) is  quite boring, however the making of Buch Cassidy (45 min.) is very  good.<br />Subtitle is too bold and big, reduce space of the scence. I also  like it's strong pastic case.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|David Bowie once sang that he was happy, and that he hoped we were happy too. Although, technically, David was actually singing in the character of Major Tom. Or was he? It's that kind of weird messing-about with personas  that made David Bowie so great, and it's a shame that he went all boring  just about the time of 'Let's Dance'.<br />Anyway, I am reminded of the video  for 'Ashes to Ashes', in which Steve Strange and other to-be New Romantics  gestured significantly on a solarized, false-colour beach. The sky was  black - a portent of the nuclear dawn to come, the age of 'Threads' and  'Rambo'?<br />Pigeons. They dwell on roofs. It's strange that we say 'hooves'  and not 'hoofs'. Or 'blinded' but not 'binded'. Well, actually, I suppose  some people can say 'binded'. Whatever. Rooves? Why do they live there?  Presumably because the air is slightly thinner, and they want to experience  the thrill of flight without the physical effort that leads to them having  to eat twenty-five times their body-mass every five minutes.<br />What did  they do before there were people to build houses? Well, I suppose the  houses were originally made of trees, and they lived in the trees, until  they were cut down. I envisage the early house as being shorter than the  trees, but then again, for some reason I am envisaging the plains of  Africa. One too many television documentaries, I expect. I see elephants,  hippos, and white-painted jeeps driving about the Serengetti. I don't see  any pigeons, though. Must be the heat. Yeah, the heat.
B00001ZULV|5.0|I jut read a review saying that Genesis with Peter Gabriel was &quot;inferior music with an annoying sound&quot;, this is an insult, I have no words for his comments, just that people with a little bit of music  knowledge know that Genesis with Gabriel has been one of the most  influential bands in Progressive Rock, without living behind PFM, Emerson  Lake and Palmer and many others. I am a great fan of Phil Collins and  Genesis with Phil as lead vocals, but Genesis with Gabriel really  influenced a lot of musicians and songwritters with their music, it was a  musical revolution. Whoever dares to critize Genesis on the Peter Gabriel  era just demonstrates a lack of knowledge in the modern rock era. I am  sorry, but it is unacceptable.....
0780624890|5.0|A fantastic horror/action b-movie, this wrings some excellent performances and effects from a fairly moderate budget, and it's interesting to compare this with the similar 'Spawn', a film it trounces in every possible way.  It's a modern-day 'Highlander', or 'Terminator', in that it snuck out  without much fanfare and pleasantly surprised a lot of people.<br />Opening  with a stunning, John Woo-esque sword-fight against the legions of the  undead, it slows down a bit after than (as all 'origin stories' tend to  do), until the last third, which is more-or-less constant  action.<br />Everything about it is hyper-real in a comic-book-style, and it  works by not taking itself too seriously. The cast is fantastic - Kris  Kristofferson is the definition of grizzled, and Wesley Snipes (as a  character called Eric!) is the definition of cool, whether dispatching  vampires with a grin, driving around in a big evil-looking muscle car, or  just striding about in body-armour (which he never seems to take off -  presumably making simple household tasks unduly hard).<br />It gets along on  sheer style, and after seeing it for the first time, I wanted to see it  again.<br />The DVD is great - picture and sound are top, and there's an  alternative ending, and lots of extra stuff, none of which you will look at  twice, but it's nice to have and adds value. For a long time in the UK this  was one of two decent DVD releases (the other being 'Das Boot'), and is  therefore something of a benchmark.
B00003CWPR|5.0|Do you know why?  Because Eyes Wide Shut epitomizes Kubrick's filmmaking style.  It is the culmination of everything he previously innovated and tested on his earlier movies.  It's the definitive Kubrick movie.  If you  love 2001, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon, The Shining, Full Metal  Jacket, then how can you all of a sudden say you don't like Eyes Wide Shut?   That's like changing your mind in mid-sentence, like saying &quot;I like  apples no I don't like apples.&quot;  If your one of those people then  maybe you never really understood why you liked Kubrick's earlier work, or  never understood his style but felt obligated to like it because it's  classic cinema.  Face it.  You don't understand Kubrick if you don't like  Eyes Wide Shut
6304712499|1.0|Absolutely the worst film I have ever seen at a cinema, this opened in the UK a week after 'Batman and Robin' and damaged my faith in motion pictures irrevocably.<br />Looking back, the only good thing I can remember is the  opening credits sequence, and then only for the interesting collaboration  of Orbital and Metallica. Apart from that, and an attractive visual style,  this film is awful, and I hate it in so many ways.<br />As a translation of  the comic book, it's terrible, missing the atmosphere completely. It's  closer to the dreadful Marvel adaptations ('The Punisher', 'Swamp Thing'  and so on), it pulls its punches, the script is awful, and it doesn't even  have a single decent action sequence. The acting is uniformly dreadful, you  feel sorry for poor old Martin Sheen, the effects are cheap-looking and  very, very bad (the final computer-generated monster seems to use a model  from 'Men in Black', whilst the evocation of Satan and Hell will have you  laughing out loud - it looks worse than the average computer game FMV intro  sequence) and I'm just going to stop here before I start ranting about  this. I seriously considered walking out, although I couldn't as there were  people in the way.<br />Buy several copies of this DVD, and then burn them.  You'll be happier, believe me.<br />Compare this with 'Blade' for how it  should be done - on a similarly low budget, and a similar mileu 'Blade' is  fantastic, whereas 'Spawn' is awful.
B000002H72|5.0|OK, everyone else has said it so let me reiterate it. The Pixies are the most important rock band of the eighties. They've never made a mediocre or even less than great recording, and this is truly one of their best. I saw  the Pixies for the first time on this tour (with Bob Mould of `Husker Du'  and John Doe of `X'-- what a killer show!) and I was hooked. Every song on  this record is good. If I were exiled to a desert island and could only  take 10 albums...this would definitely be on of them.<br />I could give you the  clich&eacute; rock review where I use a litany of adjectives to describe the music  and then tell you who they sound like--but they don't sound like  anybody...except the Pixies. This is one of the few genuinely original rock  bands of that decade.<br />Though I've written this review for the `Doolittle'  album, it could just as well apply for every Pixies recording made. You  can't go wrong with any of them.  The Pixies are just visceral, hard  driving, amazing rock'n'roll at it's best (see! I couldn't leave well  enough alone...I had to end with the litany of adjectives!).
0152465030|5.0|I am French, and very glad to read that so many American people do apreciate this book.  But please, don't be so American, don't write tons of sentences about it. The only words that could describe it are : a delicate  alchemy between drawings, poetry and philosophy. That's enough... Now, you  can just read it again and again.
B00004RFFM|4.0|MAgnific !  renny Harlin did a fantastic action movie. The &quot;bad guys&quot; used were sharks, but this isn't the main factor: the fact is that this is a great action film!  Thomas Jane is fantastic as the  &quot;action-hero&quot; and if he keeps picking up his scripts with care  from now on he can really turn into an action movie-star. Jackson is  stunning, totally convincing, as an investiment rich man, even being in a  short appearance. Some special effects are not so good, but in general they  are. In the opening sequence, harlin gives somekind of tribute to  &quot;JAWS&quot;, mking it clear that he doesn't want to copy anything from  that classic. I have only 2 complains: 1) Who the hell cast Saffrom Burrows  for the main female role? She's awful, no acting at all, it seems like a  robot; 2) The movie ends and I still don't know how one of the first sharks  (shown in the opening sequence) escaped the complex, to be captured again  by Jane's character (Carter)
B00001QEBQ|5.0|HI.  I like this movie because a lot of times I feel like Mulan. I just wish I had her guts!  I like this movie because of the cool songs, and the fun charictures like Mushoo....(or however ya want to  spell his name.) I  just like this kinda movie. I  got it for my 14th birthday from my dad and  mom.  And when I can I watch it. Of course I drive my  brother nuts with  singing all the kewl songs. Because they'll get stuck in HIS head and I  would  be walkin' past him and he'd be singin them. But this is defenently  one of my most favorite movies. And you'd miss out if you didn't get it,  and watch it. So see ya around!
B00000IPAX|5.0|To all concerned parents out there who restrict their children from explicit CD's, you're in for a big suprise here.  Normally I think that these artists can think of more creative lyrics to sing.  One day my son  borrow this CD from a friend.  After I listened to the entire CD, I allowed  my ten-year-old son to buy it.  What looks like a vulgar album on the  cover, comes a clean CD that I  approve of for my entire family.  &quot;All  the Small Things&quot; is the most explicit song on this disc.  However,  radio stations across America still feel confident enough to play the song  uncensored.  After all, they say an explitory only three time(which is  pretty good, compared to other alternative bands like that awful Limp  Bizkit).  Parents out there, this album is fine.  Thank you so much Blink  182 for publishing such a good album with clean content!

B000001EAQ|3.0|When I heard that POP was a &quot;techno&quot; album I really wasn't sure whether I wanted to buy, but anyway I gave it a try. And it turned out to be a decent listening experience, even though it doesn't come near to  Achtung Baby and Joshua Tree. &quot;MOFO&quot; is my favourite, no matter  how strange that sounds, I really like that song. &quot;Staring at the  Sun&quot; is also great.
B000002BBY|4.0|This album is probably there best. With songs like Champagne Supernova and Morning Glory as the stand out tracks. But I do not like that they are so pompous. They think they were the best band of the ninties and there albums  were the best. They are a talented group but there pompous attitude needs  to stop.
B0000019HU|5.0|A minimalist sound. A whisper like a dream. A haunting guitar. Throbbing rythms. Spiderland is meant to be listened to by cold nights, when reality becomes uncertain. &quot;wash yourself in your tears... and build your  church... on the strength of your faith...&quot;
B000020617|5.0|who thought the FOO could get any better?  i sure didn't, and i was dead wrong.  when u listen to songs like &quot;february stars&quot; and &quot;new way home&quot; from &quot;colour&quot;, u think they're at the  top.  Their third and latest album is extraordinary.  I have heard nothing  better in a long time.  For a while after the second album was released i  had continued to deem the first album the better of the 2, strongly in part  of its originality and &quot;non-mainstream&quot; sort of sound.  but that  argument was laid to rest w/the release of this album.  each song,  beginning to end, is priceless, with emphasis on &quot;generator&quot;,  &quot;aurora&quot;, and &quot;headwires&quot;.  Dave and the FOO have  reached a new level of creativity and have continued their streak of  blowing me away to 3 for 3.  BUY THIS ALBUM, before u buy ANYTHING else!
B00004STPT|5.0|This is a beautiful piece of work by both Zimmer and Gerrard, two artists I admire for their often emotional pieces that border on Wagner-effects. The score often contrasted the physical violence by adding emotional depth.  Also, it has the right feel for the period, a sort of Eastern flavor at  times.  Moody, dark, atmospheric, and emotional, this soundtrack is a sure  winner.
B000002KHY|5.0|The songs on this cd are gentle and comforting. The voice is not trying to defy or threaten. The folk base to James Taylor music is American in the Grant Wood sensibility.&quot;Fire and Rain&quot; is a rather beautiful song  that still can give the listener a sad eye and a shiver.&quot;Steam  Roller&quot; never did much for me, but it's small potatos in a cd with  this much good honest music!You've Got a Friend&quot; get's it's definitive  reading here(along with it's writer!) &quot;Something in the Way she  Moves&quot; is an eloquent moving folk rock statement.&quot;Sweet Baby  James&quot; is just plain honey for the bee.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Some bands get to be boring and they try to release songs and CD's that sound the same year after year. Pearl Jam is one of those bands that started in a trend but they sure do not follow them. Binaural is a great  gift from Pearl Jam to It's fans. Although the tracks could have been  numbered alittle differnt to help the CD flow better as a whole this is one  of Pearl Jam's best CD's. It is totally amazing how much there music has  grown over the years. Light Years and Thin Air prove to be some of the best  songs Pearl Jam has ever done. This is a truley amazing CD and I suggest  all people that love music in general should go out and pick it up.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Do you remember all of the great alternative bands that appeared during the early nineties?  Have you noticed that out of all of them the only one that's still around is Pearl Jam?  The reason for this is because none of  those bands have managed to do what Pearl Jam has done, keep coming out  with really great music.  Binaural is another fantastic addition to the  Pearl Jam library. This record is a powerhouse from the very beginning.  Songs like Evacuation, Insignifigance, and Grievance show that the boys can  still rock.  Pearl Jam's soft side is also wonderfully displayed in Nothing  As It Seems, Soon Forget, and the aurally beautiful Light Years.  One great  boon to this album is the addition of Matt Cameron (formerly of  Soundgarden)on the drums who not only plays extremely tight rhythms, but  also wrote the music for Evacuation, one of the album's highlights.  All of  this is put together by talented producer Tchad Blake (who has also worked  with Soul Coughing).  Run out and buy this one kiddies.
B000002GK1|5.0|This is a classic masterpiece of heavy rock/metal. From their earlier great indy records, SOUNDGARDEN was building to this crescendo. For me, side 1 is the best I've heard in years (and I stand by that today too). You  CANNOT go wrong with this disc!  Slaves&amp;Bulldozers is so powerful it  induces goosebumps! Unfortuately ever since Chris Cornell cut his hair I  thought the quality of the band's music dropped-still good but not like  this effort (much like METALLICA's much discussed trip toFloyd the barber).  Hard rock must have a Samson-esque curse on it.

B00004SCX6|4.0|The title track is peppy and infectious.  Where Are You Now, Stronger, When Your Eye's Say It and Dear Diary are all interesting and easy to listen to.  I was disappointed in her version of (I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction.  Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know is inferior to the other  songs on the album and drops my rating to 4 stars.  With the exception of  that song, I'm glad I bought the CD.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Wow, I knew that this album was going to be good but it's much better than I had hoped!  You can certainly tell that Britney has grown not only as a person but as an artist!  It's just a good all around cd. I am certainly  glad that I bought it...you should too if you haven't already!
B00004T8RK|5.0|I have bought every album of PJs the day they came out (with the exception of ten, of course).  They have yet to let me down...but that is not true to other fans.  Every album has had instant praise as well as instant  backlash.  This album proves to have the same exact initial fan/critic  response.<br />Don't listen to us, the mixed fans.  Where I praise certain  songs, others will say it is the worst stuff PJ has ever done.  It happened  with Vs, it happened with Vitalogy, it happened with No Code, and it  happened with Yield. <br />Did you like Yield and No Code?  Well, this CD is  probably for you then.  It's the next step, in my mind, in their  ever-advancing and maturing musical career.<br />Don't expect to fall head  over heels in love with this album after your first listen.  There are many  layers in each song that you don't notice right away.  It's hard to  explain.<br />All I can say is this:  If you didn't like the direction they  were hading with the last two albums, stop now.  You won't like this.<br />If  you like their new(er) stuff, go buy/borrow Binaural.  Find yourself a  great pair of headphones and just let the cd play from start to finish.  If  you don't like the CD, well, maybe the new PJ is not the band for you.
B00004C4L6|2.0|If you're familiar with Tangerine Dream only as a synthesiser group, specialising in &quot;New Age Ambient&quot; music (as many people think of them), then &quot;Electronic Meditation&quot; will come as something of a  shock. This was the embryonic Tangerine Dream's first record release,  recorded in October 1969, a couple of years before even the name Tangerine  Dream had been heard outside of Germany.<br />Bear in mind that 1969 was only  five years or so after Robert Moog and David Buchla almost simultaneously  released the world's first commercial electronic music synthesisers: such  instruments were still rare, expensive, and of fairly limited capabilities  back then, and the 'electronic' of the title refers not to the use of any  such instrument, but rather to the treatments applied to the sound produced  from the standard acoustical instruments--guitars and piano (Edgar Froese),  cello and violin (Conrad Schnitzler) and drum-kit and metal sticks (Klaus  Schulze)--and the use of Farfisa organ. The music itself is difficult to  describe unless you're already familiar with the cult experimental  free-form rock that was prevalent across continental Europe (especially  Germany) in the late 60s. If you imagine three guys hammering and scraping  away and generally torturing their instruments, often with little or no  seeming regard for what their fellow group members are doing at the time,  then you'll have a pretty fair idea! But don't let that put you off: this  is important music which at one time had a huge cult following and it  deserves to be heard still. And, who knows, you may even discover that you  like it! <br />Be warned, however, that this disc runs for fewer than 35  minutes. (Hence the paucity of stars!) And it was recorded 'live' in an old  warehouse, using less than the highest of fi recording gear, so it has a  much lower dynamic range than we're used to hearing these days, and in  parts sounds positively muddy. Which was probably intended...  Youshould  also be aware that there is three disc boxed set of early TD releases which  includes this album, together with &quot;Alpha Centauri&quot; and  &quot;Zeit&quot;, which-if you can find a copy-is great value.<br />  Incidentally, if you do find you like it and want to hear more like it,  then you should definitely check out the other early Tangerine Dream  albums, &quot;Atem&quot;, &quot;Zeit&quot; and &quot;Green Desert&quot;, as  well as the early musics of Klaus Schulze and other experimental groups of  the time, like Amon Dhul and Cosmic Jokers. Or you may prefer to explore  the more up-to-date approach to experimental electronic music-making, by  investigating the many treasures available from Centaur Records and the  Consortium to Distribute Computer Music releases, or the electroacoustic  masterpieces on offer from Diffusion i Media...
B00004SCX6|3.0|Yes!  I promise that there are really only two songs on this album--one fast and one slow.  The fast ones all sound like &quot;Ooops&quot; which really just sounds like &quot;Hit me.&quot;  The slow ones all sound the  same, but I wouldn't even bother listening to them.  Half the tracks have  TALKING in them.  I didn't buy this album to listen to talking.  I still  gave this album 3 stars because it is what it is -- teen pop, and one can  really only expect so much from teen pop.  I wanted to give it 2.5 stars  because it's just average, but I was generous (and Amazon doesn't allow  half stars).  Her first album was better, by the way.  If you're going to  buy a teen pop album, buy the new 'Nsync one or Britney's first album.  To  her credit she didn't try to take herself too seriously like the BSB did on  their second album.
B000005J56|5.0|This album is phenomenal!  It's a shame that an era of music like this can be allowed to fade away.  If you like Latin music that is pure and raw, unscathed by modern technolohy, you must add this to your collection!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Well yet again Britney Spears rocks the world with a great album. This is truly a best buy. There is no song that you don't bob your head to. A nice mixtue of slow and fast songs. The music is great and so are the lyrics. It  sounds a lot like her first album. When you first hear it you're like  &quot;Its good&quot; but a couple of listens later you're like &quot;Its my  favorite album&quot;. My favorite song is her current single,Oops... I did  it agin. But not far behind are songs like Satisfaction, Don't let me be  the last to know, and Lucky. Well,I have to go so let me leave you with  this last thought, If you're going to buy one album this year Britney  should be the one.
B000002572|5.0|This is one of those albums that sounds like it was engineered in the 90's. Of course those tokin days are long gone for me, but this album takes me back to all of the fun days in the sun. Every track is great and there is no reason to touch the stereo except to turn the volume up.
B0000024IE|5.0|public enemy are and always will be the greatest rap force ever! i myself hate rap but when it comes to chuck d/flavor flav i can't help but to listen to their positive messages that actually say something. they're not  all about selling hit singles/shooting others/flashing their cash in  videos/talking about hoes! public enemy have a message that some punk bands  can equal! their words speak of politics and what wrong with society! a rap  version of the clash. so all these little kiddies out there can have their  one hit wonders with dmx/master p/puff daddy! public enemy is a huge middle  finger to all that. public enemy is real! no matter what race you are  public enemy is speaking to everyone!
B000001ESP|5.0|I have had 3 copies of this album two worn out and one played very little, 4 cassettes, and 3 cd's (one original, one gold and now this new one) I do not say this lightly- this is one of the finest recordings ever made.  These three guys are the best at what they do.  Just stick it in the player  and put the headphones on........and take a ride with Tom Sawyer, a  futuristic city, a witch hunt, life on a lighted stage and all in a  priceless ferrari.
B00004SCX6|5.0|BRITNEY'S NEW ALBUM &quot;OOPS I DID IT AGIAN&quot;IS WAY BETTER THEN HER LAST ALBUM.MY FAVE TRACKS ARE &quot;LUCKY&quot;,&quot;WHAT U SEE IS WHAT U GET&quot;,AND DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW&quot;.I DID NOT KNOW BRITNEY HAD A VOICE IN THE SONG &quot;WHERE ARE YOU NOW&quot;.AND OF COURSE YOU  HAVE TO LOVE &quot;OOPS..I DID IT AGIAN&quot;.BRITNEY IS NOW THE BEST!
B00004ST9P|4.0|This video is ok.  I am a really deep fan of Whitney. I have alot of her items, but where are all the other videos? Like, Run to You, I Have Nothing, Exhale, I Believe in You and Me, I'm Every Woman, Why Does It Hurt So Bad. And the other videos not on the greatest hits cd, like, My Name is  not Susan, Miracle, Count on Me, the real One Moment in Time video, and  maybe others.  I know that these videos were made, because i seen them a  while back.  i think it's time to complain to ARISTA, because these  videos should have been on this video.  Especially for the price.   And  also why in the ... do they add the special bonuses to the DVD disc.  Just  because we buy the vhs versions doesn't mean we don't want to see the  extras!
0553565915|5.0|I found this book to be absolutely wonderful.  Not only do you feel Betty Eadie takes you on her spiritual journey, this book captures you and will truly make the skeptic of life after death a true believer.  It is  exciting, reassuring, as well as comforting.  With her wisdom and her  message, this book is touching as well as easy to read.  Whether you know  someone who has passed away or you have questions of you own, this book  will capture you.  I really did see life in a different way after reading  &quot;Embraced by the Light&quot;, Honestly.  Can you tell I loved this  book?
0385334206|5.0|American narcissism can be very blinding. Only a few critics see that Andy Warhol's art deals with something more than American consumerism and pop-culture. Kurt Vonnegut's book is only in part an anathema to American  provincial life.<br />If you want to experience Zen stripped of it's Oriental  trappings do not miss Breakfast for Champions.<br />Just like Andy Warhol,  Rusin by birth, Vonnegut is an outsider to the American culture. He takes  the items of everyday life, choosing these with the maximum layers of  idiosyncrasy - used car yards, KFC joints, Holiday Inns -  and regals them  with the extraterrestrial's stare. <br />We are born and raised with a certain  mental molding, we see the things as they are supposed to be seen. Then  something happens. You see hundreds of Marilyn Monroe's faces in Warhol's  painting and the pop icon becomes a weird combination of dots, lines and  shades. You read Vonnegut and see his drawings of the most familiar objects  - and they become as unearthly as Nasca reliefs.<br />When I had my satori I  rode a bus and suddenly became aware of the weird flesh formations on the  sides of a fellow passenger's head. Only a part of my brain was storing the  name for that phenomenon - &quot;ears&quot;. The rest of me was just  looking.<br />All the happenings in the book are just an excuse for showing  you that stare. It is an American province, but could be Nairobi slums or  Danish boyscout camp. The prose is detached, laconical. If you are looking  for &quot;funny&quot; parts you'll find them. But that would be entirely  your fault.
6305657947|2.0|This movie was a major disappointment to me.  I figured we'd be seeing Thomas Crown committing burglary after burglary and constantly fooling the authorities.  Instead, we get two whole burglaries in the movie and Rene  Russo's character, who's supposed to be assisting the police in aprehending  him, fawning all over him and generally making a fool of herself.  Her  character was so not believable that it was ridiculous.  There was no  motivation for her inane actions...she fell in love with him after seeing  him on a security camera for five minutes, if that.  Ridiculous. <br />I was  expecting a lot more action out of this movie.  There was hardly any!  It  was all character development that wasn't believable.  I'm sorry, but this  movie was pretty bad.
B00000I3JO|5.0|There simply aren't enough stars to do this album justice. Everything about this CD is perfect; Paul Buchanan's voice, the organic layer of sounds, the haunting melodies. &quot;Let's Go Out Tonight&quot; is simply  one of the most beautiful tracks ever recorded. (I also highly recommend  Paul Buchanan's somewhat different but no less moving version on Craig  Armstrong's album The Space Between Us.) <br />This CD belongs in everyone's  collection.
B000003BF1|5.0|It realy should be known as the Keith Richards lp! Sure it is the Stones,and yes Mick Tayler plays guitar on LIVE WITH ME and slide on COUNTRY HONK. But Keith had to help his old buddy Brian Jones out.(of the  band)And produce a lp of great music. Keith does it right here on LET IT  BLEED! Never a boring moment here ether. Not that I'm the worlds biggest  Richards fan,But give the man credit were credit is due,ok! Let It Bleed is  still a great smoking cd after all these years. If you were to turn someone  on to the Stones for the first time.(like on Mars,lol) LET IT BLEED along  with BEGGARS BANQUET, is what make STICKY FINGERS so great! So GET YOUR  YA,YAS OUT there and get LET IT BLEED. Right there is four cds that go from  great to greatness. Problem? How come the Stones cds(like THE BEATLES)stay  in the high price bracket,without adding extra tracks? Let it Bleed does  stand on it's own as a masterpiece mostly because the presure on Keith to  be two guitar players in one. And he pulls it of with flying colors! And  the Rolling Stones were never the same again! Ever! THANKS!
B000003S28|5.0|It's amazing to think that this was recorded in 1978. It sounds timeless. This must have exercised a huge influence on the whole generation of ambient music that appeared in the following two decades, but still sounds  more interesting than most.<br />While sonically similar to Music for  Airports, the very brevity of the tracks here works in its favour. None  outstay their welcome, whereas with MfA, one's mind pretty quickly wanders  (though you might argue that that is precisely the objective -- in his  original sleevenotes, Eno suggests that all of the Ambient series be played  at barely audible levels.) While MfA is meditative enough for that to work  it would be a shame to use this CD in the same way. The structure and space  of each piece deserve close attention. <br />I don't know if any of these  tracks made it into films (I wouldn't be surprised) but many of them were  staple soundtrack fare for BBC documentaries for many years, as were tracks  from Eno's excellent &quot;Apollo&quot; album.
0380804557|5.0|Stardust is an amazing display of talent on the part of Neil Gaiman. I picked it up once at the local bookstore and wasn't able to put it down. I am currently reading it again. The entertwining of fairy tales, adventure,  and love leaves the reader speechless. (When is the movie coming out! )
B00004SCX6|4.0|I was actually pretty surprised about this album. I was fighting getting it (ok, so my BOYFRIEND was doing the fighting). I was impressed that she has improved her voice. I have her first album as well, when she seemed to  be merely an image more than a good singer. She's improved her voice a lot  and I got a kick out of the satisfaction song. Its interesting to see words  and music interpreted different than the original. I like having a song  like &quot;Dear Diary&quot; on her album. That &quot;email my heart&quot;  was a really stupid concept. I'd recommend getting it if you like the new  'N Sync album (some of the same heavy beats). I like having less sappy  songs, so its a good album.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I love PJ.  I love them for doing what THEY want to do.  They are a great band who have fought to make diverse music as to not get caught in the &quot;trap&quot; of making the same record 6 times.  Since &quot;Ten&quot;,  they have been anti-celebrities.  They felt that they didn't deserve all of  the fame and popularity they were getting, because to them, there were many  &quot;better&quot; bands out there getting no recognition.  PJ felt  undeserved.  We know that is BS as Ten is one of the best albums EVER  recorded.  Although Binaural is no Ten in that it has no gimmicky, catchy  rythmes, and won't &quot;WOW&quot; teens into buying it, it is a great  album.  PJ is happy where they are now.  They can make music for themselves  and don't have to follow any formula that the media thinks they should.   Yet they know their fans will be there for them.  They are truly a band.   Every member had huge input on this record.  It's not the Ed show anymore.   And lets realize one thing folks.  Pearl Jam is not a &quot;studio&quot;  band, they are a live band; perhaps one of the top five live bands EVER! If  you've never seen them live, you've never heard Pearl Jam.  Even &quot;Live  on 2 Legs&quot; doesn't reveal the intensity and power delivered by them  live.  Is &quot;Grievance&quot; not one of the best PJ songs you've ever  heard.  Listen to it again, LOUD!   Cameran is by far, the best drummer PJ  has ever had.  My favorites on Binaural are: Breakerfall, Light Years,  Insignificance, Grievance, Of the Girl, Ed w/ukelele(sp).  And the closing  song is brilliant. (sorry, forgot the name).  So in summing it up.  If  you're looking for Ten, why have you been hanging around so long?  It's not  gonna happen already.  If you want a great, raw Pearl Jam album, buy it  NOW!
B00003CWRX|5.0|I originally saw this movie at the cinema, and while I definitely enjoyed it, I did not find myself thoroughly satisfied.  However, the acting was of such a high calibre that I rented it to watch again and see what I missed  the first time.  The second viewing was somewhat of a revelation.  What an  amazing film!  I believe it plays better on the small screen. The  subtleties of the narrative and the acting are outstanding.  I was  completely absorbed in the story and, after purchasing the disc, have loved  it as much, if not more, on repeat viewings.  I think that The Insider can  be ranked, along with Being John Malkovich, as the best film of 1999. With  regards to the dvd, the picture quality is excellent but Disney has not  given this film the packing it deserves.  There are no extras worth  mentioning except for an all too brief &quot;Inside a Scene&quot;.   However, as with The Sixth Sense, they did manage to put unavoidable  previews at the beginning of the disc.  Shame on you Disney for not giving  this remarkable film the kudos it deserves.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I have never been that crazy over Britney's music, but when I saw &quot;Britney's first listen&quot; on MTV I really liked the sound of her new cd!   So I decided to give her a shot, and buy it.  I was really  shocked because almost all of the songs on the album are high energy and  EXTREMELY catchy.  I stronly suggest you buy this cd if you like catchy  tunes, and striking beats. By the way, it makes for some awesome car  music!
B00004T8RK|5.0|After drowing for a few years without anything good in the music scene (except Chilli Peppers &quot;Californication&quot;)Pearl Jam has thrown us another life-preserver. This has to be the best album I've heard since...I  don't know when. The amazing variety on the album only serves to show how  far these guys have come as musicians without losing their edge. I came of  age when PJ just started putting out music and ever since I've been a fan.  This album hasn't left my sight for two days now and it probably for  awhile. The highlights of the album are definately &quot;Of the Girl&quot;  and &quot;Rival&quot; both songs that depart from the usual PJ but it's  done so magically. I recomend this CD for anyone who likes great guitar and  amazing vocals with edgy song writting. Thanks PJ, keep it coming and we'll  keep appreciating your efforts!
B00002Z88D|5.0|I bought this album when I heard Nothing Else Matters on MTV. I found it a fantastic song so I decided to buy it even not knowing all the songs, (this is the first Metallica album I bought). And I wasn't dissapointed, no! I  really love it! After I bought this album I listened to the original  tracks, just of curiosity. And after that I couldn't understand that some  guys here said that Metallica is forced to play slower in this album, coz  the Symphony can't play that fast, which is not true! <br />I mean if you  listen to &quot;One&quot; for example, the solo ending played by Hammet is  played a lot faster than the original track! And the original one was  already very very fast! And the violins give the song a lot more  darksphere.<br />Nothing Else Matters is also good re-arranged by Michael  Kamen, and the new song: No Leaf Clover is awesome! <br />I just recommend it  to anyone, because even if you don't like hard metal music, then just buy  it. This album is a good start to size your musical taste a bit up.
B000002MTU|5.0|This album is one of Mr.Clapton's greatest ever. The more you listen to it the better it gets.  You discover subtleties you never even imagined were there.  The passion is deep. The blues is pure. <br />The world's best  guitarist player is at his creative best performing and improvising on the  songs of his favorite artists.  The band is clearly up to the  challenge.<br />If you like any kind of blues you won't be disappointed with  this masterpiece.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I just wanted to say that Britney's music is not all sugar and spice. It is actually danceable and talented. I myself always seek those who are truly talented. ie: they write their own music. She can. I love Dear diary.  Satisfaction is a great old song revitalized with a new rythmn.  Truly a  good album.
B000002J03|3.0|How dare people compare garbage like the Beatles and Beethoven to the Almighty Led Zeppelin! It is my sincere belief that Led Zeppelin were not mortal beings, but Cosmic entities that descended into our plane of  existence.Every song they wrote is light years better than any other music  ever written, even when they did a version of someone else's song.Every  song written by anyone else - the Beatles, Stones,Beethoven,  Metallica,Black Sabbath, Deep Purple ,Nirvana,Mozart, Rush ,Queen, Iron  Maiden,Bach,Def leppard,Aerosmith,REM,Oasis,Muddy Waters, Bob Marley, Van  Morrison, Bob Dylan, Hendrix,Pink Floyd, the Doors,Van Halen, Guns n Roses,  the Who,Hell, EVERONE- has already been done far,far better by the Godlike  Led Zeppelin.Every single note they played is a work of purest  genius.Listening to their music is a deeply religious experience. It is  like spiritual poetry.
0385484518|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was at some points hard to put down (and Im not a lover of reading). I was attending mass one Sunday and my priest recommended this book, and I also recommend it to you. This was a heart  warming book about a man who faught the disease ALS. I also had prior  experience with ALS, because this was the disease my Granpa died from. If  you have no experience with ALS, it will feel as if you did after reading  this book. This was a short book which was great, but at some points it  seemed like they were dragging out some topics. In this book there were  many important life topics that I feel all people should take the time to  think about. I am very happy that Ms. Ward, the best teacher ever, gave me  this assignment (otherwise I wouldn't have read it). Please come back!  We  all miss you very much.
0783235968|5.0|Kevin Costner, Ray Liotta, Amy Madigan and James Earl Jones truly shine in this glorious film, but watch for an absolutely spellbinding performance by one of the most talented actors ever to grace the screen: Burt Lancaster.   While one of his briefest roles, Burt Lancaster makes the most of it and  puts on a virtual acting class in portraying Archie &quot;Moonlight&quot;  Graham.  Every move, every expression is so believable and so perfect, and  that grand and unmistakable voice clearly and beautifully speaks to what it  truly is to play the game of baseball, whether it's been as an everyday kid  out with the neighborhood gang or as a true major-leaguer.  His performance  in this film is flawless, and his character's importance to the story is  brought home even stronger due to his extraordinary acting skills.  Watch  this film again, and after hearing &quot;Moonlight&quot; tell us what it is  to really play the game, you too will want to wink at the pitcher just  before he releases the ball the next time you come up to bat!
0385484518|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It was at some points hard to put down (and Im not a lover of reading). I was attending mass one Sunday and my priest recommended this book, and I also recommend it to you. This was a heart  warming book about a man who faught the disease ALS. I also had prior  experience with ALS, because this was the disease my Granpa died from. If  you have no experience with ALS, it will feel as if you did after reading  this book. This was a short book which was great, but at some points it  seemed like they were dragging out some topics. In this book there were  many important life topics that I feel all people should take the time to  think about. I am very happy that Ms. Ward, the best teacher ever, gave me  this assignment (otherwise I wouldn't have read it). Please come back!  We  all miss you very much.
0553573411|5.0|Robin Hobb's Royal Assassin is a wonderful example of true adventure and fantasy. Hobb has a spectacular imagination and a talent for writing. This second book in the Farseer Trilogy links the young Fitz to the new, grown  up FitzChivalry. The plot is not overly intense but is full of new and  unique ideas. The story is so creative that the turn of each page brings a  new suprise.     Hobb's style of writing really makes the reader more  involved in the book. He writes not only the actions and events that occur  for the characters, but the feelings and emotions as well. Each character's  personality is developed enough for the reader to understand yet leaves  room for the reader's own imagination. Each character is unique in it's  personality making the story even more interesting. I especially enjoy the  action scenes in this book. The description of what is happening flows so  easily and with just the right emotion. I find myself reading faster yet  understanding it all.     As a reader, I am much more involved in the story  and the characters. I find myself hating the antagonist, Prince Regal. I  pity the honorable Burrich, the father-like stablemaster and worry about  the king-in-waiting, Verity, in his struggle to save his lands from both  invasion from the Outislanders and curruption from within Buckeep itself.  It isn't often that I find a book that is so involved and well-written.      I would also recommend the first and third books of Robin Hobb's Farseer  Trilogy; Assassin's Apprentice and Assassin's Quest. Enjoy!
B00003W8NM|5.0|This movie is by far the best 1999 had to offer. No scene is wasted - every shot is perfect and meaningful to the story. The amount of violence is much less than what was portrayed in the media and what is there is  essential to the storyline. I must admit that this IS a guy's movie - it  may be THE guy's movie. I have the VHS and can't wait for the DVD. David  Fincher rocks as &quot;Seven&quot; and &quot;The Game&quot; are almost as  intriguing - but this is his masterpiece. Great acting, great screenplay,  great concept, great musical score, and a haunting movie that will be  remembered long after you see it.

0805062971|5.0|I loved &quot;Fight Club&quot; the movie, so I decided to pick this book up. Since the book was written way before the movie - I suspected that things would be different from the movie. Was I wrong! It was like reading  an alternative director's cut in the movie where most things were the same,  but things were shifted around a little. Palahniuk's writing style is pure  MTV - but it works here. Plus, the book has a few more mischief and mayhem  examples that the anarchist would find intriguing. I highly recommend this  book.
0440219078|5.0|this book sounded pretty dumb when my teacher said it was a required to read this book. Once i read it, i wanted more! this is the best book ever!
6302000823|5.0|Warm and kind, \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" will bring you to remember the fond times with your father, uncle or neighborhood older male friend. Though set in a old Italian village, it easily relates to the world we in the USA grow up in. It may become an unexpected favorite movie as it has for me.<br />By no means a \\"buddy movie,\\" it shows how a young boy seeks out an older man to fill the shoes of his father (deceased in a war). The man is reticent to be involved, but eventually realizes the relationship they have and is responsible to this role.<br />The relationship is complex, and the life the boy lives is filled with various coming of age issues, mostly related to love and living out dreams.<br />In an age in which fatherhood is too often a task rather than a desire, this movie shows how, though a father is absent, love still matters and others in the community should step up.<br />Some scenes are very romantic (LOTS of kissing clips in a fun subplot about censorship) and might not be appropriate for younger viewers. However, nothing, I think, is so offensive that older teens couldn't watch.<br />I fully recommend it for teens and up.<br />Anthony Trendl
B00004T8RK|3.0|that is my drawn conclusion after giving pearl jam's latest outing a couple of spins at the local record store. like many other rock fans out there, i really had high hopes on this one. being trapped in a musical  world where pop culture rules; with nsync on one side and limp bizkit on  the other, i looked upon these guys as the saviours of rock and, due to all  respect, the forgotten &quot;6 string&quot; instrument called guitar. but  now here comes binaural. it opens up promisingly with 'breakerfall' and  'god's dice' but soon things started to part away. the once restless  quintet which redefined rock music in the 90s sounds more like a bunch of  college music graduates playing 'mainstream rock' (the genre once known as  alternative). the songs lack composure with loads of key shifting all over  the place, making this cd not an easy listening to some. i dare say only  half the tracks here qualify to be on a pj record. there's no anthemic  standouts in sight (a la 'alive' or 'go'), no multi-layered guitar texture  ('dissident'), no adrenaline-fused wailings (&quot;it's evolution  baybaaaaayh&quot;), no freewheelin laid back jam sessions ('off he  goes','red mosquito'). however there's still a dim light flickering at the  end of the tunnel though. tracks like 'grievance' and 'rival' would still  make up for the compensation, even if it's not enough. and in the tradition  of a pj album, there's an unusual short track in the lines of 'bugs',  'foxymophandlemama', 'i'm open', 'push me pull me' etc. This time it's  called 'soon forget' featuring vedder accompanied with an ukelele (the  small hawaiian guitar). so now, a little piece of advice from me. dont take  this review seriously. i despised superunknown the first time i heard it.  stroll down to your local record store, or for mp3 freaks go download the  tracks and decide. but at least for now, this cd is no longer on my  wishlist. looks like my search for the saviours of rock continues. sad but  true, maybe i'll stick to the hip hop metal bandwagon instead.
B000031XCR|5.0|THIS CD IS AWESOME, EVERY SONG IS WONDERFUL, I LISTEN TO THIS CD AT WORK, AND MY CO-WORKERS LOVE IT.
B000002UAO|5.0|In this album, a completely matured band is  introducing. It was the heyday of the Beatles. There were eventually two ways to carry on. One of the ways would have gone to a very comfortable haven: sitting on their  greatest hits and being the same usual pop-group as they were in  '64-early'65. The other way was change the style and change the sound even  if it meant to lose the image and charm of a favourite pop-group. They  really lost this image but paralelly they stepped to the next and higher  level of music. This album is the argument that the Beatles had a great  talent to change their musical style in the very moment when it was  necessary not for the fans' sake but for the sake of real music. It is an  album not for the usual fans of popular and commercialized bands but for  the fans of real and undying music.
0790744759|5.0|A True masterpiece. Vincent Minelli and of course the immortal Arthur Freed create a timeless film that can be enjoyed forever. <br />Judy Garland of course in absolutely the greatest. The songs by Ralph Blane and Hugh  Martin seem to fit in to the tiny plot just perfectly. <br />Watching this  film like watching a great and wonderful garden. &quot;The Boy Next  Door&quot; is a stopper..but most of the songs are..
B000002TQB|5.0|This has to be the best Blur album of them all. Their influences come out here more than ever- the Kinks, Syd Barrett, the Jam, all the while remaining completely creative and imaginative. The quirkiness and  brattyness are here as well, and that will always be the Blur I love:  Badhead, Tracy Jacks, Jubilee, and To The End(featuring the  singer from  Stereolab!).
B000003TA9|5.0|sugary sweet and cyanide deadly. sy's most perfect blend of pop and avant noise. the whole album is wound so tight like a venomous reptile poised to strike. 15 love songs for the disaffected. &quot;sugar cane&quot; makes my  teeth ache.
B0000004V2|5.0|Of all the &quot;Madchester&quot; bands the Stone Roses were simply the best. Not only that, they affected Britsh music for years to come:Oasis, Blur, Kula Shaker(just to name a few). I bought this album without even  ever hearing the music, and now if I had to choose one album to take to a  desert island with me, it would be this. The Roses' music is like  Merseybeat from twenty years before, only funkier, and the lyrics  definitely probe some serious psychological depths. Buy this cd, it'll  stick with you forever.
0515123447|5.0|It has been quite a while since I first read Killing Floor, and in that time it has almost become like an old friend. It's quite simply an outstanding thriller, especially for a debut novel. In Jack Reacher, Lee  Child has created a hero for the ages, tough, smart and with excellent  taste in music!  The action in Killing Floor is a breath of fresh air  compared to the flashy martial arts rubbish we are usually dealt. Fighting  is a fast, dirty game, and Reacher is the fastest and the dirtiest you'll  ever hope to meet.
6302820448|4.0|Someone recently complained to me that they didn't like this film because it &quot;was kind of like the same thing over and over and over again.&quot; Isn't that the point?<br />Weatherman Bill Murray finds himself  re-living Groundhog Day over and over and over again.  In a part written  for Murray's wonderful comedic talent, he gets bored and the viewer gets to  enjoy the many and varied ways that Murray tries to do himself in.  Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending upon how you look at it, he awakes  the next day to find that it's the same day all over again.<br />Murray is  joined by co-anchor Andie MacDowell (a mediocre actress who does a  convincing job in this film)and eventually falls in love with her.  His  attempts to make her love him fail as well.<br />Will he ever live the day  just right...right enough so that when he wakes up it's tomorrow?  You'll  have to watch it to find out.<br />This is a simple, yet clever and fun film.  Don't go into it expecting too much and you'll enjoy it through and  through.
B000035P80|5.0|Dylan bickers and manipulates and taunts and intimdates but then he gets on stage and blows everyone away and then rejects a bevy of beautiful models so he can drink with his friends and write songs, a fine piece of  cinema, everybody should get stoned for it
B000002JR8|4.0|What`s to complain about anyway? Listen to real metal, everybody likes something else! This album really deserves more than   just comparision. I`d say they are upset about the similarities of metal. So what Skipper,  These guys paved way for bands like Korn and Slipnot I like it very well  and gave it 4 stars!
0790744473|4.0|I agree with other reviewers that Brigadoon is not as spectacular a musical as Singin' in the Rain or My Fair Lady is; however, there is something magical about Brigadoon.  As enchanting as the town of Brigadoon  is to Tommy (Gene Kelly), I found the movie to be just as enchanting.   Though the songs, for the most part, are not as catchy as those from  Singin' in the Rain or My Fair Lady, they have a beauty all on their own.   &quot;Brigadoon,&quot; &quot;The Heather on the Hill,&quot; and  &quot;Almost Like Being in Love&quot; are simply lovely.  Though I found  the dances between Tommy and Fiona (Cyd Charisse) somewhat repetitive, they  are nevertheless breathtaking.  The dances the townspeople do are quite  charming and, I thought, very apropos for the time and setting.  The  setting itself would have been more glorious had the movie actually been  filmed in Scotland; however, the studio sets are pretty and take away very  little from the movie itself.<br />What makes this movie work is the unique  and yet timeless story.  While watching the movie, you cannot help but ask  yourself whether or not you could give up everything you have known-your  friends, your family, your job, the world as you know it-for true love.   The pairing of Kelly and Charisse also makes Brigadoon work.  Though I was  not overly impressed with Charisse's cameo performance in Singin' in the  Rain, she acts and dances beautifully in Brigadoon and makes a lovely  partner for Kelly.<br />For those of us who are fans of Gene Kelly and/or are  hopeless romantics, you will not be disappointed by Brigadoon.  However,  when watching Brigadoon for the first time, have few expectations and let  Brigadoon work its magic.  You will be pleasantly surprised by the charm of  this movie.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|This is one of Maiden's best albums. It is definately the most musically complex and textured of their albums. Each track is great. My favorite is The Clairvoyant. I didn't care for this album too much compared to Maiden's  other works when I first heard it because it's so different. Now it's my  favorite next to Powerslave. If you're one of those Dianno only Maiden fans  quit being so narrow minded and check it out. This album rules!
B000000W5N|5.0|Although not as revered as the other albums in the Classic Stones Album Block(the Beggar-Bleed-Fingers-Exile period)SF is in my opinion the greatest Stones album.Not only do we get classics like Brown Sugar and Wild  Horses,but we also get Mick Taylor in his first full appearence on  album(his miniscule appearence on LIB not counting).Regarded as their  greatest second guitar player,they sound like a completely different  group.His work on Can You Hear Me Knocking is incredible,especially on the  Santana-esque jam at the end.Other great moments on the album include  Sway,B#*ch,the Stax-esque I've Got The Blues,and the chilling Sister  Morphine.Although tagged as a substance influence album,the final track  Moonlight Mile,a beautiful open-ended coda shines a ray of light and hope  on this claustrophobic collection of songs.
6302814359|5.0|Is this a comedy or is it meant to be serious? Big question. Either way, I loved it! I was really impressed by the bit at the beginning where the zombies are getting out of the ground. It was really clever how the smoke  covered the cemetary ground, and the music really added to it! There were  parts that made me laugh, made me jump and parts that made me think 'how  the hell did they do that! ' One of the lighter sides to zombie films, and  a load of fun! Definately worth buying, but it isn't one of those films you  could watch over and over.
0446677450|3.0|I am still waiting for the lesson.  So the guy got lucky by marketing the velcro wallet, and was able to reinvest it wisely.  He does point out some obvious blunders people make, but how about how to correct them.  The 16%  solution, is mentioned in his book, but he doesn't put it in his book  recommendations.  He promotes his playing game throughout the book, which I  perferred he didn't.  Overall, it was a fairly decent book, but as for the  lesson to be learned, it is not lacking.  Your house is your greatest  investment, don't ever look at as a liability.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I know I might as well not bother putting up another 5 star review just like most of the other ones, and I wouldn't have even bothered at all, if not for a couple naysayers out there. This album is amazingly passionate  and spellbinding, and I have to buy another copy because my old one got  lost somehow and I miss it enormously.  I sort of argue with the &quot;not  a good first radiohead album&quot; thing, because this was my first and  it's what got me into them in the first place. My only advice is to make  &quot;pablo honey&quot; the last radiohead cd you buy. It has a few good  songs and it's an interesting document of their past, but as an album it  pales before The Bends and OK Computer.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Britney's singing voice is really terrific, but again her album sounds very much like a broken record, all the same background music. Take it from groups like the Eagles, Fleetwood Mack, Belinda Carlyle, etc, mix up the  sounds and every song will not sound identical.  After the third song, I  was so sick of that stuipid repetitive background beat, I turned the CD off  and gave it to the 13 year old girl next door.  You said on your Disney  interview that you wanted to move into more adult sounds, this is  definately not the way to do it!  Sorry.
6305428425|5.0|This is one of those movies where you have stand up and cheer. It makes you feel good from start to finish, and takes you back to the high school years. I hope everyone buys this movie just like I did because, you will  never ever see a better, not to mention hilarious film about 2 sweet girls  who were nothing back in the days... and now are at the top of the world!   5 stars all the way
0312932081|5.0|My resolution this New Years was to read the classics, the great novels that everyone ought to read once in their lifetimes. Along with Shakespeare and Dickens, I started to read ask my friends what their personal favorites  were, and read them as well. The name 'Enders Game' came as a suggestion  from one of my friends, and I reluctantly agreed, expecting yet another  unrealistic and mediocre sci-fi epic, drenched in spaceships and overplayed  heroism. I was amazed to realize that this novel was actually one of the  most engrossing and well-written of all of the books I had recently read.  Card's clear, concise and descriptive writing tone made the story  believable and fast-paced. I above all commend him for not patronizing  children. All too often their ideas, quite occasionally as clever and  intellegent as adults, are swept aside and discarded purely for the reason  that the person was below a certain age. This was truly a remarkable book,  and I urge everyone to read it.
0790733897|5.0|From what I have picked up over the years.-Steve McQueen did all his OWN driving including the JUMPS but when it came to the SPINOUT at the very end of the chase it went against his Grain-(as a Race car driver to but a car  into a spin).So lower profile tires were installed on the Mustang and Carey  Loftin did the final spinout.I have seen pictures of the Camera car used  for the chase and from what I could see it was custom built for the  movie-not a camaro as has been mentioned-Car was completely open with  exposed engine -camera operator sitting at the very front another at the  passsenger side(possibly the Director Yates) and another camera operator  positioned at the rear of the car,making a TOTAL of three cameras-looked  like a Trans am(Race car) or stock car with the body stripped off of it.The  chase was filmed at speed-meaning it wasn't sped up in anyway- at the top  end highway speeds were close to 120 mph.Was filmed in the very early  morning-around 5 to 6am.Police blocked off about 15 or 20 city street  blocks.All other cars on the road were driven by stunt drivers,one of the  reasons you keep seeing that VW Beetle pop up now and then.That there were  at least three mustangs used-One for the jumps only-as they would destroy  suspensions.Eg.You will see one(Mustang) with a side (Drivers)Mirror and  another without it#1 at car wash -then #2 later when he returns to his car  before the chase.Have seen footage of McQueen practicing with the GT  Mustang driving against the RT. 440 Charger at a local Oval  Track(California)-to get a feel for the car.Mustang was souped up -as it  was going up against a Stronger Big block(440).All that shifting mentioned  is from a 4speed-McQueen liked to double clutch when he was shifting which  is prominent on the soundtrack through the chase.You can see him chewing  gum in the rear view mirror in one or two parts of the chase as as has been  mentioned. THE CHASE was all McQueens idea-He had it Written into the  script.The studio wanted to do it on a Studio Backlot-He said -No Way-he  wanted a REALISTIC chase.So he got HIS chase-Too much credit is given to  the Director Yates-The chase and the way it was filmed was all STEVE  MCQUEEN.
B000021Y77|5.0|This movie is one of the more stylish movies I have ever seen. and unlike other movies that try to be stylish, this one has an orignal concept and is very very interesting and well written. It's easy to follow and just a  great fast paced movie. It's a must see!
B0000025D0|5.0|An incredibly important album to me and many other loyal fans.  Bruce's story-telling skills have been refined here from his earlier work and his more economical use of imagery and symbolism pack a punch that resonates on  a deeply visceral and psychological level.  <br />Its hard to believe that  songs with so much interior depth and complexity are capable of inciting  legions of Bruce fans into a fist-pumping frenzy.  This is in large part  why the man and the music are so great.  The message is to keep pushing  that boulder up the mountain (like Sisyphus) even in the face of the  bleakest odds.  The struggle is its own reward.  Adding this music to your  collection is a reward you can give yourself (without the struggle).
0790729342|4.0|This is a very very great movie,and it has the value to have created one of the coolest heroes of all the times (The first one is a sort of prologue,for me...) ,but ev'ry one knows the THIRD ONE -MAD MAX BEYOND  THUNDERDOME- had MORE success and was ...simply the BEST. &quot;Road  Warrior&quot; is pure action and visual impact. Several years after the  first one's events,there was a great World War that leaded to the total  collapse of each form of civilization.There were nuclear exchanges too,but  we viewers will see their effects on the environment into &quot;Mad Max  beyond thunderdome&quot; scenario. However,Max is becoming a loner psycho,a  scavenger  wandering into a not-specificated Wasteland (probably following  an ecological disaster occurred prior the first &quot;MAD MAX&quot;) in  costant search for food and...FUEL !  .He will meet a compound of  survivors,attacked  by a weird and bloody band of Marauders.All the events  connected to this small fight will lead Max to the way of  REDEMPTION.<br />&quot;Road warrior&quot; is an intense movie with a bit of  poetry in it,and the BEST CHASE SCENE of the Cinema history,but there's a  lack of a substantial plot,one thing you can find into the MASTERPIECE of  the series,MAD MAX 3.Yes,this one has created the myth of Mad Max,but the  third one is incredible !  Mad Max purists (like me) have  UNDERSTOOD the lesson,and there is a critical revalutation of the third  one,that however was a box-office smasher.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Her voice is ok, the lyrics for most of the songs are okay, but I cant stand people tampering with good songs ALREADY MADE (satisfaction).  She has No talent except for her voice, anyone can learn to dance, and she  doesnt even play any instruments!  dont get the cd, waste of money.
6305736650|5.0|In this movie, an American expatriot who was once a gunrunner, had an intense affair with a mysterious woman, and now runs a highly successful bar in Casablanca, comes into possession of letters of transit.  At about  the same time, the mysterious woman turns up with her husband, a  significant figure in the fight against the Nazis, who is in desperate need  of those letters of transit in order to make a quick getaway.  From this  wildly improbable plot stems quite possibly the greatest movie of all time.  The pacing is brisk, dialogue &amp; performances perfect, cinematography  phenomenal.  When a person watches it, the unlikelyhood of it all fades  away &amp; suspension of disbelief is instantaneous, because everyone  involved knew how to make a good movie.  Personal favorite lines of  dialogue: &quot;Why, Rick, how extravagant of you throwing away women like  that.  Someday they may be scarce.&quot;;  &quot;Tomorrow I will be in here  with a breathtaking blonde, and it will make me very happy if she  loses.&quot;; &quot;I am shocked! Shocked to find that gambling is going on  in here!&quot;<br />The DVD features pretty much the same extras as the  Aniiversary Edition VHS, which is a shame.  It would be nice to have a  commentary by a film historian.
B00004T0UT|5.0|This is the single best collection of Elvis' 1969 comeback recordings.  The first compilation of this material, _The Memphis Record_, suffered from muddy sound quality and horrible mixing (especially in the removal of the  brass and strings from &quot;Suspicous Minds&quot;).  Last year's 2-CD  _Suspicous Minds_ contained the masters in their entirety, including a  handful of fairly weak tracks.  The reissue of _From Elvis in Memphis_  compresses the best of these sessions onto one smokin' disc!<br />The original  1970 release of _From Elvis in Memphis_ contained 12 tracks, with &quot;In  the Ghetto&quot; as the torch-bearer.  The new reissue pads the original 12  tracks with another 8 which were initially released as singles around the  same time.  The result is perhaps the best single Elvis CD ever  released.<br />While the King is generally regarded as a &quot;country  boy&quot;, it is the R&amp;B tracks which are most memorable.   &quot;Wearin' That Loved On Look&quot; kicks off the proceedings with a  fiery energy which sustains itself throughout the entire CD.  &quot;Long  Black Limousine&quot; and &quot;Power of My Love&quot; easily justify  Elvis' title as the King of Rock n' Roll.  These are the performances of a  man reborn;  a man eager to reclaim his place in the rock and roll  hierarchy.<br />No Elvis record is complete without a country influence.  This  CD does more than satisfy.  &quot;It Keeps Right On a-Hurtin'&quot; and  &quot;True Love Travels on a Gravel Road&quot; both come across as  heartfelt performances while Glen Campbell's &quot;Gentle on My Mind&quot;  gives this reviewer goosebumps.<br />The true centerpieces of this incredible  CD are the three smash hits culled from the '69 sessions:  &quot;In the  Ghetto&quot;, &quot;Suspicous Minds&quot;, and &quot;Kentucky Rain&quot;.   Need I say more?<br />While Elvis would go on in the 70's to reach new  isolated musical heights (the _Elvis Country_ album, &quot;Burning  Love&quot;, &quot;Promised Land&quot;, &quot;Way Down&quot;) this would be  the last time that he would be so consistent in the quality of his  output.<br />If you're an Elvis completist, you'd probably be better served by  _Suspicous Minds_ or _From Nashville to Memphis_.  But if you want to get  to the core of what Elvis was all about circa 1969, this is the one to get!
B000000H5K|4.0|I don't really have much to say about the album. I just wanted to say to the previous reviewer that Sepultura DID NOT break up. Max Cavalera simply left. And the followup, 'Against', is obviously not what you foreshadowed.  Since that review was written in Feb. 2000, and Against came out in '98, I  figured any Sepultura fan would know about it. Ugh.
B0000033RY|5.0|This represents a good time, get down, in your face, boogie band! I know that there are those of you who don't know what that means (boogie), or maybe you just did not get a chance to see one of the best live bands ever  to grace a stage. Either way, I'm sure this album will show just how  amazing the times of Cactus were. Even after Rusty was murdered, the lineup  that followed was still pretty amazing.(Try Hot and Sweaty!) I still get  goosebumps when I hear these guys.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural finds Pearl Jam expanding as a band with a new sound, some new instruments, great percussion and experimentations.  Ed's vocals act more like an instrument with the rest of the band. It took several listens, but  Binaural is a gem.  It is a new direction for an innovative rock band.  If  you let this CD stand on it's own and enjoy the new tunes, it will provide  lots of depth and musicianship.  Afterall, listening doesn't have to be a  rating game with previous albums.

0061002747|3.0|This book was a good book. A lot of people would think that it had a bad ending but u have to look past it. Really the they did give u the murderer just u have to figure it out. Other wise it will seem to be a bad ending.  The book was good and it kept u intrigued in each chapter mostly.
B000002UWF|5.0|My Name's Joel. I'm 19 and a young musician deeply in love with Jazz. I easily own 600 Jazz C.D.'s and this Disc is one of my most played! It's amazingly lively! Louie has such a unigue voice, and it just captures your ears attention and gets your feet tapping withing a minute of playing the  first song (Just a Gigilo). I, sadly, bought this disc in the store for  $21.00 (Which I'm sure is wayyy above what Amazon charges) but stil worth  it. If you lead a sad life I guarantee you that as long as this disc is  playing in your stereo you will forget your worries and be filled with the  absolute joy of Jazz itself.<br />-Joel
B00004RI87|5.0|If you listen to this and QOTSA at the same time, it's almost like old times.  The album is rough, edgy, filled with rampant guitar and gruff vocals.  John Garcia has not died, nor will his sound ever die.  I just  wish I could get Slo Burn.  Such is life.
B00001QGPS|5.0|the best hip-hop album i own! it starts out great and ends better. i highly highly recomend this album to anyone.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is awesome! Since I've gotten it I haven't stopped listening to it. Her voice, songs--everything sounds much more mature than her other CD. I love the song &quot;Stronger&quot; &quot;Don't Go knockin On my  door&quot;, &quot;lucky&quot;, and &quot;what u see is what u get.&quot;  The other songs are awesome. A must buy for any Britney fan
0767802470|5.0|Of the distinguished german films. Which represents the seventh art is Panic Box, which describes the hidden side of war panic. It is a documentary film that recounts the story of German navy crew, on a  submarine, who is trying to survive during the Second World War.<br />The  scenes are shot in exciting manner. It is a film about  the last look  during a destructive international war, as represented in panic box. It is  life of stress, fear of death, and life hope. The expression were very  clear on the face of the submarine crew, who spend long time in panic and  stress waiting for death or hope to survive and get victory.<br />It is  exciting film indeed and makes you feel that you are one of this crew  members. You share them their fear  stress and anticipation of what will  become of them. It is a mixture of unbearable tension, which is quite  apparent on the face of crew members. You move from this sever tension to  mid-level tension and later you face fearful silence.<br />Production is  wonderful. Shots are very clear and expressive. In addition to accurate  details and exciting finishing. I regard this film the most exciting  surprise. This film is considered as a psychological study for mans  psychology during war. It picture sever and violent changes in which man  becomes another person.
0312962118|5.0|This is one of the best books i have ever read.  It is a suspenseful novel, that you simply cannot put down.  It has everything you can possibly want in a thriller/action novel.  It has everything starting from noonstop  action, to graphic violence to sex.  What more can you possible ask for?  Read the book, you will not regret it!
6305622957|5.0|I've seen reviews talking both sides of the fence.<br />In reality, this is not a film that has one combat scene after another. Most of the story revolves around the events leading up to the 'surprise' attack, with the  actual raid on Hawaii taking place at the end of the film.<br />However, I  would argue that the story is NOT boring. Quite the contrary, it does a  fine job of chronicling the events which led up to the attack -- both from  the American and Japanese side.<br />Much of the footage centers around  American intelligence putting together pieces of the puzzle and making an  attempt to warn complacent military commanders of a possible confrontation.  Tora, Tora, Tora excels in this respect. You feel the tension mount as the  plot unfolds.<br />The actual attack scenes at the end of the movie are well  done and provide a suitable climax at the appropriate time.<br />The musings  and misgivings of the high Japanese Naval commander about attacking America  just before the closing credits gives a touch of drama which does credit to  the Japanese as a people rather than to merely show them as stereotyped,  mindless warriors.<br />This is one of the good ones. If you like a good war  story, you'll enjoy this picture.
0684872153|5.0|Angela's Ashes, Frank McCourt's first published memoir, describes his impoverished childhood while growing up in Limerick, Ireland. The memoir follows McCourt through his tumultous childhood and adolescent years as a  Limerick &quot;laner&quot;<br />The memoir begins in New York City, before his  mother and father move their family, which is shrinking in size because of  death, back to Ireland.<br />McCourt continues to nararate his story  straightforwardly and frankly, sprinkling the text with various Irish folk  songs (Roddy McCorley, etc.) and poetry while also describing his love for  literature, (which  becomes his only refuge from poverty besides a distant  and confused relationship with the Catholic religion)<br />Frank contends with  the ever-present threat of death, disease, starvation, a ever-depressed  mother and alcoholic father. He also struggles with the common problems of  young boys and discovering the mysteries of &quot;manhood&quot; and the  opposite sex.<br />McCourt very obviously has great literary talent, as shown  by his ability to narrate and weave past memories together ironically,  intelligently, and stylishly, to form a great literary work.<br />All in all,  &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; is an wonderful book that deserves the great  praise it has won.
6305513406|4.0|It's Star Trek - TOS all over again. What more needs to be (or can be) said?<br />This release of the series on DVD is crisp, clear and well worth the price paid. Colors are bright and lack the 'washed out' look that was  evident on tape. I could never convince myself to buy the series on VHS  (besides which, I had taped them from TV), but will be buying the entire  series on DVD.<br />Unfortunately, as others have said before me, there is  little on the DVD besides the two episodes each themselves. Just the  trailer from televison. More could have been done here -- thus I took away  a 'star' for this. However, the quality of the transfer is excellent and  will present you with many hours of re-enjoying the adventures once again  (assuming that you enjoyed them in the first place).<br />For those of you who  have not seen ST:TOS, I favor it over later Star Trek releases because of  the unique personal interaction between the primary members of the crew  (Kirk, Spock, McCoy, Scotty). This is the strengh of the series, and was  not duplicated in later Star Trek releases.<br />So ....  If you enjoy a  somewhat hokey space adventure (remember, the charm of the series is the  crew interaction mentioned above) and/or would like to see the show that  started it all, this is a purchase you probably won't want to pass  up.<br />~unabashed recommendation~<br />Beam me up, Scotty.
B000002KHF|5.0|I would consider myself to have a very eclectic taste in music, leaning more towards newer stuff.  My collection consists of everytthing from Limp Biskit to Fiona Apple.  After buying Moondance I am amazed at its honesty  and sound.  Most times by listening to a cd you can guess what era it is  from. Moondance I cannot,  the musicality of the cd is amazing as are the  lyrics.  Moondance was one of Van Morrison's earlier recordings and you  already get the idea that this man is a virtuoso.  It is simply amazing and  moving.  His voice drips with emotion no bottled feelings here like you  hear on todays stuff.  I highly recommend this you won't be dissapointed!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of the best bands around.   &quot;binaural&quot; is a reason why.  Good songs.  Good feelings.  Good thinking music too.  Better than Yeild in my oppinion, but can't mess with VS.  Pearl Jam has never put  out a bad CD.  Once again, really good.  Some of these songs will be  amazing live. (light years, breakerfall, gods dice, of the girl, slieght of  hand, parting ways, inSIGniffigance, greivance...)
6303234844|5.0|My friends saw this tour live and I didn't realize what I had missed . . . until I saw this video.<br />For those who are tired of bands looking like they're still in the recording studio while performing live, this video is  a must!<br />Peter Gabriel, and co., developed an elaborate and visually  stunning performance - on two separate stages nonetheless - that can get  even video audiences out of their seats and cheering.<br />This is not a  concert - it's a theatrical event!<br />For Peter Gabriel Fans, this concert  was about 90% new material.  Most of that was from the &quot;Us&quot;  album.  However, the personal nature of the album was mirrored well by the  song selection and powerful performances by Peter Gabriel and Paula Cole.  These songs include &quot;Blood of Eden&quot;, &quot;In Your Eyes&quot;,  &quot;Don't Give Up&quot; and &quot;Shaking The Tree&quot;. <br />Other faves  include &quot;Sledgehammer&quot;, &quot;Steam&quot; and &quot;Kiss That  Frog&quot;.  &quot;Salisbury Hill&quot; is a welcome entry, and  &quot;Across the River&quot; is a moving performance.  [There are more  songs, but space here is limited.]<br />The band is in top form:  Along with  Paula Cole are familiar faces like Tony Levin (Bass), David Rhodes (Guitar)  and Manu Katche (Drums), with Jean-Claude (Keyboards) and Shankar (violin)  rounding out the main band.<br />Words are not enough.  You must see it to get  a taste of this truly monumental tour.  I don't want to spoil anything, but  I especially enjoyed the last part of &quot;Secret World&quot; near the end  of the concert.
B000002W5J|5.0|It's tragic that all the casual listener knows of Jefferson Airplane today are those Classic Rock mastodons \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\". At their 1967-69 peak the Airplane vied with the  Byrds as the greatest American band, and for good reason. They had three  outstanding singer-songwriters in Marty Balin, Grace Slick and Paul  Kantner, and three superb instrumentalists in guitarist Jorma Kaukonen,  bassist Jack Casady (amazing!) and drummer Spencer Dryden. Although the  incredibly dense, improvisational, psychedelic masterpiece AFTER BATHING AT  BAXTERS is my personal favorite, SURREALISTIC PILLOW is the album with the  best songs--even the lesser-known ones like Kantner's \\"How Do You  Feel\\" and \\"DCBA-25\\" and Kaukonen's \\"Funny Cars\\"  (sung by Marty) ring out with the freshness of the times. But this is  predominantly Marty Balin's record. The man's voice, one of the most  exquisite in rock, is at its best here, and his songwriting--the anthem of  hippie defiance \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\", the magnificent  love songs \\"Today\\" and \\"Comin' Back to Me\\" and the  eerily prophetic boy-and-his-machine pean \\"Plastic Fantastic  Lover\\"--was unparalleled in the Summer of Love. Too bad he would  become so totally eclipsed by Grace, who had plenty of charisma and wrote  many clever, nasty little ditties (\\"Lather\\", \\"Greasy  Heart\\", \\"Rejoyce\\") on subsequent albums. Here, of course, we  have \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\". I probably  wouldn't miss \\"Somebody to Love\\" if I never heard it again (the Great Society's version was better), but  the vocal on \\"White Rabbit\\", building up to the thunderous  \\"feed your head\\", still amazes after thirty billion hearings.
B00000JPHD|3.0|Standing on it's own, 'Dracula' is a wonderful movie.  Lately, stodgy critics and historians have taken to bashing it - today's audience may be largely put to sleep by it's slow, stagy production - it seems almost  styled towards a silent movie at times.  But the movie is a great moody  accomplishment from acclaimed director Tod Browning - the only complaint,  and it is a common one, is the drastic fall off after the first twenty  minutes of the movie, set mostly in Castle Dracula in Transylvania.  After  this, the setting moves to London, and Browning is never able to recreate  the unbelievable classic horror atmosphere of that first twenty minutes.     As for the special edition with new score by Philip Glass;  although there  is no complaints about Mr. Glass' compositions, the music is THERE through  the whole movie (all released versions up to this point had no music  outside of the opening credits), and borders on being obtrusive.  The  original worked without a score, and some of the creepiest scenes in the  movie are made even creepier through pure dead silence.  Plus, my biggest  complaint is that they removed the original music from the opening credits-  the chilling chords of 'Swan Lake' which for me, although Universal used it  on many of their horror movies of the era, was the trademark of this movie.   How dare they take that out?  My advice is to purchase the original  edition (the original un-scored version is also readily available),  although the re-scored version may add a some excitement to the movie as  not seen before, and may keep things moving a little bit quicker if one has  a short attention span.
B000002J03|5.0|I, like most people was familiar with the popular Zeppelin singles that were heard on all the classic rock radio airwaves, but I never considered myself a fan. I had also never owned any of their albums. The other day I  decided to pick up Led Zeppelin II at my local music store. This decision  came when I looked at my cd collection and realized that I had no classic  rock, with the exception of Hendrix.(I like all sorts of music from hard  rock to metal to punk) <br />Wow was I shocked when I listened to this album  for the first time! Every song is incredible and just gets better with each  listen. When I got home from the record store I popped in the cd and  listened to it all the way through three times in a row! I strongly  recommend you pick up this album if you are not really a fan of Zeppelin  but are sort of familiar with them. Even if you have never heard of them  (which by the way is a real shame), I still suggest you get this album.    <br />If I can make any suggestions to you about this album it is that you  should listen to it all the way through and play it at maximum volume. This  is what Rock and Roll is really about!  <br />Hope this helps you out the next  time you are stuck on which cd to purchase.
6302763835|5.0|Is it Oscarworthy?  God, no.  Is the plot remotely memorable?  Ummm....plot?  Does John Agar go totally over the top and give a completely hammy performance like he does in every other sci-fi/horror movie he ever  made in the '50s?  Indeed, but that likable Agar was the ULTIMATE hero in  these kind of pictures of this era so we forgive him.  Is Mara Corday still  one of the most beautiful leading ladies in '50s Sci-Fi/Horror film lore?   Whoa nelly, yes, although I still think she looked better with her hair  down in 'The Giant Claw'.  Are the special effects passable but do you get  one to many glimpses of a bad matte or incorrect scene placement of the 150  foot tall spider?  Geez, now you're just being picky.   Three letters  describe this movie;  F-U-N.   When I was a little kid, this was probably  my favorite monster movie to stay up and watch on the late late late show,  and to this day I still get a kick out of it.  The film benefits from the  talented direction of legendary Jack Arnold (Creature from the Black  Lagoon, The Incredible Shrinking Man,etc.) who is a master of keeping  suspense taut through 80 minutes and getting the most visually out of a  shot.  And there is a good performance by veteran actor Leo G. Carroll as  the well intentioned but ultimately mad (not to mention eventually horribly  deforemed) scientist who starts all this commotion.  Also has a somewhat  campy and overblown but nonetheless wonderful music score.  Don't think  about it too hard, these movies were never made to be taken very seriously  (I think these filmmakers would get such a kick out of seeing all the books  out there these days that overanalyze the heck out of these movies!).  Just  turn out the lights, make some popcorn and settle in on the couch for a fun  waste of time.  And, try to ignore that feeling of something slowly  crawling up your pantleg as you watch....eeeeeeeeeeee!  (Or worse yet,  don't look out the window;  you'll need to watch to understand.)

0767849493|3.0|This isn't a bad film but Smith has surely stretched his directorial abilities by making such a big leap from his comparatively low-key first three films. Dogma is intended to be an 'epic', but it just doesn't look  good enough to carry it off, aside from the rather dismal ending which sees  it moving closer to a kind of introduction to religion for kids rather than  the adult film the swearing and violence ensures that it is. If Smith is  going to carry on making films like this, and he isn't going to learn the  art of visual grace in a film, he might like to get someone else to direct  his script. That said, the script here - though packed with superb touches  - is his weakest to date; it's just too ridiculous and despite the  controversy (in the US; not reflected here in the UK) it's ultimately got a  fairly conservative message. The performances (apart from the slightly  irritating Salma Hayek) are uniformly excellent, but this is ultimately too  flawed to be a success. Having said that, it's certainly amusing that Smith  persuaded Alanis Morrissette to play a part in which opening her mouth  leads to all around covering their ears.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Who would have thought that the &quot;teen queen&quot; who sung &quot;Soda Pop&quot; just one year ago would be in the place that she is now? Needless to say, I was very impressed by this album. We have all been waiting for  pop music to drop it's tunes catered for eight year olds and actually add  some substance to the formula. I can see Britney ten years from now as the  next Janet Jackson or Madonna. She may not have an extravagant voice, but  there is no denying her charisma. Here's a summary of each track.  1.Oops!...I Did it Again: This is probably the cheesiest song on the album.  However, a declaration of &quot;I'm not that innocent&quot; shows us what's  to come in the rest of the album. 2.Stronger: Turn &quot;Baby one more  time&quot; upside down and forget about it. With it's stadium friendly beat  and self assured lyrics (&quot;my loneliness ain't killing me no more),  this song opens up new possibilities for Britney. 3.Don't Go Knockin' on my  Door: An r&amp;b flavored track, yet again, offering a more self reliant  Britney who will not be taken advantage of. 4.(I Can't Get No)Satisfaction:  When everyone heard she was covering this, they thought that she would ruin  it. Far from the truth. Maybe that's why she sounds so incredibly sincere  saying &quot;I can't get no satisfaction no matter what I do&quot;. In my  opinion, this is better than the original. 5.Don't Let Me Be the Last To  Know: Britney gone country! Well, not really, but as close as she gets. The  first ballad on the album, this song (written by Shania Twain and her  husband) definitely has a different feel to it for a pop ballad. 6.What U  See (Is What U Get): Perhaps a comment on her implant rumor? Yet again,  this song is filled with confidence and surely is a response to some of the  media she's had to deal with. 7.Lucky: A very personal song, and Britney  delivers it that way. It shows the sacrifices that she's made to be such a  big star. 8.One Kiss From You: A fun, mid tempo song.People forget that  she is a teenager and therefore will have songs like this dealing with  teenage love. 9.Where Are You Now: A ballad, actually, although it is  pretty fabricated, a very sad ballad about not being able to let go after  someone has left you. 10. Can't Make You Love Me: Even though Britney seems  to be on top of the world, there is one thing that even fame, power, and  money can't buy: love. She conveys this brilliantly in this upbeat song.  11.When Your Eyes Say It: A pretty bland ballad about love. Still, at least  it offers more foresight into the subject than most teen pop does. 12.Dear  Diary: A great closing song, written by Britney herself. This summarizes  the exciting beginning of teenage love wonderfully and ends with Britney  telling her crush and her fans, that she hopes that we'll be friends for  awhile.
B00004SCX6|5.0|If you liked Baby One More Time, then you definitely will not be disappointed with this album. Britney returns with her enthusiam and energy in 12 new songs. For once, I finally have found a cd in which I like EVERY song in it. Some of her songs are better than others, but all are fun  and/or relaxing to listen to. If there's anything wrong with this cd, its  that there's no song that matches my favorite, Sometimes. However, all I  think that means is that a song that excellent cannot be topped, thus that  should not be held against this album.<br />My favorite songs on this album  are tracks 1, 2, 5, 6, 10, and 12. However, the others are also pleasant to  listen to, and should not be scorned upon.<br />Overall, if you like Britney  Spears, then you should get this album immediately. If not, then you should  stop believing all the silly rumors and actually sit down and listen to her  songs in their entirety. If you don't then you really don't know what  you're missing.

B000006I14|5.0|The earliest, and unauthorized, version of &quot;Dracula&quot; is a marvel. Nearly 70 years after it first crept onto movie screens, it is still a riveting piece of cinematic artistry.<br />I must admit that I find  Max Schreck's vampire much more comical than frightening. At one point in  the film, where he peers out from a ship's galley, he looks like a deranged  elf. The chills in the film really come from the wonderful use of light,  shadow and symbolism. The skeleton clock, ghost ship, fields and Schreck's  ominous profile on the staircase, among others, are all evocative images  that stay with the viewer. The narration, visuals and sets all add to the  eerie atmosphere. Even the little things stand out--check out the cryptic  symbols on Renfield's letter and the black-hooded carriage horses on  Dracula's coach.<br />Among the actors, Gustav von Wangenheim stood out for  me. As the overconfident and terrorized Jonothan (sic) Harker, Wangenheim  gave a gripping performance. <br />'Nosferatu' is a wonderful reminder that  the simple things--light, shadow and story--can knock the stuffing out of  hi-tech hocus-pocus.

B000002HO3|2.0|There are three good songs on this list that  were hits that most people would know.  However, the other 12 songs on this album really don't compel me to speak of them nor do they even make me want to listen to them when  just relaxing and listening to music.  It's just another 80's  band that  had a couple of hits and then they disappear.
B00004SCX6|5.0|hey I got the CD opening day and loved it the second the player started turning!  My fave song is Lucky, a song about a movie star girl who is lonely but has every thing. My next fave is called What you see is what you  get, this song totally boosts a girls self respect because if a guy doest  like whats he sees or is getting well too bad, although I think Britney  could have belted a little more and used her voice better the selectioon of  music makes u want to get up and dance<br />thanx for taking time to read my  review<br />Kel
B000002VCB|4.0|I can see how some women who didn't listen too closely to this would find themselves offended, but they're obviously not paying enough attention if they are. Yes, some of the songs are negative towards women -- but come on,  the album's titled *Eve*. I always assumed it was from Adam's point of  view, and given most versions of that story, I wouldn't expect anything  less. Behind all the negativity in some of the songs, there's a whole lot  of hurt and injury -- just like in any breakup. It's not too hard to tell  that that's what's fueling the harsh words and vicious comments. And I know  plenty of women who say the same sort of things about men. The fact that  the emotions are real, not sanitized for your viewing pleasure, is what  makes this album work for me.<br />I never thought the album was saying it  applied to *all* women, just one (well, two) set of experiences with them.  As a feminist, and moreover a humanist, I accept that you have to show the  negative side to things as well as the positive.<br />So this is more negative  than positive -- it's still a good album.

0553573403|1.0|I will not contest that the writing is excellent, it is.  I will not tell you that I didnt spend many nights unable or unwilling to put the book down way past a sane hour for sleep, I did.  And yet, when I finished this book,  I felt the fool for having wasted so much time with it.<br />I think it comes  down to what you want from your fantasy.  I want characters I can love and  believe in and who I know will somehow, no matter how grievious hard their  path may be, manage to survive and make things right.<br />Martin doesnt care  about characters here.  He cares about plot, and the realistic, organic,  authentic world he believes he is creating--which smacks of arrogance to  me.  He creates characters that you can esteem, but he has no especial  regard for them.  And while his plot may entertain us, because he has no  love for the people who occupy his world, he cannot hope to satisfy us.<br />Martin's book/world is not a decent, honorable place, nor is it a place  where decent honorable people can hope to survive.  Time after time he  seemed most interested in proving Dark Helmet's (from &quot;Space  Balls&quot;) hypothesis that Evil will always defeat Good, because Good is  dumb.<br />Unfortunately for me that kind of world doesnt fulfill my  requirements of a fantasy.  I am not asking for Pollyanna, but I expect,  wholeheartedly and unquestioningly, that fantasy literature will be Comedy  as defined by Aristotle--meaning that at the end the good guys win, and not  tragedy where they do not.  This book, I suppose, in the end, is a tragedy,  and although I have often wept for &quot;friends&quot; I have  &quot;lost&quot; in fantasy novels, I stayed the course (in those books)  because I believed that their sacrifice would pay off.  I do not have that  hope here.<br />Martin's writing is excellent, and the plot fascinating, but  what is a fantasy without people you can root for and love?  Martin has  created compelling characters here, but he never breathed the breath of  love into them, and so, if he, as their creator cant love them, at the end  of the book I am left with the question, why should we?breath of  love into them, and so, if he, as their creator cant love them, at the end  of the book I am left with the question, why should we?
B000000OAN|5.0|One of the most versatile groups of any age, Queen proves that with this release.  With the rockin' Death on Two Legs, the 1890's Seaside Rendezvous, the fun and soaring Bohemian Rhapsody and what I consider a  great Sci-Fi song of space travel in '39 (2039 or 3039?) Queen obviously  was not afraid of trying just about anything.  With the powerful Mercury's  vocals, the trademark Queen guitar and the harmony of all, this disc should  be a must for anyone who likes any type of quality artistry.  It will not  disappoint!
6301969251|5.0|This movie holds a special place in my heart.  I saw it when I was nine years old on the wide, Cinerama screen.  It has left impressions with me that have carried to this day.  Especially great is Max Von Sydow's  extraordinary performance as Jesus and Charlton Heston as John the Baptist.   David Mcallum undertakes the role of Judas with understated pathos,  especially the scene where Judas betrays Jesus to the Sanhedrin. Also, see  if you can recognize a young Martin Landau who delivers his usual,  intriguing performance as Caiphas.   The part that still moves me the most  is the raising of Lazarus.  Absolutely breathtaking!  All in all, a very  inspiring movie.
0446605409|5.0|&quot;Funny&quot; dialogue, in books, almost never reads well. It ends up sounding either corny or contrived. Nelson DeMille's Plum Island, however, has the quick wit of a stand up comic. The main character and narrator is such a wise-ass that the conversations/ interrogations actually caused me  to laugh out loud! (This has never happened to me before.) I strongly urge  everyone to read this book! It's absolutely hilarious!
0345350499|5.0|I been reading this book, and I love it. I'm just a kid so if your an adult I bet you'd like it a lot more than I do, and I gave it 5 satrs. It basically focuses on Morgain le Fay's life, but there are other stories  about women. If your looking for a romantic book, this is the one for you.  It combines political views with love, so you'll never get bored. Everyone  of the 876 pages are really worth it!
6305127638|2.0|This a movie-length version of an average quality STNG episode. Frakes ham-handed directing really shows in scenes like the silly silo launch, and the ending where the Vulcan ship arrives and we have a picnic. Spielberg  and Zemeckis have nothing to worry about from this hack.<br />I was a big fan  of the Star Trek TV series, but have always felt the movies were pure pap  with plots slapped together to maximize box office receipts. First Contact  continues in this tradition with a little something for everyone. Its like  eating a meal of creamed beef, mashed potatoes, boiled okra, and vanilla  cream pie. You're full when it's over, but it's hard to remember exactly  what you ate.
B00000K19E|5.0|This movie has it all.  Fast paced action, phenomenal visuals, superb photography, great soundtrack, weird weird plot, and some pretty good acting.  I really don't care much for Keanu Reeves, which unfortunately  caused me to miss this one in the theater.  This would have been awesome on  the big screen.  But even Keanu does quite well, along with the rest of the  cast. (I love Laurence Fishburne!)  The visual effects are positively  stunning, and synchronized with great sound.  The combo of slow-motion to  real-time filming was spectacular!  As my son said, when Neo wakes up in  the jello-bath, &quot;This just hit about a 9.5 on my Weird-O-Meter!&quot;  The plot definitely offers one some food for thought, the dialog between  man and machine when the agent unplugs his earpiece and has a little  tete-a-tete with Morpheus was quite interesting. Did I mention Spectacular  Visuals?  That one aspect of this movie alone with worth the price!
0871137380|5.0|This is a really good book.I first read it when I was about eleven and loved it. (my goal is to join the special forces. I read anything i could get my hands and on and still do)This book was extremely interesting and  informative. the author captured the moment very well and the emotion  conveyed was wonderful. I think this is a great book.
B00000DF6O|5.0|This being my first modern blues album (my other blues album being a Robert Johnson one) I was eager to give this a listen.<br />Hearing the first organ notes of &quot;Blues Boys Tune&quot; to open the album I knew I was  in for a treat. I wasn't disappointed at all. The band is tight, pumping  out some amazing blues that sounds like it just rolled up out of the  swamp.<br />B.B. is tops, singing and playing. I never knew he sounded so  good. This whole album will have your toes tapping in rhythm. Fantastic. Do  yourself a favor and pick up one hell of a blues album. I'm certainly glad  I did. Enjoy.
B00000JG41|5.0|This Cd is amazing.  A little more accessible than their self-titled debut or Disco, but does not disappoint.  Patton has refined the Bungle sound to a well oiled machine of madness.  The whole album is great, some of the  better songs are and none of them knew they were robots, sweet charity,  vanity fair etc.  I bet you will like Mr. Bungle too, after you hear this  classic.
B000002KJL|5.0|Every time I listen to this CD I'm transported back in time to a the Cellar Door in DC. I had heard this song of the radio as college freshman and fell in love with it. Not long afterwards I got to tickets to see them  at a club and became a lifelong fan. Knopfler and company are consummate  musicians and listening to their work is like seeing an old friend. This is  an excellent introduction to Dire Straits and remains one of my all time  fave recordings.
0790729725|5.0|This is De Niro's master-performance and Scorcese's masterpiece.  From top to bottom, the best movie I have ever seen.  The best mob movie ever made (yes, better than the Godfather).  Sheer genius at work, Pesci is amazing  as Tommy, Liotta will never have a better role in his life, and Paul  Sorvino is great as well.  But, the real scene stealer here is De Niro as  Jimmy Conway, a character that demands your attention and does not  relinquish it until the movie's end.  No other movie compares to this, this  movie is perfection.  If you do not own this on DVD then BUY IT NOW!
B00003CWTI|1.0|After a whizbang opening that really gets your hopes up, Magnolia rapidly becomes unwatchable.  You, the viewer, get treated to a 10 minute version of &quot;One is the Lonliest Number&quot; (at earshattering volume), a  seemingly endless parade of pathetic, one-dimensional losers who are  impossible to care about, an actual music video (! ), two major characters  dying of cancer, and finally an EVENT which is supposed to tie everything  together in some sort of profound way (it doesn't.)   PT Anderson seems  like too nice a guy to tell his actors to tone things down. I can't  remember the last time I saw so much hammy acting:  everybody is crying and  screaming and/or cursing all of the time.  Anderson is great at moving the  camera, and he has a good eye for lighting and composition.  He would make  a wonderful commercial director.  And the special effects during the EVENT  are a lot of fun to watch.  After watching this film I really appreciated  what Robert Altman accomplished with &quot;Short Cuts&quot;.
6303920713|5.0|i really liked this movie.it really explains the life of teenagers like that class in this movie,sometimes they get shot at and theres a lot of fights and everything.one of the kids gets shot at so thats a sad  part.Michelle Pfeiffer had to have won an award for this movie for best  acting.
6304539282|5.0|i think george lucas is mean becase he is just wants people to want to get the movie very bad and wene they come back out on video people will buy them more then last time
0792151712|5.0|this movie is a masterpiece.extremely great acting,cast and titanic ship that took three years and a few months to make,just for this movie
6304539282|5.0|i think george lucas is mean becase he is just wants people to want to get the movie very bad and wene they come back out on video people will buy them more then last time
6305627347|2.0|funny but stupid.could have been a lot better but i still liked it.the soundtrack really just has all the funny parts on it.the soundtrack is really good,just get that instead of seeing the movie
B000002H5I|5.0|This album is brilliant!  'Fast Car', 'Talkin' about a revolution', 'Baby, Can I Hold You', and 'Behind The Wall' are fantastic! This is a very good album and i would recommend this to anyone.  I had only heard 'Fast Car'  so, my friend lent me her album, it was amazing! Everyone should listen to  this album, Tracy Chapman is so talented! One of the most underated  artists, but definately one of the best! BUY THIS ALBUM!
0788816454|5.0|this movie is so silly and dumb,it had me laughing to the very end of the movie.if you like Adam Sandler,this is your movie,he is very funny in this
B00000J6AG|3.0|Well you know Moby is doing something right, since this CD from 1999 is on all kinds of best-of lists, even making #20 of Rolling Stones's best albums of the 90's (not that the mag has any musical relevance anymore). Maybe  it's because Moby puts a face to the often anonymous genre of electronica.  Maybe it's because he's American, and his music is more easily understood  by mainstream critics than, say, trance or techno. <br />Or perhaps it's  because he took a simple concept- melding old blues samples with a fresh  paint of electronic music, and made a series of inspiring, sometimes  beautiful songs. \\"Honey,\\"  \\"Find my baby,\\" \\"Why does my heart feel so bad,\\"   \\"Run on,\\" and especially \\"Natural Blues\\" are proof of that.<br />But that's  only about a third of the 18 tracks on this album, and they all must stand  judgement. And this is where the CD falls flat. You get a selection of  tracks where Moby does the singing or speaking, \\"South side,\\" \\"If things  were perfect,\\" \\"The sky is broken,\\" and \\"Porcelain,\\" and with the exception  of the latter none have music good enough to carry his thin, high-pitched  voice. <br />Filling out the disc, (besides \\"Bodyrock,\\" the catchiest piece,  with guitar and a sample of Love Rap) are a series of short instrumental  fillers \\"7\\" and \\"Down Slow,\\" and simple acoustic/ambient pieces (the last  three tracks).  These won't be the tracks you remember.<br />There are some  excellent discs here, but they're within the first 11 of 18 songs. If you  don't mind skipping around you'll enjoy this but it doesn't reward a   complete listen.
B000006045|5.0|`Mezzanine' is the third and finest album from the most important British group of the 90's, Massive Attack. Their debut, `Blue Lines', virtually redefined UK soul music and invented the much-imitated genre of Trip Hop.  If it's follow up, 1994's slick `Protection' was somewhat disappointing,  then `Mezzanine' recaptures the spark of creativity and genre fusion that  first thrust them onto the world stage.<br /> `Mezzanine' is Trip Hop's  logical conclusion, and this new sound is harder and more confrontational  than before. It's closest relative in the music world is The Prodigy's `The  Fat of the Land', although whereas that album fused heavy punk with dance  music, `Mezzanine' fuses Radiohead-esque prog Rock with hip-hop.     Opener `Angel' is a brooding, moody track, illuminated only by Horace  Andy's androgynous crooning. It is a fine introduction to this  schizophrenic, guitar heavy new sound, as Led Zeppelin-esque guitars come  crashing down in the climax. `Risingson' was the track Massive Attack chose  to release in September 1997 to preview the new album. Built around a  looping bass line over which 3d and Daddy G rap, the track is vaguely  psychedelic, what with 3d's talk of  `clicking shines on foreheads' and  samples of The Velvet Underground. Massive Attack are actually more similar  to Reed's crew than you may think; both are (or were) fiercely  experimental, yet never take fore granted the ability to construct a decent  song.<br /> The next track, `Teardrop' is many people's favourite track  (myself included). A sublime and simple song built around a stuttering drum  beat and harpsichord riff, it also introduces us to Liz Fraser (of the  Cocteau Twins) and her soothing, impossibly high vocals. The accompanying  video to the track was that of a baby in the womb, and the song does have  the effect of rendering the listener to an embryonic state. The addition of  sombre piano chords and subtle overdubs creates a stark, mesmerising and  beautiful track, proof (if any were needed) that `Unfinished Sympathy' was  not a one off.    After cradling us with `Teardrop', we are  severely awoken by `Inertia Creeps, an Eastern tinged rap track that uses  its electric guitars to full effect. It also helps one understand why The  Clash were thanked in the sleeve notes.<br />`Exchange' is probably the albums  weakest moment, an instrumental that actually has little to do with Massive  Attack, and seems too retro and backward looking in the midst of these  thrilling new soundscapes. `Dissolved Girl' is much better, featuring Sara  Jay who whispers and purrs where others might full-bloodedly sing. It is  also the albums `chestburster' moment, as no sooner have we gotten used to  the relatively sparse and soulful composition, a thunderous guitar with its  amp on max invades the track, mimicking the previously discrete bass line.  The fact that it was featured on `The Matrix' should have been a clue to  this; other artists on it were Rage Against The Machine and Marilyn Manson.    `Man Next Door' is initially reminiscent of `Exchange' and that track's  shortcomings, in that it again is not a Massive Attack song and is  similarly retro. But, in the context of the album, it works fine, what with  its themes of suburban paranoia, Horace Andy's almost rude pronunciation of  `fight' and the fact that it's very melodicism is welcome after the nuclear  bomb of sound that was `Dissolved Girl'.   `Black Milk' is the album's  most danceable track, a hip-hoppy song that utilises Fraser's lolloping  vocals and fuses it with a deep grooving bass line and synths to provide  the album with the closest thing it has to bombast.   `Mezzanine' and  `Group Four' are the albums landmark progressive tracks, and should be  taken as one epic 14-minute track, as they both share the new found heavily  electric sounds that are the album's trademark. With their dark, vicious  intensity, they could certainly teach Korn or Slipknot a thing or two about  the fusion of rap and electric guitars. Whereas those groups are just axes,  coming down on you in one fell swoop, Massive Attack is a shower of acid  rain, permeating the melody constantly. Although this makes the album sound  depressing, it is not (moody is the word), and Fraser's psychedelic  interplay with 3d on `Group Four' is quietly exhilarating. `Group Four' is  progressive rock, and I don't mean that in the derogatory manner with which  it is usually intended. An eight minute epic, it is a perfect climax for  the album. Except, in a magnificent coup, the album does not end there, but  reprises `Exchange'. As with the previous albums, Horace Andy reappears for  the final track, and he sings delicately and soulfully over the vamped up  `Exchange', which has a heavier bass and several elements stripped away.  The album ends not on fade out, nor a big epic blow out, but the sound of  vinyl scratching. It seems strangely fitting, and I can't help but feel  that this is the only version of `Exchange' that is required.    `Mezzanine' is true heavy metal, an industrial strength hulk of steel,  jamming out conversely fragile and brilliant melodies over its finely tuned  sonic barrage.
B00004SCX6|4.0|This album definitly fills in the gaps that her first album was missing.  The songs, the depth, the lyrics, it all comes together for an enjoyable album.  I got the first album, and though I liked it I hated the lyrics.  They were all about a girl who was totally dependent on this guy and was  despertly trying to win him back, and that's just not what I want to hear.   In this album the lyrics are strong, but sensitive.  Some songs are easy to  dance and sing along to.<br />The missing star?  I have to say, not all the  tracks are so great.  My favorites are Stronger, Lucky and Dear Diary.   Ooops....I Did it Again, and Satisfaction are fun, but not amazing.   However, the ones that are good are really good.  I think this album is  worth your money if you're a Britney fan or a dancer.<br />I say, good for  Britney, she did it again........only better!
B00004SCX6|5.0|If u liked Brit's first CD u'll love this one. It rules! It's got great songs such as &quot;Don't go knockin' on my door&quot; and &quot;Oops!... I did it again&quot;. plus a good song is &quot;Dear Diary&quot;. I u liked  &quot;...Baby one more time&quot;, then u'll &quot;Oops!...I did it  again&quot;.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I bought this CD after hearing &quot;Here With Me&quot; on the radio last summer.  I almost crashed my car the first time I heard it!  It sent chills down my spine and made my hair stand on end.  I thought it was Sinead  O'Connor at first showing her sensitive side, then I came across the CD  while looking for something else at my local Moby Disc store.  It was on  sale for $12.99, so I bought it on the spot!  I have not been  disappointed!<br />I raved about it so frequently that my girlfriend finally  went out and picked it up, and she too quickly fell in love with it!  Now  we consider &quot;Here With Me&quot; to be &quot;our&quot; song (as corny  as that sounds).  <br />Make sure you get the CD, as I think the last track  &quot;Take My Hand&quot; is a bonus not included on the tape.  A song that  starts slowly, solemnly and quietly, then builds and builds into a fun,  upbeat little dance tune.  Very catchy.<br />All in all, if you like melodic,  intelligent songs  to round out your day, then I predict this one will find  a permanent home in your CD player.
B00004SCX6|4.0|It looks like she &quot;did it again&quot;!  For devout Spears fan this CD is a must!  However, the beats all seem the same and it is after all typical teen pop stuff.They are great dance tunes though and from reading  some other reviews i don't think she deserves some of the harsh critism  people are giving her.  She is after all the original female pop queen who  led the way for many others and she is the original.Her personality beats  Miss Aguilera's and her dance moves catch the eye.So, she desevrves credit  for her work, and she may still surprise us, and &quot;hit us again&quot;!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears has been the object of much criticism since her 1999 debut, ...Baby One More TIme. That criticism was harsh, and rightfully so.  ...Baby was poor material to use as a platform to make yourself credible as  an artist.  That's why she didn't get the grammy.<br />Britney, however, has  managed to turn the tide with her follow-up, &quot;Oops!... I Did It  Again.&quot;  This album, in my opinion, shows Britney's flair and overall  maturing since the last album.  The material is 1000 times better, which  should make her the pop icon of 2000. <br />Probably the most controversial  track on the album, (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction, is going to be butchered  by critics -- unfairly butchered.  I don't think that she meant for it to  even remotely sound like The Stones.  Why should she even try and duplicate  that sound?  That's why she put her own spin on this track and truly made  it her own, much like Madonna did with Don McLean's, &quot;American  Pie.&quot;<br />If you love pop music, then this album will certanly send you  into orbit.
B00003CWRX|5.0|I've already seen this movie twice, &amp; I know I will see it several more times. It's amazing the details that are revealed from behind the scenes of 60 Minutes, as well as what goes on in Corporate America. This  movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, &amp; I promise you, you will  NOT be bored with this one! Absolutely compelling, stunning, interesting,  &amp; riveting!  If you haven't seen it yet, get thee hence to  Blockbuster, &amp; do it NOW!
B00000J7RZ|1.0|Whoever told Jennifer Lopez that she could seriously needs a full-frontal lobotomy. Ms. Lopez, whose only claim to fame is her gluteus maximus,  provides her listeners with an hour of sheer torture as she tries to  struggle to break a note. In the same way that Paula Abdul became a star,  Jennifer proves us that her best friend is a good synthesizer. If you  thought her acting was bad (she appears like she is reading cue cards all  the time) Jennifer's singing is so artificial and bad, that it makes Puff  Daddy's &quot;Forever&quot; album (which flopped) look like a welfare-case  when it comes to talent. Here are my reviews of the songs on this  album:<br />1. If You Had My Love - I would change the title to &quot;If I Had  a Voice.&quot; Just hearing her trying to break a note on this track will  make you want to hit the stop button on your CD player. <br />2. Should've  Never - That's right....She &quot;Should've Never&quot; made this album.  Awful!<br />3. Too Late - Yes, It's &quot;Too Late!&quot; She already has made  the worst album of 1999.<br />4. Feelin' So Good - I didn't &quot;feel so  good&quot; when I saw the video or heard this song. Ms. Lopez says she is  part of the Latin Explosion. I disagree. This song proves that she is lost  in her cultural identity, more so than Bryant Gumbel. <br />5. Let's Get Loud  - Oh, please let's not. We don't want to hear the dogs barking all night  after listening to this song. Pure dance-wannabe song.<br />6. Could This Be  Love - Probably a tribute to Puff Daddy,it made me fall asleep listening to  it on my CD player.<br />7. No Me Ames - In this song you'll hear a true and  talented voce...that of Marc Anthony's. He is the hidden gem in this album.  Jennifer sounds like she learned Spanish overnight with a Berlitz tape  course. Only listened to it because I am a great admirer of Anthony.<br />8.  Waiting For Tonight - Catchy tunes can't save this song. Pure synthesizer!  Her voice is hardly heard!<br />9. Open Off MyLove - It won't be a top 25  song. Trust me!<br />10. Promise Me You'll Try - Slow and boring. Just like  her acting. Horrible sounding ballad. <br />11. It's Not That Serious - Her  singing is not &quot;serious&quot;. There are true Latin Divas out there  such as La India and Brenda K. Starr, but Lopez is not!<br />12. Talk About Us  - If &quot;us&quot; means her and Puff Daddy, than I'll pass on this one.  <br />13. No Me Ames (ballad version) - Same song as #7, only more slower and  without the salsa beat.<br />14. Una Noche Mas - Same as &quot;Waiting for  Tonight&quot; but in Spanish only. <br />Trust me! Spend your money  discovering true Latin divas/groups that are hidden out there. La India,  Brend K. Starr, Nuyorican Soul, Safire, are all wonderful alternatives to  this album. Ms. Lopez must realized that she doesn't have a talented bone  in her body (the gluteus maximus is a muscle, not a bone). I would urge all  true music lovers to pass this one by, and discover true dance divas like  those mentioned above. Jennifer please stick to dancing!
0671004611|1.0|Conspiracy, smearacy.  This is pure, unadulterated, 100%, genuine, Grade A, U.S.D.A. Choice, prime, fresh off the barn floor horse hockey.  Another book that proves anyone will believe it.  I read this book hoping it might,  once and for all disperse the fog and put to rest the rumor of alien life  visiting earth.  I'm embarrassed to have read this.  The only green guys I  know of play football in Green Bay, are in someone's entomology collection,  or work for Green Peace, okay?<br />Take my advice: stick with reality and  donate the price of this book to your favorite social or medical charity.  Go about your business people, there's nothing to see here.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I loved the first track as soon as it was on the radio.  Then, I heard Dido acoustic on the radio live while she was visiting a local radio station. I knew I had to have it.  Her voice is awesome.  Every song on  this album is terrific.  I can play it over and over and never get sick of  it.  Her crooning ballads are not overly sentimental.  The music  exemplifies her vocal talent.   A must buy for anyone who likes Sarah McL,  Fiona Apple and/or Natalie Imbruglia.
B00003CWL6|5.0|I can understand that some people might have a problem with the content of this movie, but THAT IS THE POINT.  This film offers a great perspective into American society and some of the underlying problems that all people  face.  Now, of course the events that go on in this movie are taken to the  extreme, but this was done in order to prove the point.  The acting was  great, the plot was original, the themes and messages were wonderful--COME  ON, IT TOLD US TO ENJOY OUR LIVES.  WHAT IS WRONG WITH THAT?  This movie  might not be for those people who are afraid of the truth, but for anyone  willing to open their minds a little, this is a treat.  Everyone should see  it at least once just to give it a try.  It is a great movie.
B000009O8A|4.0|If you like your films nasty and twisted with a character that has a gilligan hat to boot,rent this film! (wimps stay away! )
B00003CWOL|1.0|It's truly a terrible movie. All it is is an excuse to bash organized religion. There is a reason that it bombed at the box office. The movie flat out stinks. Avoid it like the plague.
6303985467|5.0|Very good film,a low-budget triumph of the director and cast over big bloated hollywood thinking.
B00000K3UR|1.0|I am a big fan of Sandler - this makes it all the more difficult to slam this movie.  This was a 3 star movie - a marginal recommend - until the movie wraps up.  I'm all for a happy ending but this was ridiculous!  Our  hero gets married, now works as a lawyer, has a child of his own, is still  best buds with his original &quot;son&quot; Julian, and to top it off he  can have a laugh at his ex-girlfriend working a menial job at Hooters with  the guy she dumped him for.  Just like it works in real life, right?  Ugh!   The ending is bad enough to knock this movie down to one star.  Sandler's  talents are wasted with this dog.
0425129586|5.0|Although, I consider most of Agatha Christie's mystery books at the top.  However, I think that this the most outstanding mystery book.  Please give this book a chance!  It talks about 10 strangers each lured to an island.   And one by one thing die.  Who is the murderer?  Keep in mind, that Agatha  Christie is the master at writing!  I just loved this book...READ IT!   THis is beyond doubt, one of Christie's best ever written including the  Appointment with Death, murder on the Orient Express.  I read this book  only in 1 day because I didn't want to put this magnificent book down.  I  guarantee you that you will enjoy reading it!
B000002UAU|5.0|I remember in the summer of 1967, I had just received my paycheck from my job at a local burger shop. I decided that I was going to pick up two records at the record store.  The first would be the latest Rolling Stones album &quot;Between the Buttons&quot;. I must admit, there were a few  catchy songs (&quot;Let's Spend the Night Together&quot;) and at the time,  I honestly thought that the Stones album was going to be better, because at  that time I prefered the Stones to the Beatles. However, once I had  finished listening to the Stones album, I played my other music selection  which I purchased that day which was &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club  Band.&quot; My life has not been the same since. I remember when I got to  the last song &quot;A Day in the Life&quot; and listened to that infamous  final note in the song, I remember staring at puny little turntable,  completely awestruck, with my jaw on the floor. I couldn't believe what I  had just listened to. I just sat there and stared at my turntable, never  thinking that such amazing, brilliant, completely original music could come  out of my cheap little sound system. That night, I listened to the album  three more times, in it's entirety. The following weeks after that, I saved  up my paychecks to by a better turntable and better speakers so that I  could listen to this album the way it was intended to be listened to. Those  people who still don't think that this is the best album of the century can  go....  They don't deserve such a brilliant work of art such as  this album.
0425129586|5.0|Although I consider all Agatha Christie's book at the top, however, this book I rank it the best of Agatha Christie's.  Keep in mind that Agatha Christie is master at writing.  Talking about 10 strangers lured, yet  invited to a mysterious island.  As they share their darkest secrets, one  by one, they are murdered.  WHo is the murderer?  You shall find out  yourself.  Please give this book a chance!  It is excellent!  I read this  book only in 1 day because it's a page turner.  I give this book 5 stars.  Best of the best!
B0000025BL|5.0|This album falls somewhere between progressive rock, classical, and opera. Strange? Yes. Good? Definately. A classic? You bet. One reviewer said that Meat Loaf is a &quot;pretty good singer&quot;. Man, is that a major  understatement. Meat is one of the greatest singers of all-time. Although  he is not my favorite singer, you'd be hardpressed to find another rock  vocalist who could pull off these songs and not make them sound corny.  Despite what some reviewers have said, that is exactly what he does here.  Every single song is a masterpiece. The title track is a classic rock song,  with the timeless &quot;motorcycle guitar&quot; from Todd Rundgren (who  also does a masterly job producing this album). Paradise is the most well  known song from here, and with good reason, it is great. Heaven Can Wait is  a simple song (a rarity on this album) that features one of Meat's best  ever vocal performances and some great piano work from Roy Bittan. Jim  Steinman is a genius, plain and simple, anyone who could write such  grandiose, sprawling music as this should be given credit, and no one else  could've sung it except for Meat Loaf. For that reason alone, Bat Out of  Hell is worth owning.
B0000399WI|5.0|Like Tim Robbins character says its about hope.  This movie presents the viewer with something that seems devoid in such a landscape of deprivation and horror.  To feel that good after seeing a prison movie, is incredible.
B000002OMN|5.0|While the above title may not be true, it is certainly a coin toss between the two Bats. This one is just as good, if not better than the original classic. I'd Do Anything For Love (But I Won't Do That) who doesn't love  that song? Life Is A Lemon is a bit of a different song for Meat Loaf, but  still a fine one. Objects In The Rear... is possibly my favorite track ever  from Meat. His vocal performance on it is unbelievable, also Steinman keeps  his lyrics &quot;serious&quot; for once, throughout most of the song at  least. Rock N Roll Dreams is a great song too, and so is Everything Louder.  Wasted Youth is hilarous (the first time you hear it at least). A bit of an  exhausting effort to listen through, but with Steinman's vision, Meat's  voice, and the array of excellent musicians gathered together for this  album, you will not be disappointed in it.
6305627347|5.0|This is crass, rude and foul.  But its speaks plain truth and has a childlike joy when it reveals the hypocracy that's present when adults try to censor.  Couldn't be funnier and inventive m'kay.  As for me i just can't get the &quot;don't say ( ); song out of my mind!
B000024D4R|5.0|This is no Wish You Were Here, but it's damn close. Animals is great and infinitely better than the sum of its parts. \\"Dogs\\" is the most underrated Pink Floyd song (even by the band itself), truly one of their best. \\"Pigs (Three Different Ones)\\" and \\"Sheep\\" are both very good also and have particularly sharp guitar work. The lyrics are very strong  on this album -- vividly descriptive and so caustic that you just have to laugh. The guitar is excellent, and the music overall is quite different -- heavier and punklike. Indeed, this was released in 1977, the year the punk  movement broke, and no doubt it had some influence.  This is as close to heavy metal that  Pink Floyd ever got. Of course, it still has their trademark progressive sound. The lyrics also have political  overtones, if you're in to that. Though not their best album, this is quite close, and you should get this masterpiece if you like Pink Floyd.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Britney is the true meaning of propaganda. She is always on TV, radio, and magazines selling the wrong thing. Britney Spears is just as bad as the local drug dealer. Just like the local drug she is pumping truck load of  smack into the youth of America. I am also 18 and I can say that I have  more on my mind than just boys and needing love from a boy. Come on when  are teen performers going to start to helping the youth to over come things  like teen pregnancy, killing on school grounds, not getting a education,  self esteem, and etc. Not all teens are shallow. And now on the music note  the girl can not sing live or studio. I don't care who tells me she can  sing, they're lying. The songs on both of her albums are bad and sick. And  if people really need some good bad a** pop/r&amp;b/rock/whatever buy Janet  Jackson for power.
B00004T8RK|2.0|i dont know what it is, but it seems like pearl jam keeps making these albums layered with noise that mix heavy with the whines of eddie vedder. perhaps their goal has been to shake accessibility. they've succeeded.
B000002UR7|4.0|...IF you are interested in getting into Radiohead, do not even bother getting Pablo HOney...<br />Even the most die-hard Radiohead fans do not like Pablo Honey that much.  Sure 'Creep' was a huge commerical hit, but it is  extremely pop and doesn't represent the quality of music Radiohead produces  in their later two albums.  Pablo is a more buy the book, how to make a  commericially successful album, very pop, very mainstream...nothing really  special...<br />Therefore, buy Pablo if you got some extra cash and already  have the others.  If you are just starting get Bends or OK COMPUTER...you  cant go wrong with either....
B000002O1Q|5.0|I just love this soundtrack, specially the songs from Fire Inc. &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot; and &quot;Tonight...&quot;, I think they're great, and the lyrics are pretty cool!
B000002UJQ|5.0|...After the paramount of an album 'The Bends,' Radiohead outdones itself again buy releasing an album that is at least of equal listening value.<br />Ok computer is definitely a MUST BUY.  It takes the awesome  emo-indie fusion found in Bends and adds in a techno and more electonitic  sound.<br />All songs on this album are awesome.<br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED...BUY  BUY BUY...
B00004T8RK|5.0|In an age where we want instant gratification, it is a relief to find that Pearl Jam is again giving us an album that is not fast food.  This music is to be savored and listened to again and again.  These are incredible songs,  but you have to take the time to really listen.  I have been a fan since  Ten, but frankly, I thought (until now) that Yield was their best album,  their most creative.  After trying this new one, it shows even more  promise.  I can't wait to get there.
B000002TQV|5.0|...Radiohead's follow-up to their pop-hit Pablo Honey is nothing less then classic.  It is deep, musical, simply beautiful.  I highly recommend this album and OK COMPUTER.  Both these albums are just awesome and if you are  just looking into Radiohead now, you have been missing out for a  while...<br />From beginning to end, Radiohead fuses emo and indie sounds to  create this non-stop wall of wonderous sound.  'The Bends,' 'High and Dry',  'Fake Plastic Trees,' the list goes on.<br />HIghly HIGHLY recommended...
B000006045|5.0|its now the year 2000, and two years after this album's release, it still remains the first and foremost in musical innovation and just downright grooviness.  i am a big fan of complicated music.  when a sound, riff or  melody seeps into my listening experience even after hearing it numerous  times before, i think it is the mark of true music genius. and this ablum  does seep, crawl, stalk, flow, seethe, and pulse with sounds, vocals and  beats blended into a never before accomplished masterpiece.  the music is  as layered and complicated as the new NIN cd, but with a groove known only  as trip hop.  this music is cool, cutting edge, dark, erotic and hypnotic.   play it loud at a party for its sheer sound, or low in the middle of the  night with your siginificant other.  a few of the songs with the female  vocalist remind me much of the gothic sound of switchblade symphony, only  with sexier, less dated musical support.  this album never stops, it'll  never leave your cd player.  be prepared.  leave the boy boy bands and all  the mtv trash behind, and come into a world of intelligent, sexy, and  challenging music known as massive attack.........
B000002X2B|5.0|I sit here in my basement, listening for perhaps the 10,293rd time in 20 years to this album and it still sends shivers up and down my spine. It's too bad I'm probably preaching to the choir. <br />You obviously had the  wherewithal to find this album, SO BUY IT! . It only outclasses 99.99% of  the &quot;rock and roll&quot; that's released today, even if it is mostly  acoustic. And if you're not &quot;experienced,&quot; this album will maybe  give you a taste of what you've missed.
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is Metallica, and metal itself, at it's ultimate best.  The poor production does nothing to its edge whatsoever!   You've got the song &quot;one&quot; on this Cd, probably their best hit song of all time( and  NOT Enter Sandman).  For me, the highlights are Blackened, The Shortest  Straw, and Dyers Eve.  Especially Dyer's Eve.  Its explosive anger and its  original and shocking lyrics make it in my opinion Metallica's second-best  song of all time,( next to Disposable Heroes).
B000002UAR|5.0|REVOLVER by the Beatles was a creative turning point in the fab four's career.  Where RUBBER SOUL their first real album, each song virtually a gem, REVOLVER was the same formula, taken a step further.  It also showed  the creative feats the group accomplish when allotted a limited amount of  time.  It is arguably, even in light of the infamous SGT. PEPPER, the  group's finest effort. When REVOLVER was released, the Beatles had gone  through a dramatic change.  They had been using drugs heavily (3/4 of them  had taken LSD) and they began to look at things differently.  This brought  on looking at music differently as well.  It would be a matter of time  before they released their biggest barrier-breaker, SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY  HEARTS CLUB BAND.  But if it wasn't for REVOLVER, that album would never  had been released.  For it is a pre-empt of PEPPER. Enough w/ the history  though, let's get to the album. REVOLVER is a brilliant album.  It's  brilliance is shown not only through the experimentation, but the  consistant quality of each song.  Each song is a classic.  It's also one of  those albums that deamands repeated listenings, bringing on fresh joys with  each listen.  Lennon and McCartney's songwriting differences also begin to  show through this LP.  Lennon is at his psychedelic best with his heavy use  of backward tape loops and druggy vocals.  There's drug hazed   &quot;I&quot;m Only Sleeping&quot; (the group's first use of backward  guitars); the heavy, acidy rock of &quot;She Said She Said&quot; (inspired  by his second encounter w/ LSD); the lyrically strange &quot;And Your Bird  Can Sing&quot; (very impressive guitar work); Dr. Robert, Lennon's tribute  to the acid giving dentist; and the final closing &quot;Tomorrow Never  Knows&quot;, a pure nightmare, 'nuff said.  McCartney is also at his  romantic/pop finest w/ some of his best pop songs ever.  There's the  instant classic &quot;Here, There, and Everywhere&quot; (probably Lennon's  favorite McCartney tune); the child-like favorite &quot;Yellow  Submarine&quot; (Ringo's show tune); the catchy, feel-good, piano based  &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot;; the beutifully sad &quot;For No One&quot;;  the brass filled soul rockin' screaming vocals of &quot;Got to Get You Into  My Life&quot;; and the sad, moving, almost disturbing, orhestra based  &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, one of the group's finest efforts.  Harrison's  songwriting hits a high point as well.  There's the rockin', political  angst of &quot;Taxman&quot; (something we can ALL relate to ;)); Harrison's  first full-fledged indian influenced composition &quot;Love You To&quot;;  and the strange, odd-sounding &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; (great  harmonising though).  Though Sgt. Pepper is a landmark album that broke the  barriers of rock, it only works well as a whole.  Song per song, it's can't  touch REVOLVER.  REVOLVER is consitantly fresh and timeless, and always  will be.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Sounds like her last cd and just as bad!  I'm  surprised that Shania Twain would want such an untalent to sing her beautiful music! (Don't Let Me Be the Last To Know).  What's even worse is that Britney only thanked  Shania's husband for the song and not Shania!  She then had the nerve to  say on television that he wrote all Shania's music, which is untrue.  I  think Britney is jealous of Shania when all she should be is grateful!
0380002930|5.0|My name is Amanda and I am i the 8th grade.  We were required to read this book for the last part of the year.  Oh my gosh!  I fell in love with this book!  I am an animal lover so i probaly liked this book more than other  people, but this book opened me up to some of the challenging hard-ships  animals face.  Bigwig was my favorite rabbit throught out the story because  he is determined, a little wacky at times, and very funny.  I also like the  little fur-top on his head.  This book is a great book if you have the time  to read it and the patience to stick through it.  The reason i say this is  because it is 481 pgs. long....... but it pulls you in as you start to read  it.  So all I can say is....get it, read it, love it!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney Spears has an amazing talent, I know that she is going to be around for a very, very long time.She has a wonderful voice, she is super brite and is one of the coolest people on earth. One of my favorite tracks is &quot;Lucky&quot;.
B00004SCX6|3.0|Britney Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock &amp; roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene. She has nothing to do with Lolita and everything to do with Ann-Margret's  pink capri pants in Bye Bye Birdie. Buddy Holly called her Peggy Sue, Ricky  Nelson called her Mary Lou, the Beach Boys called her Barbara Ann, and her  boyfriend called her at Beechwood 4-5789. It's her party and she'll grind  if she wants to. Shooting at the walls of heartache, bang bang, she is the  warrior.  Britney is a solo starlet working the girl-group shoop shoop, and  if she's no Dusty Springfield yet, she's up there with Lesley Gore, Connie  Francis and Claudine Clark. Oops! <br /> I Did It Again is fantastic pop  cheese, with much better song-factory hooks than 'N Sync or BSB get. The  usual Swedish suspects provide sugary disco bombast along with guest  producers Rodney Jerkins and Mutt Lange. In the terrific title hit, the  music comes from Barbra Streisand's &quot;Woman in Love,&quot; the words  evoke Morrissey circa &quot;I Started Something I Couldn't Finish,&quot;  but that brutal growl is all Britney, articulating a violently ambivalent  sexual confusion her audience can relate to, kicking and screaming for the  right to figure out her desires before the world decides for her. She's in  the dressing room, trying on various styles of adult sexuality that don't  quite fit yet, and her fans know how that feels. As the Crystals used to  sing, girls can tell. <br />You can hear the same fury in her brilliant  version of the Stones' &quot;(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction&quot; as she  vandalizes the words (&quot;how white my shirts could be&quot; becomes  &quot;how tight my skirt should be&quot; -- perfect) and snarls in  libidinal frustration. Let it bleed, Miss B: Clearly it's just a matter of  time before Christina Aguilera strikes back with &quot;Have You Seen Your  Mother, Britney, Standing in the Shadow?,&quot; followed by JessicaSimpson's &quot;Under My Thumb,&quot; Mandy Moore's &quot;Ruby  Tuesday&quot; and the Backstreet Boys' &quot;Back Street Girl.&quot; That's  the great thing about Oops! -- under the cheese surface, Britney's demand  for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true  child of rock &amp; roll tradition.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This album is the best yet...I bought it and cannot stop listening to it. I listen to it while doing homework and before bad, in the car, and when I have some quite time.  It is the bomb!
6303020089|5.0|I'm glad I bought a copy of this movie, because I can watch it over and over again. This has something a lot of action movies forget -- characters you care about. Kimble may be a doctor, but he manages to be an  &quot;everyman.&quot; Just as in the original TV show.<br />Also, you root for  Gerard and all his staff. How did they manage to get such a great  supporting cast for this movie? Not that I'm complaining.<br />The big stunts  are spectacular. But each time I watch this, I most want to see the  staircase chase again. Not to mention the part right after that where  Kimble eludes Gerard by... OK, I'm not going to give that part away.<br />I  just wish they'd make a *real* sequel to this. one with both Tommy Lee  Jones and Harrison Ford.<br />Anne M. Marble Reviewer, All About Romance
6304806426|3.0|I loved this movie and was really excited about getting the DVD.  The sound is great, and I was still satisfied even thought there are absolutely no special features and the transfer is non-anamorphic.  However, there's  something screwy with the layer transfer, so I can only watch up to minute  85:00, and after Chapter 17.  I don't know if this is widespread with  Miramax, but I will think twice before I buy from them again.
1559409002|3.0|Many viewers (including myself) caught this 1962 horror classic many many years ago on TV and some of the horrific imagery has stuck with us ever since.  However, although the film has a lot going for it - the haunting B&amp;W ghouls, the moody organ music, the great Saltair location, etc. - it really doesn't hold up that well dramatically.  Don't want to trash a classic, but there's NO WAY you can't figure this one out in the first 10 minutes.  Still, it's the overall ethereal weirdness and haunting imagery that make it a well-deserved minor classic in the horror genre.  I do think CRITERION's DOUBLE (! ) DVD is a bit excessive, however....why have both &quot;versions&quot; of the film - the theatrical cut and the original director's cut?  Surely, no viewer will bother watching the edited theatrical cut (edited by the distributor to put on a double-bill) when the original director's cut (only 5 minutes longer - and nothing substantial really) is here.  Seems kind of pointless. Also, many of the extras on this Expensive DVD are a bit anal... maybe if I was a REALLY EXCESSIVE FAN of the film, I would want to watch an hour of boring industrial short films made by the company the director worked for....sorry, I don't care if they were made by Kubrick....they're BORING!  Some of the reunion footage of the cast, crew and director in 1989 IS quite interesting...but this DVD easily could have been a One-Disc release.  I feel like Criterion just wanted to milk us for more $$$ by including so much drivel....  I guess in the final analysis, though, Criterion should be commended for doing such a release at all.  If you got the bucks...buy it!
6300214753|5.0|This may just be the best movie ever made. I can watch it over and over and still laugh histerically. Buy this movie  while you still can.
B000002J2F|4.0|With the album &quot;Duke&quot; Genesis moved futher toward becoming the hit machine that they would be by the middle 1980s.  &quot;Misunderstanding,&quot; and &quot;Turn it On Again,&quot; are pure  Phil Collins driven ready made hit singles.  Surprisingly, much of the rest  of the album harkens back to the Peter Gabriel art rock days, especially  the song suite &quot;Duke.&quot;  The first of what would later be many  Collins ballads, &quot;Alone Again,&quot; is the exception.  Overall, this  is one of Genesis's best and most consistent albums.
B00000C28M|5.0|Mr Gould's recording offers something that is hard to come by in the world of Brahms: he understands the music.<br />Mr Gould, trained in the Bachian methods of counterpoint, saw far more music in this piece than any of you  ever will.  He even broke some of the traditional rules to try and prove  his point.  He deliberately alters tempo and dynamics to try and show us  the beauty of brahms, in his hidden melodies and complex structures.  Unfortunately his efforts were wasted.  The masses of &quot;classical music  lovers&quot; failed to see what he wanted them to.  They thought he was  just being difficult, because he wouldn't toss this piece over his shoulder  as a means of displaying his virtuosity, as so many artists do.  It just  goes to show, that you can't trust the public with something as beautifully  complex, musically speaking, as Brahms.<br />I'm sorry for all of you.  Mr  Gould was one of the greatest gifts to the world of music.
B000002GB4|3.0|This was the album in which singer/songwriter/guitarist Tommy Shaw joined the band, adding a new element to their sound.  He responded by composing the epic title track, which is the centerpiece of the album.  Unfortunately, the rest of the album is not nearly as good as the band  still seemed to be searching for a central theme.  The song &quot;Crystal  Ball&quot; is available on any Styx anthology album, which would probably  be a better bet for all except diehard fans.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This cd is the best cd that I have boughtin years because it mixes great music and real-life topics.  This cd also has a great mix of differnt styles of music.  I suggest that you listen to the samples provided before you enjoy this great cd!
B000002J2D|4.0|Phil Collins comes into his own as a singer and  Genesis's new leader on &quot;And Then There Were Three.&quot;  The band begins moving away from the art rock of the old Peter Gabriel days and toward the more pop sound  that would make them superstars in the 1980s.  This album is somewhere in  the middle, and the strong collaborative songwriting from all three members  makes it one of their better albums.  &quot;Follow, You, Follow Me,&quot;  was a minor radio his, and other fines songs like &quot;Snowbound&quot; and  &quot;Deep in the Motherlode&quot; can be found all over this album.  This  is a solid album that is a must for any Genesis fan.
B00004SCX6|1.0|don't say anything at all. But this CD, it's the worst CD I have ever heard. I didn't think Britney could do worse than her first CD, but true to the title, she did it again. What a sad world this is where people with  true talent are out there struggling to get record deals and someone like  Britney who can't sing who sells CDs mostly because of her looks or her  dancing. Since when did dancing have to do with the music industry? And I'm  also tired of reading people's stupid reviews where they get facts wrong.  First of all, Britney's first CD was certified 12x platinum. That doesn't  mean that she has sold 12 million albums, it only means that 12 million of  her albums have been shipped out to stores. In actuality, she has only sold  about 9 million albums (check Billboard's description of platinum if you  don't believe me). Also, she has only had one #1 single, which was BOMT.  Some people are delusional and seem to think that every song she released  as a single went to #1, when in actuality the rest never came close. Sorry  if I burst your bubble gum pop bubble, but these are true facts. I also  can't for the life of me figure out why people say that this is the best CD  ever. Are you really that naive? She co-wrote one song on the album, and  all of a sudden she's some sort of genius? I don't think so. People are  saying that she has such a strong voice and she proves it on this album.  This album just proves that computers can make your voice sound tolerable,  if even that. Have you ever heard her perform live? I have, and I was  practically covering my ears the entire time. Britney Spears is not in the  music business because she likes to sing, have you ever noticed how she  never brags about being a vocalist? If you hadn't already figured it out,  this CD is really bad. Don't waste your money on it.
B000002GB2|3.0|This is the last album recorded before guitarist Tommy Shaw showed up on the scene and changed the Styx dynamic considerably.  It contains several of their best songs &quot;Light Up,&quot; Loreli,&quot; and the  &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; ripoff &quot;Suite: Madame Blue.&quot;  All  of this helped solidify their status as emerging arena rock superstars.  A  lot this album has more in common with the band's less successful early  material, however.  Overall, a good album for fans, but not so much for the  uninitiated.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I must say Britney has done &quot;it&quot; again- she made another good album. But, before i say anything else, i have to say i'm sick of seeing those stupid 1 star or 3 star reviews saying Oops!.. sounds too much like  BOMT or them saying she just plain sucks! i hate that!   Hey y'all, if you  don't like britney's sound or pop music, don't write them dang reviews, or  better yet, stick with your own kind of music. Now, first of all, all the  tracks are good. they're a little more mature than BOMT. and, she sounds  great on every song. <br />1. Oops!...I Did it Again-  great dance number.  but, i must admit that it sounds a little teeny bit like baby one more  time, but this time she's the &quot;bad girl&quot; who &quot;played the  game of love and got lost&quot;. <br />2. Stronger- great song. i think some  people consider this a &quot;sequel&quot; to &quot;...baby one more  time&quot; cos' in ...bomt she wanted another chance but in stronger, she  realizes she doesn't need another chance and that she can make it on her  own.<br />3.Don't Go Knockin' On My Door- cool song. i like the R&amp;B sound  in the song.<br />4.(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction- good cover of the classic  Rolling Stones number. she sounds a little edgy in this song, and that's  what i like bout' it.<br />5.Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know- here it is, the  #1 ballad on the album! good thing she worked with S.Twain and her husband,  they're creativity make the song sound maturer than From The Bottom Of My  Broken Heart.i remember ms. spears said in a tv guide interview that  &quot;she didn't have a strong ballad&quot; on the 1st album. i think  DLMBTLTK is that strong ballad. i think it should be the next  single.<br />6.What U See (Is What You Get)- a good song. i like the &quot;you  can't change me, i like the way i am&quot; message in the song. <br />7.  Lucky- good song. i consider it autobiographical for britney. <br />8. One  Kiss From You- another good song. it sounds like &quot;Soda Pop&quot; and a  ballad versoin of &quot;Thinkin' About You&quot; at the same time.(both of  these songs are from BOMT.)<br />9. Where Are You Now- a beautiful loneliness  ballad. this is a #2 ballad. the other #2 tied with this one is coming  up.<br />10. Can't Make You love Me- another song that says &quot;fame kinda  gets in the way of love&quot;.  otherwise, this song is great.<br />11.When  Your Eyes Say It- if britney ever released this song, it would be a sure  hit. if christina aguilera can score a hit with &quot; I Turn To You&quot;  written by Diane Warren( my favorite songwriter), britney can do the same.  <br />12. Dear Diary- this is the other #2 ballad on the album. it short,  sweet, and beautiful, co-written by ms. spears herself.<br />That concludes my  review. and if you pop haters have anything to say, keep it to yourselfs,  cos' you wouldn't know good music if it smacked you across your nasty  faces! <br />Britney, if you ever read any of those stupid reviews, don't  listen to what they have to say. cos' if you're happy with yourself and  your career, that's all that matters. keep up the good work on your next  cd!
B000002GBB|4.0|If you like &quot;Grand Illusion&quot; (arguably Styx's best album), then &quot;Pieces of Eight&quot; will be right up your alley.  It sounds as if it were recorded in the same studio session.  Styx was into giving their  fans what they wanted at this point--not always a bad thing.  If this  included ultra-pretentious art rock with hard edged guitars and a lot of  synthesizers, so be it.  Tommy Shaw's &quot;Renegade&quot; is probably the  best song here, while James Young's &quot;Miss America&quot; is easilly the  worst (hey, I'm a fan, but JY simply CANNOT sing worth a spit).  Overall,  another good record for the faithfull.
B00000BKDW|5.0|This is an excellent album... the most complete, because you can find very powerful songs like &quot;Aces high&quot; and &quot;Powerslave&quot;, and rhytmic like &quot;2 minutes to midnight&quot; and &quot;Flash of the  blade&quot;, not forgeting the mighty &quot;Rime of the ancient  mariner&quot;<br />Anything that comes from this album is amazing Just listen  it and you will love Maiden forever<br />Up the Irons
B000002GB9|4.0|With &quot;The Grand Illusion,&quot; Styx finally broke through and recorded an album with more than a couple of good songs.  This is not to say that fans of punk or new wave will have much use for its bombast or art  rock pretentions (in 1977, when it was released, it was considered an  instant dinosuar).  Still, some good moments abound here, particularly the  title track and &quot;Fooling Yourself,&quot; which could be an exasperated  adult's ode to a punk rocker.  Bottom line, this is the album for the  unititated to start with since it simply does not get any better.
B0000027F3|5.0|It is a very good album, just hearing &quot;Night crawler&quot; you'll have and idea, but please, listen to &quot;painkiller&quot; and &quot;Touch of evil&quot;<br />NO metal fan won't, better MUST NOT dislike it!
B000002JPA|5.0|This was the first Dream Theater CD I bought, and I've bought everything they've done since. (Including the two Liquid Tension Experiments, which are instrumental only) All the musicians are world class. James LeBrie's  vocals show that he has a good range and excellent control.
B00004SYWZ|2.0|I too, am an A-HA fan, and I have spent many hours checking different web sites waiting for their next CD to come out, when I heard their song Summer Moved On on German radio I was intrigued, even though the boys apparantly  didnt know how to end that particular cut, I keep waiting for the crescendo  and finally the big ending to that particular song but it just keeps going  on and on.  Sure the music and some of the melodies are great to listen to,  but overall I keep waiting for the hooks, the lyrics and harmonies that  stick in your mind and have you humming along through the day, and they  never come.  There was only one track that gave me goosebumps and that was  a slow ballad, that I cant even remember the name of now, I believe it was  the 8th track.  All in All a pretty disapointing outing for the boys  considering the time they had to write and prepare this one, If you want  good writing and good tunes that will haunt you for months and keep you  wanting more try Vertical Horizon.  A-ha has apparantly moved on.
0425173895|5.0|This is a wonderful book--one of Agatha Christie's best, and justifiably famous.  This was one of the last Christie mysteries I read, and I was mortified to find that I figured out who the murderer was early on.   Because of all the hype surrounding this book and its...well, unique  elements (I don't want to give anything away), I found the book somewhat  spoiled for me.  If you haven't read this book, I urge you NOT to read any  reviews of it, because they do inadvertantly spoil it.
B00004SCX6|2.0|Some of the lyrics on this CD are catchy and have good beats, but the lyrics and beats do not compare to those of the first album, and Britney's voice has not matured much at all.  <br />1. Oops!...I Did it Again - This  song is catchy and fun, but it sounds like a poor remake of &quot;...Baby  One More Time&quot;.<br />2. Stronger - This song is very, very catchy and has  an excellent tune. But Britney's voice sounds a bit weak.<br />3. Don't Go  Knockin' On My Door - This one sounds a bit like Destiny's Child, minus the  hip hop and strong vocals... <br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction -  Truthfully, I have never heard the original version of this song by the  Rolling Stones, but I can say Britney's version sounds very dull.<br />5.  Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know - This song is very pretty, but it's a  little out of range for Britney's voice.<br />6. What U See Is What U Get -  Not very catchy, background music sounds a lot like &quot;Oops!...I Did it  Again&quot;.<br />7. Lucky - This song has nice lyrics, and is catchy, but I  don't think Britney's voice was right for the song.<br />8. One Kiss From You  - This song has a very nice rythm to it and Britney's voice works well with  the song.<br />9. Where Are You Now - I like the beat to this song, it's very  pretty and shows off more maturity in her voice.<br />10. Can't Make You Love  Me - This song sounds a lot like Oops, but the beat just doesn't catch on  and the tune isn't all that great.<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It - This is a  very pretty song, and has an excellent tune. You can listen to it over and  over... Britney's voice still doesn't work well with it but the song still  sounds nice.<br />12. Dear Diary - This song has absolutely no catch or  chorus, it just repeats the same verse over and over with different words.  There is no chorus or catchy beat, so I don't really like this one.
B00000DR5D|4.0|If you like Tangerine Dream, you'll love this album.  It sounds great in the car and I'm glad I bought it.
B00000BKDS|5.0|Great... nice beginning... that is still being good. No matter who is in the lineup... Maiden will be forever Maiden.<br />This is a great one, specially, &quot;Phantom of the opera&quot;... Amazing!<br />Go for it!
B00000IQBM|4.0|This is one of the greates horror-movies of all time. The only thing which is keeping me from rating it 5 stars, is that STEPHEN KING's version from '97 is so much better. (I haven't seen this movie in America. In Norway  it's for sale, with a rating for &quot;18 years&quot;.) As said, this a  Stephen King story, and Stanley Kubrick is doing a good job directing this  movie. The scariest scene was of course when the kid &quot;Doc&quot; met  the to twin-girls in the hall. I'm not going to say more. Jack Nicholsen  and Shelley Duvall is great, but as said, it can't beat the '97 recording.
6301976983|5.0|IF EVER THE PHRASE &quot;THEY JUST DON'T MAKE-EM LIKE THEY USED TO&quot;, THIS FILM IS IT! BOGART,HOLT,AND HUSTON(FATHER AND SON)MAKE THIS A WORK OF ART.AND THE ORIGINAL BEING SHOT IN BLACK AND WHITE MAKES IT ALL THE  BETTER.EACH ONE OF THE ACTORS PLAYS THEIR PARTS PERFECTLY.THE SUPPORTING  CAST, ESPECIALY ALPHONSO BEDOYA ARE JUST AS GREAT!  IF ONLY TODAYS UP AND  COMERS WOULD TAKE SOME GOOD 'OLE FASHIONED ADVISE-THE MOVIES OF YESTERDAY  COULD BE THE BEST THING THAT EVER WAS..
0792844882|4.0|Everyone's entitled to their opinion. But at least HAVE YOUR OWN! I have a suspicion that the people who trashed this movie are the kind of people who think a movie is good simply because it's English. The diva mentality in  this movie is delicious, and the slight pornographic flavoring is icing on  the cake. I kept watching to see what happened next. Elizabeth Berkely has  amazing guts. She put her entire heart into this risky film, and while it  is unintentionally campy, (the best camp) it is also a beautifully shot  film, lots of eye candy. Gina Gershon was a goddess, and the whole  sleaze-fest was a ton of fun. Get your noses out of the air you stuck up  critics! Have some fun!
B00004T8RK|5.0|When you think of Pearl Jam, the first thing that would pop in your mind would probably hard hitting guitars. Thats what i remember Pearl Jam for. On their latest album, Binaural, PJ goes in a very different direction.  This album shows the softer and more emotional side of the band. All of the  songs are very unique. Give it a try, but if you're looking for the old PJ,  you're gonna have to realize that they're long gone. They made history with  TEN now they're starting a new chapter in alternative rock.
0385484518|5.0|This book moved me in a way that no other book has.  I first saw the made-for-TV movie.  I cried.  I sat there and realized how much sense this man was making.  He talks about what to worrie about and what to just brush  away.  The context of what he describes as the end was purly heartfelt.  It  is a best seller in every aspect of the word.  I may be only 13 years old,  but I know when something is amazing when I see it. Or in this case read  it.  I recomend it to anyone who is searching for something out of life.   Like I said, I may be 13, but I know that this book is wonderful and very  refreshing.
B00000BKDZ|5.0|This is the best Maiden album... <br />I don't need to say more, because I don't like to talk so much. But if you hear this and don't become a Maiden fan, then you will never be... &quot;Moonchild&quot; is the typical power  first track for an album... Infinite dreams is the slow one who can give  the feeling, Can I play wit madness is a very good song, rhytm and a very  good lyrics make it one of the best... THe evil that men do is the best  one, it has it all, music, feeling, lyrics, power... THe track song,  Seventh son, is he kind of song that is more noise that singing but still  good, The prophecy and only the good die young are great, and the  clairvoyant is the meaning of the complete album.<br />WHat else I can say...  any Maiden fan can agree than since &quot;Seventh son&quot; no other album  has gotten this power.
B00004S369|5.0|This is one of the bes albums ever made.  the difference between the &quot;Limited Edition&quot; and the other edition is the packaging.  The limited edition comes in a gate fold sleeve (much like the record) rather  then a standard jewel case.  The booklet is glued to the case, making it  look and feel more like a book with a CD.  The art work on the CD it self  is even the old &quot;Tamla&quot; logo.  Very good re-release I must say.
0783226888|5.0|this is a great movie. it suprises me how much people rag on this movie being bad. i guess they never actually watch a movie for fun, they look at each detail, i bet they never give any movie with a 'best picture of the  year' award more than 1 1/2 stars.<br />this movie has action, and a big plot,  and a suprising end, and some twists. whats not to like.
B000002BHE|5.0|Never before has Celine had an album so well thought out and organized. Celine will take you though all of your emotions on this album. She'll give you songs to dance to at your wedding like &quot;I Love You&quot;, songs to  make love to like &quot;Seduces Me&quot;, and even songs to help grieve for  the loss of a loved one. &quot;Fly&quot; has done this for me and thousands  of other people. &quot;Fly&quot; has got to be the most touching and  meaningful song ever written. Buy this CD because it will change your life.
B00000BKDV|5.0|The typical Maiden album (Powerful and pure heavy) I don't think there is someone who hasn't heard &quot;Flight of Icarus&quot; without feeling... funny. &quot;Where eagles dare&quot; is amazing... THe trooper... well, is  a classic... what else I can do?<br />Bruce exploted his voice on this  album... this is the best &quot;vocal&quot; album.<br />You should buy it if  you're looking the best Bruce's performance. <br />5 stars... definitely!
6305089957|4.0|&quot;Scream 2&quot; was not as good as the first one, but it's not far away. You'll have to see the first to totally get this, (I will not tell you why, because then I would reveal the whole plot.) but what horror-fan  hasn't. The actors are the same, except for the ones who got killed in the  previous movie. As all the &quot;Scream&quot; movies, it's not related to  something supernatural, but maybe just that makes these movies a litlle  more interesting. (But thank God for not every movie is as &quot;real&quot;  as this one. Just imagine what the world would be without &quot;Friday  13th&quot; and &quot;Nightmare on elm street&quot;) The reason why this  wasn't so good, was simply beacause I didn't get scared as much, but I have  heard people who liked this one best, so I guess you'll just have to see it  yourself, but I promise you...you won't be dissapointed.
B0000025BL|1.0|For it's day the gimmick was a unique one.  Take a huge, overweight, singer with a silly name, give him a set of overblown and pretentious songs, produce said songs with a style so overwrought that it puts Phil  Spector to shame, and have the singer work himself into such a frenzy on  stage that he passes out and is rushed into an oxygen tent for revival.   Remember folks, it was the 70's when mindless excess ruled the day.<br />That  was 20 years ago.  I suppose &quot;Bat Out Of Hell&quot; might serve as an  amusing time piece of sorts for those who weren't there, but for those of  us who were should have no problem giving this the eye roll it deserves and  shaking our heads over its continued popularity.  It takes all kinds.
B000002BQK|5.0|This CD is amazing. Mariah Carey manages to take her classic pop/soul music and add a slight hip-hop/R&amp;B twist. It is much more subtle and appealing than that of Raibow. My All is an incredible original song which  was half what compelled my to buy this Cd. The other half was Honey, which  is an extremely good aand well written/performed ance tune. Once I bought  the Cd, I became hooked on the title tracks sweet beat, music, lyrics and  wonderful message. No one does it like MC. Other highlights include the  highly detailed The Roof, the elegant 4th of July, the vivid Breakdown and  every other song on this CD. This CD is mind blowing!
B00004SCX6|3.0|Sure the song has a catchy beat to it but that's really all there is. There's really no thought put into the lyrics. &quot;Oops...I did it again&quot;...very poetic...this is just one more song to feed to the  teenyboppers. There are a lot of girls coming up behind Britney and I think  she'll be fading behind them in no time. This song is great is you're  looking for meaningless music.
014028009X|4.0|Once I got settled into the unusual format I sat back to really enjoy this book.  I found it very funny.  I laughed out loud many times. I believe that my 3 years spent in London were very important to my understanding her  thoughts and finding them funny. So this makes me think that many  words/parts of this book might not make sense to many here in America. I'd  be cautious in recommending it to my friends as I fear they just wont get  it.  Not trying at all to dumb up America but there are many things she  says that don't make sense in the American vocabulary/way of life.  I found  Bridgets existence very sad at times, made me ponder the values of a person  who spends so many evenings getting drunk at the age of thirty-something.  Yet the author doesn't mention this to be a real problem for her.  Fielding  has her counting her alcohol units when she should be counting how many AA  meetings she's attended that week.  I'll pick up the next book looking for  more laughs and in the hopes that she is able to clean up her act.
B000002KBH|5.0|IT WAS LOVE AT FIRST LISTEN. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST LOVE MUSIC AND THIS ALBUM WILL MELT YOUR SOUL. RIPPLE CONTAINS THE GREATEST LYRICS EVER PUT TO SONG.                                    IT'S JUST A BOX OF RAIN. .  . . .
B000002VQQ|3.0|As a work of art, Patti Smith's &quot;Horses&quot; is most impressive.  Full of passion and undeniably the creative work of a masterful visionary, it is startling, remarkable, and always compelling.<br />Having said that,  however, I've got to admit that it seldom goes for a spin inside my CD  player.  Perhaps it remains in my collection for the prestige and panache  it represents, but on those few occasions I do give it a listen it is only  in bits and pieces given its rather somber, dour and monotonous tone and  its relentless seriousness.  Even its few attempts at flat out rock and  roll (covers of &quot;Gloria,&quot; &quot;Land of A Thousand Dances,&quot;  and the bonus cut cover of &quot;My Generation&quot;) come across just a  little too arty.<br />There is no denying Patti Smith's impact on the music  scene of the past quarter century, and for that she will always have my  unyielding admiration, awe, and respect, but if one wants to catch a  glimpse of good old fashioned rock and roll a la punk, one is best to stick  with debut albums by The Clash and The Pretenders both of whom, of course,  are unimaginable without Patti Smith's remarkable vision.
B000002AVF|3.0|Mariah Carey is more talented than this. This Cd might have produced the wonderful megahits One Sweet Day, Fantasy and Always Be My Baby, but that is all it does. there are 9 other traks which are barely worth listening  too. Open Arms wasn't a great song to begin with, and Underneath the stars  is incredibly soft. The rest of the CD really has no life to it and there  is no point in writing about them.
B00000BKDW|5.0|i dont really consider this one to be Maiden's &quot;best&quot; like some of the other reviezers do. but then again, i dont really consider any maiden albums to be &quot;best&quot; or &quot;worst&quot; or whatever, i  like all their stuff the same, and its all great metal that was way ahead  of its time at the time it came out(and it probably still is now,  considering the garbage that is really big now). Anyway, about Powerslave  itself, its a great cd in just about every way, with intelligent lyrics,  amazing riffs and drumming, and just overall good songs altogether. Buy  this cd now. Dickinson is the man!  UP THE IRONS!
B00004SCX6|5.0|Yeah, Britney's new album is out and rockin!   I think this is one of Britney's best albums!  Even though I don't have the album yet, I would recommed it to anyone!  Britney is awsome!   Oops I did it Again is the  best song(any one who doesn't agree is a dop.)  So, buy Britney's album  now!  <br />By the way Oops I did it Again and Don't let me be the last to  know are the best songs.    <br />So, Oops Britney did it again! <br />Go  Britney, Go Britney
B00001XT76|5.0|Superb effort on the part of Patrick Swayze, Jennifer Grey and Cynthia Rhodes. Full marks to the director and choreographer in an absolute master-piece - Emile Ardolino and Kenny Ortega. Great movie. Only one  observation though. While the movie is recorded 5.1 surround which allows  you enjoy it to the core, the addtional features, which are truly  collector's worth, have been recorded in Prologic mode, with the result you  are forced to listen to the songs in the main film so that you get the  theatrical feeling. In any case, since they are a bonus to the collector, I  guess one can't get too wishful. The DVD is an absolute must buy for all  music and dance lovers......
B0000028VT|5.0|Music Box, which is often overshadowed by Daydream, is Mariah Carey's best work ever. This Cd is inspirational, Happy, sad, lovely, dancy and wonderful all at the same time. Never Forget You, Hero, Dreamlover and Now  That I Know are the higlights. Once I heard Hero, I knew I had to get the  CD. Once I heard Never FOrget You I knew It would never leave my CD Player.  These songs just leave you gasping for breathe because they are so  incredible, original and well-written. It's a shame that only 10 million  people have this in the US. Everyone should own one!
B00002E285|5.0|This is the best Rock Opera ever because it actually has a concept. There is a message inside this movie. It's such an easy concept to grasp. And a lot of people can relate to the feeling of being isolated. If you pay close  attention, there are other hidden messages in the film. There are a lot of  World War II metaphors, which is easy to see. This film is also good  because it illustrates the difficulties and struggles of life from a rock  star's point of view. The animation will truly blow your mind!
0312867123|5.0|Usually I am not a big Science Fiction reader, I generally prefer my improbable book scenarios to be Fantasy. Flash Forward though was recommended by someone who's taste I trust so I gave it a try.<br />The  premise is timely and just believable enough to be frightening. In 2004  Scientists at CERN manage to recreate the moment just after the big bang  with catastrophic results. That I will leave alone for the reader to  discover herself. I can say however that it is a wonderful blend of sci-fi,  mystery, and suspense with just a smidgen of romance. It is a slow starter,  it takes 30 or 40 pages to get into but once past those it is a fantastic,  terrifying must read.
1559408758|5.0|You'll be hard pressed to find this film on DVD anymore.  It is no longer in print, but I dug around and found one still in the shrink wrap.  First of all, this is one of the funniest, most original movies ever.  The team  of Michael McCean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer prove a winning  combination.  A great deal of the script was improvised and is filled with  subtle laughs.  It's an incredibly accurate look at the inner politics of a  rock band.<br />What makes it even better is the ton of extras.  Included on  side two of this DVD is about an hour of grainy bits from the cutting room  floor.  It has feature length commentary by the whole cast, a music video,  and tons of insight on the making of this comedy classic.  You may never  find this DVD new, but dig deep...you may find one where you least expect  it, and it's worth the effort, trust me.
B0000028P8|4.0|This CD proves that Mariah Carey has talent. She can sing, hit the high notes, and put emotion into it too. (no pun intended) She really deserves the fame and success she has gotten, and this shows it.
B000002I2I|4.0|There is just one song on &quot;Morrison Hotel&quot; that reminds very much to their early phase (&quot;The Doors&quot; album), and this is &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot;. The other songs are very blues-related,  although in different ways. &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot;, &quot;Maggie  M'Gill&quot; and &quot;You Make Me Real&quot; are strong blues-rock songs,  &quot;Land Ho!&quot; sounds like a shanty, &quot;Blue Sunday&quot; is a  sentimental (too sentimental!) love song. &quot;Indian Summer&quot; is in a  way similar to it, it's very slow, but also more simple. Altogether, the  Doors have made a very versatile album. Clearly, Morrison is the boss, and  all the songs are centered on his lyrics, so they all last only between two  and four minutes and it's a pity that the other band members did not have  the opportunity for more instrumental parts and perhaps improvisation. But  I would advice anyone who likes the blues to buy this album, although I  don't rate it five stars.
B00000K0EA|1.0|This is sadly and decidedly the last Bond film I will grace with my time.  Pierce Brosnan's suitability to the role notwithstanding (and it is, along with Q's appearance and M's introduction, frankly the only positive in this  entire moronic exercise), this has to be the dumbest, most intellectually  insulting piece of garbage I've seen in years.  The whole movie is one  ridiculously contrived situation after another.  A completely retarded  handcuffed motorcycle scene, a massive cutting machine that can cut through  a warship's hull and innards like butter (jaw-droppingly dopey in itself to  begin with) but gets stopped by a control panel after shredding a villain,  a female martial-artist spy whose combat exploits make Jackie Chan films  look like real-world documentaries but can't even kick her legs enough to  swim to the surface when dropped underwater with her arms tied, an  uber-villain that gets stabbed in the heart and continues to display a  Superman constitution (just about literally)...the list goes on and on and  on (for 2 hours). The sheer scope of stupidity this movie represents, even  when judged against the over-the-top bent of the Bond series in general, is  frankly and utterly vile.  If this is the &quot;new&quot; Bond style, I say  keep it...personally, I'll mourn the death of the series instead.
B000006FNX|2.0|It's so shocking that people just don't get the clue that this film was released to compete against Octopussy, which was an &quot;official&quot; Bond release.  Sean Connery had a truckload of money handed to him by  Warner Bros. with the opportunity to star in the role that made famous.         You can't blame him for doing it, since all men go through some sort of  mid life crisis to recapture the glory of their youth.  Even that reason is  no excuse for the terrible special effects, and the plot is a pathetic  offtake of the original Thunderball, which is arguably one of the greatest  Bond films of all time.        A true Bond film fan would have hurled about  twice as much debris at the screen as I did while watching the film.  There  is no gun barrel image to start the film (a staple of all Bond films),   Connery reads his lines off in a questioning manner, not a dictating one  (which is a main personality trait Bond traditionally has), and as hot as  Kimmy B is, she lacks the true class that the original Domino (Claudine  Auger) carried herself with in Thunderball.  I guess the old Hollywood  T&amp;A actress can still cast a shadow over acting talent in any era (and  don't tell me that she was better in Batman, either).      The movie was an  attempt to make some quick money off a naive movie public who were lured in  by the return of Sean Connery.  And by looking at some of the reviews by  others on this site, it seems to have worked better that Warner Bros. had  planned.  I compare this film to Coke II.  Lots of people said they liked  it, but when it came down to it, the original was still the best.
B00004SZWE|5.0|After listening it in remastered digital format, this recording brings back as well as stirs up emotions about love, hope, compassion, harmony, unity, and friendship. I have forgotten how prolific a songwriter Stevie  was and some of the songs had me in tears on how articulate he can be with  expressing on people's states of mind.  It beautifully summarizes how love  will conquer all and hate is something we can all do without.<br />This is a  recording which no music fan should be without.  Without a doubt, a desert  island disc choice, no question.   <br />I had owned all the 45s from this  album when I was a teen and loved them then.  Now that I can listen to all  them in their full context and glory, it shows why Stevie is the musical  genius that everyone has known him to be.<br />Listen to it and feel the  humanity!
B00000BKE1|2.0|I think this album was a case of a band who were beginning to run low on new ideas.  Only half the tracks are anywhere near Maiden's normal high standards,  Bruce sounds like a cross between Ronnie Dio and Brian Johnson  from AC/DC!     Be Quick, Weekend Warrior and FOTD are the highlights of  this, their 9th studio outing, the rest is mediocre at best.   Not a patch  on 1988's brilliant Seventh Son of a Seventh Son, one of the best albums of  all time in my humble opinion,  the last great Maiden album before this.    The absence of Adrian Smith was beginning to show.    Inspiration was  clearly lacking   (a bit like Rush during the Grace Under Pressure /  Powerwindows era) and Bruce left a year later.    I write this review after  the recent release of the amazing &quot;Wicker Man&quot; single which is  riding high in the U.K. charts and it's obvious Maiden NEED Adrian Smith.    He is the main cog of the band in my opinion, and their best songs are  penned by or with him, as well as the best guitar solos (Alexander the  Great should prove this) FOTD conjures up hideous and embarrassing images  from the 80's of Ronnie Dio fighting enemies with swords and defending  castles, if you see what I mean!  It's just too naff!   Maiden are much  better than this,  as the new Brave New World album will show. All bands  have low points, and this album is one of theirs.  But I think after the  effort and sheer hard work that they have put in to British music in the  past 20 years we can forgive them. Up the Irons!
B0000004V2|5.0|When I first listened to this album over ten years ago I firmly believed that I was in possession of the finest rock debut album ever.  It was certainly the finest one I had encountered.  I am now over forty and have  changed my opinion of The Stone Roses somewhat.  I now believe this to be  the finest rock album ever.  The sound captured the essence of a  fleeting  era in music; the Manchester Scene. But it has turned out to be so much  more than that as it has retained it's vitality years later. It appears as  if the music has a timeless quality on par with it's defining quality in  1989. It had few rivals in it's day and far fewer now.  Perhaps only  Pills  Thrills and Bellyaches or Screamadelica or for me, at least, New Order's  Technique could claim parity status.  I am grateful for all the lyrics,  guitar riffs and dancing pleasure that this recording brings.  But I can't  help but wonder what might have been had there been a bit more from them.   It is truely amazing that most of America missed this one.  In the end  though all that matters is the music and this one is a melodic masterpiece  meant from the very beginning to be adored.
6305428220|3.0|The 'Buffy' set arrived at high school, with the main characters being shown aka 'Trainspotting' style; the quiet one, the popular one, the scary one, the new one...and of course, captain of the football team.    Circumstances...i.e. teachers being overtaken by alien creatures...brings  them all together to try and save the school and, of course, the world.    The best performance was from the high school coach...the liquid terminator  in Terminator 2...that man is just scary!   It was predictable throughout,  until the nice littletwist at the end.   A decent enough film for a  Wednesday night.
0800141660|5.0|My family and I enjoy quiet, well-done proformances, and this is the best one we have come across for a long time (with the exception of &quot;Little Women&quot; starring Wynona Rider)  I really like it beacuse the romance is  not too steamy, and everyone in the film remembers their manners.  Emma  Thompson does an excellant job as the eldest sister.  For anyone looking  for a clean family movie, select &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; you will  not be dissapionted!
B000002OX7|5.0|No one is next.  Because being next would certainly mean having to follow a strong act, and most who would try will come up short.  This is one of the seminal albums in the history of rock music.<br />We all get to hear  &quot;Baba O'Reilly&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; with some  regularity on oldies stations.  There is so much more here, though.  Those  classics are supported by other driving rock, like &quot;Bargain&quot;,  &quot;Gettin In Tune&quot; and the sweet starting, but hard finishing  &quot;Behind Blue Eyes&quot;<br />Another one of those desert island albums.   A collection of rock music cannot be complete without this  masterpiece.<br />Sheer sonic power.  'nuff said.
B000002LCK|4.0|I waited a while to finally buy this double CD '80's compilation from one of the decade's groups that best defined British Techno-Rock-Pop.  I had already owned both (The Best and The Rest Of) New Order albums, which I  enjoyed immensely. But when I decided on Substance, I was glad to hear that  from '80 to '87, New Order's song catalog included the full whole entire  original &quot;Blue Monday&quot;, as well as two songs that I had already  heard on late-night radio in '95, &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot; and the  original extended version of &quot;True Faith&quot;. They sure sound pretty  cool, and off of the first disc, I also like &quot;Temptation&quot;,  &quot;Confusion&quot;, &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;, &quot;Perfect  Kiss&quot;, and especially &quot;State Of The Nation&quot;. As for the  second disc of B-sides, I like &quot;The Beach&quot; which is essentially a  &quot;Blue Monday&quot; instrumental, and the other two   &quot;Confusion&quot; and &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; without words also  sound quite funky. &quot;Shame Of The Nation&quot; is good too, but the  last track, the original &quot;1963&quot; pales in conparison to the '95  version off of &quot;(The Best Of)&quot;. So, in conclusion, I appreciate  the song quality of both this collection and the aforementioned two with  colored sqiggles, Best and Rest. New Order has never disapointed as far as  I'm concerned, get this double CD set soon!
B00004SCX6|4.0|I received this CD today. It was very good but I think the first one was better. I still give it 4 stars though! Keep up the good work Britney!
B00003W8NM|5.0|The Movie:  Fight Club is the story of the every man - Jack, who like most of us clocks in every day to a job, defines himself by what he owns, and simply does not sleep well. Jack finds solitude in myriad of support groups, everything from Men with Testicular Cancer, Sycle Sell Anemia  Support Groups, and of course both Blood and Brain Parasite Support Groups.  Jack doesn't have the ailments associated with each group, but he isn't  exactly well either. Through a series of events Jack meets Tyler Durden and  through Tyler he finds Fight Club, a much different kind of support group.  I would say more, but as you will find out.... &quot;The First Rule of  Fight Club is- You Do Not Talk about Fight Club&quot;.<br />Fight Club is an  in your face adrenaline filled movie, which isn't afraid to laugh at itself  and at us. It's part action film, part satire, part comedy. A strange and  unique blend that really works.  If you haven't seen Fight Club, be  prepared, it's a movie that definitely has to grow on you. The first time I  saw this film in the theaters I had a mixed reaction to it. Then I read the  book by Chuck Palahniuk, and began to find myself really liking the story.  By my third enthusiastic viewing on DVD I realized that Fight Club is one  of those movies that truly improves with time and repeat viewing.<br />The  Picture: On DVD Fight Club looks great. Fight Club is presented in its  theatrical aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and is enhanced for Wide Screen TV's.  Having seen Fight Club in the theaters I was particularly impressed with  the films transfer on to DVD. Fight Club is a very dark film with a lot of  deep dark tones. The transfer to DVD masterfully reproduces these dark  tones in a very clear and clean way while still maintaining the gritty feel  of the movie.<br />The Sound: Fight Club features truly fantastic 5.l Dolby  Digital audio track which is used very well by both the movies sound  effects and the excellent score by the Dust Brothers. A nice feature (if  you have the equipment to support it) is the main Dolby Digital 5.1 audio  track is THX EX enhanced - Which basically means it has an additional rear  center channel. Fight Club is THX certified, I wish more of the the THX  certified movies looked and sounded this good.<br />The Extras: Fight Club is  so packed to the gills with special features, I found myself spending as  much time watching the special features as I did the movie. The best  special features are the 4 audio commentary tracks on the DVD. It was quite  a task listening to ALL 4 commentary tracks, and I'd recommend spacing them  out a bit. The two tracks I liked the best were the main Commentary track  with David Fincher and the second track with David Fincher, Brad Pitt,  Edward Norton, and Helena Bonham Carter. There are so many layers to this  film and these two tracks really flesh out many of the subtleties and  meaning which make Fight Club such an amazing movie. I was less enthralled  by the track with Chuck Palanhiuk and Jim Uhls which sounded like buddies  watching a football game, and when I got to the crew's audio track I was  simply burned out.<br />The Second Disc in this 2 disc set is devoted entirely  to extras. Be warned, this DVD has so many features and so many options  it's almost impossible to get through. While I admired the uniqueness of  the way the Making of Fight Club Features were presented (with multiple  camera angles and audio tracks), I found the experience of watching them to  be disjointed. I was so overwhelmed by option and selections that it really  didn't end up being an enjoyable experience. I think the Making of Fight  Club Features are a great example of DVD technology being over used and  getting in the way of the enjoyment of the material. I would have much  rather seen a more compiled making of documentary over the fragments  presented on this DVD.<br />When Fight Club was announced I got the impression  that there would be many more Outtakes and DeletedScenes. There are only 7  fairly short deleted scenes, most of which compare the deleted scene with  the scene that ended up in the movie. With so much room on the second DVD I  would have liked to see more Outtakes and Bloopers (like on the Criterion  release of Armageddon). <br />If you are a fan of trailers and promos, you'll  be in heaven with Fight Club. I don't think I've ever seen such an  extensive collection of promotional materials including: Teasers, Trailers,  TV Spots, Internet Ads, PSA, Posters, Lobby Cards and even the Film's Press  Kit. Of special note are the Fight Club Internet Ads which are extremely  entertaining as well as 2 PSA's which are just hilarious. Conclusion: Fight  Club is a really exceptional DVD due mostly to the superb film and sound  transfer. It is packed with special features, but quantity in this case  doesn't necessarily mean quality. I spent a great deal of time with Fight  Club, much more than almost any other DVD that I own, but not all of that  time was quality time. Especially on the second DVD, I found myself  spending a lot of time just flipping around trying to figure out what I was  watching. If Fox had released Fight Club with the great picture and sound  and only 2 of the commentary tracks, a solid making of documentary and the  deleted scenes, on one DVD, it would have been enough, the rest is bonus.  <br />Review Reprinted from DVD Talk.
B00000JZI9|5.0|Lawrence Kasdan has made this wonderful, light tribute to the great old westerns of old.  He has assembled a great cast, including Scott Glenn, Kevin Kline, an incredibly young Kevin Costner (before he started taking  himself so damned seriously), Danny Glover, and Brian Denehey (as a really  great bad-guy sheriff).<br />The good guys are on their way to the town of  Silverado, where they do good (by coming to the aid of D. Glover), save  Costner from a wrongful hanging, rescue a band of settlers from evil  swindlers, meet up with family and potential friends and slay the bad  guys.<br />Fine dialogue, great cinematography, a story that also honors the  tradition of the genre without taking itself too seriously.  A fun way to  spend a couple of hours.
B00004SCX6|5.0|A great album by Britney Spears.  Here is the breakdown of the songs:<br />1.  Oops!...I Did it Again: For the few who haven't heard this song, it is about a girl who plays with and breaks guys hearts.  A cool song with a  cathcy hook.<br />2.  Stronger: Fun song...nothing very memmorable here.<br />3.   Don't Go Knockin' On My Door: Good song with a cool beat.  This song is  similar to Stronger in the sense that it is about a girl telling this guy  to go away after he hurt her.  This song sorta reminds me of &quot;Are You  that Somebody&quot; by Alliyah.<br />4. (I Can't Get No) Satisfaction: Great  remake!  I didn't think she could pull it off but she took this song and  made it completely her own.  Her voice sounds so good in this song.<br />5.   Don't Let me Be the Last to Know: This song sounds like something Shania  Twain would sing (she co-wrote it).  A nice ballad.<br />6.  What U See (Is  What U Get): A pretty forgettable song about this girl telling her  boyfriend to accept her the way she is.<br />7.  LUCKY:  The BEST song on the  album!   I am obsessed with this song!  It is so good...I play it back to  back to back over and over again!  The lyrics are of a girl whom everyone  thinks she has it all but in reality is unhappy.  The song has a great hook  and Britney sounds really really great on this song.  I hope she makes it a  single because it is destined to become a hit.<br />8.  One Kiss From You:   Probably my favorite ballad on this cd.  Very nice song.<br />9.  Where Are  You Now: Pretty ballad.<br />10. Can't Make You Love Me: In my opinion, this  is the worst song on the disc.  It makes references to Lucky because the  girl is saying she has all this money and fame but she can't make her crush  love her...very mediocre.<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It:  Good ballad written  by Dianne Warren.  The beginning sounds like &quot;You're Still the  One&quot; by Shaniah Twain.<br />12. Dear Diary:  The song Britney (co)wrote.   The lyrics are pretty dumbin my opinion but her voice sounds really nice  and soft in this song.<br />A great album that definitely shows Britney with a  more mature style and voice.  If you liked her debut you should definitely  get this cd.  Even if you don't like Britney, give it a try!
0767849493|5.0|This was one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Its right up there with the play &quot;Do Patent Leather Shoes Really Shine Up,&quot; for anyone who is or grew up Catholic. I highly recommend this movie. But  remember to pay attentiion to all the quick one-liners, because they really  add to the movie.
6305903182|5.0|I saw this movie 5 times wich is the most I've ever seen a film in the theatres, ever. This film just gets better and better everytime i see it, Despite the horrible movie theatre audience. If you didn't like Scream 2  and don't think that you'll like this one, your wrong. I had a friend who  hated the 2nd one and by the time we were in Sunrise Studios he loved it.  Parker Posey deserves the MTV Award she's nominated for. Everyone go vote  for her for best comedic performance. She was so funny in this film. I  can't wait to see the dvd. I just hope that the rumored features are real.
0440234743|4.0|Don't listen to the cynics.  This is another great book from Grisham.  Even though I consider 'The Partner' and 'The Firm' to be his better works, this one got plenty of Grisham's talent.  <br />I read it on my way to and  from work; made my commute a lot  more interesting -- and  shorter.<br />dzorin@hotmail.com ==================================<br />To the  editor: if possible, please include my email as part of my review.
B000002B2T|4.0|this cd is really good, it's calm grunge, I wish that they would do another cd but unfortunately the bass player died some time ago. It unites two of the best singers around: lanegan and staley, also it has mcready  from pearl jam, an outstanding guitarist, so that combination you know it  will instantly work, the best songs are I'm above, river of deceit, long  gone day and wake up, a pretty good effort in general, almost a perfect  combination of sounds from 3 different bands. if you like alice in chains,  pearl jam, or screaming trees slow songs you'll like this.
B00003CWL5|5.0|Many people misunderstand the purpose of the explicit nature of this film.  Personally, I feel that this film is making fantasies into realities and conflict as to aid in one man's discovery of life.  Spacey is supposed to  represent the conglomerate of all male apprehensions and fantasies that  coincide with middle age.  This film displays all of the fears and feelings  he has being a middle-aged father in suburbia.  All of his impulses become  realities and eventually lead him to see the inherent beauty infused into  life.  This movie's purpose was not to be vulgar, nor to offend the  squeamish.  It was supposed to display one man's quest to discover the  wonder of life.  I recommend this movie to anyone who will try to watch  with an open mind and not cringe at the slightest deviation from normalcy.
B00000BKDV|4.0|This album is the album that came in between my two favourite Maiden albums - Powerslave and Number of the Beast. <br />Although this album IS classic Maiden, and it does feature some of Maiden's best material, not  every track is 'up there' with the likes of 'Number of the Beast', 'Run to  the hills', 'Aces high' and 'Powerslave'.<br />The first five tracks are  amazing, and if the rest had been of similar quality this would be 'up  there' with 'Number of the beast' and 'Powerslave', but the other four  tracks are just average, and are not really all that memorable. That is why  I had to give the album four stars.<br />This is definitely one for the  collection, but get Number of the Beast and Powerslave first.<br />This was  the first album with what is in my oppinion the 'classic' Maiden Lineup.  Bruce on vocals, Adrian and Dave on guitar, Steve as always on the bass and  Nicko on Drums. I am glad that this lineup is now back together with an  additional guitarist. Having three guitarists may seem unnecessary to some,  but three guitarists means three part guitar harmonies and maybe even  TRIPLET GUITAR SOLOS!<br />Anyway, UP THE IRONS
B00004SCX6|5.0|BRITNEY SPEARS IS THE COOLEST TEEN IDOL OUT THERE!FROM HER MUSIC TO HER ATTITUDE SHE ROCKS! BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU ARE INTO HER. OOPS...I DID IT AGAIN IS TRULY THE BEST CD OUT RIGHT NOW! WAY TO GO BRITNEY!
B00000BKDS|4.0|This was the album that began Iron Maidens ascent to metal superstardom. This album has some great songs on like 'The phantom of the opera', 'Running free' and 'Iron Maiden'. However, before Bruce joined Maiden (no  disrespect to Paul Dianno, he did a great job), iron maiden were A great  heavy metal band, rather than THE great heavy metal band. Had Maiden  carried on like this they would have been big but not the HEAVY METAL  LEVIATHAN they are today.<br />On this album we get our fist glimpse of one of  the elements that made Maiden so good, Steve Harris's bass playing. Steve  Harris shows the world how basslines should be, i.e. an instrument of equal  importance to the guitar rather than a mere shadowing of whatever the  guitarist is playing. Steve Harris is one of the best bess players of all  time, in the bass playing elite along with Joey DeMaio of Manowar, Stu Hamm  and Billy Sheehan.<br />This is a very good album and deserves a place in any  metal warrior's CD collection, but don't even try to compare it to Number  of the Beast.
B00004SCX6|5.0|If her first album sold 12 milion then this one, which is infinitly better, is most likely gonna do even better. The slow songs on this are better then the lame ones on her first.<br />1. Oops!...I Did It Again-I dig  this, nice beats peppy song. 2. Stronger-This is a real cool song, the  steady beat is sweet. 3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door-This has an R&amp;B  feel, it reminds me of Destiny's Child. 4. (I Can't Get No)Satisfaction-I  didn't really like this one, a girl would like this more I guess. 5. Don't  Let Me Be The Last To Know-This is the one with Shania, and it's actually a  good slow song. 6. What U See (Is What U Get)-It starts off like Oops! but  gets even better, it shows Brit's great voice. 7. Lucky-The beginning  reminds me of the classic &quot;Stand By Me&quot; but this isn't a classic.  8. One Kiss From You-A girl would like this more. 9. Where Are You Now-Slow  song, nice beat, another that shows off her great voice. 10. Can't Make You  Love Me-Cool song, I dig the beats. It reminds me a little of &quot;Larger  Than Life.&quot; 11. When Your Eyes Say It-It's got too many interludes of  talking, so the beat is disjointed but vocals are ok. 12. Dear Diary-More  of a melodic story then a song, the piano in the back is a nice touch. I  really think that its more girl oriented, but I still liked it.<br />Thats it,  you get all that plus pics of Brit in the booklet. =)
B0000027F3|5.0|This album is VERY VERY METAAAAAAAAAAAL!<br />I have been a Judas Priest fan for some time and have heard a lot of their albums but I have to say that this is proabably the best. This is Judas Priest's heaviest album with Rob  Halford. <br />From the opening drum frenzy of the first track 'Painkiller' to  the last chords of 'One shot at glory' this is classic heavy metal. This  album is very heavy but maintains all of Priest's trademark excellent  musicianship. Every song on this album is as awesome, but some stand out as  being better than others. Most of the songs on this album are great metal  songs, but 'Painkiller', 'Nightcrawler' and 'Metal Meltdown' are  abseloutely anthemic!<br />This is a great album for people who like their  metal heavy, yet it is equally good for those who like thier metal to be  traditional.<br />Five stars of heavy metal for this one! Buy it!
0767803434|5.0|I am a big fan of Harrison Ford's movies, and Air Force One is no acception. There is tons of action, and the story is great. I honestly couldn't imagine any other actor being able to pull this role off, Harrison  Ford was perfect as the President.
0451167716|5.0|This is the book that swept the world. This book turned into three classic movies. The story of Don Corleone and his children made for a spellbinding reading experience. The trials and challenges of running a crime syndicate  are profiled well in this book. During the time that Vito is down due to  being shot, Sonny attempts to lead the family but loses his life due to the  treachery of Connie's husband. This brings about the return of Michael who  was forced to leave the due to killing a police captain. Michael takes over  the leadership reins of the family after the death of the family. After  this Micheal is able to take total control of the Syndicate due to some  well planned assasinations. This book is classical,legendary, any other  term this is complimentary that you can apply to it. Read this book, it is  truly a classic.
B00004SCX6|2.0|this cd was over an OK cd... however, there were some pretty bad songs such as (I can't get no) Satisfaction she totally ruined the song. Also, some songs there were a lot of computerization in it and it made her sound  worst! Some of her songs are OK like Lucky. The upbeat songs are pretty  good but the slow songs just makes me fall asleep. Overall, this is an OK  album but it's worst than the last one, that's all I gotta say.
6305342776|4.0|Ok, so the dialogue isnt the greatest, the acting is a little stiff, and sometimes you can see the strings holding up Vincent and his Texan counterpart, but this is one of those movies that shouldnt be taken  seriously anyway!  Speaking of Vincent, quit picking on him!   I thought he  was cool, a lot less annoying of a kid's immick than Jar-Jar! (if maybe a  tinge too philosophical...)  Even into the new millenium I think most of  the FX and set designs hold up very nicely to today's movies (the black  hole itself and the meteor are still stunning).  This is really more of a  kid's sci-fi movie, and truthfully it made me feel like one again watching  it!  Mix together Lost In Space (for storyline and characters) , 2001 (for  visuals) , and Star Wars (set/costume design) and you get the Black Hole.   Also worth watching to see Norman Bates and Ernest Borgnyne as astronauts!    Dont take this movie too seriously and you'll love it...trust me!  DVD  version picture was nice and crisp, sound was as good it probably was in  its day,  but a la cheap-o Disney, don't expect any worthwhile extras (like  all their other dvd's).  I think this movie was more enjoyable and better  than the Phantom Menace...honestly!
B00004SCX6|1.0|This is horrible singign, the songs are tolerable, but her voice is so horrible, even with the computerized &quot;melodrama&quot;. If you like Birntey and anticipate a thirfd album too, to be even better. Well, third,  seconds, or even first time isn't and won't be the harme for someone with  such a horrilbe voice!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Reading through Moby's collection of short essays included in the MOBY'S &quot;PLAY&quot; CD booklet, you feel Moby's perspective on mood, depth, and inner peace. Especially, the piece on MOBY'S PLAY CD Track # 3:  Porcelain. Buddhists should be aware of Moby's diveristy and interest in  preserving his choice of living a life in devotion to the inner spirit and  awareness of himself. Moby is a vegetarian after I read through his CD's  booklet, I learned what kind of person he was. His music talks to the  spirit and provides a sense of inner peace. I highly recommend this album  to those who are interested in thoughtful and question answering music.  Moby is truly a talented individual who seeks inner peace within himself  and share this music with the world. Beautiful music!
B00004STPT|5.0|Having seen the movie, I was anxious to get the soundtrack.  In spite of the quotations from Holst and perhaps Wagner, there is still much originality in this music.  Many of the pieces are quite powerful and  moving.  I especially like &quot;The Battle&quot;, &quot;Patricide&quot;,  &quot;The Might of Rome&quot;, &quot;Slaves to Rome&quot;, &quot;Barbarian  Horde&quot;, &quot;Am I not Merciful?&quot;, and &quot;Elysium&quot;.  The  rest of the pieces serve to tie together the album and to provide some  additional ambience, and are good in their own right.<br />The peformance is  excellent and well recorded.  The album conveys quite a bit of the emotion  of the screenplay itself and evokes the grandeur and tragedy of the story  and of the Roman times (at least a small part of the Roman times).  I  highly recommend this recording.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This is a great fantasy adventure! One of the things I liked most is the star being a girl, rather than a boy.  She makes all the hard decisions and does all the right things to get her baby brother back after she, in a  moment of frustration, allows him to be kidnapped by the Goblins. David  Bowie as the Goblin King is wonderful and does a great job. The puppets are  also great and very believable.  I loved this movie.
0767836324|4.0|Remaking a fairy tale into a live action film is very dangerous.  Steven Spielberg has done a pretty good job doing it.  In this movie, he captures the spirit of Peter Pan quite nicely, with breathtaking visual effects and  wonderful scenery.  Robin Williams did an OK job in this movie, but not one  of his better performances.  As for Julia Roberts, I would have to say that  her as Tinkerbell was the low point of her acting career.<br />Whoever says  this movie is &quot;for the entire family&quot; is wrong.  This is not one  of Spielberg's greatest works which is probably why it is not popular.  This is no E.T.  Most adults won't enjoy this mind fluff.  Still, it's a  fun and harmless movie, you just need a really BIG imagination to enjoy it.  Slightly reccomended.
B000002J29|4.0|I am as ever a huge fan of earlier Genesis, and no more so than of this album.  As I opened the CD packaging, I salivated over how good the &quot;Definitive Remastered Edition&quot; would sound.  Sorry but it  disappointed me.  You could say it comes down to a matter of personal  taste, or of how expensive your stereo equipment is, but I just couldn't  hear/feel the bass half as much as with the LP.  Granted I could go buy a  subwoofer, but previously I wouldn't have needed to in order to feel the  earth shaking bass and bass pedals of Michael Rutherford throughout these  songs.  That feel is part of what made the album for me. On the other hand,  I never heard cleaner mid and high end sound on a live recording.  From  that point of view the remastering truly succeeded.  Yet they could have  still brought the low end up without compromising too much - listen to  &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; for a shining example.  Oh well,  maybe I will go buy a subwoofer and tick off my neighbors.  That way I  could also listen to Rush's &quot;Signals&quot; as it's intended.The bottom  line is, with a less than expensive/bulky stereo this package merits 4  stars; otherwise it's an obvious 5!  I will always get goosepimples and  feel flushed hearing the last section of &quot;Supper's Ready&quot; ...
6305232660|5.0|This is one of those few distaster movies that actually has a plot.  As the end of the world is near, we see characters with REAL emotions.  There is a little action, but the movie focuses more on the emotional impact and  panic that people feel when they know or they think they are about to die.  This movie attempts to be a real teer jerker, and it mostly succeds.  A  well done disaster film and much better than Armageddon.  Some people may  not like it because it may not be what they were expecting, the movie can  get sappy at times trying to drain all the teers from our eyes it  can.<br />Overall, a very good movie.  The DVD has 2 trailers and is otherwise  featureless.  Still, highly reccomended.
B0000025OP|5.0|As these reviews pile up, they sort of cancel each other out. One person's 5-star manna is another's 1-star manure, and when you're dealing with someone like Dylan, there will always be big fans and casual disses for  most every album.<br />I will say this: Planet Waves is my favorite Dylan  album, and one of my favorite albums by anyone, ever. I love Dylan to  death, I'm a hopeless rock-and-roll fan, and in all my years of listening  to and being knocked out by albums, very few have ever filled me with as  much sheer musical joy as this one does.<br />It's impossible for me to put  this on and not jump around the room, flail and dance wildly, and howl  along at the top of my lungs. It's been that way since I first started  listening to my mom's LP back in high-school, and I love the album just as  much today.<br />Obviously, not everyone will have the same experience. But,  for me, Planet Waves is a one-of-a-kind record: a wild, inspired,  off-the-cuff affirmation of the pure delight and transporting power of  rock-and-roll, played by people who live and breathe it, FOR people who  live and breathe it. A sweaty, rollicking musical powder-keg; light the  fuse, and explode!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Most of the Critics who tore this movie apart were not doing their jobs correctly.  This is because they were hating it for personal reasons.  For example:  &quot;this movie discriminates twords women&quot; or &quot;it  glorifies violence.&quot;  First of all, it does neither.  It is a daring  and fun ride through the the human mind.  It is a psychological and daring  thriller that says a LOT about our society and doesn't blind us from the  truth.  Another good thing about this film is that it doesn't censor  itself, it says what it wants and it's not scared to.  It's a mind trip  that is hard to look away from once you're watching, it's like a drug.  It  is also one of those movies that puts you in it's world and doesn't let you  out until the ending credits.  Not to mention that there are some very  amusing parts to this movie that will have you nervously laughing.  PLUS,  after reading the book I'd have to say that it follows it pretty  well.<br />MOST HIGHLY RECCOMENDED.  Oh, and check out the 2 disc DVD special  edition, this baby's loaded!  Probably the most extensive special edition I  have seen!
B00001U0GQ|5.0|Of course, the movie is great, the cinematography is simply marvelous, and I could watch Madeline Stowe all day long......But that isn't the reason I wanted to jump into reviewing this movie. I wrote to see if anyone besides me sees Hawkeye as the first movie hero portrayed as a sixties-type  counterculture freak. The figure of Hawkeye is drawn here as a kind of  counter-cultural anti-hero.<br />Here he is, a long-haired non-conformist, a  white man scorning the ways of colonial life, choosing instead to live the  Indian way among kindred spirits (the Mohicans). He lives in harmony with  nature,  owning only what he can carry with him. His values are not those  of the white man, not those of the colonial farmer, and certainly not  those of the despised \\"Yankee trader\\", who greedily attempts to exploit the  local environment in order to maximize whatever material wealth he can  glean from it .<br />For Hawkeye and the rest of the Indians, such values  make no sense. What, for example, is the purpose in owning more things than  one can use?  Instead, he follows a more aesthetic philosophy, employing a  minimalist value system  allowing him to live off the the land without  exploiting it beyond its limits. Gotta set his soul free?<br />Meanwhile, he  heaps scorn on the ways of the crazy white man, whose life and values seem  to make no sense. Unlike Cora, Hawkeye moves effortlessly through the  wooded landscape, viewing reality through the very practical lens of  experience and Indian wisdom. He doesn't attempt to interpret the world  through some inappropriate value system such as English culture.  Instead,  he uses local values, customs, and folkways to great personal advantage by  employing them in an active attempt to interact as meaningfully as possible  with the evolving circumstances, whether it be with Cora, the Camerons, the  Hurons, or the military.<br />Thus, Hawkeye as portrayed in this movie  represents a perfect model, whether intended as such or not, of the  consummate counter-cultural man. His views are those of the 1960s freaks;  a no-bull..., no-complications, lets-live-for-today concentration on  living in the present moment. he is neither racked by torment, nor by  regret over misdeeds in the past, nor is he filled with dread or self-doubt  about the future. He lives with no apparent illusions, with no apparent  aspirations, no personal ambitions or career plans. He seems in touch with  his feelings (his \\"inner child?\\"), and he shows a range of emotions all the  way from gentleness toward loved ones and a reverence for all living things  to the other side- he's willing to deal aggressively with any perceived  threats emanating from outside sources.<br />This new movie Hawkeye is a  marvel to behold; an idealized man who never makes a false step. He  recognizes his dependence and obligations to others, such as his adopted  Mohican father Chingachook and his blood-brother Uncas.  He acts  immediately on his attraction to Cora as their romance develops. His  actions are all consistent with his stated values; i.e. they serve to move  him aggressively but purposefully through whatever environment he finds  himself in.<br />He understands that his values are not always the same as  the values of those of others with whom he must interact, yet he makes no  effort to attempt to change their attitudes or ideas, nor does he interfere  with these individuals in pursuit of their goals unless their acts somehow  threaten or impede him.  When it's appropriate, he's quite able to explain  his motives, attitudes, beliefs, and values, as he does to the English  major who mistakenly believes him to be an Indian scout.<br /> So dear reader,  what do you think. have I been sitting out in the sun listening to old  CSN&amp;Y records too long, or do you think Michael Mann slipped us a fast  one? Far out!t, of the  consummate counter-cultural man. His views are those of the 1960s freaks;   a no-bull..., no-complications, lets-live-for-today concentration on  living in the present moment. he is neither racked by torment, nor by  regret over misdeeds in the past, nor is he filled with dread or self-doubt  about the future. He lives with no apparent illusions, with no apparent  aspirations, no personal ambitions or career plans. He seems in touch with  his feelings (his \\"inner child?\\"), and he shows a range of emotions all the  way from gentleness toward loved ones and a reverence for all living things  to the other side- he's willing to deal aggressively with any perceived  threats emanating from outside sources. <br />This new movie Hawkeye is a  marvel to behold; an idealized man who never makes a false step. He  recognizes his dependence and obligations to others, such as his adopted  Mohican father Chingachook and his blood-brother Uncas.  He acts  immediately on his attraction to Cora as their romance develops. His  actions are all consistent with his stated values; i.e. they serve to move  him aggressively but purposefully through whatever environment he finds  himself in.    <br />He understands that his values are not always the same as  the values of those of others with whom he must interact, yet he makes no  effort to attempt to change their attitudes or ideas, nor does he interfere  with these individuals in pursuit of their goals unless their acts somehow  threaten or impede him.  When it's appropriate, he's quite able to explain  his motives, attitudes, beliefs, and values, as he does to the English  major who mistakenly believes him to be an Indian scout.<br /> So dear reader,  what do you think. have I been sitting out in the sun listening to old  CSN&amp;Y records too long, or do you think Michael Mann slipped us a fast  one? Far out!
B0000039QP|2.0|I accidently bought this edited version instead of the explicit version. The songs are pretty good but most of it is edited and about half the album is dropped from the explicit version! If you want this album, don't get  this version of it!
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I remember sitting through this movie with my long-time ladyfriend, both of us totally entranced by its sheer power to captivate and entertain. Friends, it appear as though nothing has changed about the movie's enormous  appeal over the years. This is a movie for a rainy Sunday afternoon, a  blockbuster movie you and your sweety can snuggle up with on the couch to,  a big pan of microwaved popcorn and a couple of cold ones, and wile away  the time over. Who can resist listening to the score of &quot;Raindrops  Falling On My Head&quot; as Newman and Ross ramble around the yard on one  of them there new-fangled bicycles things. Ah, the hubris of  youth.....<br />The story is extremely entertaining, action-packed, and full  of the special screen chemistry  that matching Paul Newman and Robert  Redford with a perfect script allows for. By the way,pretty Miss Katherine  Ross ain't chopped liver here, either, fresh from her success in &quot;The  Graduate&quot; with Dustin Hoffman. Seeing her again reminds me how much a  woman can do to us menfolk with the hint of one her winsome smiles. No  wonder she was the dream squeeze of millions of babyboomers at the time. At  any rate, all of their performances and the romance and tightness of the  film itself contribute to its magnificent and often comical storyline. If  you've seen it, you need little encouragment, and if you haven't, you best  waste no more time. Enjoy!
B00000IP2L|5.0|Zakk Wylde and the Black Label Society serve the 90's Grunge movement a good ol' chicken-fried pistol-whippin' with this massive slab of a disc. This is the kind of music that would make a mild-mannered accountant do  beer-bongs and roll through a campfire! Zakk grabs ya' by the scruff of the  neck and rubs your nose in it from the beginning to end of this album. If  you dig the cat-squawls and gattlin-gun riffs he served up on &quot;No Rest  for the Wicked&quot;, this disc is one you will want. There is not one bad  song on this disc and the best effort I have heard from Zakk. This album  shows why he could play with Ozzy Osbourne and follow up by playing for the  Allman Bros. The Black Label Society is gaining members... You had better  jump aboard before we come to your house......
B00000K31Q|5.0|This is a fabulous movie, same concept as She's All That, but way better.  I've seen it many times.  Made me cry, laugh and learn a really important life lesson!   If you want to see a good movie and you're between the ages  of 10-25, I recommend this movie for you.  Adults may get bored, but teens  and ages around there will love it!   I've seen it atleast 3 times!    Can't wait for the fourth!
B00000G3PL|5.0|The adventures of the slightly unhinged cop and his long-suffering partner (played by Mel Gibson and Danny Glover respectively) will go down in the annals as some of the greatest action films ever made. What is most  marvellous about these films is that the formula -- (an immensely  successful mixture of violent action, hilarious antics and sheer  stylishness) -- has not worn out after four instalments. Brilliant.
B00004T0US|5.0|Moody Blue in its new form captures all the musical beauty and feeling of Elvis' 1976 Graceland Sessions (recorded in the Jungle Room). There is not a bad song in this set. Hurt, For the Heart, Moody Blue, She Thinks I still  Care, It's Easy For You, and all of these display Elvis' ability to get in  a song and sing it from the inside out. He truly feels what he sings. This  set is a must have that stands up against the Sun Sessions, The 1969  Memphis Sessions, and any of the Nashville Sessions. The live tracts add  flavor and feel. Elvis was far from being washed up in the late 1970s. The  RCA Jungle Room Sessions CD (Elvis Collector's Label) is a great companion  to this CD. You'll play both over and over.
B00000K19E|1.0|If you want to see a clever, action-packed and truly witty sci-fi classic then watch &quot;Total Recall&quot;. In its action, its scripting and its philosophic sophistication, &quot;Total Recall&quot; easily dwarfs this  pretentious and self-regarding piece of idiocy. The acting is indifferent.  The action is barely solid. The &quot;philosophical&quot; treatment of the  Cartesian apperance/reality problem is elementary. Even the effects are  nothing special, in spite of the massive budget. And why does the chief  villain have to mince every sentence like a constipated Nazi? The awful  dialogue contains such lines as this -- &quot;Do you believe in fate?&quot;  -- &quot;No...Because I don't like the thought of being controlled.&quot;  The immense popularity of this mindless and overlong bore is mystifying,  but then again, what can one say considering that the majority is always  wrong? It seems to be aimed at the core audience of cybernerds and computer  geeks, upon which it has numerous enthusiastic fanatics. To be missed.
B000002MZ6|5.0|It's hard to write about this one. I recall driving across Wyoming while listening to this, and the beauty of the music kept moving me to tears. Oldfield here has reached a zenith with this work, one which surpasses  perhaps all of his prior output. Merging elements from many world musics  along with his own idiomatic sounds and styles, Oldfield really has created  a work that seems to echo Arthur C. Clarke's vision in the book which  inspired this title. Voices whirl in and out like transmissions from some  either lost or undiscovered planet, yet which are in fact from our own. The  music merges together many, many things...so many, that it synergizes some  new music that is so much more truly 'world music' than anything that's  been tagged with that overused commercial cliche. Previously, I felt that  Mike Oldfield had hit his best stride on the minimalist-colored symphonic  work &quot;Incantations&quot;, but this blows it...and pretty much  everything else he's done, the historic importance of &quot;Tubular  Bells&quot; notwithstanding...out of the water! An important, critical,  must-have work. Make some time for a good long drive out across the  West...Utah, Wyoming, the Black Hills, or even the open plains of Kansas or  Nebraska...and put this on. The feelings are indescribable...
B00003CXDU|5.0|Those are the best two words to describe Galaxy Quest.  Another good phrase would be &#34;one of the best movies Dreamworks has produced so far&#34;.   It's been a long time since I've seen a parody film hit  its intended targets with such accuracy and finesse.  The movie deals with  the crew of the Protector, a spaceship that exists only in reruns of the  strangely familiar early 80's ensemble SF TV show Galaxy Quest.  Exiled to  mall shows and science-fiction fan conventions, they  live out their days  signing autographs for fanatical, show-quoting groupies until they're  propositioned by some rather distinctive &#34;fans&#34; for a very  special mission...  What ensues is an incredibly fun skewering of the  whole Star Trek experience, effortlessly bouncing from knowing parody to  rollicking action to heartfelt emotion.  And it's all headed by a  top-flight cast led by Tim Allen as Jason Nesmith/Commander Peter Quincy  Taggart.  Aiding and abeting him is his flouncy blonde side-kick, played  by...Sigourney Weaver!  This brilliant casting coup alone should tip you  off to the film-makers' attitude towards the subject matter.  Also present  is Alan Rickman in an incredible turn as the token alien cast member who  longs to return to Shakespeare, Tony Shalhoub as the boggled engineer, and  Daryl Mitchell as the cute kid who is now all grown up.  But as good as the  human cast is, they fade into the background whenever they interact with  the true aliens of the picture, the Thermanians.  Masking their true  squidlike form in a human disquise, they lurch across the screen speaking  in stretched and strangled accents with ever-present goofy grins on their  faces.  It matters not if you're a bred-in-the-bone Trekkie or wouldn't  know a Mark I phaser if it jumped up and stunned you...there is just so  much to enjoy here.  It probably does help if you're at least familiar with  the source of the various in-jokes contained within, but Galaxy Quest is  careful to surround itsTrekian pokes with a surprisingly touching story of  personal redemption.  Sure there are plot holes the size of black holes,  and the motivations for the aliens' actions are as vaporous as a plasma  cloud.  But this is one of those movies that revels in its own wonderous  creations so much that you really just don't give a damn about blasted  logic.  Hurry to the video store today, a video gem like this comes around  about as often as Halley's Comet.
B000000I0K|5.0|Mike Oldfield's best known, of course, for his album-length suites and symphonically-styled works. But he's also done quite a few short pieces, especially on albums from &quot;Platinum&quot; onward. And this collection  of those type of works is perhaps the best. Oldfield's multitracked  self-played style here is augmented with extra players, including Phil  Collins, and he even takes on such things as ABBA (&quot;Arrival&quot;)  here to amazing results. Oldfield in places rocks out, works with hymn-like  pieces, returns to the glossolalic vocals from &quot;Ommadawn&quot;, hands  in some fine Celtic-styled bits, and so on...all in the span of one concise  album. For those who don't exactly have the patience to sit through some of  Oldfield's long pieces, this is a perfect starting-point, and it's  certainly an album that's been a favorite of mine out of Oldfield's body of  work since discovering it shortly after it was released. Definitely one to  have.
0780625129|5.0|My wife and I just watched American History X. It was one of those rare films that leave you speechless as the closing credits roll down the screen. There are disturbing scenes (cold blooded homocide), revealing  scences (an oi music party with tons of kids, not just skinheads),  ridiculous scenes (a full court basketball game where Ed Norton leads an  all-white team and ends the contest with a reverse slam.   Jeez...  I  suppose white men CAN Jump?), and there are scenes that will you will never  forget (a table scene with Elliot Gould as a dinner guest---poignant)  If  you can sift through some of the distractions, this can be a very important  film.  The ontogeny of hate in a specific individual and his subsequent  deprogramming into a true human being is very effectively depicted.  If you  have ever felt racist rage and you don't know why, see this film and, if  you are human, you will hopefully start on a path of understanding.
B000000WG4|5.0|Before this, Mike Oldfield was a young session guitarist who'd played with Kevin Ayers, among others. But in between that, he was screwing around with this 'demo project'. Well, that 'demo project' kept growing and growing and  getting more complex as Oldfield managed to scrounge more session time to  tinker with it, and eventually, a certain hippie record dealer with a wild  hair to start a label heard it and decided to kick off said label with  Oldfield's 'demo'. To make a long story short, the hippie was someone by  the name of Richard Branson, the label got named 'Virgin', and that demo  turned into this album, perhaps one of the greatest-selling...and greatest,  period...instrumental rock works of all time. Music's not been quite the  same since. &quot;Tubular Bells&quot; forced a lot of people who'd  dismissed rock as having no 'serious' capabilities to reassess their  opinions, as Oldfield had crafted a well-composed, beautiful,  often-dramatic, and lyrical work using both the instruments and technology  of rock. People pigeonhole this in 'progressive', but it really goes so  much beyond that, as Oldfield here grafts on many classical and folk  elements to come up with something that goes far beyond the tagline of  'prog-rock'. In a very real sense, this is almost a precursor to the  late-70s rise of minimalism, especially the latter part of Part I, with its  reliance on a gradually-building structure based on simple repeating forms.  And, of course, the fun addition of Viv Stanshall as 'Master of  Ceremonies'. Oldfield even gets into a little ethno-fakery fun, too,  vocalizing as the 'Piltdown Man' in Part II. A totally enjoyable work, and  an important milestone in both rock and the classical music of the late  20th Century, too.
B00003CXA2|5.0|This movie is full of special moments and special saying, all of it is told from the point of view of a simple, unnasuming, and also oddly smart man and it follows his entire life. It makes you wonder about what really  is most important to you in life, being &quot;smart&quot;, being  &quot;popular&quot; or just being simple enough to understand people and  not judge them too harshly, and love them. And that was what Forrest did,  and his story didn't turn out so bad. He remained constant, faithful, he  followed his desires in life and he made his momma proud. Oh yeah, I liked  his mom; she had some good sayings; there were lots of good quotes in this  movie. This movie is also loaded with history and humor, and chance  encounters with presidents and famous people. I think it was one of the  best movies ever made.
B000000I0I|5.0|On &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;, Mike Oldfield set the stage and a new standard for rock instrumentals with his album-length suite. Then the follow-up, &quot;Hergest Ridge&quot;, seemed to let things drop a bit,  appearing (to me, at least) to be a hodgepodge of sketch ideas from the  previous work as well as precursory bits to the follow-up. Well, this is  the follow-up, and what an effort it is! Oldfield here has apparently  perfected his hypermultitracked methods which debuted on &quot;Tubular  Bells&quot; to create a work of amazing compositional cohesiveness, drama,  and sweeping lyricism. Melodies here all have a beautiful, singing quality  to them, even when there are no lyrics. And when the lyrics do appear, as  mysterious, looping incantatory chants (from which the title comes), the  work takes on a...something...that just goes so much farther than Oldfield  had gone before. More ethnic elements get in here, as well, notably his use  of African drumming and Oldfield's own newfound prowess on pipes. Closing  it out is an endearing folkish piece, &quot;On Horseback&quot;, that is  much more of a rounded work than the little &quot;Sailor's Hornpipe&quot;  toss-off that closed &quot;Tubular Bells&quot;. A genuine pinnacle work,  perhaps only surpassed in Oldfield's 1970s output by  &quot;Incantations&quot;.
B00004TLMC|4.0|Tom Cruise is a doctor (who has a lot of time on his hands) and Nicole Kidman is his wife (who has a lot of time on her hands). She has sexual fantasies which she reveals to her husband, and it bothers him so much,  that he becomes involved easily with some real sexual situations.  Why this  should be made to seem necessary is not clear.  <br /> However the film is  strong on mystery  and that keeps you involved to the very end. The end  does seem like a long time coming. But all the talk by some critics about  what is a dream and what is real life, seems overrated. It's pretty  obvious. If you like mystery though,  and a little wierdness, this is for  you. The sex is only slightly erotic.<br /> As Kubrick's last production  and direction before his death, you can detect some absence of his genius  toward the end of the picture.  Everybody is rubbing their heads and hair,  frequently looking down at the floor, as if they have been left on their  own to figure out how to behave. You wouldn't notice that if it wasn't too  much.<br /> See it for what it is: mystery, fun and games; but don't be  mislead by the hype. It's not a great film.
B000000I0J|4.0|Yep. This is the follow-up to the tremendous, long, and highly complex &quot;Incantations&quot;. But it bears little in resemblance to that work, save for the continuing minimalist directions. The four-part title track is  very fun, taking Oldfield's complex compositional ideas and tweaking them  in a stripped-down and jazzy direction, hearkening back to a Roaring '20s  feel in a couple of places (especially Part 3-&quot;Charleston&quot;). But  there's a major tip-o-the-hat here also to then-labelmate and minimalist  pioneer Philip Glass with Part 4, which is a 'cover' of Glass's &quot;North  Star&quot;. The second part starts interestingly enough with the quiet  percussives of &quot;Woodhenge&quot;, but then goes  into...&quot;Sally&quot;? Odd, this, as my version of it shows &quot;Into  Wonderland&quot; in the liner notes at this point. &quot;Punkadiddle&quot;  is a goof, really, sort of a miscue. And the version of &quot;I've Got  Rhythm&quot; just sort of plods along languidly and never seems to come  quite together. So...get it for the title suite, one or two of the second  half shorties, but this isn't one of the first things you'd get in  Oldfield's oeuvre.
6305531374|4.0|&quot;Halloween: H20&quot; is a worthy sequel to the original, and the DVD is great, although the Audio Commentary listed on the back of the DVD is NOT present.  The trivia game is pretty cool, as is the &quot;Unmasking the  Horror&quot; featurette.  &quot;Halloween: H20&quot; is short, but scary.   You'll enjoy it.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Maybe it is me who is changing, or maybe Pearl Jam is changing.  I love the new CD.  I love the songs, the lyrics and the music on just about every track.  Pearl Jam has defininitely become better and better as the years  have gone by.  But I was yearning for another Porch, Animal,  Rearviewmirror... I miss that mosh pit song on here and Revolution on yield  was that song for me on that album.  But don't get me wrong, this album is  definitely a great buy and I will be standing in line this morning when  tickets go on sale for the Greensboro concert.
B00004TJK2|5.0|If you have American version of &quot;the big blue&quot;, get rid of it! and buy this long version. The directer's cut makes a lot of difference,the music, character, etc.....It is totally different movie, and probably the  best movie of Besson. It'll make you cry.
B00000GAIW|5.0|It's rare when I award 5 stars to anything. It has to be not only a great work, fun to listen to, and able to stay fresh no matter how many times you crank it up, but also has to be VERY original. This CD fits all those  categories. The style and the power of these songs mix extremely well,  starting with the opening salvo of &quot;Aqualung&quot; and continuing all  the way through &quot;Wind Up&quot;. This is one of those few albums where  there is not a single bad song on it. Of course &quot;Locomotive  Breath&quot; is the absolute hightlight of the CD, and (with Aqualung) is  still a mainstay of every Tull concert to date. I usually try to temper  every review with a lowlight as well, but here there really isn't one. If  you're looking to find out what Jethro Tull was all about this CD would be  the place to start.
B00003CWL5|5.0|Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is your usual well-behaved 42-year-old dreg of an American dad until he spots his teenaged daughter's girl friend, Angela Hayes (Mena Suvari) whose beauty transforms him.  Part of the fun of  this very funny and enjoyable movie is watching Lester break out of his  self-imposed shell and blossom with the rose petals as he tells everybody  what he really thinks as though he had nothing to lose.<br /><br />His daughter Jane  is a brooding raven-haired beauty who likes to put on a white-powdered face  and red Betty Boop lips to go with her full figure.  Thora Birch, who plays  Jane, has a face that can mesmerize, and Director Sam Mendes puts her to  work mesmerizing us.<br /><br />Annette Bening, in a comedic tour de force, plays  Lester's wife Carolyn, a straitlaced, uptight, worry wart who sells real  estate.  Next door we have, just moving in, 18-year-old Ricky Fitts, played  with sly self-assurance by Wes Bentley, the dope-dealing, Bible-suit  wearing, photog son of Marine Corps Colonel Frank Fitts and his mostly  catatonic wife.  Two houses down there's Jim and Jim, your smiling yuppie  fruit loops and all-around neighborhood sweet guys.  They are however an  embarrassment to Colonel Fitts who is living in the deep, dark corner of a  very large denial closet, paranoid to the teeth that his only son has  inherited the same shameful desires and will act them out.  In an effort to  keep Ricky disciplined and on the straight and narrow, the good Colonel  practices various forms of child abuse ranging from bare-knuckle beatings  to medicated imprisonment.<br /><br />In other words what we have here is your  typical American suburban street.  What makes American Beauty a great  success is a witty script with a deep and beautiful lesson for our age by  Alan Ball, superb direction by Sam Mendes and outstanding performances from  just about everybody in the cast.  Bening is brilliant with her silly  finger gestures and her one foot sideways stance, like a fawn just learning  to walk, and her squinty little eyes full of merriment, and that raised and  then downward pointing index finger of indignant reproof.  (But she really  needs to keep her pretty shins off the bedposts or at least off the wall.)  Mena Suvari is perhaps no more beautiful than any number of other screen  darlings, but she has a litany of sexy expressions and poses that inspire  delight.  Her portrayal of a fast lane teen siren whose talk is bigger than  her experience is just perfect.  She might be a budding star.<br /><br />But more  than anything this is an uplifting and satisfying tale of an unappreciated,  unloved and mostly ignored man who is inspired to transform his life by the  beauty of a girl.  For many people (and for most women, I would wager)  falling in love at first sight with a teenaged girl just because she is  beautiful is shallow and beside the point, inappropriate and not fair.  But  women love men for their power and their strength and their standing in  society.  Is that fair to those men who have none?  Lester's love for  Angela was so great that it transcended carnality, but he didn't know that  until he began to take off her clothes and then he realized something very  beautiful.  He could love her without making love to her.  If he took  advantage of her youth and inexperience, it would cheapen his love for her  and possibly destroy it.  Maybe some people in the audience felt he wasn't  a real man because he stopped, but I tend to feel the opposite.  Not that I  think there is anything wrong with making love to 18-year-old girls (on the  contrary); but if the girl is incapable of experiencing that love, then  perhaps it is better to love her from afar without a sexual expression,  even at the risk of disappointing her, especially if you're old enough to  be her father, and especially if you really do love her.  Notice that in  the next scene she is bored and for her the magic of sexuality is gone.  He  might aswell be her father.<br /><br />So much of what we are presented through the  media is a focus on those males who would only be able to express  themselves in some sexually-exploitive manner.  So much of what we read  insists that this is the only way men are.  I'm happy to say that American  Beauty presents another point of view, and presents it beautifully.<br /><br />The  point made by the surprising ending (and the reason for the presence of the  Marine colonel and the two gay guys) is that our contemporary \\"enlightened\\"  society may recognize the legitimacy of homosexual love, but continues to  hypocritically condemn the love of a man for a young girl.<br /><br />--Dennis Littrell, author of \\"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\\"well be her father.<br /><br />So much of what we are presented through the  media is a focus on those males who would only be able to express  themselves in some sexually-exploitive manner.

B00000IQBL|5.0|As with all of Kubrick films this is meticulously crafted to create an effect an to show us the dehumanization of men at war. The film is divided into two equally compelling halves. The first being Marine basic training,  R. Lee Ermey is scarier than any Vietnamese could hope to be as the drill  sergeant who turns his men into 'killing machines'. The second half  (vietnam combat) is also equally intense and memorable. Vincent D'Onofrio  is also devastating as a clumsy confused private. Matthew Modine adds a  little comic relief to a very heavy film but also creates a fascinating  character. But this is Kubrick's achievement, his use of sets,  cinematography and sound create a profoundly intense impact. A hell of a  war picture. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!
0783244320|4.0|I bought this DVD because of those cute gray aliens I saw on a commercial, I did not go to see the movies because I expected it to be just a laim comedy. Well, actually, it is not bad at all.<br />I am a devoted fan of Star Trek series. I found this film very entertaining and wicked-funny in a  SciFi way. The plot of this movie made me think of the cast of Star Trek  (original). Tim Allen act as a combination of himeself and William Shatner.  <br />As for the DVD good sound and pictures. It's also included 8 scences  that have been thrown away (because of the time limited, I guess), but they  are all good. Give me a good laugh.
B00000J7JO|4.0|I've played this cd on quite a few stereo systrems and read a few reviews that agree...the recording on this cd SUCKS. At first I thought that my stereo was broken or that I had a defective disk...but I've had other  people say the same. <br />Otherwise... it was an excelent cd with excelent  music.
0790738139|2.0|I was moved to rent this flick after watching James Lipton slobber all over Kim Basinger on Bravo's Actors' Studio.<br />What a letdown. Although supposedly set in the 50's, this movie was intended to invoke the nostalgia  for film noir, and ride that wave to big box office receipts.<br />Where to  begin? The flat color of LA Confidential does no homage to the brilliant  black-and-white work of true film noir.  Outdoor time-placing was  accomplished by setting a fedora-ed, wide-lapel-ed guy in a vintage car, in  front of some LA neon. It was always a tight shot, to avoid revealing the  Taco Bell lurking next door. The indoor scenes were littered appropriately  with old fans and furniture, Remington typewriters, etc.<br />The cops were  all given a wounded-child persona, which, I suppose, was meant to give a  psychological edge to their characters.  Pure cardboard.<br />None, NONE, of  the characters were worthy of any empathy. How can a movie connect with an  audience like that?<br />Kim Basinger is a major babe, and, from what I hear,  a wonderful person.  But she is, alas, a so-so actress.  She supposedly  researched the hell outa Veronica Lake, yet failed completely to capture  that lady's smoldering sexuality. More cardboard.<br />Danny DeVito plays an  oily little rat. So what else is new? Oily cardboard. James Cromwell's  brogue (Scottish, Irish?) waxes and wanes comically throughout the  movie.<br />The patois splattered throughout the dialogue was derived from  every decade EXCEPT the 50's.<br />The identity of the Big Baddie was  telegraphed the moment he appeared on the scene.. No suspense there.<br />No  chemistry between the femme fatale and her amours. None, zip, zero,  nada.<br />Of course there was plenty of shotgun-toting and gore, bodies  splattered everywhere. A distraction from the total lack of a worthy  story?<br />I kept thinking of a vastly superior cops-gone-bad movie,  &quot;Witness&quot;.<br />Raymond Chandler must be rolling in his grave.
B000001GOZ|5.0|I have several recordings of this including the Von Karajan (which I do not care for) and the wonderful recording by Horenstein, which I have listened to mostly - but I have to say that the Boulez opened doors in this  symphony that I did not know were there.  His deleiberate and precise style  are perfect for this work.  The recording quality is impeccable.<br />I think  the Andante deserves special praise.  he takes it like a true andante (not  a slow adagio).  As this movement reaches its peak it gives the sensation  like you are seeing the sun for the last time ever on planet Earth...
0790729725|5.0|This is a bona-fide classic, believe me.  If I had to create a top ten list of the best movies ever made, this one would be included.
B000002BFZ|4.0|Ok, it should be obvious to everyone that Ten is Pearl Jam's best album and they are never going to equal it (I give No Code four stars because Ten is the one essential purchase that should be made first). but this album  proves that they shouldn't be written off.  Admittedly, I was one of the  &quot;fans&quot; at the time who were turned off by this album, but in  retrospect it was the turning point of Pearl Jam's career, the point where  they stopped trying to be the biggest band in the world (which they  wouldn't have been able to continue doing anyway) and make the kind of  music they wanted.  Hence the relatively softer, actually less grungy in  some ways music of No Code and Yield. On this album, the band is finally  feeling the results of having conquered many of their demons and they  settle down to the business of making great music.  The pointless screwing  around that marred Vitalogy (Bugs?) makes way for much more fruitful  musical expermimentation, like the vaguely Eastern rhythms of &quot;Who You  Are&quot;.  The prayer-like &quot;Sometimes&quot;. the harder &quot;Hail,  Hail&quot;, the intense &quot;Red Mosquito&quot;, and &quot;Mankind&quot;,  in which the band, led by Stone for once, exhibits a rare sense of humor.  are just some of the other highlights. Pearl Jam blazed their own new path  with this album, and while that path is not groundbreaking, it is  consistently rewarding.  I have recently rediscovered how awesome this band  truly is, and I hope that Binaural (which I just bought) turns out to be as  great as Yield and No Code were.
1573226521|5.0|this is really an astounding pice of fiction.the characters are inteligent and you really get to know them. the narrative just flows and it is just a really fun book to read.very impressive for a debut novel, almost as good  as Asher Brauner with his debut &quot;love songs of the tone deaf&quot;  I  really reccommend this book.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney's Sophmore album has shown how much her music has matured. I think she is the queen of Pop and deserves all of the credit she gets!
0440180295|5.0|this is without a doubt one of my all-time favorite books.I originally read this many years ago and thoroughly enjoyed rereading it.this is definitely one of the most original and interesting storylines you will  ever read.just like Asher Brauner's &quot;Love songs of the tone deaf&quot;  this book will take you on a great journey that you will never forget.this  is a work of genius
B000002UJQ|5.0|If you experiance an album better than this then i'll jump off the nearest cliff.This albums truly touching,beutiful,emotianal and any other word you can think of that describes this albums brilliance.Right from the opening  guitar riff on airbag to the triangle at the end of the tourist this albums  touching the end of another world.I've convinced many of my friends to buy  this album and now i'm convincing the readers of this review.If radiohead  can top this album i would be most surprised because this albums better  than anything ever done before.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Those who are hoping Eddie Vedder and bandmates return to the sound of &quot;Ten&quot; (released nearly a decade ago!) will do themselves and the rest of us a favor by picking up the latest Creed album. But those who are  willing to accept that this band has matured and continues to explore the  vast musical landscape we call rock 'n roll will surely not be  disappointed.<br />While PJ's latest effort contains some great riffs and  rockers--including the punky &quot;Breakerfall&quot;, the Jeff Ament penned  &quot;Gods' Dice&quot; and Vedder's freedom statement  &quot;Grievance&quot;--overall this record is much more introspective  displaying the group's varied influences, reminiscent of the underrated  &quot;No Code.&quot; Guitarist Stone Gossard's countrified &quot;Thin  Air&quot; is a sweet love song much in the vein of &quot;Off He Goes&quot;  while bassist Ament's &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; conjures up images of  Pink Floyd. And the album's closing song &quot;Parting Ways&quot; could be  a companion piece to frequent show opener &quot;Long Road,&quot; a song  that was the result of PJ's 1995 collaboration with Neil Young on his  &quot;Mirror Ball.&quot;<br />&quot;Binaural,&quot; produced by Tchad Blake  (Los Lobos, Tom Waits), is a breath of fresh air in the present atmosphere  of MTV-groomed acts like Limp Bizkit and Britney Spears. As Vedder sings on  &quot;Evacuation&quot;--a song written by former Soundgarden drummer and  newest PJ member Matt Cameron--it's definitely &quot;time to take heed and  change direction.&quot;<br />From the most dedicated fan to the person who  became acquainted with the band during last summer's surprise hit single  &quot;Last Kiss,&quot; this album has a little something for everyone. So  put your headphones on and listen with both ears because I think you'll  enjoy what you hear.
0441003257|5.0|This book definatly ranks in the top five most entertaining books that I've ever read.  It has an enjoyable cast of characters (Crowely being my personal favorite), a great plot, a morbid sense of humor, and most  importantly luagh out loud hillarity.  Most books that I read only ever  make me chuckle, but this book actually made me cackle with laughter in  some parts.  I mean it honestly that it is extremely funny.  This great  sense of humor is brought about by the cast of characters constantly  playing off of each other's personalities, and quirks.  Plus there's the  dead serious subject matter that the book deals with being portrayed in  such an off-handed manner.  It deffinatly leads to some great moments.   This novel will keep you reading (i finished it in about three days).  I  you want a memorable book that will make you want to read it over and over  again get this masterpeice, you won't regret it.
6304546386|5.0|Like any great work of art, this movie transcends the passage of time -- a storybook come to life, as one critic put it. Beautifully designed and photographed, perfectly acted, and magnificently scored, it's got  everything a movie should have. A few years ago, I saw it in a revival  theater and they read a letter from Olivia de Havilland in Paris, who said  it had a special place in her heart for reasons that are obvious. Amen.
6305807086|4.0|&quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is some sort of weird movie experience. You look in awe at the ideas the film has and how it executes them. I admired it more than I liked it for it's skillfull blend of dark humor,  originality and sweetness. It's daredevil fun, but it has the potential for  more. Though I enjoyed and do recommend it, I sort of expected more from a  movie about going into someone else's head. A tour of Malkovich's mind  would have been more entertaining than just looking out through his eyes  sockets. Still, it's a fun movie and sometimes thrilling in it's own  special way. &quot;Being John Malkovich&quot; is in a sense, some sort of  achievement. None of it seems barrowed, it all seems fresh and new. All the  actors are great. If only a little more had been added, if it had dared  more, than it would have been a masterpiece.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Wow, this album is beyond incredible. Pearl Jam have brought together one of the best albums ever here. This album had extreme collaboration from the entire band in which there are many influences played around. The songs are  so deep and insightfull and Eddie just provides the best vocals possible  for every single song. This is their 6th album, and I don't wanna hear  anybody saying how the music isn't catchy enough for you because this is  the best music that you can find in the entire world. This album also shows  the mad skills that Stone and Jeff have for writing lyrics. With songs like  Thin Air, Nothing As It Seems, Gods Dice, Of the Girl, an Rival, they  completely show their great talents. The music of course could not be  complete without the guitar of Mike Mccready which I'm sure all Pearl Jam  fans love so much. Matt Cameron(formerly of Soungarden) does a fantastic  job at the drums, and of course Stone on guitar and Jeff on bass are  incredible and get mad props. And Eddie, you just can't get anything but  the best from him. Thanks for reading my review of the best band on Earth!
0792156684|2.0|This film could have had much potential as a true masterpiece, however it was instead absorbed into sugary teeny bopper culture with the casting of Leonardo DiCaprio as the main character. This is supposed to be the best  selling movie ever, but that is merely because ditzy little twelve year old  girls went to see it 12 times each. It is good to see once, and only once.  Rent it, don't buy it.
B000002BSV|5.0|This is an excellent Suede album, despite what all the hardcore fans may say about it in comparious to the previous album.  Not one song doesn't belong on this album.  It is perfection.  Everything fits.  Everything is  represented on this album...glam rock, drugs, sex...The two ballads,  &quot;By the Sea&quot; and &quot;The Chemistry Between Us&quot; are two  breaks from the beautiful rock which composes the album.  &quot;The  Chemistry Between Us&quot; is my favorite off the album.  This album is a  must for any Suede fan, and a must have for anyone with a vague interest in  rock/glam rock/britpop.
B00004T8RK|4.0|Binaural, the sixth studio cut from Pearl Jam, shows once again that Pearl Jam refuses to allow their music to become stagnant.  With contributions to lyrics and songwriting from all five band members, including Soundgarden's  former drummer Matt Cameron, Binaural is a bit more diverse than other  Pearl Jam recordings.  Highlights from the album include: Evacuation,  Insignificance, Of The Girl, Grievance, and Rival.  Other tracks worthy of  mention are Gossard's Thin Air and Light Years (lyrics: Vedder, music:  Vedder, McCready, Gossard).  Cameron makes for a nice addition to the band,  although I should say I personally liked the sound Jack Irons incorporated  a little more.  Those interested in purchasing the album should be aware  that this newer version of Pearl Jam is not the same that would be heard on  previous albums such as Ten, Vs., etc.  However, Binaural is still quality  music, deserving of many listenings.
B00004T8RK|5.0|At first listen, i wasn't incredibly impressed, the melodies seemed initially undiscernable... however, after my second or third listen the cd really unfolds.  This is a superb cd, if you give it a chance.  PJ isn't  afraid to morph to different styles, whether the mainstream follows or not.
B00004SCX6|4.0|I'm not usually a total Britney fan, but this CD changes her whole image!  Check out the song, &quot;Lucky&quot;...it's really good!  I'm totally impressed, Brit!
B00003CWQ2|4.0|In 1995 director David Fincher and Brad Pitt teamed up to make a little film called Seven that still creeps people out this day. Last year they teamed up with Fight Club. In this movie it is about an unknown character  Played by Edward Norton who lives a white collar exsistenz and is getting  very bored with his life. So he meets Tyler Durden pplayed by Brad Pitt.  This film mainly works as a black comedy and as a social comentary. Those  two start a club which they fight. This movie is not for the weak stomached  it no holds bared violence. <br />Director David Fincher shows kinetic visual  style and offers up some bone crunching entertainmant. What i am really  surprised with is Brad Pitt after the lame Meet Joe Black. Also i would  have liked Seven years in Tibet if it didn't feel like seven years. This is  easily one of his better movies. After the great Twelve Monkeys. Edward  Norton holds his own and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla is great.
0792146670|4.0|This is one of the better two parters. Picard, Worf and Dr Crusher go on a secret mission into Cardassian territory, while the Enterprise comes under the command of Admiral Jellico. Although Chain of Command focuses mainly on  Captain Picard, important parts are played by Riker, Troi, Worf, and Dr  Crusher.<br />The best parts of the episode were the interrogation of Picard  by the Cardassian, and the interaction between Admiral Jellico and Riker. I  think of all the 'bad guys' on Star Trek, the Cardassian's are pretty good,  although no where near the standard of the Dominion or the Borg. This  episode does mark a turning point in one respect, as it's the first in  which we see Troi in uniform.<br />Overall, this episode turned out very well  and is quite dramatic, as well as giving us a nice insight into Federation  and Cardassian relations. People who buy this will have to get part 2 as  well, which continues the story, as you'll need to know what happens to  Picard.<br />I recommend it to all Star Trek fans, regardless of whether  you're a collector or who your favourite character is, though if you like  the Cardassians, this is a must have.
6305363668|4.0|Out of an Impulse i rented this movie. Never having seen it before only hearing about it. Director Ridley Scott shows us a rainy metrop that is Los Angeles in the future. It stars Harrison Ford plays Decker who used to be a  blade runner now who is on the hunt for a replicant. Supposed to be a great  piece of sci-fi movie making that just about every sci-fi movie is based on  today. I guess im 18 years  to late to be blown away by the movie sure the  special effects and cinematography were excelllent but i guess i needed to  be in the 1980's to really be blown away by it. I was still wondering what  a Blade Runner does and why were Replicants so bad they didn't seem like  that.
B00001NFCY|5.0|This album rocks!   I knew the words to all of the songs by the end of the day that I got it.  This is my absolute fovorite CD!
B00002MZ12|2.0|I hate to be the devil's advocate after so many good reviews about the album, but I have to say I'm unimpressed. Alanis is undeniably gifted - the question is in what way. She definitely has a talent for writing music  which is purely emotional and naked truth (even if she uses the word  &quot;ironic&quot; in an incorrect form several times). But I find it  difficult to believe that anyone who gives serious thought to the matter  would enjoy her voice. Excuse the mental image that comes to my mind -  something between a strangled chicken and nails on a blackboard.<br />Also I  find that she has much in common with my own singing voice - she can reach  a vast range of notes but never consecutively - always the third or second  note in a scale cannot be sung. <br />Finally, I thought she sounded really  fake on the album - her thank you's and her ending speech were delivered in  her sqwuaky monotone and sounded completely insincere - which in my opinion  is devastating to an Unplugged album.<br />So good work on the songs, Alanis  but find someone else to sing them...
B00004T8RK|5.0|Every time I buy a new Pearl Jam album, I know I won't be disappointed.  No matter how it sounds the first time I listen to it, eventually I come to love every song on the album. PJ has changed alot since their early days,  but one thing has remained constant, their incredible musical integrity.  They are hands down the best true rock band out there today and Binaural  proves that once gain. Binaural is strong start to finish. It's got  something for everyone, but don't expect any radio hits (and that's a good  thing!)
B0000013G9|5.0|I think this is there best cd although fanmail is good this is better. The spice in Waterfalls is nice and sugar with creep, i loved it.
B000003BF4|5.0|Can't remember anytime in the last 30 years I didn't have a copy of GET YOUR YA-YAS OUT in some form or another. But only one prob. I was holding off buying stones cds. Waiting for the remastering of their older stuff.  Wouldn't it be great if they made this one THE COMPLEAT SHOW!  One of the  best live albums ever made. I think HUMBLE PIE was going for this same  sound on ROCKIN'THE FILLMORE,maybe? Midnight Rambler is still one of my  greatist &quot;crank it up songs&quot; Sloppy or what? What your hearing is  human beings playing rock&amp;roll for other human Beings. Unlike some  stuff thats all computers&amp;drum machines! I've been drinking}:-) Oh! I  did get the cd! It's a blast! Goes great with THE WHO/LIVE AT LEEDS. you  know the one where they added tracks,hint,hint? lol!
6302000823|5.0|A Mass-Appeal European movie about a young boy who grows up with a love of cinema, guided by a friendly father-figure who works as the projectionist for the local cinema in Sicily. If this had been made by Hollywood it would  have been nominated for multiple oscars but you should not be put off by  its subtitles or European setting. Very funny and moving and a fascinating  study of the development of a young boy in a time which most people have  never known or will ever know. Then ending is perfection itself.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I am a fairly new RHCP fan but after hearing &quot;Scar Tissue&quot; (which I will admit to hating the first time I heard it) I decided that I had to have this CD.  I didn't actually buy it, however, until I heard  &quot;Otherside&quot;, which is my favorite song ever.  I really recommend  this CD to anyone who has ever heard an RHCP song.
0790733226|4.0|I really disliked this movie the first time i saw it. My biggest dislike was for Matthew McConaughey charachter which I thought was way overdone. After viewing it again i still have problems with McConaugheys simpistic  and intrusive portrayal of a &quot;modern man of faith&quot; but focused  more on his messages which represent genuine skepticism but eventual  reconciliation between science and religion. Jodie Foster is awesome as  usual - its terrific seeing her in a Sci-Fi movie and I hope she does more  of this in the future. The DVD Video and Sound is very good and adds a lot  to the ambience and impact of the film.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I was almost afraid to buy this album because I love Savage Garden.  I was afraid that if it was a really bad CD, I would start to hate them.  On the contrary, I like Savage Garden more than ever.  I loved every song on the  album except &quot;The Animal Song.&quot;  I cried when I heard &quot;Two  Beds and a Coffee Machine&quot;.  I absolutely love &quot;Crash and  Burn,&quot; &quot;The Best Thing,&quot; and &quot;Gunning Down  Romance.&quot; The vocals are awesome and the music rocks.  This CD is a  must-have.
006092988X|5.0|I loved this book.  Although times are hard, and the cruelty of life is shown early to Francie (main character), she still captures the magic of being and child and growing up, and retains a sense of poinancy throughout  the entire book, I would reccomend it to anyone in the right age limit.
0792139771|5.0|Yes that's probably an overstatement but this is one fantastic movie.  Action packed, well acted, well directed, etc.  The very best hand to hand battle scenes I have ever seen.  I saw this movie three times at the  theater and have enjoyed it several times at home, and will buy it on DVD  if they ever release it in that format.
B00003CX5A|5.0|I just got done watching my DVD copy of this film, not having seen it at  all when it was in theaters, and I must say, this was, by far, one of Tim  Burton's best films since Edward Scissorhands.  How ironic that it would  have the same star, Johnny Depp.  Depp was excellent in the role of Ichabod  Crane.  You never would have guessed that he could carry comedy as well as  drama and horror in the same film.  Tim Burton is a master at this type of  film.  I hope he does more collaborations in the future with Depp and the  enchanting, Miss Ricci.  She is absolutely stunning in this film.  She  makes this film worth seeing over and over again.  Do yourself a  favor...give it a rental at your local video/DVD store and I promise you'll  enjoy it.  Word of caution: this film is not for the squeamish.  Don't  watch it after eating pasta or something, though it is worth watching with  popcorn.  I know, it seems strange that I would say not to eat one thing,  but instead another.  You'll understand when you start watching it.  Have  fun!
0767840135|5.0|Having seen the live shows, I was a little skeptical that a video could do it justice.  I'm not a skeptic anymore.  Excellent cinematography and wonderful editing.  Music was beautiful.  If you're a Cirque fan already,  you probably won't be disappointed.  It's not exactly like being there but  the DVD is cheaper then a ticket and you can enjoy it over and over.
6301972139|4.0|Question: Name a film that the Hammer horror greats both appeared in pre ( HHG)?<br />&quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; a feast for the eyes as well as the mind. Unlike John Hustons, ( Oswald Morris,) cinematography of sepia style in  &quot; Moby Dick&quot; Huston here creates a world of great hues and  colors.<br />If saturation is the word that this is it. Costumes, sets and art  direction are tops. The nuances of Montmatre are all on this film and we  can drink it in.<br />In a lifetime, this is one that should be viewed on the  big screen. !
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam has changed alot more, musically. They were pretty horrible these last couple of years with &quot;Yield&quot;. The album, a total piece of trash, made me therefore hate Pearl Jam's music. When Binaural came out,  I began to enjoy Pearl Jam more, and began to get over that  &quot;Yield&quot; trash. The songs on Binaural can definetly get boring,  but not nearly as boring as Yield. Last Kiss is a horrible song, too. So  keep away from most of Pearl Jam's stuff. Binaural is what you are looking  for.
B00000IAU3|5.0|WHAT A GREAT ALBUM. IT TOOK ME A COUPLE OF LISTENS TO GET USED TO IT, OF COURSE THE KILLER TRACK IS &quot;HERE WITH ME&quot; BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF OTHER GREAT SONGS ON THE ALBUM. PLEASE DONT EXPECT THE WHOLE ALBUM TO SOUND  LIKE &quot;HERE WITH ME&quot; BECAUSE IT DOESN'T, ALTHOUGH &quot;DON'T  THINK OF ME&quot; IS IN THE SAME VEIN. BUT THE OTHER SONGS JUST GROW ON YOU  MORE WITH EVERY LISTEN. THANKS AMAZON FOR STOCKING IT AND SHIPPING IT  QUICKLY TO AUSTRALIA AS IT IS NOT AVAILABLE HERE....
0767817443|5.0|I don't see why people hate this film so much.  It was awsome.They are probably just jealous because it is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaay betterthan that (  ) Armageddon.  The script was excelent and the only acting that was  less than perfect was Matthew Brodderick's (sorry Matt, but it's true).   This is, without a doubt, the best American film ever!
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica has proved to be a band that knocks its listeners on their backs with their powerful and massive sound. In S &amp; M, their awesome mixture with classical music produces a unique sound that will sure to give chill  bumps. Metallica still has my vote for one of the best bands to come out of  the ugly '80's.
0449002632|5.0|Al igual que  wdanthemanw de Ginebra(Suiza), no conocía ningún libro de Edward Rutherford, pero siempre me ha llamado la atención la ciudad de Londres (aunque no la conozco) y cuando vi este libro, me dije: 'Puede ser  interesante, teniendo en cuenta que no es tanto un libro de historia como  la historia de una ciudad vista a través de los ojos de varias familias'.  Este estilo lo conozco - y me gusta- . De hecho, Isaac Asimov, en su saga  de &quot;Fundación&quot; (aunque es ciencia-ficción)  describe la historia  de un pequeño planeta, Términus, desde su origen como una colonia  científica hasta ser el germen del Segundo Imperio Galáctico.<br />Buen libro  y lo recomiendo. No se asusten por el tamaño, el libro se deja leer y  quedan atrapados en él desde el comienzo.
B00004SCX6|5.0|It has been a blast listening to this CD. I am not a active Britney Spears fan, because I really did used to dislike her music a lot, after hearing her first debut album. However, Britney has made some definite  improvements. She proves to have originality and talent her in own style.  Sure, she might not be the best singer out there, but she knows how to use  it.  1. Oops.. I Did It Again -- the smash hit. Not my favorite, but really  upbeat and edgy. 2. Stronger -- one of my favorite tracks. Really. gets you  motiviated to become &quot;stronger&quot;.  3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door  -- has some R&amp;B edge to it, pretty good. 4. (I Can't Get No)  Satisfaction -- this is a really good version of Satisfaction. I like the  R&amp;B style mixed with pop.  5. Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know -- half  ballad, half pop. Pretty good. 6. What U See (Is What U Get) -- really  upbeat, makes you wanna dance! 7. Lucky -- my favorite. The song  interperates a message .. and Britney does well with it. 8. One Kiss From  You -- reminds me of Destiny's Child.. some funky light beat to it. 9.  Where Are You Now -- a great ballad.. I truly enjoy hearing it. Her voice  is at it's best on this track. 10. Can't Make You Love Me -- again, another  dance hit. If you're doing aerobics, tune into this one. 11. When Your Eyes  Say It -- I was suprised that this wasn't a ballad, but it's not that all  bad either.  12. Dear Diary -- probably the worse song on the track. Has no  tune.. but does get you to daydream. Nice.<br />Trust me, it's worth your  money to purchase this CD. Way to go Britney!
B000031WD9|4.0|This is a film about fulfilling the most important dream one can ever have: losing your virginity. When I was a teenager, all of my friends were determined to lose their virginity, which is why I love this movie.<br />The  comedy is the best part. You cannot watch this and not laugh; it is too  funny. Do you want to know my favorite scene? No, it is not the one in  which Jim has a sexual encounter with his mother's pie (although it is a  very funny scene); my favorite scene is the one in which he tries to have  sex with his date but doesn't succeed because of his -- what shall I call  it? -- shortcomings, why not?<br />This is a great film, and I am glad I own  it. If you enjoy a naughty comedy like this one, get it as soon as you can!
B00004SCX6|3.0|Sorely as-of-late underappreciated and vocally challenged divas-such as Ms. Paula Abdul and Janet-may or may not take solace in the success of this decade's answer to them: Britney Spears.  &quot;Oops, I Did It Again&quot;,  is what the average consumer-over the age of 14-is probably admitting to  themselves right now. That is not to say that the gloss-job is not without  its merits. Spears evokes the progressive early '80s synth funk of the Gap  Band's &quot;You've Dropped the Bomb on Me&quot; in &quot;Stronger&quot;,  where vocal distortions and voice-boxes are prevalently displayed in a  retaliatory anthem, where the funk overwhelms and Britney's a mere droid,  judging from the number of distortions. That is not to say that Max Martin  does need to broaden his palette a bit; &quot;Stronger&quot; is stolen from  the anals of the Backstreet Boys' &quot;Larger than Life&quot;, though  production is more grittier. The composition  &quot;Lucky&quot; and the  vapid diplays on the Janet Jackson style &quot;Rhythm Nation/Control&quot;  interlude segments are a confirmation that Britney may  probably be the  self-obsessed diva her female-teen contingent of detractors suggest. For  instance,ostensibly in the shallow attempt to portray herself as lonely  &quot;Lucky&quot;, it depicts &quot;Lucky&quot; as someone for whom a great  deal of awards and success is not a consolation for her loneliness. Such  autobiographical themes have been more skillfully and more legitimately  pulled off by latter-day Madonna, who also insisited &quot;she cries&quot;  in her &quot;room at night&quot; in &quot;Inside of Me&quot; from Bedtime  Stories. Madonna, whose Mother passed when she was a girl, more  convincingly and less superfically conveys the tragedy of loneliness based  on the notion that something has been lost. In &quot;Lucky&quot;, we never  understand the cause of Spears' loneliness; maybe she and Justin had a  fight-who knows? And let's face it: another fallacy is that Britneyprobably will never win the slew of awards-i.e Grammys or Academy Awards-  that only the  lonely &quot;Lucky&quot; star could win. This story would  only prove tragic if it were true; the only tragedy is that she expects the  world to believe this-how sickening. <br />     Other musings in &quot;What U  See( Is What U Get) in which Ms. B responds to criticisms that her  &quot;dress is too tight&quot; and in the interlude that precedes &quot;I  Can't Get No Satisfaction&quot; that she is a malcontent only reenforce the  notion that teens today are vapid and shallow. We do not need B to make  that generalization because she may be.<br />          In any case-with this  diatribe withstanding-some of the music is satisfying. &quot;Don't Go  Knocking on My Door&quot;, is a Destiny's Child &quot;Bug a Boo&quot;  attmept with carefully placed pauses in which, again, Rami and the other  collaborators distort her voice(&quot;Don't go Knocking on  My..D-d-d--Door). Larry &quot;Rock&quot; Campbell, most renownded for his  work on Jody Watley's &quot;When a Man Loves a Woman&quot; from her  &quot;Intimacy&quot; album is a welcome addition to the bevy of producers,  and adds a great bass-line hook to the pleasing Diane Warren ballad  &quot;When Your Eyes Say It', which recalls-for anyone over the age of  18-the introductory spoken word musings of Bardeux's &quot;When We  Kiss&quot;; it is plaintively delivered and she does not try to overemote  as in &quot;From the Bottom of My Broken Heart&quot;, in which she tried to  may notes out of her reach.  Another triumph of the production over her  voice is in the case of the &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot;,  which, with lyrics such as &quot;My friends say you're so into me&quot; is  better delivered by someone younger than it is by its co-writer Shania  Twain;country Honkey-tonk meets pseudo ballad power-pop.Who would have  thought Britney would do something like this? In her lower registers on  this album, her voice is tolerable as well, as was Paula Abdul's in  snippets of &quot;My Love is For Real&quot;.
B000003RCY|5.0|This CD is a must have!  Definately Ramms+ein's best work yet.  Sehnsucht is good, but it's no Herzeleid.  Once it starts, you can't stop listening to it until it's over.  And then you want to listen to it again and again.   If your a Ramms+ein fan, then you must get this CD.  And if you are just  starting to enjoy Ramms+ein, then this has to be the first CD that you buy.   Order this CD now and experience what Ramms+ein really is.
B000002B7O|5.0|Blizzard Of Ozz was great, but Diary Of A Madman is a masterpiece. In my opinion this is Ozzy's best. Some of my favorites are &quot;Over The Mountain&quot;, the CLASSIC &quot;Flying High Again&quot;,  &quot;Tonight&quot;, and the decent into madness, &quot;Diary Of A  Madman&quot;. I can't find 1 bad song! Listen to the bass intro on  &quot;Believer&quot;, and the way the accoustic intro turns electric on the  title track. This is the best. BUY!
0440219078|5.0|An absolutely wonderful book. This book takes so many thingsgoing on in the world, and brings them almost &quot;secretly&quot;into the book. This is one of the best books I have read. Very different I give it 5 plus stars.
B000000H5J|5.0|I love this cd.  I saw the artwork work on a  t-shirt and I loved it so asked around for the cd to borrow and at first  I wasn't impressed all that much.. until I heard Dog Day Sunrise.  I loved that song and after hearing  it I bought the cd and listened to it more carefully. This cd gradually  grew onto me and I realized how awesome it was.  True. at first I only  really like Dog Day Sunrise but then I got more ino the heavier tunes of  Pisschrist and Zero Signal. This quickly became my favourite cd and I  litened to it for about 18 months non stop appreciating all the songs. I  believe this is a complete album. Just about everyone will disagree with me  when I say this this is the best album made, but I can still say it.  It  has so much variety, Burton just kicks a**.  Even now 5 years after I  bought the cd it is still my all time favourite.  And I don't care if  anyone ever reads this or not but at least I will know to myself that I did  what I could in saying how awesome this album is.
0792837614|5.0|Without a doubt this is one of the top five movies musicals of all time, if not number one.  The score, the choreography, the direction, the performances, all of them are flawless.  The screen play improves greatly  upon the original show's book and is much tighter.  This is a true work of  art, and one that will be remembered for years to come.  I could go on and  on about how great it is, but it is much easier to simply say:  &quot;Buy  it, you wont regret it.&quot;
B000002KDS|5.0|There are only but a few albums in all of rock n roll history that everyone should have.This is indeed one of those albums.It is hard,it is raw,it is  from the soul.Its energy is boundless and driving.                                          And if you're a connoisseur of  grungey-crashing-thrashing guitars and pounding-booming-slapping bass/drums  mixed with  vocals that are squealing and yelling and carrying the tunes as  a demon/madman/rebel does,and somehow strangely melodically too,then you'll  marry this album.You'll kick anybody's ass who puts even a scratch on this  album. Listen,go grab your favorite 'stimulants',your best rock n rolls  pals,slip the CD into the best sound system available to you and crank this  masterpiece!FULL VOLUME! If you're somehow unmoved by this album then I  suggest you do some real soul searching and then perhaps go buy a Barry  Manilow album or something. ...Your Alice Cooper journey awaits you.
0385484518|4.0|This is the most moving book I have ever read.  I recommend this book to everyone.  You will never read something that will impact your life so much.  I can not even begin to tell you how much it has made me question  everything and the meaning of life.  It really helps you think and gives  great advice in the book that everyone could use.  Please just take some  time and read it. It is not a long book but has a long meaning. Thanks.
B00003CXDV|5.0|Finally, a fresh perspective on Science Fiction.  Galaxy Quest delivers all the parody-type fun of Space Balls, but without the sexual puns.  After The Phantom Menace, it's great to see actors who actually care about their  roles, or in this case, two roles.  Buy or at least Rent this movie.   Perhaps a sequel will be made.  Or a series!  And the rubber monsters were  a great touch.  But weren't they on that Ninja Turtles Live action TV  series?  In any event, this is a movie for everyone, and you will not  regret watching this movie.  I give this movie 5 stars only because its the  limit.  But it deserves at least 8.  A true tribute to Star Trek, and  science fiction in general.  Enough rambling from me, go now and see it!
6305426651|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It was very touching,although not altogether realistic.The music,actors and screenplay was excellent. This is my very favorite next to the &quot;Sound of  Music&quot;.
B000002I97|5.0|I'll admit that I was drawn to John Prine on the strength of one line from the song Sam Stone.  There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes.  That got me.  Prine has a wonderful gift for injecting humor into  intensely uncomfortable and painful situations.  Prine has a lot of great  albums and songs, but this debut is, in my opinion, the best that he has or  will ever do.  John possessed a maturity and insight well beyond his years  on this one.  Kris Kristofferson wrote the liner notes, praising Prine  greatly(and deservedly so).  Songs like Illegal Smile, Hello In There,  Pretty Good, Quiet Man, Donald &amp; Lydia and Six O' Clock News earned  Prine a place in the songwriters hall of fame with the likes of Townes Van  Zandt, Bob Dylan, Guy Clark, Steve Earle &amp; Bob Mould.  Prine wrote  everything on this one himself &amp; the lyrics are included with the cd.   If you're into brilliant singer-songwriters, then I do believe you're  looking in the right place.  Even better news...he certainly kept up the  great work on the follow-up to this one(Diamonds In The Rough).  Prine has  been off and on over the years, but his first two or three years were  almost flawless.  There is almost no way to live up to a debut like this,  but Prine has periodically pulled it off.  Prine's voice is accessible  &amp; blends well with the country/folk/blues music.  This is a must have.   If you are only going to own one John Prine cd...then add this to your cart  right now!
0783231032|4.0|I didn't see 1941 when it came out in theaters, because I believed the generally negative reviews it received at the time. I've been kicking myself ever since for never having had the experience of seeing it on the  big screen, because that's where all this beautifully-crafted insanity  would really shine.<br />1941's brilliant ensemble cast, daring director, and  hard-working crew, including special-effects wizard Greg Jein, combined  their talents to take viewers back to the opening days of World War II, to  a comedic fantasy California in a '41 that never quite was. It has been  criticized for being fragmented (it was cut to shreds against director  Spielberg's wishes), and lambasted for not being funny. Personally, I laugh  my arse off every time I watch it. I'd call it a guilty pleasure, but I'm  not at all guilty about loving it. This film has so many brilliant  qualities in its writing, design, photography, sound, music, direction, and  acting, that I think anyone who appreciates screen comedy should own a  copy. Now that the special edition DVD has restored Mr. Spielberg's  original intention to this film, I hope it finds a new and appreciative  audience in addition to those of us who have loved it for years.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Countdown to Extinction is without a doubt the best Megadeth album Ive ever heard. After the very overrated &quot;Rust in Peace&quot; it was the perfect way to renew themselves without having to sell out. There is no  specefic best song, my favorite is &quot;Architecture of Agression&quot;  but they are  all good songs when you listen to the album. With  &quot;Risk&quot;, Megadeths latest album, they made a bad attempt to go  commercial. Megadeth needs to listen to &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot;  and go back to the days when they were heavy.  In other words, any true  metal fan needs this album.
6305718903|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie.  I didn't particularly care for the previews and 'possession' movies are ususally so incredible (and poorly done) that I'm unable to abandon my skepticism long enough to get  involved.<br />Not so with this one!  There were enough accurate facts (e.g.,  the Gospel of St. Thomas was found in 1954 and it quotes Christ as saying  &quot;split a piece of wood, I am there. Lift up the stone and you will  find me there.&quot;; Christ's wrists would most likely have been nailed,  not his hands, etc.) to make it believable.<br />Furthermore, the special  effects were fantastic!<br />Don't be too quick to scratch this one off your  'to see' list!

0060174900|4.0|Like other poets and writers,  Sylvia Plath got her acclaim after her death, in her case, suicide.  Suicide always helps to enhance a person's worth in the art and literary world.  Does that sound harsh or cynical?  I  bet Ms. Plath would agree.  Her suicide was a great career move.<br />I just  recently read this book and it is well written and interesting.  I heard  &quot;The Bell Jar&quot; was semi-autobiographical even though it is listed  under fiction and called a novel.  I mostly wanted to read it because I too  have suffered from depression and wanted to see if I could identify with  anything Sylvia Plath wrote.  Yes I did, with many things.  I especially  identified with Esther not wanting to bathe and how it seemed a waste of  time. I never went three weeks without bathing like she did, but I did get  where I considered showering and washing my hair a waste of time, like she  said, because we would just have to do it again.  That's only one example  from the book.  <br />I would like to read a good biography of Sylvia Plath  now to see if I could get some insight into things that &quot;The Bell  Jar&quot; left dangling for me, such as why she/Esther disliked her mother  so much.
B00000BKE0|3.0|What is Holy Smoke? THe kind of song I never though Maiden can do... This albums would be good, if it wasn't from Maiden. It has good songs, like Tailgunner and Bring your daughter, but... they can't save the whole  album.<br />So, want to buy it, do it, but if this will be your first album...  think it again... You should buy Powerslave or Seventh son...
0060196122|5.0|After i have read this book..there is a Question mark on my mind ...are we the normal ones or the others whom in a mental hospital  right now? I bet u will have the same question after u have read it.........great book...
B00002NDB1|3.0|This is an album, which dissapointed a lot of fans... including me.<br />&quot;FUtureal&quot; and &quot;Clansman&quot; Saved it for having two stars (And I have put 1 star to Hanson only). <br />Songs like WHen two worlds  collide and Don't look to the eyes of a stranger, are kind of joke (No  imagination and long as any good torture)<br />As a Maiden fan, I hope the  next will be good.<br />&quot;Brave new world&quot;<br />Go for it... THis will  only make you smash your head on the wall (Like me)<br />You will be better  off buying the Futureal single.
B000005RUV|4.0|From '82 to '86, these two young handsome Brits were a huge hit on both sides of the Atlantic, with Dance-Pop hits like &quot;I'm Your Man&quot; and &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot;. The other good songs I still  like to this day, with me being way too young to be a fan of this duo in  the '80's, are &quot;If You Were There&quot;, the original version of  &quot;Everything She Wants&quot;, the original, really poppy sound of  &quot;Freedom&quot;, &quot;The Edge Of Heaven&quot;, &quot;Wham Rap!&quot;,  &quot;Young Guns (Go For It!)&quot;, and the two remixes at the end,  however, &quot;I'm Your Man '96&quot; doesn't quite sound nearly as  appealing as it's original version. All in all, this was certainly the  standard stepping stone for a legend in the making in pop music, George  Michael. This collection truly compiles the best of Wham!, that's for sure.  It's worth a listen, pick it up sometime soon!
6302378648|5.0|WHen you watch movies like this one, you can understand why Robert Deniro is such a great a Actor. DUe to this movie, he became my favorite actor. THis is the kind of thriller you should see... and you must remember  than... You never know anybody until it is late.
B00000DHRX|4.0|I love this collection! It soothes the heart and really gets your feet to movin'! My favorites from this double solo retrospective of George's, from &quot;For The Heart&quot; would have to be &quot;Father Figure&quot;  &quot;Careless Whisper&quot; (Funny, I thought that he had performed that  while still being part of Wham!, this song isn't on their &quot;Best  Of&quot;), &quot;I Can't Make You Love Me&quot; (Who really did this first,  him or Bonnie Raitt?), &quot;Heal The Pain&quot; (it's almost also for the  feet, but not quite), &quot;Cowboys and Angels&quot;, and Mr. Michael's  number one hit in 1990 &quot;Praying For Time&quot;. And now, my favorite  part, &quot;For The Feet&quot;. The funky new tune &quot;Outside&quot; is  cool, then there's &quot;Fastlove&quot;, the 1993 &quot;Red Hot And  Dance&quot; AIDS benefit single &quot;Too Funky&quot;, &quot;Freedom  '90&quot; (this one's really great), &quot;Star People '97&quot; (I've  never heard the original), next is a cover of fellow Brit performer Seal's  &quot;Killer&quot;, along with &quot;Papa Was A Rolling Stone&quot; both  from the &quot;Five Live&quot; album with Queen. But why Part II of the  definitive George Michael dance song &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot; was  included, I have no idea. Then there's &quot;Monkey&quot;, his excellent  duet with the Queen Of Soul Aretha Franklin &quot;I Knew You Were Waiting  For Me&quot;, &quot;Hard Day&quot;, the one tune that I'm really sick of by  now, ever since the god-awful band Limp Bizkit covered it,  &quot;Faith&quot;, and finally to round out the collection nicely, George  once again with Queen in &quot;Somebody To Love&quot;. Well, that's it for  me tonight, I highly recommend this collection, buy it for yourself soon!
B00000BKE1|4.0|Fear of the dark is the most underrated album, it has good potential, but it was wasted. If you listen songs like &quot;Fear of the dark&quot; &quot;Be quick or be dead&quot; and &quot;Afraid to shoot strangers&quot;  you would think this is a good album... and it is. You would want to put it  5 stars until you listen &quot;Weekend warrior&quot; and &quot;Chains of  misery&quot;<br />This is a good album, but... never compared to  &quot;POwerslave&quot;... NEVER
0446525537|5.0|This is the first Nicolas Sparks book that I have read and I found it to be absolutely wonderful.  This book makes me want to read more of his work.   The way the main character, Landon, grows up in this book is and always  will be memorable to me.  I think it was a wonderful way of showing the  good in people. This heartwarming book will have you feeling good and sad  all at the same time.

B0000027K7|5.0|This CD is part of my all time top 10 list.
B000002O4S|5.0|This is probably one of the greatest soundtrack of all time. The BTTF overture is awesome, all the songs of the movie are on the cd, except for van hallen. Power of love is still goos, back in time too. What about  johnny b goode by marty mcfly, this stuff is so great !
B000023X9W|5.0|Neil Young returns to the Harvest-sound, and it's all so beautiful. From the opener to Good to See You, to The Great Divide (my favourite) and Red Sea (a truly beautiful duet), different in style from his latest  nineties-albums, Young delivers one of his best albums ever.(!)
B000009VOL|5.0|It's late, my contacts are drying out and I'm tierd. But I can't go to bed, no I can't. You see my little brother's car has been egged for the past four nights in a row. When I go to get the paper, breakfast is served as well, I just scoop up some eggs which have been cook from the morning  sun.  It's best when they mistakenly come out sunny side up! I've had  enough though of walking on egg shells, I want to retaliate. So right now  Moon Pix (American Flag) the first track is playing.  I am mentally  preparing to strike back with the hose, and put out this rage these kids  have. Moon Pix Doesn't have one bad song on it.  I can listen to this cd  and find a new something each time. Oh man I hear eggs must go fight back  now. Just remember Moon Pix is eggselent. Complements to Cat Power. later  alligators.
1567184855|5.0|The proposition this book offers on what happens after physical death is nothing short of amazing.  This book really helped me overcome my fear of death and it has given me peace of mind.  Also great for anyone who has  lost a loved one. A must have page turner!
6304711905|5.0|This movie is historically accurate.  Val Kilmer is brillant in the movie as Doc Holliday.  He did his homework and knew the character well.<br />There are 2 books I believe the screen writers followed when writing this script.   The first is &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp,&quot; by Josephine Earp and the  second is &quot;Doc Holliday,&quot; by John Henry Henry.
B000031XCR|4.0|I found this album to be a pleasant surprise, one album I can enjoy when the mood is right. This album brings out Celine's strong points and showcases the kind of substance that made Celine stand out above all other  big-name divas.<br />The only major issue I have is that Celine has so much  more material at her disposal that she should have done a 2-disc album,  much like Whitney Houston's newest Greatest Hits album. Many have  complained about the lack of &quot;Where Does My Heart Beat Now&quot; and  &quot;Misled&quot; - and I wholeheartedly agree. And what about a few  tracks in French? After all Celine's most distinguishing characteristic is  her Quebecoise chanteuse background, unlike other divas bred in New York  and elsewhere. As for the new tracks, they are good in themselves, although  I don't care for them too much because I am not an adult contemporary  fan.<br />I give this album a 4 because of the missing songs and because my  preference works against this album; but otherwise there are few flaws to  find. Celine has a reputation for being not only an expressive singer with  a great, powerful voice, but also for being diligent at her work; that is  evident in this album, as Celine's songs get better in quality over time.  Can you say the same for, say, Mariah Carey? I guess not.<br />Celine chose to  retire at the peak of her career for personal/family reasons, but that also  ensures that her fans will remember her at her best for a long time to  come. I wish that Whitney and Mariah take a clue and retire themselves,  before their reputations go down the drain further.
B000006045|5.0|With the amazing vocals brought into the newest of this groups' albums, it's no wonder at all that they're a topselling artist of our time. Just listening to songs such as &quot;Angel&quot; and &quot;Teardrop&quot; (my  personal favorite) gives you an idea to the heart put into this album.  Elizabeth Fraser's voice and ability to put feeling into her words just  doesn't do justice to her songs of the past. Songs like &quot;Man Next  Door&quot; and &quot;Black Milk&quot; show their ability to reach deep down  inside for untouched feelings that we are so afraid to let out. MA together  with the many guest vocalist on this album make it a supreme buy,  regardless of music preference, race, sex or age.
B000000I0D|5.0|Side one consists of a full intrumental and side 2 a selection of songs with one instrumental (Taurus 3).<BR>At the time of release Crisis was 10 years after Tubular Bells and was used as a bit of a celebration of Mike's official decade in the music business. The opening bars reflect this with a reworking of the Tubular bells piano riff, albeit, very synthetic sounding.<BR>The instrumental 'Crisis' itself is the usual mix of tones and melodies that only Mike can concoct. His obsession with sound technology at this period is very apparent but makes for really interesting listening. There is a heavy use of synthesizers and I feel that this album was the turning point in people's perception of what Mike Oldfield is as a musician. His first instrument is, and always will be, guitar but people seem to think he's a virtuoso keyboardist.<BR>Taurus 3 is an instrumental that displays his amazing skill as an acoustic guitarist. I've known several people listen to this track and not realise it's Mike playing!!!They just think he's a keyboard man!!! READ THE INSTRUMENT CREDITS!!!<BR>Jon Anderson, Michael Chapman and Maggy Reilly are the vocalists used on various songs. 'Moonlight Shadow' being the obvious one to note. Simon Phillips does an incredible job on drums and co-production with backing from bassist Phil Spalding, keyboardist Micky Simmonds (Rennaisance) and Anthony Phillips (early Genesis) on guitars.<BR>Overall, this CD does stand out as one of Mike's classics and should be a definate purchase for any fan.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I think this cd surpasses the debut.  Britney has yet to fully mature and prove her voice, however this cd is a great improvement, and I can listen to it over and over. :)
B000000I0I|5.0|This is a beautifully composed piece of music. It's very difficult to put into words what it is. If you are a sensitive soul and like what is now known as 'new age' music, then I feelOmmadawn would certainly be a worth  while purchase. It is very English. Delicate. Strong. Like rain on a May  morning or fluffy clouds over a field of lambs, (sorry, I am getting silly  now). You get the idea though?  From the very first melody the atmosphere  is simply haunting. It's very easy to say that this album is boring. It's  also easy to say Shakespeare is boring.  You decide.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is the one thing that keeps an entire bomber squadron in WWII still flying. The book constructs a vivid portrayal of the experiences of Yossarian and his comrades and their reasons for insanity.  Their only goal  is forging plans that can keep them on the ground and out of their planes.  There is a limit to the number of missions the squadron must fly, but as  soon as enough men reach it, it is simple raised.  The squadron is caught  in a never-ending circle broken only by death. The ironic Catch -22 is  their only path towards freedom, it keeps them flying because it is  Catch-22.  The book is a great read the humor in the book runs abound along  and the irony behind catch-22 creates great plot twists. Yossarian will  continue to live for many years.
B00004STPT|5.0|to a terrific movie. Highly recommend both the movie and the music.
0316777722|2.0|After a 3 year wait since Naked, it's a bit of a letdown that this book is made largely of material that has been printed elsewhere.  After being such a fan I suppose it's my own fault for having sought out his various  articles in anticipation of a new book. But so much recycled material is  disappointing, better for a paperback perhaps. There are some very good  laughs and expected Sedaris worldview, but the tone is disjointed, rushed-  it's magazine writing on deadline basically. Descriptions of life in Paris  and 22 -city book tours (like a rock star) are also not likely to appeal to  readers who enjoyed his hilarious depictions of life in the working  classes. He seems to be above it all, moved on from crude America, and the  work is far less engaging for it.
0517543052|5.0|This book shares Ram Dass's journey into consciousness that transformed him in every way. He reminds us that the journey we find ourselves on in the world of form has a parallel expression in the formless aspects of our  being.  Each of us are on a journey into the nature of soul. The paths we  take in this life engage some of the most profound experiences our  consciousness is capable of embracing. Be Here Now reminds us to make the  most of each moment, see it as grace, and filled with enough love to last a  lifetime.    I also recommend: What the Dying Teach Us: Lessons on Living  by Samuel Oliver
B00004T8RK|4.0|First you must understand as far as words go Im not great but bear with me because this album is too good for me not to sing its praises..<br />The sixth studo album for Pearl Jam, Binaural, is really something special. From the  first song &quot;Breakerfall&quot; right through until the end of the disc  it had me captivated as so few CD's now do... Highlights on this album  include the single release &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot; and  &quot;Insignificance&quot; and my personal favourite and possibly one of my  new favourite songs &quot;Thin Air&quot;<br />If you are a Pearl Jam  &quot;virgin&quot; or an fan from way back or even if you want to hear  something a little bit different, give this album a try...<br />Ed Vedders  voice just seems to get better and better, and the rest of the band (Jeff  Ament, Mike McCready, Matt Cameron and Stone Gossard) play with a level of  enthusiasm and skill rarely heard. I love this album as I have with all of  their albums. This one just seems to be more grown up.....Have a  listen.....<br />I only gave it four stars because nothing is perfect, but  this is about as close as music can get to perfection.....

The plot was very exciting and you never expect what's gonna happen next. All the  characters are really cold, strange and ambiguous. The use of letters is  very usefull to explain all the points of view of the characters and to  enter easly in their life and in their thoughts. The author has been really  good to create the atmosphere and the suspance. I think that if you liked  the movie you'll love the book even more.
078062565X|5.0|The original 'King Kong' is one of the small handful of movies that defines the reason that movies were invented.  Only the most jaded of individuals would find Willis O'Brien's painstakingly precise stop-motion  photography of 50-foot tall Kong and his nasty Dinosaur friends dated by  today's standards;  this movie transcends special effects by honestly  suspending disbelief for a full 100 minutes and bringing you into IT'S  world instead of vice versa.  Any somewhat slow, plodding business in the  first half-hour plus of the movie, prior to Kong's first appearance, is  more than made up for as we switch into high gear for a non-stop adventure  fest between the jungles of Skull Island and eventually the skyscrapers of  New York.  The whole way through, we are helped out by likable, fun  performances from Robert Armstrong and Bruce Cabot, pursuing Fay Wray and  her tall, hairy captor through thick and thin.  Many unforgettable scenes,  such as Kong's first appearance as he abducts poor terrified Ms. Wray,  Kong's battle with a vicious 1930s-style T-Rex;  his bursting through the  wall which seperates him from the villagers on Skull Island and subsequent  trashing of their village in search of his little blonde sweetie;  his  escape from his chains in a theater in New York City;  his trashing of an  elevated train (my favorite scene) and of course, Kong's legendary last  stand against the squadron of biplanes atop the Empire State Building.  And  believe me, this does not even scratch the surface of how many great scenes  there are....if you have not seen this yet (and ESPECIALLY if your only  memory of Kong is from Dino De Laurentis' horrendous 1976 full color  remake), do yourself a favor and order it right now;  nearly 70 years  later, it is still the greatest fantasy film ever made and ranks right up  there with the all-time great films period.  (The documentary piece which  accompanies this special edition is interesting, yet does not shed a whole  heck of lighton anything or add a lot;  it is just 25 minutes which needs  to be fast forwarded through at the beginning of the tape in order to get  to the actual film.)
B00004S6GL|4.0|Elliot Smith is very consistent.  Each of his solo albums contain very enjoyable music with great depth of feeling and musicianship.  This album is very similar to XO in virtually all aspects, so if you liked his  previous work...
B00000JPHF|5.0|The movie which introduced the square-headed, bolts-in-the-neck design of the monster (a design which is still alive and well and kicking some near 70 years later!) is still the spookiest of all the Frankenstein films  through the '30s and '40s.  The sets and photography are shadowy and muted  and add a sense of eerieness to everything. Like 'Dracula' just before it,  this movie benefits from the lack of a running musical soundtrack - the  creepiest moments in the movie benefit from the accompanying dead silence.   Karloff was the original Frankenstein Monster (save for a couple of mostly  forgotten silent films from other studios earlier)and is the best actor to  ever play the monster;  his performances throughout the first three movies  evoke fear and sympathy from scene to scene, and it is tough to say that  this first performance is not his best (although in 'Bride of Frankenstein'  he does get to speak!).  Also, Colin Clive as the mentally anguished Dr.  Frankenstein gives a great performance - Clive, who died much too young,  was excellent in the 'tortured soul' kind of roles.  The rest of the cast  is solid too, including notable performances from a couple of other  stalwarts from horror films of the '30s, Dwight Frye (as Fritz, the mad  hunchback assistant) and Edward Van Sloan (as Frankenstein's mentor, Dr.  Waldman).  The Great James Whale directed this movie, as well as a few  other classic horror movies from the early 1930s (The Invisible Man, Bride  of Frankenstein, The Old Dark House).  This film does not quite have the  sense of dark humor that some of his other films had, making it a little  eerieer than his other work.  'Bride of Frankenstein' may indeed have been  an all around better movie, but the original was spookier.   As far as  classic black-and-white monster flicks go, the original 'Frankenstein' is  still pretty tough to beat.
B00004SCX6|1.0|When are people going to wake up and get real?  Britney Spears is coming to the end of her 15 minutes of fame, and soon she will be looked at as the Debbie Gibson or Tiffany of the 90's/early 00's.  Music like this lacks any  kind of talent, but it's funny cuz it usually takes about 3 years for  people to wake up and realize that before their appreciation for the  &quot;artist&quot; dwidles.<br />  This is Tennybopper music in every aspect  of the word.  The record companies go out and find these pretty faces and  make stars out of them for no reasons except for the way they look.  The  message that Britney sends out to all her little fans it that you have to  have a perfect body and you must be something your're not to be liked and  accepted.  It seems that is what everything is based around these days.  We  live in a overly shallow and materialistic society, and this is one of the  reasons why. The media pushes this garbage and you all accept it. People  feel that you have to be fake if you want to be liked.  <br />  Music has  definately taken a backseat to style.  Music used to be good. It's not  anymore.  All it is is commercialized rubbish.  Look at all these other  untallented groups like the Backside Boys and N'Sync.  How do groups like  this even get signed?  At least the Backstreet Boys can sing though.   Britney cannot.  All her tallent lies in the way she dances and strutts her  stuff.  I do not own this album or any of Britney Spears albums, nor do I  want to.  I have heard enough of her music though on MTV and I hear it all  the time in public to know what her music sounds like.  Its not music.  If  Britney had talent she would write her own songs.  I laugh at people who  spend tons of cash to see one of her lipsynched concerts.
B000002HAJ|4.0|This album runs in the middle of the pack of all of the other Cure albums. It's a decent album but it's short of being a great album. I could really live without &quot;High&quot;, &quot;Wendy Time,&quot; and &quot;Doing The  Unstuck.&quot; Those tracks seem airy and just blah. Apart, Trust, and End  are definitely the best tracks on here. From The Edge Of The Deep Green Sea  is right up there as well. This is worth buying if you liked &quot;Kiss Me,  Kiss Me, Kiss Me&quot; and &quot;The Top&quot;, those albums that vary  greatly in mood. But for people stuck in the early 80's, who like Faith and  Pornography, might not care for it as much.
B00003CXDV|4.0|A very good DVD production of the movie. The &quot;Lost in Space&quot; feature was interesting although short. The deleted scenes are very funny and I think a lot of them should have been retained in the first cut. The  deleted scenes also help explain some of the incongruities, such as why  Sigourney Weaver suddenly is showing a lot of cleavage toward the end of  the film.
B000031XCR|3.0|Where does my heart beat now, Any other way, If I were you. These are three great songs that should have been on this CD.  This always happens! They always leave something out that they shouldn't and then put in things  that are questionable. She should have left off most of the new songs and  taken a couple of the older ones off. They didn't belong there! This is a  good CD to buy if you don't own any Dion albums and can't afford to buy  them all. But for me it is just plain frustrating.
B00003CWOL|4.0|You see Kevin Smith films for the dialogue, not the cinematography. He really is a great writer with a quarky mind. He has some fascinating ideas. A major disappointment with this DVD is a lack of extras. A commentary  track from Smith would have been great and made this one a must in a  collection.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I bought &quot;Oops...I did it again&quot; the first day it came out. I think it is really good. It is a great follow up to &quot;Baby, One more time&quot; The Cd has all different kinds of songs on it, from the kind  that'll make you cry, to the ones you'll just want to get up and dance to.  I highly recomend this cd to anyone who like pop music.
B00003CWL5|5.0|I went in to this movie being a big fan of action and titles like the matrix, and let me tell you when I left that movie had a powerful effect on me. Everything in the movie has a purpose, you can see the characters pain  throughout the brilliant acting in the film. And of couse the ending will  suprise you. Let me tell you this movie really makes you think about your  life and how important the small things are, than worrying about the  material things in life. Go see this movie now, I will promise you, you  will not be dissapointed.
0375707972|1.0|I teach a high school modern novel course, and it's become kind of a tradition for the students in my class and I to make a pilgrimage to Borders and to select, as our last novel together, a book I've never read.   When I think back to that amazing pile of books we abandoned for THE  READER, I feel heartsick.  There was a faction in our class who wanted to  read a vampire novel called I AM LEGEND, and I, wanting something perhaps a  little more literary, backed the group pulling for THE READER.  How I wish  we had opted for the undead.  This is surely one of the most manipultive  and poorly written novels I've ever read.  Even my high school students  knew it was a dramatic step down from the novels we had read so far in  class (CUCKOO'S NEST, POISONWOOD BIBLE, SULA, TIME'S ARROW, ect).  There  are whole chapters that read like bad essays or banal journal entries.  The  &quot;climax,&quot; a court trial, is referred to rather than shown.  The  voice of the narrator is generic, as is his depiction of the woman he meets  at 15 and then again 20 years later.  We found ourselves poking fun at the  sentences rather than discussing the characters.  Our public consciousness  regarding the Holocaust is so specific and layered (thanks to other better  novels and to SCHINDLER'S LIST) that anything less seems like a horrible  affront to the reader and to the victims of the tragedy.  This is the  second &quot;Oprah novel&quot; I've read that suggests, Toni Morrison and  Jane Hamilton aside, that her literary tastes are flagging.
B00003CX5A|4.0|This film was very very cool.  It was a completley immersive movie that put you in Sleepy Hollow, and gave you haunting scenery to enjoy.  Tim Burton is thankfully at the top of his game, for the first time since  Batman Returns, and showcasing fine actors.  Johnny Depp is funny and  completley lovable as Ichabod, and Christinia Ricci is hypnotic as Katrina  Van Tassel.   The film suffers however from two things, a sometimes weak  screenplay that sometimes does not stick to the original story where it  should (those who've seen the picture and read the story know what we were  expecting at the end), and Tim Burtons egotistic desire to put his  girlfriend (Lisa Marie) in the movie for ten minutes too long in a  completley tangential role revealing nothing about characters or plot or  motives.  Beside those two points (which after watching the engrossing  film, one tends to forget about) you will find Sleepy hollow to be a  remarkable experience.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|This album is a product of the era when rock music still was maintainly honest. featuring various styles, one should not think this as a traditional punk album, as it certainly is not. It's not trying to be  anything more than it really is, and I think partly because of that it is  one fo the biggest classics in the rock'n'roll history. plus, the lyrics  are gewnious, featuring issues from the late-70's politics to the average  Joe's life. Album filled with intelligence, honesty and raw energy. A must  forany rock'n'roll listener.
630349255X|5.0|Baraka will make you gasp, cry, shake your head, and smile. All with no dialogue and no story. Baraka is about the planet and how we humans fit into it. <br />This film is almost a slap in the fact to some people who have  become so wrapped up in their day to day lives that they have forgotten  that they are a part of nature and that the whole world is interdependant.  For others it is a celebration of the diversity of the earth. Finally it  can be a wake-up call to what we are doing to our planet.<br />Baraka is  educational, but not preachy.... entertaining, but not mindless.... and  finally - beautiful but not superficial.<br />Watching Baraka should be a  prerequisite to calling yourself a human-being.<br />I just can't tell you how  much I love it.
B00004T8RK|5.0|This new album from Pearl jam shows how the band have developed together over the years.  Every member has contributed music and/or lyrics, and this has given us a wide range of tracks. Form the rocking Insignificance to the  broody lyrics of Sleight of Hand.  Once again they have also done something  different and special, in Soon Forget we have Eddie Vedder playing a  ukelele, and it its is a superb song.  A rich mixture of music and  words<br />Buy this now!
B00000K0DT|5.0|I like nothing better than stumbling upon a really good movie you know nothing about. Like when you click to a late night flick and are so transfixed by it you stay up to 4 in the morning watching it.<br />The Usual  Suspects was like this for me. I rented it as soon as it was on video... I  didn't know anyting about it. I watched it and just sat there and said WOW.  Wow. <br />Don't READ REVIEWS! They will destroy the movie for you. Take my  word and just watch it. You'll be a Kevin Spacey fan for life...
B00000IOSU|5.0|Although i don't really enjoy live albums that much, this was really a great album.  As it has been said before, &quot;Possession&quot; takes on this psychotic, powerful vibe that I love.  Even though there weren't that  many songs from her earlier albums, this was an excellently done album.  It  deserves more than five stars.
B00003CWL5|5.0|This movie is amazing, pretty bizarre, but amazing. When I went to see this movie I wasn't really sure what to expect. After I watched the movie I thought that it was acceptionally well written, directed &amp; acted. It's  kind of hard to describe everything that goes on in the movie because there  are so many twists &amp; turns. It's something you just have to see for  yourself.
B000002HEM|1.0|I was not a maniac before I bought this album and I'm still not a maniac.  The only song that I liked from this album was &quot;because the night.&quot; I just could not get into the other songs because the other  songs didn't have the same feel as &quot;because the night.&quot;  I'd buy  this used, but not new.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Let's face it: &quot;Binaural&quot; is not the kind of record that knocks out the listener immediately.  But that's the exact reason why this album gets better with every listen.  Pearl Jam could have easily taken the easy  road, and ended up making a record that sounded like Creed. I know, I know,  Creed ripped off PJ, but that is my point. Pearl Jam push their music, make  it demanding, and refuse to rehash their old hits or sound. They've  sacrificed a large portion of their fans but who cares? The songs here,  like 'Grievance,' Insignificance,' and 'Parting Ways' are written and  performed by a veteran band working at the height of their powers.  Experimental and daring, 'Binaural' again shows PJ to be committed to  making music on their own terms. If you want easy listening go buy Creed.
B000002I25|5.0|This album is great.  If you have only heard of the Doors, but not actually heard them, then this should be the first album of theirs to purchase.  It's got classics that have stood the test of time like: break  on through, alabama song, light my fire and the end.
B000000WA4|5.0|Melon Colie and the infinate sadness is one of the  best albums ever.  It has musical taste for just about any one if you like thoughtful tunes you can listen to Tonight Tonight.  If you like songes that do not have a lot  of meaning you can listen to 1979.  if you like hard rock there is always  zero.  in conlusion this is the 3rd best double albulm after, &quot;the  wall&quot; by pink floyd, and the &quot;white albulm&quot; by the beatles
B000002I2I|3.0|It has some good Doors songs on it, but it's not their best.  &quot;Waiting for the sun&quot; is their best effort on this cd.  I would say the songs are good, but not great like their first album that had tons  of classics on it.  A buy for a big time Doors fan.
6305075468|5.0|Directed by F.W. Murnau, the original, superbly loathsome German version of Bram Stoker's novel DRACULA is a concenrated essay in horror fantasy, full of weird, macabre camera effects.  Though ludicrous at times (every horror film seems to become rather absurd after the passage of years - yet the horror remains), this first important film of the Vampire genre has more spectral atmosphere, more ingenuity, and more imaginative ghoulish ghastiliness than any of its successors.  The movie often seems more closely related to demonic painting than to the later, rather rigid vampire movies.  Henrik Galeen's adaptation of the novel changes the setting from Victorian England to Bremen in 1838.  In the novel, Dracula himself is at first quite old, becoming progessively rejevenated in England by fresh blood; but he's never as grotesque as Schreck in this Murnau version nor as romantically attractive as Langella in the Badham version. The influence of this 1922 silent can be seen in movies such as Bergman's THE MAGICIAN and Goddard's ALPHAVILLE. Surrealistic and Freudian, this version is equally frightening and bizarre.
B000002GK1|1.0|Go and buy soundgarden's other album &quot;superunknown.&quot;  This album has &quot;outshined&quot; on it and that is about it for songs that you can actually listen to on this album.  The other cuts aren't even worth  mentioning.  Their second album &quot;superunknown&quot; is ten times  better because you can at least listen to it from time to time.
0671775308|1.0|Several of the most annoying people I've ever known drone on incessantly about how they're going to be millionaires by obsessively following this book's commands. I glanced at it in the bookstore at it seemed to be  resemble most diet plans, i.e. eat less and exercise. If I understand  correctly, if I spend less, put my money in mutual funds, and devote all my  waking hours to accumulating money, I can join the ranks of people with a  million dollars. Ge, no thanks, I think I'll keep my personality the way it  is, and read some decent novels instead of this drivel. May I recommend  Thomas Pynchon as a start? Or maybe a tome of history, say, C. Vann  Woodward?
B000002U3P|1.0|The only good song on this album is 'lust for life.'  I thought the soundtrack was going to be pretty good, but only 'lust for life' was a good and catchy song.  The songs are different from most music out there and I  would only buy this album if you really liked the movie.
B000002UDG|4.0|Even though this is an old CD of his best songs from the seventies and early eighties it's still pretty good. Has some of those songs where you say &quot;This is soooo eighties.&quot; But then there are those that you  just love like &quot;Band on the Run&quot;, &quot;No More Lonely  Nights&quot; &quot;Silly Love Songs&quot;, &quot;Live and Let Die&quot; and  &quot;With a Little Lucky&quot;. Great CD, even if a lot of the songs are  corn (i.e. &quot;Ebony and Ivory).
B000002I2M|4.0|It's got three real good songs on it: Love her madly, L.A. woman and Riders on the storm. Most of the songs are good on this album and this is worth buying even if you aren't a  Doors fan.  Good music that you can  relax and listen to.
0780624890|5.0|The problem with America is that there are too many soft cushy malls into which ugly hairy movies are screened. On the other hand, sometimes an ugly hairy movie is so much fun you forget that you are in a mall.<br />Where did  Batman go terribly wrong? Why was Spawn such a yawn? Well, cinematically  speaking, my explanation might not suffice, but I know this much: whoever  made 'Blade' got it right. Down to the last edit. I am digging into my  black boots to come up with raving superlatives kiddies. This movie is not  only the bomb, it is the shockwave, the flying glass and the crunching  concrete and steel. I have never felt so cool driving my own chrome-rimmed  black euro-sedan pumping bass, as just after seeing 'Blade'. The charge of  coolness lasts long after the final credits. I'm going to see it again. And  probably again too.<br />When I saw 'Passenger 57', it was at a midnight show  off Times Square with a packed house of nightcrawling action hounds. I'm  wishing to be with just such a rowdy crowd for the next screening of Blade,  because Wesley Snipes has just outdone himself. Yeah he was bad in p57, and  I could dig his Simon Phoenix badass, but neither of these characters  matches the ferocious intensity of Blade. Blade is pure focus, absolute  fury and lethal precision. All that and black leather, silver hollowpoint  bullets and a titanium pig sticker. Ouch! Bite me, Terminator.<br />Plot is  satisfactorily straightforward, never lurching off too far. But the action!  Oh mercy Jesus this man can fight! The effects are seamless and never  overblown - car chases are speedily goofed up for effect, the clouds and  ominous music are done just right, the 'America is f'd up' is left out of  the picture, there are enough Asians in the movie to remind you that Asians  are left out of movies, and there is enough mayhem to satisfy appetites for  destruction without overdoing it. It's funky and hip. I'm even thinking  about grabbing the soundtrack. In other words this is an absolute first  class action flick and it hits just the right balance.<br />So, what's not to  like? Well for one thing, you never get the impression that Blade can lose.  The bad guy in this flick, sneered by what I suppose is the coolest of the  new looking evil dudes, is no physical menace. We know he's up to something  evil, but we never get a first hand look at his cold-blooded capabilities.  He just pisses off all the old fogie vampires because he parties all night,  wears trashy fashions and smokes like Leonardo DiCaprio. He talks about  taking over the world, but we don't see him setting Bosnians off against  each other. On the whole, he doesn't seem any more superhumanly bad than  your average Noriega. He doesn't even smack his woman.<br />Nevertheless,  Dorff's Deacon Frost does employ a load of pseudo-zombie troops always on  the move in a relentless pursuit of Blade. They all end up fodder in a  flurry of incredible martial arts stunts and fabulously violent deaths. But  of course Blade must be hobbled by babeage, in this case, the smart and  somewhat vulnerable N'Bushe Wright who gets to participate in various  girl-fights peppered through the flick.<br />Still, in all. This is the best  action flick since, hmmmm. Total Recall.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Maybe one of the best films of the last 10 years. Fight Club is one of the deepest film released in a long time. Most people see it as just violence, for violence's sake. But in reality, it's a modern day parable about  consumerist culture. The fact this film is also very funny, will probably  pass unnoticed by many.
B000001Y5J|5.0|I love this CD.  Buy it if you don't have it.  The best songs in &quot;Broken&quot; EP are:  &quot;Wish&quot; and &quot;Happiness In Slavery&quot;.
0679720200|5.0|Albert Camus' tale, The Stranger, reveals to its reader how important life truly is.  The novel revolves around a man suffering from the recent death of his mother.  However, it appears that his way of coping involves not  feeling anything at all.  Read along as we learn of a man without a care of  thought in the world, and learn why this novel can entertain as well as  teach any person the true values of life.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has done it again....but better this time.  This is a more mature cd and she sounds more grown up too.  No more corny ballads like &quot;Email my heart&quot;,etc...  This is one of the only cd's that I have  that I can listen to from start to finish.  I say that this is one cd to  pick up, there are going to be a lot of singles off of this one.
B00004SCX6|3.0|All in all, I feel that this album proves that Britney still has a long way to go. It is no doubt better than the first album. There are some good songs (Stronger, When Your Eyes Say It) and some really bad songs (Dear  Diary, Where Are You Now). I feel that Britney tried to show a more mature  side of herself which she succeeds in. But she never ventures out from the  pop star mold. I feel that there is a great album in her, if she would only  take some risks in her music and not stick to the trusted and successful  formula. In an MTV interview she said that she would like to stick to pop  music. I hope that it is not a hint that she will be making this type of  music for the rest of her career. It would be nice if Britney looked at  artists like Janet Jackson, who reinvent themselves for every album, and  gotten a few ideas. Overall its a good album, but how many more like this  will Britney put out? Take some risks and shock the music world.
1573225517|5.0|If it hasn't already achieved the status of a contemporary classic, Nick Hornby's &quot;High Fidelity&quot; will surely become the literary anthem for past and future generations of lost young men. Men who spend their  lives escaping life and commitment. Rob is a vinyl junkie who owns a second  hand record shop in London, an eternal teen whose emotional state and inner  momentum is powered not by regular &quot;adult&quot; concerns (ie, jobs,  mortgages, etc) but by 60s pop/rock classics. His Top 5 Desert Island Discs   become the soundtrack of his life. Relationships (past and present) begin  inevitably with a perfect compilation tape and end when the chase is won  and reality bites. Growing up on Dusty Springfield's &quot;The Look of  Love&quot; may have changed his life forever. Problem is, life doesn't  quite deliver like Dusty sings it.  Hornby's take on Rob is so spot-on and  offhandedly true it's become a timeless metaphor for Joe of all  generations. This is quite simply the most funny, readable and enjoyable  book I have read all year. It's fast and zany and such rollicking fun you  don't want it to end. Being a huge 60s pop/rock fan myself, I absolutely  thrilled to the musical references which brought back so many wonderful  memories I very nearly forgot. &quot;High Fidelity&quot; is quite the most  accessible &quot;must read&quot; novel for everyone. Yes, both guys and  gals. I promise you a great time. Amazing book ! PS : I haven't watched the  movie yet, but I can't imagine it topping the book. I'd also bet that some  of the resonance has been lost from the film's relocation to Chicago.
0792845730|5.0|Before director Paul Verhoeven starting pushing the limits of on-screen sex and kinkiness with movies like Showgirls and Basic Instince, he was pushing the limits of cinematic violence, and Robocop is a fine example of  that.  This movie has so much cleverly done graphic violence that is is  great fun to watch and listen to.  The effects are superbly done, a mixture  of outstanding costuming and pretty good stop-motion, not to mention  makeup.  Of course, this movie completely represents the american police  forces (they're not allowed to shoot to kill, and they're not allowed to  cause thousands of dollars of property damage to stop a petty theft) but  who cares, it looks cool!  The acting is good, especially on Weller's part,  and this movie does a prime job making fun of the past &amp; the future  through commercial interludes throughout the film.  Boddicker is still one  of the most cold-hearted SOB's to appear in a movie, and Robocop is still  the most human non-human.  This movie makes fun of large monopolizing  corporations, conspiracies, and the military, but not too blatantly, and  it's got some excellent sequences where people take baths in toxic waste  and their flesh starts melting off their bones.  This movie is simply a  thrill to watch, an almost unrivalled gory, over-the-top action movie.
0440234743|3.0|&quot;Testament&quot; entertained me, however, it wasn't what I'm used to from Grisham.  By the time I finished the book, I realized I didn't think much had really taken place, although it had.  <br />&quot;Testament&quot;  moves at a languorous pace, so it would be a good read while on vacation.   If you'd like to see a new side of Grisham, try this book.  <br />A large  portion of the book is set in The Pantanl jungle of South America, and I  enjoyed the detailed descriptions of the protagonist's adventures  there.<br />The protagonist himself is a sad and pitiful character, but he is  also believeable and human.  He is not so pitiful as to be uninteresting,  and the relationships he forges with acquaintances in South America are  realistic--they *feel* right.<br />My reason for giving the book three stars  is that the book didn't keep me riveted.  Yes, I did like it, but I took  about a month to finish the book.
B000002UAR|4.0|Revolver has some good songs.  Taxman, Eleanor Rigby, I'm Only Sleeping...  Well, they are all good.  Of course, there is Yellow Submarine.  Make your own judgement on that one.  It's amazing that Lennon's chemical rockers can  fit onto an album that doesn't seem to feature anyone else who is high  (except maybe Paul on Eleanor Rigby).  Paul's songs shine as pop music as  they usually do.  Particularly Good Day Sunshine and Here, There and  Everywhere.  George really came into his own in terms of songwriting.  He  got three chances on this album, and they turned out well.  And, Ringo,  what can I say?  <br />For me this isn't the Fab Four's greatest effort, but I  still enjoy it.  Rubber Soul closed out the Beatles' pop era (a la  Backstreet Boys), and moved them into their psychadelic era.  Revolver is  the turning point for the Beatles.  Abbey Road is the group's best effort,  followed by Revolver and then Sgt. Pepper.  I gave it only 4 stars simply  because the group still hasn't reached their full potential here.  They  moved forward with Rubber Soul, took more steps with this, and got there  with Sgt. Pepper, The White Album and Abbey Road.  If you're a Beatles fan,  you need this turning point, essential  album.  If you don't really care  for the Beatles, then don't buy this one.  Go for Abbey Road to get  acquainted and move on from there.

This is a great love story, one that really has a nice plot, &amp; hold a person's attention all the way to the end. I thoroughly enjoyed watching  this movie, &amp; even cried at the end!  &amp; that's not normal for me!   I HIGHLY recommend this one for the romantic at heart!
B00004SCX6|5.0|I heard a lot of nasty comments about Brit making a lot of the same songs again and was a little dissapointed.  I love Brittney, her music is decidedley bubble gum, but I love her voice, and think she has a lot of talent.  So, I almost didn't get her new Cd, and I am kicking myself for  almost not buying it.  This CD is awesome, and I listen to it all the time!   Her songs are new and fresh, and she definately did do it again, she made  a great CD.  I love the voice tracks in here, I think they add character  and personality to the songs.<br />1) *Oops!.. I Did It Again*  Great song.   Nice fast beat, but rather like One More Time.  Still, it is a great  song.<br />2)  *Stronger*  Weird begining, but better as it goes.  It gets  better as you listen to it.<br />3)  *Don't Go Knockin' On My Door*  Nice song  to diss on boys... I love it!<br />4)  *(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction*  Easily  the best remake song of the past ten years.  In the car, my mom and I both  knew the lyrics to it!<br />5)  *Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know*  I really  love this song.  It is the second best on this CD.  Shania Twain's husband  is really talented.  Although some parts of the song sounded a lot like  some of Shania's, it was still unique.<br />6)  *What U See (Is What U Get)*   Not quite as good as some of them, but still a nice, up beat song.<br />7)   *Lucky*  My favorite song on the CD!  This is such a great song, I can't  wait to see a music video of it.  I put my player on repeat when this song  comes around.<br />8)  *One Kiss From You*  Good song<br />9)  *Where Are You  Now*  A nice change from the other songs.<br />10)  *Can't Make You Love Me*   A nice song that all girls can relate to.<br />11)  *When You Eyes Say It*  My  third fav on the CD.  A great ballad.<br />12)  *Dear Diary*  This is the only  icky song on the album.  It seemed really sappy to me the first time  around, but when you listen to it more, it gets better.<br />The thing I love  about Oops is that thereisn't only one good song on it, and I know my  headphones will be glued to my ears for a long time with this CD spinning  in the player.
B00000ILBK|4.0|I think our expectations were a little too high after First Contact.  If you view this movie from the perspective of being a good Star Trek episode, you won't be disappointed.  The action certainly isn't as intense as its  predecessor, but the story is engaging with a slight twist.  If you're a  Star Trek fan, it's a must see (or have).  Even if you're not, it's a  worthwhile rental.
B00004SPYK|5.0|Richard Gere is so SEXY in the movie.  He plays a male prostitute that gets framed for a murder.  The wife of the mayor is willing to say he was with her, to end the investigation.
B00000IPAX|1.0|I really truely dont see how these guys are any different than any of the pop boy bands out their. poor musicianship; making money off their looks; horrible lyrics. you might say &quot;oh but theyre &quot;punk&quot;&quot;  thats bs go buy an against all authority or an anti-flag cd for real punk.
B00004RHZU|5.0|i recently saw her in concert at radio station event she is one hotty with a body.The music is ok too.We need more people that look like her
B00004SCX6|4.0|Well, let me say that I was interested in what Britney has done on this album. I am no big pop fan, but I like it. She carries nice, even though at times, tongue-in-cheek tunes. She hasn't got a big voice. Actually, I  believe that she probably has it somewhere down there, but does not use it.  Britney does not have the &quot;Christina&quot; voice, but she can sing and  sticks to the tune. In my opinion, this album is better than her debut  album, which by the way sold more than 28 million copies worldwide! Quite  an accomplishment. I don't think she will break that record with that one  as too much might be expected from her at this point. But if she does, good  for her. So, don't listen to this album trying to find diva-like material,  but good dance, pop material that sticks with you and that may remind you  of this summer. Let me dissect the album for you and tell you what I think  of each song.<br />OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN Catchy tune that reminds you of a  love child of BABY, BABY and DRIVE ME CRAZY. I like it a lot. Nice  beats!<br />STRONGER Nice dance mix that reminds me of the BSB LARGER THAN  LIFE. More pop though.  <br />DON'T GO KNOCKING ON MY DOOR. I don't like this  one as much as the others, but it is nice. More mature lyrics that show her  growth from a young poppy girl to an older teenager!<br />SATISFACTION Unlike  some other reviews I have read, I feel that this is a great job that has  been done with this song. It was produced by Rodney Jerkins, who works with  Whitney Houston and Janet Jackson. Her voice is a bit more powerful here.  The introduction reminds me of something that Janet would do. I really like  it a lot. One of the my favorite track on the album. I never caught with  the Rolling Stones' version. Really good!<br />DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO  KNOW It screams Shania Twain. It is pretty nice and that one shows a nice  transition from what she used to do (SODA POP and the like). It is va nice  song, but it seems to me that singing this song represents a challenge for  her. She is learning though.<br />WHAT U SEE This is Britney again, with her  moaning and everything we know about her. However, the arrangememnt sounds  harder and more confident. One of my least favorite tracks, but good  though. More mature lyrics too.<br />LUCKY I loved this song right from the  start. very 50s/60s beat. That one is definitely tongue-in-cheek, but I  believe that it carries a really good message to all those young girls that  shows that when you look / act like you have got it all, it is likely that  you don't. Britney is trying to show that all of you girls have something  special about yourself througout this album and that is a darn good message  for every 13-17 year old girl, no mater how cheesy it sounds!<br />ONE KISS  FROM YOU Pure pop! Nothing great, but nice to listen to. Once again, nice  beat, more mature beat, which is one of the trademarks of this album. It is  the most tongue-in cheek of them all. Not bad, but not a highlight for me  on this work.<br />WHERE ARE YOU NOW Now there is my all-time favorite song.  You like ballads, you will love this one. The lyrics are pretty nice and  the chorus is wonderful. I am sure you will like it a lot. It sounds a lot  like something that Janey Jackson could sing. This might be a nice closing  number for her shows if you cast my drift, a vehicle to leave a lasting  impression. Should be a single.<br />CAN'T MAKE YOU LOVE ME Pure pop music  again, her trademark. Once again, a nice message for all the girls who are  wondering whether the guy they are infatuated with is really worth it. Not  my favorite tune, but a nice message again. Quite wholesome.<br />WHEN YOUR  EYES SAY IT Who would have thought that Diane Warren would appear on this  album? It is a very mature choice of lyrics once again. She is doign a  great job here. Not my favorite track, but she carries this song quite  well. <br />DEAR DIARY Well, very, very girly song. However, that is what a  journal (diary) is made for. Your deepest confidence put there in the  plainest form. The context calls for such easy language. We are all humans.  So is Britney. Co-written by Britney. This one shows that in spite of the  mature lyrics she has recorded here, she is just a your girl, struggling to  become the mature woman she intends to be. This may mean nothing to a lot  of people, but it is a darn good message for all those young girls out  there. Knowing this, you will definitely enjoy that new production. It is  really good...if you like pop music. I cannot mention the transition from  Britney the teenager to Britney the young woman enough. Very clever.
B000000OY9|1.0|This can't be Neil Young!  This sounds too new wave to be him. I can't even believe he did this album, this is practically a disgrace to his rock career, but to take him back he still is one of the best artists of all  time and this is the only album that sucks. So I forgive him. But people  don't listen to this album, your wasting your time if you want to listen to  this Neil Young album.
B00004SCX6|4.0|K,<br />I didnt like her first cd that much. This one i think is a lot better best tracks are Lucky, What U See, Stronger and Where Are You Now?. Dont Let Me B The Last To know is a good song, but you can hear her breathing  and *as a singer* you shouldnt hear it especially on a cd. Satisfaction is  certainly a different cover i don't mind it. Dear Diary was a good attempt  , but the lyrics are very childish(in my opinion). She doesn't have the  strongest voice eg. Christina, yet her voice isn't bad. This cd is good if  you like pop, or upbeat. Yet if you like ballads, this cd isnt for you.
B00003CWL5|5.0|I wondered why the words &quot;look closer&quot; appeared insmall type after the title American Beauty, then I watched themovie. If you view the world though rose tinted spectacles you probably wouldn't like this movie.  This is disconcerting view of the world - how things are when you look just a little closer. Dark humor, tumoil and never a dull moment. Annette Bening and Kevin Spacey are both brilliant, as always . . .<br />Next time you look in the mirror, look closer.
630018403X|5.0|Anyone who grew up in the 80's is bound to love this movie!  I can not watch it too many times, it's great! If you're looking for a great laugh, this is the movie!
6305807086|5.0|Definitely a strange idea - a portal into the mind of John Malkovich. An office with unusually low ceilings. This is the kind of thing that you don't get away with, unless you do it well. Fortunately for all it is done  well. Funny, oddball and entertaining. Charlie Sheen was an unnecessary  adjunct, but otherwise good.
6300214753|5.0|It doesn't matter how many times you watch this movie, you can't help but to laugh!  I have seen it more times that I can begin to count!  If ever you need a pick-me-up, or just something for fun, this is THE movie!  Also  if you love the city of Chigago, this has got some great scenery in it, and  makes me homesick for there!  This is one of Matthew Broderick's greatest.   Even if you are not a fan of his, this is the movie that will make you one!
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is a great album! It has great lyrics on all of the songs and you do not have to keep switching songs to get a good one.  If you like the Oops I did it again, you will love this cd, if you didn't, you should still try  it.  This girl is amazing and reall sweet, her album is awesome, all I have  to say... You Go Girl!
B00003CWPR|5.0|The title for my review might polarize fellow customers in this section of Amazon.com. No other film last year was more misunderstood than Eyes Wide Shut. <br />The arc of the story centers around Nicole Kidman's character  fantasizing internally -- lusting within her mind -- and Cruise's character  attempting to act out his own fantasies externally -- lusting for something  real on the streets of New York.<br />It is important to discuss the feeling  and texture of Eyes: Based on Austrian physician and author Arthur  Schitzler's (sp?) short-story, a colleague of Sigmund Freud, the film is  about dreams; waking and subconscious. The lighting; glow and shine, of the  extravagant party, for instance, at the beginning is luxurious: it is not  reality -- with harsh lighting -- but rather, of the mind: an escape.  <br />Notice the way characters will come on-screen (like the costume-shop  owner), interact with Tom Cruise's character, and exit. Why were they  there? What relevance do they have to the story? Stop asking these kinds of  questions. Remind yourself of what it is to dream: people, places, and  things come and go, without knowing why.<br />Much has been made of the orgy  scene. But the most important element from this area of the movie is when  the actors talk to each other from behind their masks. There is sound, and  there is voice, but we cannot see the movement of the face when speaking.  Easily one of the eeriest and most shockingly disturbing techniques used in  Eyes, this is an area where, once again, the feeling of dreaming is  represented well; this time, being detached from oneself, becomes the  overiding element. This is where we feel that, as in a dream, sometimes  events will occur without the power to stop them, until they are carried  out fully, and to the end.<br />Finally, it must be mentioned that the use of  sets to depict New York City, instead of filming on location in New York  City, was a brilliant move on the director's part. For this isa  dream-story, not reality, and anything that represents the latter must be  made to look the former: because dreams, in the end, are only  representations of what we perceive.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Well I must say that that this is a plesent suprise. I heard &quot;Bodyrock&quot; and thought moby was just another fatboy slim amintreem dancebeat techno artis. Well after hearing and seeing the  &quot;Natural blues&quot; I found he was more than that. Well its starts  with the gospel/hip-hop track &quot;honey&quot;. Well at first listen you  may not be empresed but it will grow on you. after &quot;find my baby&quot;  one of the best songs I heard in a long time comes on &quot;Porcelin&quot;  is amazing. So peaceful and relaxing. The &quot;why does it feel so  bad&quot; track follows, and is also a powerful song. &quot;Southside&quot;  is a cool song. You get &quot;rushing&quot; which is an istrumental. Then  the dacebeat &quot;Bodyrock&quot; comes on which is a very rare fast song  on this album. The next song is the amazing &quot;Natural blues&quot;  track. Nuff said. Well &quot;Machete&quot; is the fastest and most techno  song on the album. I wish there was more. After that, there is a buch of 40  sec songs and songs that he just talks. &quot;My sadness&quot; and  &quot;Gutair string and flute&quot; are great and there are a few other I  just wish he would take of some of the pontless tracks like &quot;7&quot;.  Well neverless this is a great album.<br />Standout tracks: porceline Why does  my heart feel so bad Honey Southside Natural blues Body rock Machete My  sadness
6305807043|1.0|Fargo was quirky, as was Raising Arizona, The Gods must be Crazy, Waiting for Guffman,,,etc.  This was the most dis-jointed film I have had to endure in a long time.  I like to watch films that have a somewhat plausible  relationship with reality.  I agree with the reviewers who compared it to  Alice in Wonderland.  Also, I couldn't get the humor about the secretary  who couldn't understand someone speaking, she was just irritating.  There  were a few humorous, original scenes but not gut wrenching.  I watched this  just like I did Chariots of Fire, hoping for it to get better and it never  did.  I'm glad I didn't buy it, just rented it.  I did hurry back with my  copy to get the $1 credit for early return.  I guess I'm from a different  era than the ones who loved it or I haven't done enough drugs.
B000002JS0|5.0|Hands down, this is the best rock and roll album of all time. This is pure, unadulterated rock as it was meant to be played. Check out the mini solo at the beginning of &quot;Rock n' Roll Singer&quot;. This is one of  Angus's finest licks. The first time I heard this album, I was blown away.  Thousands of plays later, I'm still blown away. Bon spouts clever toilet  poetry and Malcolm pounds out bone jarring riffs as is usually the case.  Put this album on at a party, and notice how many people come up to you and  say, &quot;What album is this? It rocks! I've never heard it before.&quot;  Most people have only heard Back In Black, and that's truly a shame.  Because AC/DC's finest work was done in the Bon Scott years. And this one's  the best. Get the Devil in your blood.
B000002ADT|5.0|There is little to add to what has been said, analyzed, proclaimed, etc etc about this music.  Timeless perhaps? Listening to this session is a relevation every time I hear it.  This is perhaps the truest definition of  modern jazz, and its influences are still heard in countless recordings  today.  Anything further on my part would be redundant.
B00004RF83|3.0|Maybe I'm just letting my own political bias color my judgment, but it seems to me that this movie has a bit of a pretentious edge that the novel had less of.   You can spot the moments right away where Rod Serling  decided to pontificate (President Lyman's rattling about the &quot;nuclear  age&quot;).   I think what amuses me the most though is what this movie  left out from the novel.   In the novel, President Lyman is forced to  confront the fact that the reason behind General Scott's plot, the fear of  the Soviets cheating on a disarmament treaty, is borne out completely.   In  the end, what makes Lyman's appeals to the rule of law powerful are when he  points out to Scott that he will end up reacting to this crisis no  differently than Scott would upon illegally siezing power.   And that is  the one thing that is sadly missing from this movie and it's absence hurts  the film completely from my standpoint.<br />On the plus side, Kirk Douglas is  outstanding as Jiggs Casey, whose character is improved from the novel, and  there are other fine performances too (Ava Gardner though looks haggard and  aged).  It's too bad though that Serling's desire for pontificating mars  the film from my standpoint.
B000002JS6|5.0|AC/DC, a great 70's and 80's metal or hard rock band. They have a number of mainstream hits and 2 of them are on this album, Back In Black, and You Shook Me All Night Long. Really great songs that you can groove to, if you  know what I'm saying. For more intense AC/DC fans you will love Hells  Bells, Shoot To Thrill, and Have A Drink On Me. For the true AC/DC lovers  this CD is your #1 pick I'm sure. This is definatly their greatest Album. I  give It 5 stars. This is stainboy signing off.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I love SEX AND THE CITY so much, I can't wait to have the DVD.  I believe that the comedy is funnier and more sophisticated than many of today's movies, so it is going to make for fantastic repeated viewings!  I could  watch the lives of Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda forever.  I hope  they release the second season, too!
B00004T8RK|1.0|How do I begin? First off, Pearl Jam is my favorite band and I love every one of their CD's...up until this one. Pearl Jam's last album &quot;Yield&quot; was arguably the best one they have made. I had such high  expectations for this album, but I bought it the first day it came  out...and I am so dissapointed. I just can't believe that this is the same  band that has just made the 5 best rock albums of the decade (Ten, Vs.,  Vitalogy, No Code, Yield)...it shocks me how fast a band really can go down  hill. Their is not even one notable good song on this album...it's all  easily forgettable. Their last two albums (No Code, Yield) were Pearl Jam's  best yet, and then they make this. I was so sure that they were just going  to keep getting better like they always have...but I was wrong. Pearl Jam  has always been my favorite band, and they still are, but this just proves  that their best days are behind them...although their best days were not so  long ago...
0679745203|5.0|Ondaatje's book is sheer poetry.  Though the prose tends to get heavy and super-serious, the way he fleshes out the characters is superb.  His scarce use of punctuation other than periods contributes to his highly personal  style of writing.  However, aside from Ondaatje's writing style, the plot  is the heart of the novel.  Some compare it to Anna Karenina, but it is a  completely different tale, not just a tale of an adulterous affair.  It is  a tale of love against all odds, the ultimate tale of chivalry and  sacrifice.  This novel testifies to the power that love can hold, and how  two people can shut out the world even if it's in the midst of the worst of  wars, become traitors even to the good, and see only each other.  It is a  tragedy, a love story, a shock, and a poem at the same time.  Unbelievable!
0783226063|1.0|Without a doubt one of the worst sci fi movies ever made. A horrible movie. An incomprehensible &quot;groaner&quot; to any who loved Herbert's Masterpiece.
0385484518|4.0|I give the book Tuesdays With Morrie four stars.  It was a very moving and compationate story.  Morrie and Mitch's converstaions were very interesting.  I loved Morrie's attitude.  He was never upset or depressed  about his condition.  He just lived live to the fullest and did not waste  one minute.  he was also a very smart man.  He had many theories that  people shoudl live by to have a better life.      I am interested in going  into the medical field.  As a medical professional, you have to deal with  dying patients and their families every day.  That is something I am going  to have to get used to doing.  The book Tuesdays With Morrie showed me how  it is going to be.  I believe there will be times where I might get  emotionally attached, which is not good.  This book opened my eyes to  death.  Everyone should read this book, especially if you are intersted in  going into the medical field.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Some of these reviewers make me laugh. Some people give her one star and say that all her songs are the same, that she can't sing, that she isn't good-looking, and that she can't dance. Well first of all, this album  rocks. She just has a lot of good catchy pop tunes and good material.  Nobidy can deny that this album has some really good material. Her voice  isn't as high and bouncy like some other divas, but that doesn't mean it  isn't good. She has an excellent lower voice, especially for someone who  has to dance like crazy and sing at the same time. And as for her not being  hot or being a bad dancer is just funny. Nobody can say that she isn't hot.  And se is an excellent dancer as we have seen. I guess some people are  intimidated by Britney's dancing skill and beauty, and get a little jealous  (even though they wouldn't admit it). So for all you Britney haters out  there, go listen to your music and don't waste your time bashing Britney. I  don't like country music, but I would never go and leave bad reviews for  country artists becuase I didn't like them! By hating Britney, you are  hurting yourself more than you are hurting her. She is a hot, talented  supestar and complaining won't change that!
B00004SCX6|3.0|Max Martin does need to broaden his palette; he seems to ape other songs and other styles a lot on the release. Take &quot;Don't Go Knockin' on My Door&quot;, for instance: a Pink &quot;There You Go&quot; knock-off, this  song would have the edge they are looking for if someone such as Pink, with  a voice, performed it. &quot;Stronger&quot; is a &quot;Larger than  Life&quot; knock-off. Only so much could be done though for someone such as  Britney with a limited range.
B00004SCX6|5.0|I really liked the first album, although it had one too many slow songs.  THe new album has one too many fast songs, but they're all great! I've actually had the privlege to listen to Britney's New album two weeks prior  to its release, and I really liked it.  Here is my song by song review, and  BTW, this album really deals with Brit's body image.    1.Oops I Did It  Again!: A good first single, but after listening to the whole album, it  just becomes another great track.    2.Stronger: This song sorta reminds me  of BSB's Larger Then Life, very loud, metal-sounding, and the middle part  where its all slow is like BSB. An okay song.    3.Don't Go Knockin' On My  Door: I really like this song, and Britney goes all r and b, which is sorta  cool.  It reminds me of Blaque or Destiny's Child in a way. The phone convo  is stupid though!    4.Satisfaction: Honestly, this isn't the best song. I  like the beginning, but the dance part is sorta cheesy.    5.Don't Let Me Be  The Last To Know: This is a nice slow song, and the strings at the  beginning sorta sound oriental, but the song is kinda  country-like.    6.What U See: This is another fave song of mine, and its  really cool just to listen to. Its a fast one again, but diff. from the  others. Its got a street feel, [think Monica's Street Symphony]    7.Lucky:  The BEST SONG on Britney's album is Lucky. I love that song soooo much, its  so catchy and good to listen to. I hope its a single, I've already thought  of the music vid!    8.One Kiss From You; This song is similar to first  album stuff, like \\"Thinkin' About You\\" and \\"I Will Be  There.\\" Its good if you like those songs.    9.Where Are You Now?:This  song is sorta boring, but if you listen to all of it, its sorta  nice.    10.Can't Make You Love Me: Lately I've fallen in love with this  song for some reason. Its the 2nd best in my mind, cuz it sorta reminds me  of Crazy, a good single with a dance bit in the middle.    11.When Your Eyes  Say It: At first I hated this song, cuz Britney talking is sorta creepy.  But the chorus and all that is really nice!    12.You can tell this was  written by Britney, cuz its very immature and weak. Better luck next  time.    So go out and buy the album, it rox!
B00003CWTH|5.0|This film is an absolute masterpiece. Every part of the film is  outstanding. I will never understand the acadamy for not nominating this  film in every category. It should have won the best directing for sure and  the most disappointing thing is that Tom Cruise didn't get the oscar. Ok  I'm not saying Michael Caine wasn't good, but there were several greater  this year. There could have been 5 actors nominated from only just this  film. So the acting was incredible. I can't say even one bad word about  this film. The songs were great and in order all the time. The editor was  great and the script was really well written. To be short I can say: GREAT,  GENIUS, THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!
0783225849|5.0|This is one of the best movies of all time.  It's just perfect.  There isn't a second in the movie that doesn't count, and move the story forward.  Everyone knows how good the movie itself is though, it is an essential  addition to any movie collection.<br />The DVD edition is just a great deal.   Universal gave this the treatment it deserves, with all sorts of extras,  including a great 1 hour documentary where major players recall the making  of the movie.  The only thing it is lacking is a commentary track, but this  came out before those were really popular.  Anyway, the DVD is definately  worth the money.  If you're thinking of upgrading from a VHS tape, this DVD  is worth it.
0060920386|5.0|I read this book several years ago after watching the movie based on the book. At that time, it was a hard book to find (This was before Amazon)but well worth the search. This book is rather complicated and at times the numerous characters are hard to keep separate. Actually, if you read it twice it is  much easlier to follow.    The book presents a detailed narrative of the  takeover fight between Ross Johnson, CEO of RJR Nabisco, and KKR, the firm  that perfected LBO's. The reasons, stupid mistakes and misconceptions made  by the combatants make the story interesting.      A casual reader might  watch the movie before reading this book to acquaint themselves with the  storyline and characters. However, you should be forewarned that James Garner portayal of  Ross Johnson paints a picture of a likeable person fighting the demons of Wall Street. The real Ross Johnson is more closely aligned with the demons.      The book does leave the reader wanting to know  what happened to Ross Johnson. It appears that Johnson basically retired from the business world. There is little information about him except one small reference to a business venture that failed. He did divorce  Lauri sometime in the 1990s. Kravis also was divorced from his wife in the book.      Burrough and Helyar wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal that attempted to tie up loose ends about the major characters and the eventual sale of RJ Reynolds by KKR. The surprising item in the article was the deal was the top of the mountain for KKR. After the completion of the deal, KKR started a slow downard slide because of infighting among partners, Kravis and his cousin had many partners, and other factors including the financial weight of the RJ Reynolds deal.
B000009ED0|3.0|I bought this CD because I was starting to get interested into 'rock'.  Since then, I have discovered so much more.  Kid Rock is not a band. He is a self obsessed poser.  But, The music is okay.  Get this CD if you like  the combo of rap/rock.  I personally don't.  If you're like me, stick to  real Hard Core rock like Metalica, or even go as far back as Guns 'N Roses,  or stick to Rap, like DMX, but, this is not a 'rock' album, so don't buy it  for that.  I wish that he would just pick an image for himself.   Kicker/rapper/rocker just don't work.  Well, now that I've put in my 2  cents, I think I'm going to go tell the world about what not to expect from  Limp Bizkit.
B000000H57|5.0|I listen to a broad variety of music, so when I heard &quot;My Girlfriend's Girlfriend&quot; on the radio one day, I decided to give Type O a shot, and what a wise decision that was! &quot;My Girlfriend's  Girlfriend&quot; is one of the fastest and hardest tracks on the album, so  I was surprised to hear how different some of the others were. Sometimes  you think you're listening to a classical arrangement with some gothic  guitarplaying going on. Other times it's more like chanting. Lead singer  Peter Steele must have one of the deepest voices in existence! Overall, the  album has one of the richest atmospheres I've ever heard.  Type O Negative  seems to appeal to some primal instinct deep within the human soul, some  ancient qualities long forgotten. Steele deals with the dark side of things  in his lyrics, but deep within I sense a celebration of love (although it  certainly is well hidden). Death and despair gets turned into art (or  functionless art that is nothing but tolerated vandalism according to the  band).<br />No matter what, this is a dark and beautiful masterpiece. Well  worth your materialistic means of payment. In other words: get the thing!
0440213525|4.0|The Client, by John Grisham is a good, very entertaining read. Grisham does a nice job of writing with the main character, an 11 year old boy named Mark Sway. Mark is very intelligent, yet at times he also shows his  youth.  Grisham does a good job of mixing Mark's youthness and older like  qualities, and doesn't rely on either too much. Reggie Love, Mark's lawyer,  is also a wonderful character, who you can really sink your teeth into  because of her troubled past and hopes for the future. The Mafia is  additionally displayed well. Some of Grisham's works are kind of  predictable, but to me, the Client really wasn't. Sure, Mark will probably  make it through all this madness, but the question asked till the end was,  HOW? I gave it 4 stars though because I did have a couple of minor  complaints. After the intial exciting chapter, the book to me dragged a bit  for a time, picking up solidly though shortly. I also felt the ending was a  little too subdued, and would have like to have known more (what happened  ultimately to all the characters involved). No, John Grisham's works are  not classic literature, and The Client certainly isn't an exception. Yet  for those of us who just enjoy a very entertaining, meaty, page turning,  excellent read, John Grisham knows how to push all the right buttons. And  with The Client, Grisham certainly does that.
B000002BFZ|5.0|As is the case with several of Pearl Jam's albums, \\"No Code\\" begins in a deceptively low-key way. \\"Sometimes\\" has a soothing, almost meditative quality that is downright atmospheric and lulling. It's a beautiful and unique way to begin the CD, and Eddie Vedder is in his usual reflective mood. Like a bullet from a gun, though, \\"Hail, Hail\\" shatters the calm with a blast of twin guitars, Jack Irons' dependable beats and Vedder's feisty but confused attitude. Thus starts a stormy mix of both laid-back and raging tunes from one of the best bands to emerge from the 1990s.<br /><br />\\"Who You Are\\" was released as the somewhat surprising first single off this album, and people's reactions to it at the time were mixed. Many appreciated the soft, tribal-like direction the band was steering toward, whereas others wanted the third sequel to [[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]] -- simply no changes in musical direction. But \\"No Code\\" is a much more complex, textured record than PJ's 1991 debut effort, and for that it is all the better. \\"In My Tree,\\" for instance, might be one of the best songs Pearl Jam has ever written. It begins somewhat ominously with Vedder's soft, almost cautious voice and Irons' equally quiet, careful percussion. The song evolves into a tuneful guitar masterpiece that boasts Vedder's best vocals (in all ranges) and a splendid bridge at one minute, 45 seconds that is an eclectic mix of shamelessly catchy guitar chords and what seems to be Vedder's moaning vocals played backward and interwoven for a double-tracked effect.<br /><br />Retaining one's innocence and joy of living are Vedder-penned themes on a few of these tunes, including \\"In My Tree.\\" \\"I'm Open\\" has a closed, quiet and dire sound to it, with Vedder relating his words in the form of a soliloquy, but the singer's message is actually heartening and positive in the end. As the title would suggest on the song \\"Present Tense,\\" the introspective, forward-thinking tune rebuffs life's regrets and embraces \\"this all encompassing trip\\" of life. As always, Vedder's lyrics are thoughtful and poetic on the song: \\"Do you see the way that tree bends/Does it inspire?/Leanin' down to catch the sun's rays/A lesson to be applied.\\"<br /><br />Elsewhere, the rockers on \\"No Code\\" sound as cool and fresh as anything PJ have ever done. \\"Habit\\" (a tune about the pitfalls of drug use) and \\"Lukin\\" (who knows what it's about) are blazing tracks that display the band rocking out with wild abandon and gusto. \\"Smile\\" is a hearty, down-to-earth stomper that clearly shows the fun Pearl Jam had collaborating with Neil Young on 1995's [[ASIN:B000002MZ9 Mirror Ball]]. And \\"Mankind,\\" written and sung by guitarist Stone Gossard, has been called \\"glam\\" by other pundits, but to me it's just a cool rocking Pearl Jam tune performed by another band member.<br /><br />Overall, \\"No Code\\" showed tremendous musical growth by Pearl Jam, a sign of things to come. Meanwhile, Vedder unabashedly did his own personal growing, writing some of the most memorable lyrics of his career. A brilliant mix of soft and hard sounds, \\"No Code\\" is an album for the ages.rip\\" of life.

0451169514|2.0|Stephen King now has so much power as a bestselling author that I guess no editor has the nerve to tell him that his stories would be much more effective is he just cut out, oh, say three hundred pages or so.  &quot;It&quot; isn't by far King's  only example of literary bloat, just  one of the more unfortunate.  His pure horror works have become  increasingly erratic over the years, though this was actually one of his  scarier concepts.  Unfortunately, it takes so long to get to the payoff  that by the time it comes you scarcely care.  King's biggest fear these  days seems to be the &quot;Horror of the Black Marker.&quot;
0425129586|5.0|This has to be one of the best book I've ever read. It was suspensful and scary, without using any stunts to try and frighten the reader. I was barely able to put it down. The ending's plot twist suprised me and left me  thinking afterwards. I highly recommend this book to anyone who craves a  good mystery novel. The only bad thing about this book is that it kept me  awake at night.
B00004SCX6|5.0|BRILLIANT ALBUM! This is even better than her first one. Ok, so some of the music sounds suspiciously similar, but after a while you notice each song is different. Here's what I think;<br />1' Oops' You know this one, so there's nothing I can really say 9/10<br />2.'Stronger' Brilliant tune, it  never fails to stick in my head. 10/10<br />3. 'Don't go knocking on my door'  Brilliant attitude song has a little r'n'b added to it. 9/10<br />4. '(I can't  get no) satisfaction' The one everyone's been talking about. No wonder, it  turns out to be one of the standout tracks 10/10<br />5. 'Don't let me be the  last to know' It's really good, but the chorus is the only part catchy  enough to stay in my head , better after you've heard it a few times  9/10<br />6.'What you see (Is what you get)' This is basically 'Oops' but with  different words. It is good  and the lyrics are quite different  8 and a  half/10<br />7. 'Lucky' This is one of my faves, it's quite a sad song if you  listen to the lyrics but the music is a typical, fun, upbeat Britney  song.10/10<br />8. 'One kiss from you' This is the only one I don't remember  easily, but I do recall it being cool at the time! 9/10<br />9.'Where are you  now' This is so good!   Her ballads have improved I have to say. This is  probably the best love song on the album 10/10<br />10. 'Can't make you love  me' This is cool, another 'Oops' soundalike,  9/10<br />11'When your eyes say  it' This is one of the songs which sounds a little different. The lyrics  are good but you would expect that from the writer. 9/10<br />12.' Girl in the  mirror' Sad, soppy love song ALERT!   A 10/10 It's a pity people don't get  it in America. The lyrics are the sort of thing you could probably relate  to being a teenage girl as is.......<br />13.'Dear Diary' Written by Britney! She  should do some more of her own songs, this sounds like she really means  what she's singing. I give her 10/10 for making such a good effort.<br />All  in all one of thebest albums around. If you like' Oops'  and her last  album then you won't skip any of the songs on here. If you don't then  perhaps wait for her to release a few more songs.
0790731479|5.0|Beetlejuice is the best movie ive ever seen because i love wierd movies like also:&quot;The Shining&quot;,&quot;Hellraiser&quot;,&quot;IT&quot;,and also &quot;House on Haunted Hill.But &quot;Beetlejuice&quot; is wierd and  hilarious and strange.I hope Tim Burton does not make a sequel because they  usually ruin the movie.If i ever see &quot;Edward Sizzor Hands&quot; I just  know it wont be better than this movie.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Great album.  Anybody who has doubted Pearl Jam since Vitalogy will have their faith restored.
B000002JSN|4.0|&quot;Physical Graffiti,&quot; is a two album set that would have benefitted being pared down into one.  The best songs on the record, such as &quot;Kashmir,&quot; &quot;Ten Years Gone,&quot; &quot;In the  Light&quot; and &quot;Sick Again&quot; would have combined to make an album  worthy of standing next to their best.  As it is they are the wheat  surrounded by the chaff of the weaker cuts that surround them.  In  retrospect, &quot;Physical Graffiti&quot; marks the beginning of the  decline of Led Zeppelin as a great band.  Still, there are enough great  songs to make it worthwhile.
0783240503|4.0|In the 1980's, our church school put together a production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and had a lot of fun doing it. The songs are easy for children to learn and the words tell the Bible  story. You could use the video as a teaching tool.<br />If you're watching the  video for entertainment and not over 40, you won't get some of the more  subtle original detail. For example, in the orginal, the Pharoh was dressed  like Elvis Pressly in his famous white bell-bottomed suit covered with  rhinestones--you know--the Pharoh as the &quot;King.&quot;  When I saw this  perfomed live in the 1970's the crowd went nuts when &quot;Elvis&quot;  sprang onto the stage. Of course, most of those present knew who Elvis was  and many had seen him perform live.<br />Donny Osmond has a nice voice, and  the back-up singers are great, but I found this version a bit of a letdown.
B00000IGGA|5.0|Chock another up for Tom. I was just listening to it this morning, and I gotta say, this ranks as one of his best! From the humor of 'Big in Japan', to the melodic stylings of 'Come on up to the House', it is perfect. This  ranks right up there with Heart of Saturday Night, and Rain Dogs
B000002GYI|4.0|This is my only Kraftwerk CD. I bought it only recently; I had NO interest in &quot;Krautrock&quot; when they were active. My motivation to buy this CD in particular was that I read where Neil Young was listening to it  around the time of recording &quot;Trans&quot;. Well, I can guarantee  that's not a lie because he has rewritten 'Computer World..2' as 'Computer  Age'! I can see a thread from 'Numbers' through Afrika Bambaata to Arthur  Baker's work with New Order on 'Confusion' and beyond into rap, hip hop and  other variants so it has convinced me that Kraftwerk have been VERY  influential. The copy I have is a recent UK EMI reissue and the sound is  great. There are no bonus tracks so it's quite short - but it's very, very  good!
0451191935|5.0|Richard Bachman was a much more concise writer than Stephen King, an that's a good thing.  The four &quot;Bachman Books&quot; read like the superb King novella collection &quot;Four Past Midnight.&quot;  &quot;The  Running Man,&quot; not to be confused with the campy over-the-top sci-fi  movie it became and which it bears little resemblance to, is chilling.  As  are the &quot;The Rage&quot; (precurser of Columbine High School?) and  &quot;The Long Walk,&quot; which is a King horror story at its most basic.  &quot;Roadwork,&quot; is not quite as good as the rest, but it is still  worth a read.  Overall, this is one of King's best collections of stories.  Thank you, Mr. Bachman.
B000001FY5|5.0|I've just been discovering the greatness of Marley over the past few months, and this CD is just the essence of what I like about Marley. Songs that deliver a powerful message, yet are uplifting at the same time. My  personal favorite is Natural Mystic-I'm suprised it isn't more acclaimed.  BUY THIS CD!
0553278223|5.0|I have read this book four times!  It seems to strike a chord in me. I don't know why.  Each chapter is like a slice of heaven. Bradbury just hits on every note of &quot;What Could Happen But You Were Afraid to Ask&quot;.  And he does this in the simplist way. No long ordeals of  &quot;tension&quot; and &quot;conflict&quot;. He just rips into your brain  with the ease of a good brain surgeon. How can I review this book without  giving anything away? Alright. I will try. The Martians at the funeral will  chill your bones. The astronauts finding their homes on earth after they  land on Mars will force you to be with them and share their elation. How  wonderful! Spender's compassion will make you question his solution. And  you will feel for him. The astronauts dealings with the Martian  psychiatrist will make you re-live all your experiences with doctors and  dentists. You will feel like them. The appeal of this book is rough to  figure out. I think it's because Bradbury gives us &quot;snapshots&quot; of  our own fears and desires in short and brief chapters that make us feel  untouched but shaken. He gets the needle into us deeply while seemingly  doing nothing in order to do so. In other words, he delightfully blows our  minds. Thank you.
6304005490|5.0|I adore this movie!  I love the chemistry between Rock Hudson and Doris Day.  It has wonderful comedic moments and I love the two old men that always seem to have a comment when Rock Hudson walks by.  It is too bad  that Hollywood does not make movies like this anymore.  If you are an  old-movie fan (like I am) then you will love this movie.
B000002G9S|5.0|Free's one true gem &quot;Fire and Water&quot; is also one of the best hard rock albums of the early 1970s, raking along with &quot;The James Gang Rides Again&quot; and Deep Purple's &quot;Machine Head.&quot;  And this is  not just because their biggest hit, &quot;All Right Now,&quot; appears on  the album.  The songs are uniformly excellent, though such cuts as  &quot;Mr. Big,&quot; &quot;Do You Remember,&quot; and &quot;Don't Say You  Love Me&quot; really stand out.  It is too bad that lead singer Paul  Rodgers's subsequent band, Bad Company, could never achieve this level of  mastery.
B000002JS6|5.0|This is the first AC/DC album I ever listend to and the same day I heard it, it became the best album I ever heard! If you don't buy this album you will not be proud of yourself because you will never hear another album as  great as this one. You could lose a lot of fiends if you don't get this  album so hurry and purchse it as quick as you can! I MEAN NOW!
1563894696|5.0|Great story!  Batman battles his usual nemesis along with a serial killer.  Awesome story that shows Batman at his Detective roots, Harvey Dent as an upcoming lawyer, Catwoman as a seductive temptress, and Comissioner(sp?)  Gordon as a Captain trying to save Gotham.  This isn't a boring suspense  type story either, there is plenty of action and a surprise at the end that  will leave your mouth wide open.
0800103661|4.0|I was expecting this film to be a traditional scifi movie: lots of action, and a shaky plot. But I was pleasantly suprised.  The description of the future in Gattaca is almost frightening, that &quot;perfect&quot; people  are the only ones that get ahead, and the rest of the population are  &quot;in-valids.&quot;  However, there were a few parts in the movie that  were a bit shaky, and didn't seem to make a lot of sense, but those moments  were rare.  The acting was very good; I think Ethan Hawke played his role  to near-perfection. One of the most stunning aspects of this film is not  the actors, but their surroundings. The sets in this film are stunning, and  really convey the &quot;dark&quot; mood of the film very well. (The  futuristic cars are also really cool.)  With its interesting plot, great  acting, and beautiful set, Gattaca is a must-see.
B000002J09|5.0|Let me begin by saying that &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is the most overplayed song in rock radio history.  With that out of my system, let me also say that Led Zeppelin's fourth album is a classic that contains no bad  songs and a lot of great ones.  From the rocking opening cut &quot;Black  Dog&quot; through the accoustic hippie musings of &quot;Going to  California&quot; through the closing blues epic &quot;When the Levee  Breaks,&quot; this is great rock'n'roll.  A triumphant album from a  legendary band.
B0000039LE|5.0|This is a true clasic. It was this film which set the table for all the great slasher-movies from the golden '80's. It was also the brekthrough for actor Jamie Lee Curtis and director John Carpenter. The movie starts with  Dr.Loomis (Donald Pleasance) who is going to his work-place on a mental  hospital. But when he gets there a man with the name of Michael Myers  escapes. Michael had killed his sister when he was 6 years old, and hav  been locked up since then. Now he goes hunting for his little sister  Laurie.  This movie is scary and at the same time entertaining. On the  older copies, the colors feel very blue, but if you buy the restored DVD  edition, it feels like the movie has been made all over again, and the  soundtrack is also remastered. ENJOY!
B00004SCX6|2.0|I thought this cd really stunk.  I used to be a fan but this cd changed my mind.  She's trying to be someone she's obviously not.  I dislike her voice, and the fact that she would rather reach the male audience than the  4 yr. olds who horribly, want to grow  up to be like her! I'm sorry, but  this cd really dissapointed me.
0553277472|1.0|It is with much trepidation that I disagree with the clear majority of readers and at the risk of being considered &quot;a cynical drapchode&quot; (expression in previous review), I think this was one bad book.  The book  has two three subplots: (1) the author and his son take a motorcycle trip  across America (2) the author inquires into the philosophical underpinnings  of Western civilization (3) the author goes totally insane his career as a  college professor goes into freefall and he must have his personality  expunged by court-ordered electroshock treatment. The book is chocked full  of whining narcissism and self-involvement.  We, the readers, have to be  subjected to the author's vendettas against faculty committees, rhapsodies  about screws and washers and how they relate to philosophy, and his cutting  remarks to and about his son whenever the poor child interrupts (as  children often do)his book-length loveletter to himself.    This book has  been published and republished to continual oohing and ahhing and acclaim  and it probably is the duty of every sentient human being to get a copy and  read it with an open mind.  That being said, I plowed through the second  half more from a sense of duty than from any enjoyment, and I really  couldn't care less whether the author lived or died.
B000002JSJ|2.0|Any of Led Zeppelin's albums recorded before &quot;Presence&quot; would be a better purchase than this one.  The problem isn't the band getting older, its in the songwriting, which is mediocre compared to the high standards  they had set for thelselves.  Only the great &quot;Nobody's Fault but  Mine,&quot; measures up to the early days.  Maybe Neil Young was right when  he sang that its better to burn out than to fade away.
B00000064E|2.0|I know this guy is supposed to be some kind of saint, but this CD left me cold. If Drake can't be bothered to show a little emotion on this, he shouldn't have bothered to record it.
0780020685|5.0|I love Akira Kurosawafs movies. Especially Seven Samurai, I donft know how much time I watched and enjoyed it. You may think it strange, but every time I found something new and energetic in this film. Although the story  of this is supposed to be in during 16 century in Japan, every characters  in this movie are not seemed to be fictional ones but absolutely close and  real to me. And I remember that one Japanese movie critic said all samurais  in it have nice faces. I think hefs right.<br />Compared with current  Japanese actors, actually they themselves donft look so nice.  But in this  Kurosawafs masterpiece they are really cool.  Those samurais are hired to  protect the villagers from the bandit, and only for eating enough rice-food  everyday, but in the fighting scene they seem to fight not for it but for  their dignity.  For example I feel no misery when seeing the death of  Kyuzo, the strongest samurai but finally killed by gun shooting during the  terrible fighting in heavy rain. He never stopped fighting even just after  being shot. I suppose he never had fought for rice but for his samurai  sprit. It was the most impressive for me.  I sometimes saw this actor,  Seiji Miyaguchi in some movie or drama, it was quite strange that he  didnft look so nice as he was in seven samurai. And as to the other  actors, same things were happened to me. That definitely depends on the  magic of Kurosawa  Every time when I finished watching this, I can get  something encouraging me as a male. Ifm not sure what it is, but that  might be the power of Kurosawa Ifm really happy to watch Seven Samurai as  a Japanese man and I believe Seven Samurai is the one of the most great  films in the world.
B00004T8RK|5.0|For the past week i've been wondering why I dont enjoy listening to this album when i like nearly every song on it? <br />Well, today i decided to put my cd player on random play and this is what it spewed out:<br />breakerfall -  gods dice - insignificance - sleight of hand - thin air - grievance -  evacuation - rival - light years - nothing as it seems - of the girl - soon  forget - parting ways<br />To my surprise it sounded perfect! The album really  seemed to flow perfectly and grievance and evacuation sound awesome back to  back. So my advice to any of you out there who are having the same problem  is to give this a try...it worked for me. If you are not having this  problem then completely ignore this review. thanks.
B000002JSR|2.0|So much for the notion that Led Zeppelin may have had a great repository of unreleased songs in their vaults.  Their best song not to make it to an album, &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do?&quot; is not even featured on this  collection.  The songs that appear on this disk are for the most part  forgettable.  They certainly do not live up to any notions of what classic  Led Zeppelin material ought to be.

B00003CWL5|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking!...The cinematography was beautiful.  Tells the story of a suburban neighborhood and the secrets, problems, and disfunctions behind closed doors.  Kevin Spacey is in his without a doubt  best performance.  Annette Bening who plays Spacey's Martha Stewart-like  wife is truly brilliant.  Mena Suvari plays the gorgeous teenage love  obsession of Spacey and she is without a doubt such a wonderful, beautiful,  talented, phemominal actress.  Thora Birch plays Bening and Spacey's  confused daughter and she shines in this film.  And Wes Bentley a shining  new star is great.  The movie was absolutely great!  It's a comedy that  makes you cry.

B000002J1U|3.0|In Between the classic albums &quot;Led Zeppelin II&quot; and &quot;Untitled,&quot; the band recorded an album of lesser songs that, while not bad, certainly don't measure up to their best.  Quieter and more  folkie that their first two albums, &quot;III&quot; does show a widening of  musical influences, which would become very important on their next album.   Overall, ardent fans will love this.  Casual fans should look elsewhere.

0684872153|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book because of all the hype and 5-stars from the other readers, but I did not get past the first 104 pages.  I knew I might not like it after the first chapter, but kept plugging away because  I thought &quot;it would get better.&quot;  Unfortunately, I could not take  it anymore and it will go on my graveyard book shelf. This author just  could not get past the father who drank to much and the mother not knowing  how to take care of her children to the extent that she did not know they  were sick.  It revolved around the younger children dying and the older  ones starving.  Eating milk, fried bread, water and sugar, and eggs and  hearing about a drunk father and mother unable to do anything while her  children died around her are the focuses of this book. It did not matter if  the location was Brooklyn or Ireland, it was still the same monotonous  plot. I'm sorry, but it is not very interesting to me.
B000002J0B|4.0|After their classic fourth album, anything Led Zeppelin did was going to seem anti-climatic.  What they did was come up with a decent set of songs that may not be as trescendent, but are fine judged on their own merit.  The best cuts are &quot;Over the Hills and Far Away,&quot; &quot;Dancing  Days,&quot; and the rocking closing track &quot;The Ocean.&quot;  Though it  is not their best, it is still a a strong collection of songs.
B00004STPT|5.0|This soundtrack is possibly the first to successfully meld the might and granduer of ancient Rome with the beauty of some of its less seen aspects.  The soundtrack has a mysterious quality about it that characterizes Roman  culture.  The musical selections and compositions reflect extremely well  the moods of the different scenes.  Each composition is rich with sound and  passion.  Each track uses suberbly scored instrumental music to evoke the  emotion for that scene.  The brass and percussion play well for the battle  and confrontational scenes and the strings, chorals and woodwinds provide  the perfect sound for the mysterious and emotional scenes.  All in all,  this is quite possibly the best soundtrack that I have ever heard.
B000002JSP|4.0|We will never know if Led Zeppelin might have made the transition from lumbering 70s dinosuars to hip 80s posters.  That they seemed to be trying on &quot;In Through the Out Door&quot; to keep up with musical trends was  an encouraging sign.  Unfortunately, drummer John Bonham's death ended the  discussion with a thud.  Upbeat pop songs like &quot;Fool in the Rain&quot;  and &quot;All My Love&quot; indicate that had they survived, Led Zeppelin  might have avoided obsolesence.  Overall, this uneven album is not a bad  swansong.
B000009QPG|4.0|This cd is cool for old skool metal fans but if you are into korn and limp i wouldnt recommend it, the guitar riffs rule, the guitar sound coulda been better, the lyrics are kinda silly, but its still really cool. i'de  recommend metallica's master of puppets or justice for all if you like this  and want some great REAL metal.
B00000JG41|5.0|Great music, traditional topics from Patton, everyone who claims to be fnm fan should listen to it. Theres rage, love, hate and humor. Great selection.
B00000JBCP|5.0|I heard this CD when I was wandering around Lima, Peru. Everytime I started to wander away from the shop, another track came on. I left with the CD, realizing I paid more than twice what Amazon charges, and believe  me, it was still worth it. This music is not icky-sweet, but it is  incredibly uplifting uplifting in a funky way. I listen to it on my  peaceful Sunday mornings when the weariness of the week is finally  slippping from my shoulders, and it just lifts my heart with the passion  and longing and harmonies and wonderful unusual beats. Now all my friends  take turns borrowing it :-) (we don't find copies easily in Stockholm,  Sweden :-)
B00004SCX6|5.0|This is the best cd ive ever gotten. My Homey Hot Girl and I got it together over at target. We love this cd. The best tracks are 1,3,5,7, and 12. Well thats what we think. This cd is worth buying. I wish it had her  music video on it like Baby One More Time... but it doesnt. Besides that  its the best ever!
079073804X|5.0|When I got my first SAG card I was in a film with Linda Blair. I wanted to watch &quot;The Exorcist&quot; for content and by a wonderful accident I got the the wrong movie.<br />George C. Scott (God rest his soul) Is  outstanding in this film.<br />This film is directed, Acted, and Shot in a  manor film directors should take a lesson from.<br />The film is weird as the  subject dictates but at no time did I find myself looking at my  watch.<br />The special effects are great and the photography is super.<br />If  you are on the fence BUY THIS FILM it is a masterpiece.
B000002JNJ|4.0|Cowboys from Hell introduced Pantera to metal fans everywhere. It is, without question, an excellent album. However, it is not as strong as any of the albums that came after it. Heres why: 1) Phil's vocals often decline  into that 'screeching', reminiscent of Metallica's 'Kill Em All'. 2) While  the songs are fast and heavy, they lack the raw power of the later albums.  Again I compare this to Kill Em All vs Master of Puppets or Justice. 3) The  songs just don't stick in my head like the ones off Vulgar Display of Power  or Great Southern Trendkill. Overall, this is definitely a worthwhile  purchase, but if this will be your first Pantera purchase I recommend  getting Vulgar Display of Power first. Though really, you should just get  them all!
B00000J6AG|5.0|This album was much more than I expected.  I had only known the song Natural Blues and decided to go ahead and buy the CD.  I love it because each song is different and the first time I listened to it, I had no idea  what each song was going to be like.  The songs are deep yet easy to relate  to.  I definitely recommend this album to anyone.  It's for people of all  tastes.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I had the opportunity to hear this record back in March when I visited Los Angeles.   At that time, the master tapes were being flown to Atlanta so Brendan O'brien could mix the up-beat tunes (I guess Tchad feels fast songs  are not his strong suit). I was kind of disappointed to see they kept only  five of his original mixes.  I personally love Tchad's mixing style and  think they're much more unique.  &quot;Rival&quot; is my favorite (that's  Blake's dog). Overall, It's a great rock album.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Is it just me, or are all the songs the same with different lyrics? Don't even get me started with the Satisfaction song, a disgrace to say the least. More mature? not as much as we had imagined. I will admit the Oops I  did it again song is a rather catchy, but thats the only song really worth  commending, go find the mp3. At least there is Aguilera, who can actually  carry a note. But hey, as long as Spears has her image, she'll sell  records, unfortunatly.
0312958455|5.0|Could easily be considered the best of Michael Connelly's novels.  Loved this story, and Harry Bosch's character is masterfully done.  If you love hard-boiled detective, you'll love this one. Heartily recommend it.
6305750750|5.0|Regardless of what some might say, this movie is one of the best Star Wars ever, and is definetly worthly of being part of the saga. The computer animation was absolutly mind boggling. As I watched the movie I kept  thinking, how did they do all of this. The Podrace scene inparticular, is  just awesome. I could watch that a hundred times and still not get bored of  it. I just wish that this would get released on DVD. I don't know why Lucas  has such a problem with DVD.
0441172717|5.0|I was fascinated with the world Frank Herbert created.  I was also fascinated with the characters and plot of a Sci-Fi classic.
6305594252|5.0|Stargate has been one of my favorites since it first came out in theatres, so I was drawn to this special edition. The extra nine minutes don't really add a lot to the film. If anything it just explains a few scenes a bit  better. There aren't a whole lot of extra features, at least, not what you  would expect from a &quot;Special Edition&quot;. Regardless, I still think  the movie is very good.<br />What I think I like most about Stargate is how it  brings a sci-fi twist to how the pyramids came to be. The movie gives an  intriguing answer, but you will have to see the movie to find that out.
B00004SCX6|2.0|I bought this CD in spite of the fact that I don't really like the title track because I liked the first CD and thought that maybe there would be songs on this album that are better that it.  That was a huge waste of  money.  All of the up-beat songs sound exactly like it. Most of the slow  songs are boring and monotonous.  Even though &quot;Where You Are Now&quot;  is a beautiful song that does not make the album worth buying, but it is  the reason I gave this CD 2 stars instead of one.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Her cd is amazing. Some of the songs are really poor, but the majority of the songs are respectable. One song that is one of my favorites is What you see (is what you get). Its mad good.
0553108034|5.0|Well, better than wonderful.  Just what fantasy and S&amp;S addicts long for when you first begin a series -- a great first book, a better second book and the promise of a third.  My only reservation in recommending this  book would be its graphic sexual and violent content -- the battles are  better than DUNE and the sex is distinctly hard edged.  So okay... don't  let your 8th grader read it.<br />The family saga is beautifully written and  clearly told -- like Richard Adams, Martin's prose makes a movie in the  mind of the reader.  His pace never lags.<br />Highly recommended.
B00004SCX6|5.0|this CD is shallow on the top, but once you actually listen to it closely about 5 times, it 's rather rewarding, she recently said in one of her interviews that this CD has a lot of &quot;her&quot; in it, i think it's  true, she is developping her own style, and start to write her own songs.  first, the CD maybe offensive, and may not be approriate for young girls,  but this puppy love is relly not bad.
6305892946|4.0|At last, the final act and hopefully there will be no more after this as I feel the 'Scream' films have had their good run. Not as good as the first two but definately worth watching if you liked the other films. This one  seemed a lot darker and more sinister, and yes funnier than the others. The  beginning scenes are tense but the ending seems a little bit of a let-down  because you expected more. Never the less, a good alltogether ending to one  of the greatest slasher series of all time.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Concerning their last effort &quot;Yield&quot; I heard one critic say that every note that was played on that album was for a purpose.  The same goes for &quot;Binaural&quot; except more so. Every aspect of the album  musically is awesome. I have hardly taken the cassette out of my player  since I bought it, and it improves with each lisen. (Which to me is the  true test of greatness) I was a big Pearl Jam fan when they first hit the  scene several years ago because they rocked.  I am a Pearl Jam fan now, not  only because they still rock, but because of their amazing ability to  diversify and write creatively.  Binaural is my favorite Pearl Jam album  yet.  From the first cut to the last it is lyrically and musically  incredible.  Pearl Jam is a band that I look forward to hearing a new CD  from every two to three years and Binaural does not dissapoint.  Buy it  ASAP! and enjoy.
6302250269|5.0|This is an instant classic. Controversial and creating two instant female American icons. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are nothing short than perfect as Thelma &amp; Louise, both creating equally likable and complex  characters. Considered to be a female buddy road-trip movie, but this film  is much, much more, mainly because of the excellent multi-layered  screenplay. Ridley Scott directed an instant American classic. Some scenes  are now considered classics, such as the ending. The 'male' part of the  cast are all excellent, Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen are great. Brad  Pitt is also a stand-out in the role that shot him into stardom. Extremely  entertaining and even poignant near the end. This one is in a category all  of it's own. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!
6305537798|5.0|This movie truly makes you feel that there is that one person out there for you. The amazing story really makes you smile...and you seem to yearn for a relationship like the one shared between julia stiles and heath  ledger.  The deciet always ends with the girl gettin her wonderful guy, and  in the end all seems good.  One can only wish that life was like it is in  the movies.  I think anyway who loves a hopeless romance movie  should buy  this one.  I assure you, you will love it just as i did.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Formulaic? Sure. Pop fluff? Maybe so. Fake chest? Possibly. But this album is consistent, entertaining , and chock full of songs with hooks so frickin' huge they'd nab the cast of Deep Blue Sea AND the fake alligator  from Lake Placid.<br />Is it all because of Britney? Um, I'm gonna say no  here. She's a decent crooner, a fine dancer, and has &quot;That Look&quot;  that's easily packaged and presented by the top songwriting/production  talent the industry can offer (Dianne Warren, Mutt Lange, etc). And that  kind of supporting firepower could turn the &quot;Where's the Beef!&quot;  lady into a pop diva... <br />That said, though, this album is entertaining.  And that's really what it's all about, right? C'mon! Even Moby confessed he  had a weakness for the SpiceGirls! And Britney's latest is INFINITELY more  fun than any of their schlock, as well as trumping NSync and Hanson's  latest insipid attempts. She has no pretenses to &quot;push the  envelope&quot;, or &quot;move in new directions&quot;, and that's just  fine.<br />Highlights: Lucky, Where Are You Now, and yes, this version of  Satisfaction is actually decent. The whole &quot;talking&quot; issue is a  blatant attempt to copy Ms. Jackson, but Britney's just not Nasty enough to  pull it off. Plus, her script writer should be fired for thinking a Titanic  reference would &quot;fit nicely&quot; within the title track. Blech!<br />So  yeah, she's done it again, but there's not a lot of \\"oops\\" to this.   Britney and her handlers stuck to the formula, and it succeeds wonderfully,  making  a great addition to your summer mix.
B000001FZK|5.0|I got this album a year ago. Somehow, listening to this CD can feel like I've just bought it. The songs themselves seem to have something &quot;hidden&quot; that you think you'll pick up if you look for it. But  there is always something more hidden...like, for example,  &quot;Taphead.&quot; The song starts out simple with a bass and a guitar  riff and eventually muted trumpets and violins come in. Then, a loud,  unexpected outburst of trumpets &amp; violins, etc. happen. Was that  expected from the beginning of the song? Who knows...the point is  &quot;little treasures&quot; like that are waiting with Talk Talk's  &quot;Laughing Stock.&quot;
B000002JNN|5.0|Wow, this was an awesome album.  Probably the most inventive guitar-work since Brian came over in 1980.  You see, this album was significant in that it marks the last time that Brian was able to make a halfway-decent scream.   &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; is such a great song, I DARE somebody to find a  song that kicks ass any better!  &quot;Fire your guns&quot; is faster  paced, just another way of saying...&quot;this is how hard you're gonna get  it!&quot;  &quot;Moneytalks&quot; is a more traditional, old-school AC/DC  track, while &quot;The Razor's Edge&quot; surprisingly doesn't talk at all  about sex!  &quot;If you Dare&quot; starts off simply enough, then hits you  right between the eyes!  &quot;Shot of Love&quot; is another good track,  with the background vocals taking more of a role.  &quot;If you dare&quot;  was a fantastic closer to this memorable album.  Some have criticized this  album, as falling into that &quot;stupid lyric&quot; category.  But,  anybody who reads into AC/DC for their lyrics has something seriously wrong  with them.  The good tracks I listed more than make up for the four that  really aren't as strong.  Thumbs up!
B00000255F|5.0|Born to Run is possibly the most captivating album EVER written. Every time I listen to it, I can't help but be pulled into Bruce's narratives. I can't imagine rock songs that are more thrilling than Born to Run, Thunder  Road, Jungleland, or any of the tracks. If you like music with passion,  excitement and soul, look no further.
B000002L1L|3.0|I think some people were a little harsh when reviewing this album.  The title track itself is the heaviest I've ever heard Deep Purple, it's has such great guitar-work especially around 3:30 when you hear the  &quot;dueling&quot; guitars!  &quot;Anya&quot; has a great acoustic opener,  then kicks into some fancy vocal and guitar.  &quot;Ramshackle Man&quot; is  a great blues-sounding track, while &quot;Solitaire&quot; has some very  haunting lyrics.  &quot;One Man's Meat,&quot; is a great song, even through  the stupid lyrics.  I'm not going to say that this was the best Deep Purple  album, because it really wasn't.  &quot;Lick it Up&quot; is such a trash  song, &quot;Time to Kill&quot; has an awful chorus.  The songs that I spoke  of kindly really more than make up for the other trash on here.  The title  track and &quot;Anya&quot; are really worth the money.  Give it a try.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Binaural is a very polished No Code. This album is what No Code should've been. Very consistent and precise. There is a raw, but clear and amazing sound. The album has two sides, the low-key spiritual songs and the heavy  hitting quicks songs. The latter include &quot;Rival&quot;,  &quot;Greivence&quot;, &quot;Gods Dice&quot;, &quot;Insignificance&quot;,  &quot;Evacuation&quot;, and &quot;Breakerfall&quot;. The more spiritual  songs like &quot;Thin Air&quot;(best song on the album), &quot;Parting  Ways&quot;, &quot;Of the Girl&quot;, &quot;Nothing as it Seems&quot; are  truly innovative. You will get the maximum listening experience from this  album through headphones. Binaural is raw, edgy, creative, and  groundbreaking.
B000002UEB|3.0|I know a lot of the diehard Q-ryche fans consider this their magnum opus, but &quot;Promised Land&quot; is clearly superior. As for this cd, it is a good cd, but the overall sound is still a littl too raw for me and the  story is totally ridiculous. If you look at some of the all-time great  concept albums, they all have stories that are, for the most part,  believable. This story is not. The shots at the government are clever, but  the whole Nikki/Mary/Priest thing is weak. Touching on the music, the  standout tracks are &quot;Suite Sister Mary&quot;, &quot;The Mission&quot;,  &quot;Eyes Of A Stranger&quot; and &quot;Speak.&quot; As usual with most  concept albums, there are several very short useless songs, but they fit in  nonetheless. Like I said, &quot;Promised Land&quot; is their best cd, in  sound, structure and music, but &quot;Mindcrime&quot; probably ranks  alongside &quot;Empire.&quot;
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam have changed considerably since 1991's debut &quot;Ten&quot;, and this excellent collection of songs mirror a band clearly more at ease with life than they were in the early 90s. Lead single &quot;Nothing as it  Seems&quot; makes up for it's lack of bite with the exploration of  soundscapes born in the Mid West, while &quot;Light Years&quot; and  &quot;Thin Air&quot; show a subtlety in the band's personality that went  previously unexplored. My only gripes are with the absence of a real  grabber like &quot;Jeremy&quot; or &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;, and the  trowaway nature of &quot;Grievance&quot;, but, hell, I'm only nitpicking.  Lovely.
B000001ZS4|5.0|Whereas most people cite Oxygene as Jarre's best or best-known album that transformed electronic music, Equinoxe is the TRUE masterpiece. It has a distinctly ambient, etheral, watery quality to it.<br />Parts 6 and 7 are  forerunners of modern trance music whereas parts 1, 2, and 3 are extremely  ambient and gooey. Parts 4 and 5 are the best known and typical Jarre  anthems. If you buy one Jarre album it should be this! Sound quality is  also top notch.
B000002N3N|5.0|Released five years after 'Shepherd Moons', during which 'The Celts' had been re-released, 'The Memory of Trees' was much-anticipated by fans of Enya, and turned out to be only slightly less impressive than the previous  two albums.<br />The Christmassy lead single, 'Anywhere Is', set the tone  excellently - an extremely simple and addictive tune, repeated constantly,  it was fun, and not at all serious. The rest of the album seemed a  reflection of this, and as with 'Watermark' it was a generally cheery  collection. Still, despite an excellent set of opening songs, the album  seemed to bog down into too many ballads towards the end ('La Sonadora',  although introducing Spanish to Enya's vocabulary, went on and on and on),  despite the presence of the rousing 'On my way home' as a closing song. The  title track seemed uncomfortably close to being a cliche, too.<br />Despite  all that, it was business as before - the production seemed more earthy and  less ethereal, and 'On my way home' was the closest thing to a mainstream  single Enya has ever done.
6305513406|4.0|This DVD presents the second pilot from the show and the classic &quot;Corbornite Maneuver&quot; on one disc. The important aspect of this release (and presumably other releases) is that the picture quality is  truely excellent considering these were recorded in 1966.<br />Sound quality  is also clear and crisp for the time with the main title music sounding  very bouncy!<br />The only gripe to throw at these releases is that there  should really be 3 or 4 episodes per disc. One wonders how long paramount  can sustain these releases if there are 178 TNG, DS9 and Voyager episodes  to release too!
B000002J1Y|5.0|This was always my favorite Yes album until &quot;Talk&quot; came along! Now I have to say that is the best Live Yes album. The volume of great songs contained on this set is not the only thing that is staggering here  ... the performance is simply inspired. This brings me to the reason I  bought Yesongs on CD ... One day while listening to a compilation of studio  tracks, up came Starship Trooper ... but it seemed so bland next to the  recording I remembered from Yesongs ... so I got on line and bought it!  Great Album!
B000001ZSF|5.0|Chronologie is a varied eight part album written in 1993 around the theme of time. Chronologie part one is essentially a piece of classical music performed on synths with typical Jarresque choir.<br />Part three is an  interesting blend of opera and hard rock. Part 4 is the most well known: an  energectic and memorable piece. Part 5 is a going nowhere piece and a  failed attempt at techno. Part 6 is good, part 7 is too slow and part 8 is  a small departure for Jarre along the lines of 'Bomb the Bass'!<br />The album  was released at the same time as Jarre started experimenting with dance and  remixes and as a result shows some weak attempts at techno but the results  are enjoyable nonetheless. Some of the transition pieces between tracks  (e.g 2 and 3) are genius!<br />The 24bit remaster of this album improves the  sound quality a great deal. This is a core Jarre album.
B000000Y2R|5.0|I Got tons of stuff on Bird,Mingus,a few on Powell&amp;Roach&amp;a few on Dizzy.but having all of that Genius on Set makes up big time.The Music&amp;Arrangements are Incredible.Bird changed the Game Forever.He is  One Of Jazz's Greatest Pioneers.DIzzy blows The Mind with His Tone.Miles  Davis always gave him Mad Props.Roach is one of the Greatest Drummers ever  in any Style of Music.Powell Rings up Keys&amp;has been featured on Many  Important Recordings.Mingus who I got turned onto a Couple Years back is  Amazing.Simply put.His Tones&amp;Drives are Gold too the Ears.Very  Essential.
B000001ZSE|4.0|Images is a good place to start and also contains a few tracks which can only be obtained on this release: Eldorado, Moon Machine and Globetrotter.<br />The sound quality (24-bit) is incredibly clear and punchy,  but there are too many tracks and not enough of them are remixed. Some that  are remixed (by Jarre) such as Orient Express are quite poor whereas others  such as Rendezvous 2 and Equinoxe 4 are superb. <br />There are some odd  choices of bonus tracks on this release such as &quot;Blah Blah Cafe&quot;  which don't do Jarre any favours. A good compilation album but not the best  example of his music. It's been 10 years since Images and a new compilation  album would be welcome.
B00004T8RK|2.0|I Used to think that Pearl Jam would Come Out&amp;Change their Music especially after Kurt Cobain Dissed them&amp;Especially after Stone Temple Pilot made a Career Emulating them? well I was Wrong.The Lyrics&amp;Music  are as Predictable Now as they were 8 years back.Pearl Jam is Very  Corperate they are on the same Label as The KING OF POP MICHAEL  JACKSON,SADE,Celine Dion,etc... their Music&amp;Image is very  Manufactured.They Need too Either Break Up or do something Completely  Different they are Long Overdue.Having Listened too many of their Albums  I've Never Gotten what the Hype was about.
B00004SCS1|5.0|I first heard these guys on the radio and thought it was yet another slayer-like band with no talent.  But my friend got the cd and I was pleasently surpised when I heard it!  I'ts full of really good (although a  little wierd) songs.  I found out later though that Rick Rubin produced it.   And that makes sense, because every album he's produced is awesome.
B00004SCX6|1.0|Why? Why are we subjected to this again?  Didn't Ms. Spears do enough damage last time around? This album is a complete and utter waste of money. Ms. Britney cannot sing -- her vocals are atrocious and ear-splitting. And why oh why did she cover the Rolling Stones' &quot;Satisfaction&quot;? If  you can't do a song better than the orginial artist, don't cover it at all  and she certainly did not do that song justice. This cd is sure to sell,  but please people...
B000005J56|5.0|I was introduced to Buenavista Social Club through the documentary film of the same name that I watched two months ago. I was so impressed with the movie that I immediately scoured the internet for more information about  the group. I had my copy of the Buenavista Social Club album two weeks ago  and until now I could not still believe that it took us so long to discover  the music of these fine musicians. Anyway, they're here and let us enjoy  their music. I am a Filipino and my exposure to Latin music is very limited  but the songs in this album are very intimate and they seem to communicate  with you in entirely different level. This album is a stark reminder to all  of us that good music knows no boundary and that real talent will always  find its way to our hearts. Cheers. Let's keep the music playing.
B00004SCX6|5.0|WAUUUUUUUUUU!  Wath a CD!  Wath a girl!  well, in this CD her music have evoluted, it sound more tecno more bizarre but well, it's still Britney's style... Well, If U R Britney fan, buy it, I don't know if this  one is best than the first, but the sound evolution is... WOW! And the  booklet have britney's best photos, yeah if U R boy like me, prepare your  self fot the impact... songs are great, her voice is fantastic, well U  know, a Britney CD. ah... my favorite song is track n 2 Buy it :)
B00004SCX6|4.0|Ok, Im a very big Britney Spears fan.  People think she is cheesy, well so what shes making money and shes not putting out vulgar songs.  This album is very good, much much better than the first.  I love STRONGER because I  can totally relate to it and I can hear Britney crying out in the song.   She is progressing at about the right speed I think. Some I think have  expected too much out of her.  If she changed her style all together, we'd  freak out.  Its like sticking a frog in hot water, it jumps out.  However,  if you put it in cold water and gradually warm the water up, it will stay  there.  My only complaints are that she needs to sing out more and don't  hold back as much.  Shes got a wonderful voice, Britney let us hear it.   And second, Max Martin needs a new sound module.  Some songs were good  tracks, but Oops and What you see sound alot alike, very much like Baby One  More Time.  Next time take a step higher, but hey good step up and take it  too the bank.  Britney Rulz!
B00004RFFL|1.0|I was expecting a lot from this movie - great plot, great cast.  Instead - yawn.  I was very disappointed - felt like the movie kept building but never really went anywhere.  It could have been so much better if they'd  actually built the suspense, and if the actors had seemed to truly care.  What a waste.
6305807086|5.0|Wow.  Thats all you can say after seeing this movie.  With all the horrible movies out there, you begin to wonder if there are any good movies left.  Well, here's one.<br />Being John Malkovich has got to be one of the  most intriguing movies I've ever seen.  John Cusack plays a pathetic waste  of human life named Craig.  He becomes obsessed with a girl who works with  him (Catherine Keener) in one fo the craziest places around.  The find a  portal to travel &quot;inside&quot; John Malkovich.  Eventually, John  himself finds out setting up a hilarious 'Malkovich scene'.  It follows the  lives of Craig, his wife (Cameron Diaz), and Maxine, the girl Craig is  obsessed with as they travel through Malkovich's life.<br />Man, I can't say  enough about this one.  You have to see it.  One of the top three of 1999.
0316777722|5.0|I always look forward to spending time inside the mind of David Sedaris.  I don't know how many times I have read Naked and Barrel Fever ( if you haven't read either get thee to thy shopping cart! ) He doesn't disappoint  this go around either. Marvelously twisted and dead on.  From being tagged  a &quot;future homosexual&quot; to foul mouthed siblings, you will laugh  out loud and then read out loud to anyone within earshot.  If you've ever  watched his equally wicked sister Amy's show on Comedy Central, the equally  perverse,twisted, and hilarious &quot;Strangers with Candy&quot;, you will  wonder what went on in that house? And wish you had been part of it.  If I  could invite three men to drinks it would be Bob Smith, Dan Savage and  David Sedaris.
B00003CWQ2|5.0|How did this movie not even get NOMINATED for any awards besides MTV's best fight?  Come on, this was better then any movie made in 1999, except American Beauty.  Brad Pitt was amazing.  His work as Tyler just kept me  interested in what he was doing throughout the whole movie.  Edward Norton  also kept me laughing as eveything he did seemed to be so heart-breaking  and funny at the same time.<br />Fight Club was one of the best movies I have  ever rented and once this thing stops costing 106 dollars, I WILL buy it.
0767849493|2.0|I'm a Kevin Smith fan, and I was looking forward to watching &quot;Dogma&quot; since I had missed it in the theatres.  Overall, I feel it was a bit of a mess.  I couldn't care less about the religious aspect of  the film.  That didn't interest me at all.  What really interested me was  to see whether Kevin was evolving as a film maker.  There is no question he  is talented.  But in &quot;Dogma,&quot; he can't quite find the right  rhythm to make it a good film.<br />The whole thing just seemed too ambitious  for its own good.  Way too much dialogue.  Too many scenes that served no  purpose.  Cute performances but nothing that stood out.  A mish-mash of a  plot.  A very cliched ending (that whole guy in the hospital bed thing was  ridiculous).  And dare I say Jay and Silent Bob are growing a bit...stale?  They are great characters but their act is wearing thin.<br />Apart from a few  great scenes, like the board room scene where the angels reveal the hidden  secrets of the assembled executives, there wasn't much here to recommend.  Neither insightful nor exceptionally funny, &quot;Dogma&quot; is a step  back from the far superior &quot;Chasing Amy.&quot;  It's mildly  diverting...and nothing more.<br />For a truly brilliant religious satire,  rent &quot;Life of Brian.&quot;  It blows &quot;Dogma&quot; away in every  respect.
0380788624|1.0|Riding on the wave of Stephenson's awe-inspiring sci-fi powerhouse Snow Crash, I immedietely jumped into this book with the same enthusiasm as other great followers to the tune of Ringworld Engineers (Niven), Ender's  Shadow (Card) and The Return of the King (Tolkein).<br />Does anyone have any  water?  Can someone please put this fire out?<br />I was surprised it was such  an upset because I remember one of my friends telling me that he liked it  so much, he read it in 3 days.  It took me 3 months!  Stephenson goes  absolutely nowhere in developing his plot for the length of the entire book  (&gt;900 pages!).<br />Our protagonist, Randy Waterhouse, is nothing but a  wimpy computer geek that can't make up his own mind and relies on his boss  to think for him.  His grandfather, in a separate storyline, is likewise a  mathematical wimp/genius whose experiences regulary gave me a swift night's  sleep.  Then there's Bobby Shaftoe, in yet a third storyline, who was  probably the reason that I had the nerve to finish the book.<br />Reading  Shaftoe's experience as a soldier in WWII was by far the best part of this  novel.  His relationship with Goto Dengo, secret missions and climatic end  retained just enough entertainment value to get me to page 913.  If it  weren't for him, this would be the second book I would have ever put down  in disgust (the first was the Legacy of Heorot).<br />Of course, then there's  the fact that Stephenson doesn't know how to end a book.  When there are  separate storylines, you generally expect the author to tie them together  at some point.  Although I'll admit the storylines had vague relationships,  none of them were direct enough.<br />When this book ended, I threw it  across the room in complete disgust.  I'm only glad I read it so that I can  warn readers like yourself before you consider investing the time necessary  to finish this disaster of a novel.  What a waste of time...<br />rating: 1  star
B00000I9MK|5.0|It's difficult to say which is the best B+S album. Of the three this is possibly the most charming. These are all simply beautiful songs, which in all honesty don't sound that much like Nick Drake, the Smiths or whoever.  And despite contrary opinion, 'Electronic Rennaisance' is moody and  fantastic (and is blatantly NOT written by Stuart David- someone wrote that  in a review). 'The State I Am In', 'My Wandering Days Are Over'and 'Mary  Jo' are my favourites, but with B+S everyone likes different ones. There is  no-one quite like this band, who approach songwriting and recording so  simply, melodically and (I'm going to have to use it again) beautifully.  It's brilliant when you're being kept awake by Slipknot fans in your Halls  of Residence to crank up 'Mary Jo' back at them, complete with flute solo.
0375501851|4.0|Ms. Smith is a very good writer--ballsy, clever, fascinated with the meaning of words. The real achievement of the book though is that she has written a book that takes London's multicultural personality as a premise  instead of subject, with the result that novel reaches beyond the  boundaries established for writers of color. <br />Chatty though the novel may  be, it still has a lot to say, and it does so with grace and a hipster kind  of eloquence.<br />There are details of Jamaica life and culture that miss the  mark. But that is to be forgiven. <br />Zaidie Smith can write nuh rass

B0000041DZ|5.0|Esta gran realizacin pianistica, ES UNA MAS de las tantas obras en que Alfred Brendel deja de manifiesto que existe el verdadero equilibrio entre la perfeccin y la sensibilidad iterpretativa. Al analizar tcnicamente  cada una de las Sonatas, se aprecia la maravilla de sus Apoyaturas,  Tiempos, Ritenutos, Fortes, Piannisimos, y otros componentes propios de la  estructura musical, que  hacen concluir, SIN LUGAR A DUDA, que Alfred  Brendel INTERNALIZA Y COMPRENDE a Ludwing Van Beethoven en su grado ms  profundo, tanto en su Humanidad, como en el verdadero objetivo de dejar un  Legado a las generaciones venideras. Se logra finalmente una verdadera  interpretacin que cumple fielmente con el concepto: &quot;audicionar a  Ludwing Van Beethoven a travs de Alfred Brendel&quot;
0790736918|4.0|The Searchers is probably one of the most analyzed Westerns ever made, so I'm not going to attempt to look at its deeper meaning.  From a purely entertainment point of view, the movie works very well.  John Wayne is  excellent as the tough, driven uncle of Natalie Wood, who goes on a 5 year  quest to find her after her family is murdered and she is kidnapped by  Indians.  Two things about this film standout for me.  One thing is the  relentless pursuit by Wayne and the way one man, for whatever his motives,  refuses to give up or move on without getting what he is after.  The other  standout is the photography.  This must be one of the most beautifully  filmed movies of all time.  The colour and scenery are breathtaking.  Some  of the dialogue and acting (especially Jeffrey Hunter) are stilted and  unbelievable, but they do not interfere in the enjoyment of the movie.   Anyone in &quot;search&quot; of a great, classic Western should be sure to  view this movie.
6303979882|5.0|This is my favorite movie...I think the actors portray their characters very well, and the story is very well told.  I reccomend this movie to just about everyone...!
B000021XR5|2.0|Where I come from STP is not so popular as in the USA. I do not know any other STP fans in here. But I am a big fan. Or...was ?  I am a bit disappointed with this album. This CD brings nothing new. I don't  understand why other people find this CD a classic, it doesn't come  close  to PURPLE (what I think is their best album). In  interviews they say that  'it was so easy man' to make this album. I say it was TOO easy, because  this abum is not THAT good. But...it's better than nothing. (Hopefully  their next album is better.)
B00004SCX6|1.0|Yes, Britney did it again, everyone. She blows up the pop scene with her not-so-talented voice paired up with ok lyrics.  I am a teenager and of course I love pop music. What teenager doesn't? I really don't think this  album is much more than a over-hyped immitation of a ...good singer. All  she is , is a dressed up 18 year old with not enough supervision, too much  freedom, and way too big ego. My advice to you as a fellow cd buyer is,  please, don't buy this. You will only be wasting money that could be used  on better cds.
B00003CXDV|4.0|I liked this movie and I thought it would be lame humor or silly humor that would not make me laph. But I did laph a lot and it was not lame or silly well sometimes silly but never lame. I say this movie is a must see.
B00004T8RK|4.0|When I first listened to this album I didn't like it but after I stopped trying to find another &quot;Alive&quot; or &quot;Daughter&quot; type hit song I began to enjoy this album in its uniqueness. Because this is like no  other Pearl Jam album that I've ever heard, but there are some very good  songs on it such as &quot;light years&quot;,&quot;nothing as it  seems&quot;, &quot;thin air&quot;, &quot;insignificance&quot;, and probably  my favorite &quot;sleight of hand&quot;, my suggestion is to buy this album  and just let it grow on you.
6305807043|4.0|I liked this movie but I thought it was choppy in some sence but other wise this movie was grate it was nothing like the usuall movies and thats a big part of why people like this movie so much. Well for me anyway. You get  sick of the same old stuff and this movie was defintly not the usuall  stuff. It was also not based on anything that is another big part of why it  is such a good movie I mean we only see the same things over and over again  because when you look at it they are the same thing over and over again.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Britney has &quot;done it again.&quot;  The title track &quot;Oops!...I did it again&quot; is starting to get old though.  Britney does great on her remake of &quot;(I can't get no) Satisfaction&quot; and on Shania Twain  written don't let me be the last to know, she sounds like Shania a lot!   Tracks 9 and 10 are a little slow to get through(boring) but when you get  to Britney written &quot;Dear Diary&quot; you get another great track.   Track 3 &quot;Don't Go Knocking On my Door&quot; reminds me of some R&amp;B  track and it is really good.  Britney, you got better!
B00003CWOL|5.0|I have seen every Kevin Smith movie.  I adore his sense of humor.  In clerks, most of his humor was kinda trashy, but the movie was endearing because it was more or less fun.  Mallrats was really his mainstream  appearance. Again not rated very highly but nonetheless fun and dealing  with the whole young adult experience. Chasing Amy was alright in its own  sense.  But what I really love about all of kevin Smith's movies is the  Loyalty.  Jason Lee, (Azreal) played the lead in the movie Mallrats, and  the sidekick to Ben Affleck in Chasing; Grant Hicks, the reporter covering  the Catholisim WoW campaign news story was Dante Hicks in Clerks, The gun  clerk played The Annoying sidekick in the movie Clerks,  And of course Jay  and Silent Bob.  Although Silent Bob remains silent for most of the movies  he has been in, he usually comes up some deeply important point in the  movie that kinda makes you stop and think. Bob did speak in this one,  though it wasnt very deep.  All together this movie was one of the funniest  I have seen since Something About Mary.
B00003CWOL|5.0|Okay, I'll have to admit, when I rented this movie I did it because of Fiorentino(I've loved her work in Men In Black) and thought, hey, maybe this'll be a good watch like Good Will Hunting.  I'd heard some people say  it was one of their favorite movies, but I just figured it was mostly  non-religious rebels in the family.   I'll admit also, I almost didn't get  it because of the religiousness(living in Salt Lake City as a non-mormon,  you kind of get an overdose of religion, whether you originally believed or  not).  So, after I popped in the movie, I was expecting a Chris Rock movie  spent bashing religion with unending one-liners.  Amazingly, it didn't turn  out that way.   As soon as the movie was finished, I was kind of in shock.   I began to see religion in a whole new light.  I could actually identify  with god.  She was no longer just an icon made to soothe the minds of  people that couldn't handle not having something to believe in, but  something that could be entertaining, funny, and... believable.   I really  can't believe that people would not go see this movie because it is  &quot;blasphemous&quot;.  I can see people not watching it because of the  f-bombs being dropped every ten seconds by the &quot;prophet&quot;, but  that is a small price to pay for such an amazing movie.
B00003CWRX|5.0|i could hardly believe how excellent this film was when I saw it.  I already knew the story that it's based on, and although some things were slightly changed, its for the better.<br />Old Al does a fine job here, hes  not the typical yelling loud character he usually is and carries the role  perfectly.  Russel Crowe's face is also 100% neccisary in the  movie.<br />Michael Mann's direction is also pure genious.  Every scene is  done perfectly.<br />You won't be dissapointed.
079213690X|3.0|how can such an incredable picture not be on DVD? is this a joke? This film just begs to be on DVD. why it's not? i have absolutely no idea. Very frustrating. I'm removing 2 stars from this review because of the  boneheaded move by the studio to deprive the hardcore cinema lover of such  an epic and wonderful film.
0790705141|1.0|Stanley Kubrick's adaptation of Stephen King's novel &quot;The Shining&quot; has become an extremely important part of popular film culture, with many scenes and lines from the movie appearing in all forms  of media. However, as an avid reader, I felt this movie was a complete  failure as a book adaptation. This movie, in itself, could be seen as a  great movie if one has not read King's masterpiece. But after reading the  book, one can plainly see how horrible Kubrick's movie truly is. First, the  character portrayals were complelty different from the book. Nicholson's  Jack Torrance was essentially a mad man from the start, and fails to show  the fall from grace that Jack Torrance had in the novel. Shelly Duvall was  complelty horrible as Wendy Torrance, portraying a week willed woman  completly different than that of the novel. The movie's plot totally  altered King's plot, adding things and changing many existsing things,  especially the ending, which was far superior in the book. Many critics may  say that movies are not supposed to be exact reworks of the book, but  essentially Kubrick's version is almost a different story with the same  name. The cinematic techniques of Kubrick's movie were excellent, but after  reading the book, one can see how lackluster this film truly is.
B00002Z88D|1.0|Metallica used to be the fastest, loudest, heaviest metal band out there. Now they're playing with a huge orchestra. I'm reminded of an interview the great Cliff Burton gave in '86 shortly before his death when he made the  comment to the effect of 'why should we do something big and fancy? we're  just up there doing what we do'. Well, you cant get much more of a bigger  scale than this. Another problem is James Hetfield's futile attempts to be  a good vocalist. The band was infinitely better when he just screamed as  loud as he could. It went much better with the music. I'm sure Cliff Burton  is rolling over in his grave, and Metallica is no longer a great metal band  in my mind.
B00004IA0D|5.0|I first bought the normal , one disc version of Enema of the State a few months ago. I fell in love with it. Then it got stolen, and I was going to order the norm one again. Then I saw this one and thought Hey, why not? I  was amazed when it came. Not only does it have all the great tracks from  the normal cd, it has bonus live tracks that just Kick Tail. One bad thing:  Tom and Mark tend to talk about sex and swear a lot while they're talking  in between songs. They're funny, though. This cd is a must for any  Blink-182- fan opr just any punk fan. It's worth the dough.
B0000009S3|5.0|No, this is not Zappa's best album.&quot;Freak Out&quot; is his best. This is the album you should introduce Zappa to people with however. I mean, this album is some of the BEST jazz rock ever made ( I like it alot more  than Weather Report to be sure) and it became my daily bread after hearing  the &quot;Gumbo Variations&quot;(I NEVER played air saxophone before this  song(or for that matter, air violin)). This album is Zappa the composer  taking control, and stuffing it in the non-believer's faces, no  compromises. Best tracks: Gumbo Variations(GOD this song is so awesome) and  Peaches en Regalia. Willie the Pimp is really great howver in its unedited  version(perfect timing, perfect twiddly-twiddly guitar). As Zappa once said  &quot;Jazz is the music of the unemployed&quot;. With this album however, I  believe he had more than enough work to do and made plenty of money doing  it(It is his most popular album).
0380002930|5.0|Could this have been one of my first literary departures from reality? I don't know, but since then I have been an avid reader of Fantasy and other books of the like. But this is a great retelling of the Exodus story with a  small furry mammal twist. Hazel was a strong leader even if Bigwig seemed  to be the stronger. the real power and respect lay with Hazel. So it is in  the human worl. Children can greatly benefit from reading thhis as it  easily correlates with some of the baser sides of human society. I try to  watch the film version of it at least once a year and I now want my  children to enjoy this fantasy classic.
1559408898|5.0|Robocop is not to be taken too seriously.  I have read a good number of the online reviews and have to object to the majority of posts that claim the Criterion Collection is not worth it.<br />There are essentially two  scenes of extra footage which includes extra carnage (the only two scenes  of bonus material).  ED209 implants about twenty more rounds of gunfire  into Kenny's body during it's initial demonstration and Murphy's original  death scene is even more graphic, but at least coherent, in this version.<br />If you watch the original release, after Weller is shot the first time,  they cut to a full shot where his arm is missing.  I'm not necessarily  saying that this is great because we actually see him lose the arm, but  this is the way Verhoeven intended the film to be, so pay the extra $5 and  get it.<br />The picture quality and sound are fantastic.  The special  features include a storyboard to film comparison which is a feature I would  love to see more DVD releases include.  Most importantly, there is an audio  commentary by Paul Verhoeven himself, which makes it worth the purchase  right there.
0767802659|1.0|This is the worst example of book adaptation i have ever seen.  The only thing that stayed the same from the book are the names of the characters.  Verhoven even changed some of the characters genders.  The only reason i  saw this movie was because i didnt see the preview.  If i had seen who was  in this movie, and who directed it, i wouldn't have payed 7.50 to watch  this junk.<br />I cant believe that he slapped on the name Starship Troopers.  This is my list of changes. 1.Bugs did not have ships or lasers.<br />2.There  were no high powered suits.<br />3.They took out the skinnies(if you didn't  read the book the skinnies are aliens they fought in the beginning)<br />4.The  movie did not explain how the bugs colinated other planets.<br />5.He basicly  cut the book in half and left out the good half.<br />6.Dizzie is supposed to  be a guy.<br />7.Most of the characters and their backrounds in the book were  deleted<br />8.In the book the fighting was completely different from in the  movie ex.In the movie the troopers could fly and had various other  weapons.<br />9.The ships and the landings on the planets were  different.<br />Even though all of that makes me angry, there is something  else that just pushes me over the edge. Verhoven took a glorious book about  a human kind that advanced themselves into a great race into a war film  that was made just for special effects and not for the plot or dramatizing  issues.ex. In the book i felt sorry for those people in Ricos home town,  but in the movie i didnt even give it a thought.  the only reason that  verhoven put it in there was so that he had a reason to bring rico  back.<br />The last thing that angered me was the nazi-ism in the movie.  The  flag in the backround at the bar was a nazi flag that i've seen in books.  The eagle they used for the fleet people looked exactly like the bird that  pirched on the nazi swastica(don't know how to spell it).  The characters  in the book were raised in a hitler youth typeof place and looked like  nazi-poster boys.  The propaganda was nazi-ish as well as the uniforms.  The last straw was the rank insigia on carl when they were at dizzy's  funeral, it was a colonial nazi insigia.<br />We are all a little bit dumber  for watching this, i award it no points, and may god have mercy on  verhovens soul.

Britney doesnt have a very strong voice (which is masked by the background singers) however nobody can sing this style of  pop with the same flare and attitude she does. The cd is almost flawless-  even if a couple of the songs are cheesy- it grows on you. My favorite  songs are &quot;stronger&quot; &quot;what you see&quot;.

0192833634|3.0|Ok, I'll admit it right here.  I skipped to the end of the book.  But how could I help it?  Between Edmund's confused love-life and Fanny's martyrdom, we were getting no where.  It's like in one of those movies  where you yell at the characters &quot;Just TALK to each other!&quot;<br />Do you like the tv show Felicity?  Then this is the book for you.  Here  you have two people who totally understand each other.  They're soul mates.  Yet they just can't seem to get together.  The very characteristics that  make them so right for each other are the walls that separate them.  I  have a feeling that Jane Austen was tired of being so nice and then getting  the bad end of the bargain. Maybe writing this book was some kind of outlet  for her.  And she must have had LOTS of free time on her hands when she  wrote this.<br />So if you have lots of free time on your hands, and you're  a die-hard Austen fan like me, go ahead.  Take the challenge.  See if you  can make it all the way through Mansfield Park!
0440234743|4.0|The author of The Testament is John Grisham.  He is an author who lives with his wife and kids in Virginia and Mississippi.  He is a lawyer, which explains why most of his books have to do with crime and punishment.  The  Testament is no exception to the rule.  Greed and selfishness are the  majority of the character traits in the book.  Tony Phelan, who is a  multi-billionaire, changes his last will and testament about as often as  most people change clothes.  In every will, he gives more to family members  who have not upset him recently, and he takes away from those who have  caused him grief.  Eventually, he lets out the news that he has a brain  tumor and is going to die.  He drafts a final will and signs it.  He is  pronounced to be sane by three distinguished psychiatrists.  However, after  he commits suicide, and the family reads his holographic will, which he  drafted on legal paper just minutes before he jumped, they all began to  question his sanity.  The story then takes a very surprising turn.   However, if you wish to find out what that exciting turn is, you will have  to read the book.
B00004LN16|5.0|Having not been born for most of AC/DC's career, I have had to rely on the stories of old to keep me enlightened, gathering most info from magazines and going out and buying almost every album(almost, i'm not quite there  yet)I can get my hands on.   On hearing SUL was being released I was  filling my pants with fear at the prospect of another &quot;Blow  up....&quot; or &quot;Fly on the Wall,&quot; both of which I enjoy but  aren't classic 'DC.  I was so glad that the Aussie boys proved me wrong, it  is a true return to form for the boys who established a whole new era of  rock.  In my mind there are few weakness' on the album and rivals Back in  Black as Johnson's best album.  Sorry old fella but Bon rules the roost.

630575067X|2.0|The common theme running through George Lucas' work is visual genius  marked by artistic laziness.  Like most geniuses, Lucas works best within a  limited palette of expertise.  If you want stunning visuals and bombastic  sound, he's your man.  If you want a storyline with some level of  sophistication beyond Saturday morning cartoons, it's best to look  elsewhere.  <br />Star Wars fans (and I consider myself one) can whine all  they want, but childishness is an inherent part of Lucas' cinematic ouevre.   <br />Whenever Lucas steps away from the controls and lets someone else drive  the plot, the results are as amazing as &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot;, the hands-down favorite of most Star Wars fans.  When George is  actively engaged in the script, we get dreck like the Ewoks and Phantom  Menace's Jar Jar Binks.  <br />&quot;Episode I-The Phantom Menace&quot; could  never live up to its prerelease hype in any event, but with Lucas firmly in  command the movie is even more execrable than may otherwise have been the  case.  How bad is it?  <br />- The incoherent plot involves some nonsense  about interstellar trade regulations<br />- The Force, previously a kind of  New Age mysticism, now seemingly stems from a parasitic infection<br />- The  main force for good is a 14-year old &quot;elected queen&quot; of a planet  named Naboo, of all things, who spends much of the movie in Kabuki makeup  speaking in desultory monotone<br />- The villain never speaks a word, and  seemingly exists for the sole purpose of having a lightsaber duel with two  of the heroes<br />- A major character actually chooses slavery over freedom,  mainly as a cheap way to write her out of subsequent scenes<br />- Unlike Luke  Skywalker, who had a painful and awkward apprenticeship before emergind as  a full-blown hero in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, Anakin Skywalker is  invincible from the word go, despite being only 9 years old<br />The movie is  a colossal disappointment, and not just due to the inflated expectations of  fans.  While a number of the visuals are simply stunning, the plot is a  total mess, which substantially undermines the movie's impact.  The final  victory comes so cheaply and ridiculously as to serve as a sort of parody  of the first film (imagine Luke destroying the Death Star in a Landspeeder  while on the way to Tachi Station to look at some power convertors and  you'll see what I mean).  <br />Fans hope against hope that the second  installment will counter this trend and restore some sense of menace to the  series.  Unfortunately, this installment is to be the love story, and if  Lucas handles it as childishly as the &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;, fans  hearts will be the only ones broken.  Again.
B000002I25|5.0|The Doors was released in January of 1967. Beginning with a breathtaking introduction, &quot;Break On Through&quot; and climaxing with &quot;Light My Fire&quot; most of the songs on side one have that trademark organ  sound. The organ, a Vox Continental, is played by the incomparable Ray  Manzarek, who also played a Fender Rhodes keyboard bass with his left hand  at the same time, keeping the bass lines precise and melodic. An amazing  feat of musicianship indeed! Side two starts off with a Willie  Dixon/Chester Burnett composition, &quot;Back Door Man&quot;. A jazzy  little number complete with bluesy guitar solo by Robby Krieger. Followed  by &quot;End of the Night&quot;, the most haunting melody I've ever heard.  The final song is the 11 minute 35 second Oedipal epic &quot;The End&quot;.  I thought the song was a little boring the first time I heard it but it  seems to grow on you. The icing on the cake is the album cover artwork. The  psychedelic green logo over brown matches the music somehow. And the back  cover photography (by genius photographer Joel Brodsky) with the half faces  is extraordinary. I'm a tough critic but I'm glad to give this CD five  stars!
0930289528|5.0|British writer Alan Moore earned his place in the comic book writers' pantheon with his seminal turn on Swamp Thing in the 80s, part of the triumvirate of Frank Miller, Neil Gaiman, and Moore who transformed lowly  comic books into a respectable artistic medium.  <br />And, like Miller and  Gaiman before him, Moore found that the only way to carry on once you've  thoroughly changed your industry is to do do it again and again in new and  novel fashion.  <br />Thus, I give you &quot;V for Vendetta,&quot; the  absolute furthest thing from &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; and  &quot;Watchmen&quot; imaginable.  <br />Moore almost singlehandedly restored  the creepy cool of EC horror comics with his run on &quot;Swamp  Thing.&quot; He redefined the superhero genre with &quot;Watchmen.&quot;   With &quot;V&quot;, Moore abandoned the conventions of both genres and  embraced gritty Orwellian scifi.  <br />&quot;V&quot; is set in a Britain  which has embraced Fascism following a nuclear conflict which left the  nation intact but badly bruised. Mirroring Hitler's ascent over the ashes  of the Weimar Republic, the Norsefire party seizes power in Britain and  restores order at a horrible price.  <br />That is, until a stylish terrorist  in a Guy Fawkes mask codenamed &quot;V&quot; appears on the scene to tear  the new order down.  <br />&quot;V for Vendetta&quot; marks a major departure  from comic book style.  David Lloyd's cinematic style plays like a  storyboard for a film; gone are the motion lines and Batman-esque sound  effects so familiar to comic readers.  Lloyd also dispenses with one of the  comic writer's main crutches for exposition---the thought balloon.  The  story is thus relayed entirely by motion and dialogue, deepening the  inherent mystery of the plot as we try to comprehend the master plan of the  inscrutable antihero &quot;V&quot;.  <br />As with &quot;Watchmen&quot;, Moore  has layered his tale with enormous depth, making subsequent readings a must  to truly comprehend all that's going on within the plot.  <br />If you're  interested in seeing what the comic art form is capable of when geared  toward an adult audience, rush out and grab a copy of &quot;V for  Vendetta&quot; today.

0783242808|3.0|OK, people, take a breath.  &quot;American Pie&quot; is neither hysterically funny nor hideously raunchy.  It isn't as hilarious as &quot;Porky's&quot; or as disgusting as your average John Waters flick.  It  is instead a pretty run-of-the-mill look at the eternal quest of high  schoolers to get laid on prom night.  <br />Taken in this context, the movie  is a pretty solid effort.  Jason Biggs is decent as an indecently-stupid  senior doomed to get caught in the most embarassing situations known to  man, whether by his parents, friends, or the entire town via Internet.   Chris Klein is his sensitive dumb jock friend who needs to play down the  sensitivity a bit if he wants to appear less effeminate on celluloid (a  good thing for a heterosexual lead role, Kevin Spacey call your office).   Mena Suvari is the virginal object of his affection, while Allison Hannigan  is simply worthless as a repugnant band chick.  <br />There are a number of  funny situations along the way, but &quot;American Pie&quot; simply does  not sustain the laughter throughout the film and the climax (as could be  expected the first time) is a letdown.  The pie scene of the title isn't  any funnier nor more disturbing in the uncut version, which of course leads  you to wonder why the censors even bothered in the first place.  <br />An  inconsequential movie good for a few sophomoric laughs.  3 stars mainly for  the lovely Mena Suvari.

B00000JZIK|5.0|Every now and again, a film emerges from the Hollywood ooze to completely redefine the preconceptions of its genre.  Examples of this welcome trend include &quot;Unforgiven,&quot; &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, and &quot;The  Lost Boys&quot;, to name an eclectic few.  <br />&quot;The Usual  Suspects&quot; does for crime thrillers what &quot;Alien&quot; did for  science fiction--it causes fans to reevaluate what drew thm to the genre in  the first place and rekindles their enthusiasm for it.  <br />Usually, movies  of this sort tend to have largely-unknown casts.  &quot;The Usual  Suspects&quot; is all the more remarkable for having an all-star cast, akin  to &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;.  Chazz Palmintieri plays the hard-nosed  customs official determined to get to the bottom of a drug deal gone bad;  Gabriel Byrne plays a criminal struggling to hove to the  straight-and-narrow, Kevin Spacey shines as the handicapped reluctant  informant Verbal Kint, while Kevin Pollack and the remainder of the cast  represent a cross-section of modern thuggery.  <br />This sordid bunch is  brought together in a lineup for a crime none will own up to, during which  they decide to team up for a daring raid on a drug lord's haul.  As with  &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and other classics of the genre, things go  downhill fast from there.<br />Much of the action is relayed in the form of a  flashback from Verbal Kint's interrogation.  Anyone who doubts Spacey's  status as the finest actor in film today need only reference his role here  as the complex Kint to become true believers.  <br />It would be a crime to  reveal any more of the plot ir the astonishing climax, but suffice it to  say that if you enjoy the way tightly-plotted movies like &quot;The Sixth  Sense&quot; or &quot;Presumed Innocent&quot; pull the rug out from under  you just when you think you know the score, &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;  will make your night, or my name isn't Keyszer Soze.
B0000039LE|5.0|This is the best horror film ever.  Enough said.
0780622545|5.0|Ridley Scott's &quot;Blade Runner&quot; is perhaps the best-known (and certainly the most beloved) attempt to blend science fiction with gritty film noir flourishes.  The future portrayed in this film looked decidedly  desperate and retro, and thus somehow more realistic.  <br />&quot;Dark  City&quot; takes this concept to the next level, in that for much of the  movie you're not even aware that it's science fiction.  <br />The movie begins  with a man waking up bloody in a bathtub with no idea as to who he is or  how he got there, a plot no doubt familiar to noir fans.  He comes to  realize he is being hunted by the police for a murder he has no  recollection of.  <br />And then things get weird.  <br />Courtesy prohibits  discussion of the plot, the unfolding of which is crucial to viewers'  enjoyment of the film, but suffice it to say that nothing is what it seems  in Dark City, keeping with the best tradition of film noir.  <br />The visuals  in the film are terrific.  The setting is appropriately dark and menacing,  and the lighting is evocative of all those wonderful 40s and 50s movies  which so obviously served as the film's inspiration.  The acting is  terrific, with Kiefer Sutherland taking an appropriately slimy turn as a  mad scientist who may hold the key to the nefarious dealings in the city.   Jennifer Connelly is at her gorgeous best here as the endangered femme  fatale.  Rufus Sewell sparkles as the amnesiac protagonist who may or may  not be a serial killer, but who holds the fate of Dark City in his hands.   <br />If you loved &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, &quot;Total Recall&quot;,  &quot;12 Monkeys,&quot; &quot;D.O.A.&quot;, the works of Raymond Chandler  and Dashell Hammett, or latter-day noir films such as &quot;Body  Double&quot; or &quot;Chinatown&quot;, I guarantee you'll love &quot;Dark  City&quot;, a truly unique film.
6305169187|1.0|Godzilla's phrase may have been Size Does Matter, but this movie steals it with its unnessecarily overlong running time!  The FX are laughable, the acting stood out, and the costumes looked like they were going to fall  apart!  Hell, the Avengers was better than this movie!  It was pure hell to  sit through!  Do yourself a favor, avoid this movie!  You may die bye the  time it's over!
B00000K2SC|4.0|&quot;The Matrix,&quot; along with &quot;Blade,&quot; &quot;The Crow,&quot; and &quot;Batman,&quot; have proven that movies based on comic books need not be death at the box office.  The formula for success seems  to rely on the use of visual effects to create memorable (if unrealistic)  images much as explode off every page of a comic book.  To avoid  cheesiness, the comic book movie should move action along at a frightening  pace, not giving audiences time to poke holes in the plot.<br />&quot;The  Matrix&quot; follows the formula to the letter and succeeds.  A  &quot;Terminator&quot; style plot concerning machines' subjugation of  humans and the quest for freedom on a virtual reality battleground aside,  &quot;The Matrix&quot; is a pulse-pounding action movie with jaw-dropping  special effects.  <br />Laurence Fishburne is at his understated best as the  leader of the rebellion, while Keanu manages to look appropriately stylish  and not botch his lines (which means he's in top form here).  The rest of  the cast is essentially scenery and unworthy of comment here.  <br />In movies  of this sort, wherein an unrealistic world is created, it is important for  the plot to be subject to some hard and fast rules.  Whenever these do not  exist (as in the &quot;Phantom Menace,&quot; for example), one is left  unable to suspend disbelief and ride along with the film.  &quot;The  Matrix&quot; succeeds admirably as it switches between our world and the  virtual one known as the Matrix.  <br />While it certainly won't earn you any  points with the Starbucks-swilling set, &quot;The Matrix&quot; is great  fun.  Whoa.
0783227434|5.0|This is the best movie ever made!  I watched this movie many times, and it had so many awsome lines that make the movie hilarious. Bruce Campbell is an awsome actor, and this movie is such a cool movie, I recomend this to  everyone.
0440234743|4.0|... and into the jungle!  Finally, John Grisham takes the action somewhere new and exciting!  This book rocks because it appeals to fans of both courtroom dramas and environmental adventures!  The best scenes describe a lawyer picking his opponents apart- and you will SO want to see them crack.   The good characters are easy to love, and the bad characters are easy to  hate.  This book will also get you thinking about what you'd do with $50  million- lots of fun dreaming there!  The only disappointment (as usual) is  that Grisham hasn't created a challenging read at all (even for a sixteen  year old).  I would love to see him create a REAL work of literature in the  future that is much more challenging and complex than most of his other  books.  Rather than hold my breath, however, I'll just re-read this book!
6305807086|4.0|All I have to say is &quot;...&quot;. this was by FAR the absolutely, positively, without-a-shadow-of-a-doubtly clever, innovating, refreshing and plain-out-weird movie i ever saw. <br />i have nothing else to say to  describe it.<br />e
0375703764|5.0|At first, I was sceptical - the person who reccomended it raved about the 'brilliant structure' and the 'revolutionary technique,' using all sorts of words that send up my warning flags in a second.  So let it be said I went  in doubtful.     I'm sold.  The stories told in this book are dense,  interwoven, and interconneted in more ways than I could possibly detail.   From visceral descriptions of the utterly mundane to disturbingly efficient  imagery of the uncomplicatedly mind-blowing, the book draws you into its  world.     More than anything, I reccomend this text because it lures you  into a world that advertizes itself as both fact and fiction, leading you  to question the reality of everything in the book - and maybe a little of  your own life.     This book may not be for everyone - if you get your  kicks from pulp horror or mainstream thillers, this might be too involved.   But for fans of artists of the sureal like Borges and Cortezar are sure to  fall in love with this profoundly disturbing tome.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I just can't stop listening to this album.  &quot;Light Years&quot; is breath-takingly beautiful.  Every song is glorious.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Pearl Jam is one of the few bands left that isn't afraid to take risks (as they do frequently on their latest) and do something that's, well...just not like them.  <br />Examples with this disk: 1)there are several songs that  Vedder had nothing to do with the writing of  2)there are just as many  typically abrassive and radio-unfriendly songs as there are &lt;gasp!&gt;  catchy and almost fun songs (watch for Vedder's ukelele).  <br />So far my  favorites are the first single, Ament's almost Pink Floyd-like  &quot;Nothing As It Seems&quot;, and the driving, melodic &quot;Light  Years&quot;.  The usual hints at influence form The Who (the opening to  &quot;Breakerfall&quot; strongly echoes &quot;I Can See For Miles&quot;),  and Neil Young (I'm still convinced he has some uncredited solos on here  somewhere).<br />Great music, great lyrics, definitely a great break from the  manufactured garbage that's making it all over the radio.
B00000IP4H|3.0|As a bid to reclaim underground cred, Demonic spares little to chance.  This is easily Testament's heaviest album of their career, adopting grindcore and extreme metal effectively.  Frontmen Chuck Billy almost  exclusively uses a death throat, rather his trademark singing, and it's an  effective throat indeed.  Moreover, the playing is extremely tight,  especially with the intensely rhythmic riffs.  In every way, Demonic is  heavy.<BR><BR> And yet, it's surprisingly dull.  Underneath the clothing  and you still have a 80s thrash band, which is fine except that the  combination doesn't completely gel.  That grindcore sound works best with  extremely fast tempos or slower dirges that groove the riff home; but here  it accentuates a creative drought.  The riffs, save for different rhythms,  sound the same due to the production.  Besides that, the songs are  relentessly mid-tempo; except for the drum rolls, there's rarely an  explosive moment.  The lead parts are cheesy and monotonous.  The songs  tend to blend into each other.<BR><BR> However, these problems aren't  readily apparent until a few consecutive songs.  Taken in small doses,  Demonic works as well as average death-metal does -- heavy, brutal, but  monotonous.  If you want to hear it done right, check out Testament's The  Gathering.
B00003OSSL|4.0|Harrison Ford was,as usual, a believable actor with not the best role.  Kristen Scott-Thomas came off as a typical cold-hearted politician.  Their match up was poor casting.

B00004SCX6|1.0|What has music come to these days?  It seems that all the radios ever play anymore is pop &quot;kings&quot; and &quot;queens&quot; such as the Backstreet Boys, N*SUNK (as I like to call them), and Britney Spears.  And  today - for some random reason - I decide to pick on Spears.  Problem  number uno: she can't sing.  Her voice is -uh . . . uh . . . it's not a  good one, to put it bluntly.  Problem numero dos: this isn't music!    Will you people wake up and realize that a bunch of computer-generated  sounds and someone's lousy voice isn't music.  It simply isn't.  Problem  numero thres: she needs to work on her lyrics.  Seriously.  Her fist CD was  decently written (at least she wrote some of the songs), but this one is  even worse.  You want a good artist/music?  Try Bush, Audio Adrenaline,  Creed, dc Talk, Jars of Clay, Smashing Pumpkins, the M:I-2 soundtrack,  Bride, and so on and so on.  My last thought with you is this: SOMEONE SAVE  US FROM POP/ELECTRONICA MUSIC THAT IS FOR SOME DUMB REASON RULING THE AIR  WAVES!  LET'S GET SOME REAL MUSIC OUT THERE!

0783242808|4.0|'American Pie' is great!  I went to see it twice at the cinema, and I  can't wait to get it on DVD.  Previous reviewers have been right to say  it's like a version of 'Porkies' for the nineties - it's a modern updating  of the 80's frat-house comedy genre in more ways than one.  By contrast  with its earlier (inferior) cousin, 'American Pie' is intelligent,  unexploitative and has decent roles for its female characters.  <br />It's  also tempting to compare 'Pie' to 'There's Something About Mary' because  both films share a high gross-out factor - Jim's exploits with the pie, his  sock (!) and a collection of adult magazines form a running joke through  the course of the whole film, and there probably isn't a sexual taboo that  isn't confronted.  And of course there's the funny-tasting beer and the  laxative gags (both of which the film would have been better without,  really).<br />But to compare 'American Pie' with either of these other films  is to miss what makes is truly unique - its outlook is unashamedly romantic  and optimistic, with a complex set of messages that you'd never expect from  a film nominally about four guys out to get laid.  Our heroes'  relationships evolve in entirely different, unexpected ways, largely  avoiding clichés and cheap gags too... resulting in much of the film being  totally hilarious: the live-sex Internet broadcast is awesomely funny.  See  this film... after which you might consider getting the soundtrack, if only  for the wonderful Bic Runga track, 'Sway'.
6305810109|3.0|Avid filmgoers have been shocked that David Lynch directed this G-rated Disney movie  (DAVID LYNCH!), but those who pay close attention while watching it will notice a few Lynchian send-ups of Americana, albeit muted.   The director strives for compassion -- I think he mostly succeeds -- but  he still can't quite resist chuckling at some of the folks he puts in his  movie.  (For instance, Farnsworth blowing apart his first lawnmower with a  shotgun might be just a bit overdetermined.)  There isn't the full respect  and acceptance of rural America that one finds, wondrously, in Robert  Duvall's  *The Apostle*.<br />That small unpleasantness over with, let me  praise the virtues of  *The Straight Story*.  The movie is a welcome  reminder for all of us to SLOW DOWN.  Lynch forces us to travel at Alvin  Straight's pace, which at first is funny . . . and soon provides  opportunities for some inner reflection  (entirely possible while watching  a film).  And, of course, the scenery is beautiful -- Lynch doesn't make a  pretensious point of that, he merely presents it.  The story itself is  about an old patriarch  (Richard Farnsworth)  who wishes to make amends  with his stroke-afflicted brother.  Without a proper driver's license, he  must drive the 370 or so miles on a lawnmower, with a small camper hitched  to the back.  Naturally, it's based on a true story.<br />It's a demanding  role for Richard Farnsworth  (FAR FAR more demanding than Kevin Spacey's  larking about in  *American Beauty*), who handles it superbly.  This guy  pops up in movies every once in a while, and one is always astonished at  his dominating screen presence.  But, perhaps even more astonishing is  Sissy Spacek's lamentably brief work in this movie.  Lynch makes a HUGE  error by dropping her after 30 minutes.  Her portrayal of Alvin's daughter  is shockingly one-of-a-kind -- you'll never see anything quite like it in a  film again.  But that's what great actors do, and Spacek's one of our  best.<br/>I recommend  *The Straight Story*.  It's not a masterpiece, but it  doesn't strive for greatness, anyway.  It just does its job . . .  beautifully.
B000021Y77|5.0|I can't wait to get the DVD so I can see this film again.  I managed to  catch it at the cinema in Seattle a couple of months back and I was blown  away by its originality and general awesomeness.  I'd say it's the best  German film I've ever seen, but it doesn't have much competition since it's  pretty much the *only* German film I've ever seen.  The story revolves  around Lola (Franka Potente), a spiky-haired teenage tearaway, who needs to  scrape together 100,000 DM in twenty minutes in order to save her waster  boyfriend's life.  The structure the director uses to present Lola's hectic  adventures is really original - we see her attempting the same task three  different times, each time with a few events differing and resulting in  hugely varying eventual outcomes.  I won't spoil it by giving the plot(s)  away, but the end result is an excellent film.  The soundtrack is very cool  too - lots of suitably high-speed techno, in the style of Underworld.

0780627016|5.0|Wow!  I watched this video last night and realised I'd forgotten how great it was after seeing it at the cinema.  'Pleasantville' is based on an entertaining concept (modern disaffected youths are sucked into idyllic  black-and-white 50's US TV-show world), the story is played out by great  actors (Joan Allen, William H. Macy, Reese Witherspoon [pre-Election] and  Tobey Maguire [pre-Cider-House]), and the movie as a whole puts across some  altruistic messages without coming across as cheesy.<br />It's tempting to  compare 'Pleasantville' with 'The Truman Show' since both stories follow  protagonists living their lives in a golden-age white-picket-fenced  American smalltown utopia, and who are effectively playing out parts in a  TV show.  But the premises of the two films are wildly different.  Truman  Burbank is a real man living in a massive industry-constructed TV studio,  all those around him played by actors.  It's close to the real world,  though set slightly forward in time.  The brother-sister heroes of  Pleasantville, by contrast, are real people supernaturally transplanted  into the TV universe of a regular old show.  The Truman Show examines the  plight of the individual attempting to make a stand against an oppressive  society and those who control it; Pleasantville's perspective is far more  socially-based, showing a community blossoming into self-awareness.<br />The  effects (well, the one drawn-out effect of Pleasantville slowly  transforming from monochrome to Technicolor as the town's inhabitants each  experience their individual epiphanies of realness) serve the story  wonderfully - the scenes when the black-and-white of Lover's Lane is  interrupted by a red rose and a shower of pink petals are gorgeous -  rivaling any of the images in 'American Beauty'.  <br />I could go on for a  dozen paragraphs about my favourite parts of the film, but I'll restrain  myself to encouraging you to watch this video, if you think you can stomach  the movie's essentially moral message and its occasionally  sledgehammer-sensitive symbolism (girl tempts monochrome boy with juicy red  apple, etc).  'Pleasantville' gamely tackles a slew of issues - rejection  of traditionally monotonous work routines, liberation of women from an  age-old homemaker role, etc, but really falls down only when it alludes to  racial prejudice (OK, having a 'No Coloreds' sign is a knowing reference to  America's troubled civil rights history, but the arrival of a few non-white  characters would have been a better way to examine racism in US society).
630242335X|5.0|There were two themes in this move.  The theme of prejudice, and the \\"go to hell, authority\\" theme.<br />This movie captured the moralistic attitude of the original episodes where a science fiction world was used to tackle a  present-day problem.  The movie goes into detail about Kirk's prejudice  toward the Klingon race; how the Klingons are different from the rest of  the members of Starfleet.<br />Through the course of the movie, other people  are shown to have taken a more extremist stance in their prejudice toward  the Klingons than Kirk, which makes him reevaluate his own prejudice.  Isn't that what happens in life?  We are born with prejudices.  We have  examples of people who fight against those prejudices and people who  epitomize prejudice.  We embrace the fight and scorn those who embody  prejudice.<br />This movie, more than any other Star Trek movie, exploited  Kirk's defiant attitude.  Every chance to scorn authority was taken by  every regular member of the Enterprise. Spock even says in response to  authority, \\"If I were human, I believe my response would be ... go to hell ...  if I were human.\\"<br />Worf's minor part in defending Kirk in a Klingon court  was a much better bridge between the series than Generations. In addition,  displaying the signatures of the main cast at the end was an incredible and  fitting final tribute.
630518299X|5.0|'The Truman Show' is excellent - why it was overlooked for theAcademy Awards is totally beyond me.  This film tells the tale ofTruman Burbank (played by Jim Carrey) - a man who, unknown to him, lives in an enormous TV studio disguised as a town, and has his entire life televised 24 hours a day.  The territory is similar to 'Ed TV' and 'Pleasantville', but The Truman Show is the best of these three - more than a comedy, the film really shows the dark side of Truman's manufactured existence.  [Incidentally - in lots of ways this film reminds me of the sixties UK TV series 'The Prisoner' - both have a hero who is trapped on an island he can never leave] This is, for once, an intelligent Hollywood film.
B000002UDB|5.0|Unlike Sergeant Pepper (yes, that's the correct way to spell Sgt.) this is not an album built around a theme, but a collection of singles essentially.  The weak songs on the album are Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should  Know. The good song is the title track, and the rest are a 10 on a scale of  1-5.  I am the Walrus is my all time favorite song and with Strawberry  Fields takes you to a place so far into the depth of universal conciousness  it defies credulity.  These songs capture the imagination and takes it to a  world beyond the everyday one.  John was at his peak of genius here.  All  you Need is Love is the anthem of the '60s spirit, summing up the  collective feeling of millions at that time.  Fool on the Hill is a great  song of Pauls as well as Penny Lane (Pauls answer to Strawberry Fields).  Baby you're a rich man is a psychodelic (original spelling) rocker in that  world of higher awareness.  Some say it was about manager Brian Epstein  (listen for fade out &quot;Baby you're a rich fag Jew)  Hello Goodbye  stands on its own.  These songs are masterworks of cosmic genius.<br />  All I look forward to now is the death of Lennon's killer.
6304578458|4.0|John Cusack is devastatingly cool as the contract-killer-with-a-heart in this excellent film.  It's difficult to slot into a single category, as in contains elements of drama, action and romance - but it's mainly a comedy.   The killer-shrink exchanges are extremely funny, pre-dating the  similar-concept 'Analyze This' and the execrable 'Gun Shy' by a couple of  years.  There's quite a bit of unabashed hardcore violence and gore, but  what makes the film interesting is the human side Cusack brings to his  hitman - the dance hall scene full of wry, awkward social humour and the  scenes with his mother and psychiatrist are particularly good.
B00001SIES|2.0|While the songs on this album are decent, the album is much worse than it sounds. My complaints are really based on values and a need for musical integrity. Showbiz represents a major problem with many of today's  bands.<br />I just bought Showbiz, listened to the first 7 tracks, and  immediately returned it after being disappointed (or should I say  disgusted) by the blatant imitation of Radiohead. As they copy another  artist's affected lyrics and music, you can't help but find that the music  lacks, passion, inspiration and authenticity.  Tell us your own sad tales,  not sterilized versions of somebody else's.<br />Is the music scene really in  such a dismal state that we now pay bands to imitate another band's genius  and originality? Many musicians can imitate, but great ones break  boundaries. Radiohead believes this. If I were Thom Yorke, I would be  disheartened and scared by all the perfectly calculated,  &quot;Stepford-affected&quot; musicians that seem to have an unhealthy  desire to be Thom. At least Green Day waited 20 years before trying to  revive the punk scene.<br />Radiohead will have a new album soon. If you just  can't wait, and need a meth clinic fix to get you through the night, I  suppose this album will suffice.  But don't close your eyes, or you may be  tricked into thinking Radiohead lost their gift and released a mediocre  album.<br />Recommendation: Check out the latest albums from Catatonia and The  Charlatans!
6303407188|5.0|This black and white film by Tim Burton is based on the life (well, principally the 50s career) of Edward D. Wood Jr, the sci-fi B-movie purveyor often hailed as the worst director of all time.  The movie isn't  constrained by its roots in reality; Wood's real-life experiences  (transvesitism, a friendship with the aging Bela Lugosi, and a desire to  make some truly awful films) are so outlandish that they need no  embellishment.  But it still comes across as a Tim Burton film - the  picture opens with a slow-motion camera crawl across B-movie country (misty  swamps, underwater monsters, UFO sightings) with the credits inscribed on  graveyard headstones... then Criswell (Jeffrey Jones) rises from his coffin  to deliver an ominous introduction to the story.  Johnny Depp is in  effeminate mode here (a la Sleepy Hollow) but he plays Wood as an eternal  optimist; so much so that it's hard to equate Wood's eventual demise with  Depp's cheery portrayal.  As for Martin Landau - well, I pretty much forgot  it was him at all, he's so convincing as Bela Lugosi!
B00003CWL6|4.0|This is the story of a family's breakdown.  How the attitude the husband has adopted for years, just bowing his head and letting the wife &quot;wear the pants&quot; has kept a vision of this family as a happy one.<br />However,  one day Lester wakes up and realizes he no longer wishes to bow to his  wife.  Then all hell breaks loose.<br />This is the kind of movie you need to  watch several times so you can fully understand its meaning.<br />At the  beginning, it shocks you and you feel that you have watched enough.  But  once you have seen it, it really makes you think about the reason behind  all the events.<br />Both Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening are outstanding in  their roles, as well as the supporting actors.<br />This is a very good movie,  I recommend it to all.
6303212263|4.0|The video sleeve tagline for 'Superman: The Movie' claims: &quot;You'll believe a man can fly!&quot;.  Unfortunately, the special effects are so 70s that you almost certainly won't believe a man can fly... but you will  believe that Christopher Reeve is the ultimate screen Superman!  This film  ranked alongside Star Wars for me when I was a child - it's still a modern  classic, with Gene Hackman a far more impressive Lex Luthor than the recent  TV series could conjure up.  Get this tape for the Lois Lane helicopter  rescue scene!
B00000JFV9|5.0|Despite of the poor quality of the movie, Curtis showed a lot of people how to make a terrific soundtrack.  Every song is a gem especially &quot; Freddie's dead &quot; , &quot; Gimme your love &quot; and &quot; Junkie  chase &quot; .  GREAT music compiled with social awareness makes this CD  unique.  If you buy the special edition double CD package, you'll get the  full length junkie chase version and different versions of the great songs  included in the original soundtrack.  One of the best albums ever made !
630575067X|3.0|I couldn't have anticipated The Phantom Menace more - I waslooking for gossip and rumours for months before Episode I wasreleased at the cinema.  Was it worth it?  Yes and no.  Some of the effects in TPM are awesome - the Podracing scene, the climactic lightsaber duel, the Naboo battle scenes - and there are some classic Star Wars moments (Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon emerging with their lightsabers through a veil of smoke; the Jedi Council scenes on Coruscant).  Plus there are some great new vehicles, cities and alien species.  The downside of The Phantom Menace is the lack of any characters as good as Han, Luke or *Old* Ben from the original trilogy.  Good characters are essential for a good film, and here we just get Jar-Jar instead. Darth Maul is promising, but he's woefully underused and only has two lines of dialogue.  But it's a gripping yarn, and it leaves you thirsting for more - so roll on Episode II!
B0000025H4|5.0|I've listened to this one for fifteen years and never tire of it.  The sheer intensity just takes you along, and by the end, all your frustrations are vented.  Great for long drives where you can scream at the top of your  lungs.
B000003N89|5.0|This is Krall's best album to date.  Her appreciation for Nat Cole's early music is obvious and she has captured the essence of his remarkably elegant, but laid-back style.  Her delivery is rich with emotion yet  relaxed and full of fun.  Her piano interpretations are clean, precise and  without unnecessary enhancement. This is an album for those who like their  jazz straight-forward and unpretentious, yet full of melody and meaningful  lyrics.  Easy to listen to and a joy to behold.                 I've become  a fan!
B00000K2W1|5.0|This collection of Janis Joplin's greatest hits has the best songs. Janis Joplin's blues and unique voice make you fly high out of this world. The guitars are excellent specially in &quot;Summertime&quot;,  &quot;Maybe&quot; and &quot;Ball and Chain&quot; which has outstanding  keyboard works as well. The bass guitar is played with great skill  throughout the album. This album is a must for all Joplin's fans;  absolutely great album with a unique style of blues music.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Some say Pearl Jam are finished. Some say they went long ago when Vitalogy became the epitome of what Grunge had become - confused, muddled and dark. Some say they went with No Code, when the brash classic rock meets punk  anthems of Ten and Vs. flew out the back door in favour of  eastern-influenced singalongs such as Who You are and the rockers on it  seemed unfocussed. Some said they died with Yield.<br />No matter when people  say Pearl Jam 'died' or 'sold out' (and there is many a PJ fan who would  dispute that last comment to the day they die), the fact remains that Pearl  Jam have the potential to create some of most emotional, passionate and  beautiful rock music ever made. On this album, they get there.<br />The album  opens quickly, with Pete Townshend like riffs exploding into the speakers -  its 'I can see for Miles' except this time it breaks into rapid fire bass  and guitar - Breakerfall - the perfect opening for the album, and PJ  sounding in fine form. That moves quickly onto 'Gods Dice'- the perfect  one-two to floor this listener at the start of the album. Then comes the  jilted 'Evacuation' - the Matt Cameron penned piece, filled with sparkling  fills.<br />Then the album sparks into top gear. 'Light Years' follows - the  albums mix of the best of Pearl Jam over the past ten years - its Given to  Fly, Wishlist, Alive and Immortality all rolled into one and the result is  one of the most beautifully crafted pop songs ever made. Stunning. 'nothing  as it seems' continues in the same mold, all McCready wailing over the  strum of the acoustic.<br />Still only five tracks in, and already we're  knocked out by the sheer BEAUTY of the writing. 'Thin Air' recalls Daughter  but never plagiarises it, while Insignificance is possibly the best true  rock song PJ have written since their early days. A fullisade of riffs  crashes down before its the sparse Of the Girl - perhapsthe song that best  shows PJ's versatility. Grievance follows - the line 'Pledge my Grievance  to the flag' - proving PJ still have the political roots in them. Then weve  got the album closes - the lovely 'Sleight of Hand,' all aural texture, and  a quirky Vedder ballad on the ukelele. 'Parting Ways' sounds a little too  much 'Long Road' for my liking, but overall its a lovely ending to a  magnificent album. They haven't sold out. They're not dead. They always  have, and always will be, Alive.
B00004TDRD|5.0|JAWS is, in my opinion, one of the movies that saved Hollywood and revitalized the movie industry.  Speilberg and Lucas, along with a few others, sent America back to the movies.  <br />The movie includes an  assemblage of great actors.  The casting is superb, and the acting is  top-notch.  <br />The story line, though somewhat more difficult to believe  now than it was in the 1970s, still makes people think twice about getting  in the water.  The idea of being eaten alive by a huge animal that has  evolved into a perfect eating machine is one of the few things that  instills nearly universal feelings of horror among virtually everyone.    <br />The special effects (FX) support the character and plot development, but  the FX do not overpower the acting.  &quot;Bruce&quot; the huge shark  mechanical used in the movie actually takes on a character of its own, one  that develops as the story moves along.  <br />Main and supporting characters  are all outstanding...from the narrow-minded mayor all the way up to the  three primary characters who make up the majority of the movie on the  boat.<br />There is suspense, story line, acting, and nearly tactile horror  that grips you as you are drawn into this story.  If you have watched this  movie only on broadcast TV, do yourself a favor and watch the movie on  video or DVD for as close to the original experience as you can get.<br />A  true classic by an outstanding director, featuring an excellent cast.<br />As  for the faithfulness to Benchley's book, there are whole subplots that had  to be trimmed in order for the movie project to work.  But if you never  read the book you'd never know.  In either case, I recommend watching the  movie and then reading the book -- both are wonderful treats for anyone who  enjoys tales of the sea.<br />5 stars all the way!<br />I hope this review was  helpful to you -- Alan Holyoak
B000002UAO|5.0|While Sgt. Pepper is billed as the Beatles most influentual work, in my opinion Rubber Soul ( the U.K. version )  is the best Beatles album. Rubber Soul is the album where the Lennon / McCartney song writing starts to  mature, it starts to sound grown up. All the songs are great, not one  single filler among them, top notch.
6300183971|4.0|When I saw DUNE in 1984 a movie fact sheet was handed to each person as they entered the theater.  That sheet included a list of terms, almost a glossary to characters and other entities in the movie.  That didn't phase  me, but it really put off my brothers who went to see this movie with  me.<br />The glossary sheet was helpful as I waded through the first stages of  the movie.  There ought to be a similar list of terms, identities included  with the video/DVD for people who are first time viewers.  <br />When I first  saw the movie I hadn't read any of the books, and I'm glad that was the  case.  After I got oriented to what was happening in the show (with the  help of the guide I mentioned above) I thoroughly enjoyed the escapist  sci-fi adventure.  <br />I enjoyed the premis, the story line, and most of the  characters, though not all.  While most of the Harkonens were expertly  cast, the use of Sting was not the best casting choice for the part of  Feyd, though it did provide excellent publicity since Sting was hanging out  near the top of the music charts of the time.  I thought that the Atreides  were also cast well, especially the Duke and Lady Jessica.  This was the  first time I had seen Kyle MacLaghlin (sp? sorry), and I thought he did a  good job.<br />The movie prompted me to read DUNE, as well as the rest of the  DUNE series of books by Frank Herbert.  After reading the books and  re-watching this movie (several times) I still enjoyed it, but in a  different way -- as a synopsis reminder of the book rather than as a  serious replication of it.<br />Few movies can capture the same level of plot  and character development found in a book, and this movie was no different.   There were sections of the movie faithful to the book, and sections where  it was necessary to condense or omit material in order to put together a  movie that would fit into a time frame acceptable to most movie goers.<br />Is  this a 5-star movie -- I don't think so. Would I recommend it to a friend  -- Perhaps, depends on the friend.  This movie is best enjoyed by sci-fi  fans who enjoy sci-fi for the premis and the possibilities within stories.   If you are looking for a high-tech FX adventure, this movie does not  compare with 1990s offerings such as &quot;Armeggedon&quot; or &quot;Men in  Black.&quot;  If, however, you enjoy sci-fi for story lines and a challenge  in anticipating what will happen as the story moves along, this movie may  be for you.<br />4-stars for inconsistent casting and beginning scenes that  need serious concentration to make the rest of the movie fit into place.   If you miss the first 5-10 minutes of the show, rewind and start over!<br />A  recommended show for serious sci-fi fans.  <br />I hope this review was  helpful to you. <br />-- Alan Holyoak

6305075468|5.0|I first saw this movie as part of a classis film series in college.  CREEEEEEEPPPY!   When I saw this movie again it was just as creepy.  The vampire in this movie literally gives you chills just looking at him.  His  appearance is extremely atypical, compared to stereotyped vampires out  there these days.<br />I'm not a horror movie fan, but I highly recommend this  one.  It banks heavily on basic emotional impact and little on special  effects and the bells and whistles that many modern film makers dish out  and that many viewers expect.<br />Viewing this movie is a visceral  experience.  One you are not soon going to forget.  <br />Definitely 5  stars.<br />Alan Holyoak
0783242808|5.0|This movie is so funny. When I first saw it I laughed so hard I almost wet  my pants. I guarentee you will love this movie. If you don't enjoy this  movie i'll be very surprised.
B000002U9E|5.0|I am a new Kate Bush fan; discovering her a month ago.  I finally found out who did the song &quot;Running Up That Hill&quot; after hearing it on an internet radio station.   I went out and purchased this CD and I admit I  ended up liking all the songs.<br />In addition to her sweet-soprano voice,  she writes the lyrics and music to this CD.  There are unconventual musical  instruments used on this CD that you wouldnt expect for rock music that are  layered together.  It is recommended that the listener have a set of good  headphones to hear the melodies, the lyrics and her voice.<br />After  listening to &quot;Hounds Of Love&quot;, I have bought all her other CDs  and enjoyed them too.

B000004166|5.0|This outstanding Philips Duo compilation is a tremendous bargain for Mozart lovers.  It contains all five of  Mozart's violin concertos, and, in addition, his  Adagio for Violin and Orchestra (K. 261), Rondo for Violin  and Orchestra (K. 373), and Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and  Orchestra, (K. 364.)  The violin concertos are played by violinist Arthur  Grumiaux and the London Symphony Orchestra with breathtaking beauty and an  almost perfect classical simplicity and restraint, and convey a sense of  Mozartean elegance, virtuosity  and passion.  Grumiaux teams with the  Raymond Leppard and the New Philharmonia Orchestra for the  Adagio, Rondo  and Sinfonia Concertante (with Arrigo Pellica playing the viola.)  The  musical results are no less outstanding.  Also worth mentioning are the  liner notes, which combine an excellent historical overview of the  compositions with superb musical commentary.  They are among the best I've  ever found accompanying a classical CD.  This 2-CD set is an absolute  winner.  It belongs in every classical music lover's collection.
B00000IAU3|4.0|It only took those twenty seconds of music from the theme of Roswell High to catch my ear and set me off on a hunt for the full version. I was wary of buying the full album - too often I've found that the rest of the songs  don't live up to the promise. But in this case I was pleasantly surprised.  Dido's songs are well crafted affairs with strong choruses and melodies,  and given the right marketing many of these could be hits in their own  right. Her voice is fantastic too, great range and very powerful when she  wants to be. Somewhere between Beth Orton and Jerry Burns with a hint of  Dolores O'Riorden (of the Cranberries) thrown in. There's hardly a bad song  here. Curious, then, that she should remain an unknown. Maybe America has  heard of her, but judging by her accent I'd say she sounds British, so  what's happened to the marketing campaign in her home country? Even my copy  of the CD was imported from the USA! But never mind all that: How DO you  pronounce her name?
B00003RQNJ|5.0|I originatly rented this movie on CED videodisk a long time ago around 1981. I was turned off by the opening title sequence &quot;the silence movie on the wall&quot; I though this was introducing a 2hrs of bordeness.  But 20 years later i gave it a 2nd chance and realized that i judged this  movie by it cover... so the speak.... This movie gaved me a good lesson,  you have to watch the entire thing before you prononce it sentence. It's  funny, it got great taste, and I love Goerge Roy Hill's signature.. so much  that the next day I bought B.C.S.K. i went out and bought The sting.
0425129586|5.0|Unlike most mysteries you will read, this one will always stay with you.  Agatha Christie has surmounted the mystery form to provide a fascinating story of morality and immorality, in which justice plays an unusual hand.  The title nicely displays the mystery (which has a perfect plot from my  point of view).  And then there were none -- who did it?<br />Agatha  Christie wrote this in a spare and efficient way so that the story starts  moving immediately, and speeds up as you go.  It will be impossible to put  this book down once you start reading it.<br />As you can imagine from the  book's age and the author, this is a classic English murder mystery.  The  murders are there, but the blood does not overwhelm.  Violence and social  niceties nudge one another for your attention.  At the same time, there is  hope.  Agatha Christie adds her hope for the future in a most unusual way  in this novel, that will leave you encouraged for the future of humanity  after first causing you to despair.<br />One of the beauties of the plot is  that it expands on the famous locked room format to include an island where  there is no access or exit, nor any way to communicate.  That gives much  more room for interesting plot developments without losing any of the  intellectual puzzle of a locked room.<br />An unusual factor about this novel  is that you will soon find yourself identifying with the guilty victims  (even though you are not a murderer).  Usually, mystery novels have the  reader identifying with the innocents or the detective.  That is  accomplished by creating a gripping sense of paranoia as the numbers of  those on the island rapidly dwindle.<br />Don't miss this book!<br />After you  are done and have savored all of the book's brilliance, reflect a little  about how Agatha Christie explored stalled thinking about what was going on  to make the plot so effective.  Then think about all of those places in  your life and business where things may also not be what they seem.  If you  can use this insight to locate your misconception stalls, you will be  doubly blessed by reading this book.ey seem.  If you  can use this insight to locate your misconception stalls, you will be  doubly blessed by reading this book.
B000002H4C|4.0|When I was first interested in this CD, I first had to see the movie. It sure was worth it, being extremely adult-oriented material-filled, being a refreshing change from the usual Disney kid-stuff fluff. I was also quite  pleased to hear a few of my favorite actor's voices in the movie, like the  late John Candy himself must have portrayed half a dozen characters, as  well as Harold Ramis and John Vernon too. Back to the material on this CD.  Sammy Hagar's title cut begins the album rather nicely, then Devo's  &quot;Working In The Coal Mine&quot; remake is pretty funky. Did anyone  else notice that another Devo song &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; was  played by the band in the bar on one of the alien planets? I did. Further  on, Cheap Trick's &quot;Reach Out&quot; is possibly cooler sounding than  their hit &quot;I Want You To Want Me&quot;, which is featured on another  soundtrack which I will review later on. My two absolute favorites on this  CD have to be the former Eagles' guitarist Don Felder with &quot;Heavy  Metal (Takin' A Ride)&quot; and &quot;All Of You&quot;, both are simply  excellent to hear. &quot;Queen Bee&quot; by Grand Funk Railroad and Riggs'  &quot;Radar Rider&quot; are both pretty good too, then finally, &quot;Blue  Lamp&quot; by Stevie Nicks is able to round out this album rather well  musically. So, the known thing now know is that a 2000 version of both the  movie and the soundtrack will be released soon, I don't know if I'll be  interested in either, really. I gotta watch the movie again, anyway. Buy  this cool CD, it really rocks!
0425104052|5.0|Most Sherlock Holmes stories (especially the short stories like The Red Headed League) are like playing chess in a Victorian drawing room.  You get a period piece with some subtle moves.  The Hound of the Baskervilles is a  total change-up from that format.  Doyle builds the atmosphere of ancient  legends, foul play, and a dark moor in an irresistible way.  You will find  yourself looking out over your shoulder if you read this book on a dark,  lonely night.  So if you like a novel with a true gothic feel, this will be  your main reward.<br />Your unexpected reward will be one of the most famous  clues in all of detective fiction.  In searching out who is haunting the  Baskerville's, Doyle has Holmes solve the puzzle by looking for something  that is missing.  This is the only mystery that I know of that is solved by  vacuous fulfillment (an odd concept of mathematics that Doyle must have  known about).<br />The third feature of this story are the many fallacious  beliefs about how science works (like phrenology -- the shape of the skull  determining your mind and character).  You may find this interesting or  annoying.  In either case, try to remember that we probably have many  similar false beliefs today that will look silly a hundred years from now.  Can you think of one?<br />Wrap up in a blanket by the fire, have a glass of  wine, and enjoy!
0553573403|4.0|Martin writes an ugly breathtaker, a &quot;fantasy&quot; book without wizards and magical orbs, gods and flying lizards. Yet, the political intrigue is enough to bind your eyes to the fine print, and the constant  war, upheaval and death are charaters in their own right. The plot is  complicated, but thankfully, not difficult to follow, and the characters  seem to truly come alive - as our companions, or as hated foes, or  (usually) both; the moral greyness is remarkable and lifelike. It's not a  typical fantasy book either: the main characters keep dying abruptly (or  not), and there isn't really a central &quot;quest&quot; for any  &quot;hero&quot; (yes, both missing) to run after. Definitely enjoyable.  Slight problem might be that the central characters keep making very stupid  decisions, and indeed, the choices that the Starks make in resolving  crucial matters seem consistently incorrect. Further, the children are  blessed with uncommonly good sense and unlikely resourcefulness right from  age 8: more than a little difficult to take in. Other than those and a few  more minor complaints that I forget, this book comes recommended.
B000000H40|5.0|.....best death metal record i ever heard. stick your fangs in and enjoy!
B000002UY5|5.0|Blind Melon is one of those bands that just up a disappeared. Even though they are no longer around(from the death of shannon) they should still be remembered by everyone; if you just want so music to sit back and listen to  while your looking at the world this is the perfect band and this is their  best recording.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I've been listening Enigma for the last 10 years, and it's incredible that I can overplay it over and over again and never get annoyed. On the contrary, sadeness stay on my mind all day long, and I'm not crazy...<br />I  simply love the first album, but screen behind the mirror is amazing, even  better. My favourite classical song is carmina burana, and listen to its  samples in this cd is awesome! The lyrics in silence must be heard is  terrific, and make me feel relaxed and at the same time thoughtful.  Delightful songs! The best of enigma ever! Now, I'm anxious to see what  will be the next move of Cretu and his band...
0684872153|5.0|This book was interesting in a horrifying way.  It's a book that you can't put down, yet it's very depressing.  AA is a story of love, poverty, hunger, alcoholism, faith, religion, and social structure.  It is very  touching and at times infuriating.  It is absolutely heartbreaking to think  of children suffering, and that is a huge chunk of this book.  As sorry as  I felt for the McCourt children, I felt even sorrier for Frank's childhood  friend Paddy who had never tried a sandwitch and pronounced it  &quot;sandwidge.&quot;  Paddy's mispronouncing that word is a perfect  example of the way AA makes you feel:  Bittersweet.

B00000J7J4|5.0|Loved it nice to have Santana back and yes it have change but how can the offer new song without offering a new style.  So in defenitive like it all past and present.  It show a great alternative to my kid and show them what  their Dad was listening and might push them to go for his past music too.
6305807086|5.0|I saw this movie by accident, I just walked by in the video store and decided to give it a try.  I did not expect it to be one of those movies that make you re-examine yourself and your surroundings.  Watching this  movie is like an acid trip and it is amazing, and I recommend it to anyone  who wants to think deep.
158234082X|4.0|Not for the squeamish, indeed.  There are certainly some stomach-churning moments. There is, as well, laugh out loud hilarity, wry observation, practical admonition, and life lessons learned.  The language is rough,  yes; but so is life.  And one can't help but admire a guy who comes through  &quot;the wilderness&quot; into his own.  This is a story of personal  growth as well as a rollicking ride through the behind-the-scenes and  mise-en-place restaurant world.
044022165X|5.0|The Rainmaker,<br />John Grisham<br /> The Rainmaker is another legal thriller from the master of legal suspense, John Grisham.   It has been praised by many newspapers, and fellow authors.  It is the story of a young  prosecutor, Rudy Baylor, fresh out of law school.  After being fired from  his first job, he is forced to live in the attic of one of his clients.   After he stumbles upon a case that could make him f amous, he gets to work.   A middle-age couple has been screwed over by an insurance company, who  will not give them the money for a lifesaving operation for their son.   Baylor is their lawyer, and he is up against some of the biggest names in  law,  including the ones that fired him.  Although it gets a little long in  the middle, this a great book, one of Grishams best.
0452282195|3.0|First of all this is the first Toni Morrison book I have read.  I also have not read very much literature.  I enjoyed the book entirely.  I feel I missed some important points along the way though.  It is difficult when  the story bounces around quite a bit.  The afterword was a help.  Thanks.   It takes plenty of patience to get through this book.  A second reading  would probably be a benefit for me.  I am hoping when Oprah has her book  club dinner, a few more things will be cleared up.  Now I know what it  takes to get a Nobel Prize..
079284470X|5.0|Granted, this movie will never be considered a &quot;Classic&quot;, nor will it be ever used as an example of superior movie-making of the 1980's.  <br />That stuff isn't important, though.  What is important is that this was  a sweet love story and an entertaining movie that real people enjoy.<br />I  have watched this video repeatedly - almost time to get a fresh copy - and  still am not bored with it.<br />Andrew McCarthy and Kim Cattrell have a  wonderful chemistry that really works.  You can't help but root for them to  be together.<br />Taking the critic's side for one moment, the outcome of many  of the incidents in the movie are predictable.  The story is simple and the  premise far-fetched.  However, where is it written that good movies have to  be mentally challenging and unpredictable?  Where is it also written that  movies have to have a story that is conceivable in real-life (aren't some  of the greatest stories in history based not on fact, but mythology?)<br />If  you are one of those intellectual types who can't appreciate entertainment  for entertainment's sake, then this isn't the movie for you.<br />If, on the  other hand, you want a nice, sweet, simple love story that keeps you  laughing and entertained for 1 1/2 hours, then this movie is for you.
B00004SCX6|4.0|Britney &quot;did it again&quot;! She has released an amazing album. All the songs were recorded with only one flaw. Some of the songs seem to have the same music as her other &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; songs. Overall  an amazing performance by Britney. Some people reading this may think I'm  crazy and have no clue what I'm talking about. The only thing I can say is  this is a teen pop album, not for most adults. Probably my favorite song is  Stronger. It's so up beat and has a great tune. Also Lucky is a great song  because it is almost like a story. It is a little sad what the girl is  going through though. If you like performer like Christina Aguleria,  Backstreet Boys, 'Nsync, things like this I think you'll really like it.  The cover and interior picture are a nice extra for the cd. Something that  people find annoying is the occasional talking from Britney, I think it  adds a nice flare to the music. I highly recomend this. It is no Oops.

0671015206|5.0|This book, changed my conception of what it was to be wealthy. I always had thought that wealth was represented by Rolls Royce's, Patek Philippe watches, expensive houses etc etc etc. This book will blow your mind, if  you believe these things represent wealth.<br />The premise of the book, is  that there are usually 3 kinds of &quot;rich&quot; people, the super rich  that can afford the absolute luxuries without problem, the ones who look  wealthy, the cars, lifestyle etc, but have nothing in the bank, they are  all front, and the ones who are wealthy but live simple non dazzle  lifstyles.<br />What this book teaches the student of wealth, is that to look  wealthy is not the same as being wealthy. Looking wealthy is a falacy, that  can lead you to finacial ruin. Throughout the book it gives real life  examples. What would you prefer a new Rolls Royce, or a 5 year old Rolls  but an addtional $50,000 in the bank from the savings you make on buying  second hand? The upfront keep up with the Jones's will buy the new one, the  true millionaire will buy the older car, and invest the saved capital and  make money on the investment. Capital should not be spent, only intrest off  the capital should be spent on depreciating luxury items.<br />This book has  changed my life. I lived a life of &quot;luxury&quot; believing that I  could afford it. This book gave me a diffrent perspective on wealth, and my  competitve spending stopped, and my wealth has soared. I now live 50% under  my wage, instead of 100% of my wage. I love saving and investing money,  instead of spending. I know that wealth is not about lifestyle, but what is  truely in the bank.<br />The book must be read in conjunction with, The  Richest Man In Babylon, The Greatest Salesman in the World and The Science  of Getting Rich.<br />This is a book that could be used by a marketing guru,  on how to sell products to the 3 social classes mentioned, or it can be  used by the aspiring rich. Used by those who aspire wealth it will show  them that flash lifestyles can create finacial ruin. Prudence, sacrafice  and wise investing can make a millionaire out of anyone. The keys are in  this book.
B00004T8RK|4.0|There can be written a lot about this new album, but my advise is: Just sit back and enjoy this almost-masterpiece...
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of The Moon is absolutely exceptional. If you want the greatest experince of classic rock, this is the CD to buy. Not one song is bad on this CD. It's like a great best of CD except better. You will absolutely  love this. I know I did, and so did the Bilboard top ten, since it has been  in the top ten charts ever since it came out,and is the best selling rock  album ever.
0684833395|5.0|Catch-22, the ironic rule that keeps Yossarian and his fellow men in his squadron in the war. They are all crazy in their only special little ways, each fighting their own battle for freedom.  Yossarian knows their all  crazy; he knows he must get out, not for a loved one or for just the hatred  of war itself. Yossarian fears for his life, he fears it every time he  climbs aboard his bomber.  Some man fly for patriotism and others fly  because it needs to be done; the younger men believe war is a great and fun  thing.  When they do fly many do not come back, as Yossarian can testify.  Before his eyes he has seen many of his comrades die, which only depletes  what is left of his sanity. The squadron's lack of sanity is at most times  the source of great humorous occasions. From Milo's crazy antics of buying  and selling of merchandise to Major Major's rules, the laughs far outnumber  the moments of tears. Heller uses such great detail to bring the reader to  the limits of sadness, and the characters means to dealing with it are the  craziest of all. The book is a great read, it offers so many great lessons  to be learned and to be taught to further generations. As I began to read  it I was unaware of how the book had touched the minds of some many people  before me.
0385495315|5.0|Ever since I saw Derek Jacobi in the play Breaking the Code (about Alan Turing and his Enigma code-breaking), I've been interested in codes.  Singh is a great story teller and this book is as engrossing as the latest  Grisham novel.  I happen to like how he leads us right into the internet  cryptology process which is must reading for anyone who has ever ordered a  book on Amazon!  By the end of this book, you'll understand the mechanics  behind a &quot;secure transaction.&quot;  I can't wait to read his book on  Fermat.

B00003CWOL|5.0|Kevin Smith is definetly one of Hollywoods future mega - men. Dogma, which was protested against by certain religious groups, is a film with a statement. With a delivery in pure fun and entertainment. It brings up good  points about the flaws in things we have been spoon fed since childhood.  This film begs the question, why do we believe all this stuff set by man?  It does not abandon God, it shows us true faith (or an idea) is in us. We  can't have faith in the many beliefs that cause war and animocity. That  can't be what was intended.  As with all Kevin Smiths scripts all issues  are presented in a brilliant humourous light. Even the simplest of jokes  are executed with concise thought and delivery. This is definetly worth  adding to any DVD collection.
B000002B30|5.0|This is a great listening experience.  From the hard-rockin' roots of &quot;Born to Run&quot; to the soulful, introspective side in songs like &quot;Secret Garden&quot; and &quot;Streets of Philadelphia,&quot; this CD  has it all.<br />Sure, every great song Bruce has recorded isn't  here...frankly, that takes the boxed set.  But a great selection is here.   And as a younger fan, I was excited to hear some of the great songs of his  early albums that I hadn't heard before...like The River.<br />The highlight,  here, is the liner notes...with a note from Bruce about each song.  A great  chance to look into his mind, and see what he was thinking at the time of  each song.<br />This is a great, great CD...and it belongs in the collection  of every rock fan.
0684874350|5.0|This book is one of my favorite's . The book is about a family that goes through  Irish hard ships.  The main character in this story is a little boy and his brother Malachy. This family finds that they can't make it in  America so  they move to Ireland.They also face many deaths within the  family. They  also have battled many sicknesses including  typhoid fever. I  liked that there was always new  problems arising. Yet there were the  problems that hung over the there heads the whole book. This book was the  winner of the Pulitzer Prize. Overall I think this was the best book I've  ever seen.
B00000J7J4|4.0|The great thing about this album is that, from track to track, it moves through so many different musical genres. This helps keep the interest and makes the five spanish songs actually stand out. Here are the tracks: 1.(DA  LE) YALEO: This is an excellent spanish song. The guitar solos and drum  beats are wonderful. Great stadium rock. 2.LOVE OF MY LIFE (ft. Dave  Matthews): This slow love song has a great feel to it. The jumping vocal  acrobatics by Matthews certainly help this song take off. 3.PUT YOUR LIGHTS  ON (ft. Everlast): This is a great, gritty rock song. Everlasts vocals  sound so much more intimidating when they are laced with Carlos' excellent  guitar. 4.AFRICAN BAMBA: This has a very addicting spanish chant that is  repeated over and over (ella baila la Portugueza). It's pretty good.  5.SMOOTH (ft. Rob Thomas): What can I say about this song that hasn't  already been said? It's simply a terrific song, and the best on the album.  6.DO YOU LIKE THE WAY (ft. Lauryn Hill &amp; Cee-Lo): Don't expect to hear  any real chorus to this rap song, but it is a nice, diverse track and any  rap with spanish guitar in the background is cool. 7.MARIA MARIA (ft.  Wyclef Jean &amp; The Product G&amp;B): This is the best work that Wyclef  has ever done. This is a really good track, the vocals are really good and  the beat is very addictive. 8.MIGRA: This spanish song has really excellent  drum beats and hand claps and even though it's in a different language it's  still very catchy. A good dance song. 9.CORAZON ESPINADO (ft. Mana): This  sounds like a standard latin song but Carlos has a way of making it sound  fresh and very catchy. I didn't think I'd like it, but I did. 10.WISHING IT  WAS (ft. Eagle-Eye Cherry): Cherry's voice fits this song very well. It's  really quite good, doesn't sound like the rest of the album. 11.EL FAROL:  This is the first of two instrumental tracks. I swear that I've heard this  song before. Anyway, it's kinda boring but okay. 12.PRIMAVERA:We sang this  one in my Spanish Class :)! This is a really cool latin song and, again,  very catchy. 13.THE CALLING (ft. Eric Clapton): The second and more boring  of the instrumental tracks. I wouldn't choose it to end the album. It's  almost eight minutes long.
0060977493|4.0|A story which only notice things, not judge them. <br />It reminds us, the small things, which could have changed our life, in their own special way.

0553260111|5.0|Ludlum surpasses not only himself but all other spy thriller writers for all times to come. I started in 1977 with Scarlatti Inheritance and have ever since been hooked to Ludlum. But Bourne Identity exploded on me like  no other book or experience I had. It is more than a spy story or about a  person called Bourne trying to fight tremendous odds with a total memory  loss with bursts of  memory flashes of the violent past with layers of  different personalities. It is about human mind itself discovering its way  using the ultimate training of the past to protect it and achieve the  objective imprinted in the psyche. The events will linger forever in the  mind and you will be hungry to read another book which can match this book.  Yes! Read it ,Enjoy it and be haunted by it.
B00000J7JO|5.0|I absolutely loved this cd! The songs are great because they are filled with feeling and emotion! This definately makes up for Anthony's HAIR DILEMMA!
B00000269M|5.0|BAD is a masterpiece of music-making!  Its 10 original tracks, from BAD to Smooth Criminal, all have awsome rythmic qualities and all-round great sound!  Its bonus track, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot;, is also good for a  listen, though it isn't nearly as powerful as the rest of the album's  contents.  In my opinion, BAD surpasses Thriller in all dimensions  including: melodies, rythms, and all-round musical sound.  By saying this,  of course, Thriller is the second best album of Jackson's.  The best song,  musically and meaningfully, on BAD is &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot;.  This  track lets us hear Michael's powerful vocal abilities and lets us know that  to make the world a better place, people should look to change themselves  first.  If there is one album that you purchase in the near future, it  should be this one.  Congrats to Michael Jackson on providing his fans with  a great piece of art!
B00000637V|5.0|The greatest album ever made?.....If it doesn't quite achieve this title then it's clawing its way in at second place. Few pieces of music touch a nerve blissfully then Reed's masterpiece. Lush orchestrations and gritty  stories of abuse and torment mix well to give the listener a sonic film  noir. Sit back, tune in and don't let those screaming kids keep you awake  all night. A work of beauty and passion. What the hell... &quot;IT IS THE  GREATEST ALBUM EVER!  EVER! &quot;
0679746048|5.0|I could not put this novel down after I started it, and ended up finishing it almost entirely in one sitting.  Kaysen delivers a wonderful novel filled with insightful and intelligent remarks.  For me, the book almsot  read like I was having a conversation with kaysen herself, and she was  re-counting an experience that changed her life.  Read it, and then read it  again.  It's a book that is more than worth the cost.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Wow!  I was a little bit taken aback when I first listened to the album. Different but familiar. The first four songs are &quot;funky&quot; as Brit wants to describe them. But the  power and talent of her pure voice show in  these cuts and really take off with &quot;Don't let me be the last to  know&quot; and &quot;Lucky&quot; (My two favorites)and totally for the  whole album.<br />You just can't go wrong with this young Lady's talent.
B0000021RL|4.0|This was the last Chicago album I really loved, the last one that I can name the contents of without looking. True, the seeds of decline are here-- you can hear the band discovering the formula for the mooshy ballads that  would become their bread and butter. But there's also some kicking  excitement-- &quot;Skinny Boy&quot; with the Pointer Sisters is worth the  price of admission all by itself.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is by far the best ever recorded album by Nirvana. Kurt is so cool I love him. This was the first album i ever heard of his and from the first moment I heard it I loved it. I don't know how I could have ever lived without hearing this album it rocks!  <br />Thanks Nirvana I love  you guys!
B0000021RD|5.0|This is the album that success nearly destroyed. To make singles out of some of this material, the cuts were butchered inexcusably. Hear &quot;Colour My World&quot; and &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; as they were  meant to be heard, a parts of some great album writing. The horn players  are still well-used here, with some nice solo work all around, and there  are some absolutely exquisite instrumentals. Even thirty years later, much  of this album sounds wonderfully fresh and non-formulaic; the range is  likewise impressive, from rocking to sweet. And the cornball lyrics that  often weakened Chicago's work manage to stay out of the way here. This is  the must-have cd in the Chicago catelog.
0140186409|4.0|The Great Depression and the 'Dust Bowl', two of the worst disasters to strike our nation in the last hundred years.  The author, John Steinbeck, takes a chance at creating a story to properly convey the story of millions of migrant farmers kicked off their land during this period in the 1930s.  He succeeded through the Joad family.  Trying to create a new and better  life, the Joads leave their Oklahoma home and travel to the land of  promise, California.  The travel to and throughout the state provides the  perfect setting for a story of the terrible injustices and obstacles that  migrant workers of the time faced.  The main problem that many will have  with the novel is the pacing of the story for the first 20 or so chapters.  Not without its bright spots, the first chapters although good, can be  terribly slow.  It took much willpower to keep reading this classic.  Another contributing factor is Steinbeck's intermittent chapters, through  which he giving a sort of social commentary.  The chapters seem to take  away from the story by destroying the pacing of the novel.  Although these  two characteristics didn't suit me, I am glad that I kept reading.  The  book is a surefire classic.  While in some places overly symbolic, the  novel tells such a great story, and is told in such a fashion, that you  can't help but sit and think after reading the last words.  I am writting  this review directly after that period of thinking.  I strongly recommend  this book to anyone willing to think.  And to dig deeply into their minds  and souls to review what images and feelings that the book has imposed on  them. I am a freshman in high school and the book is required reading for  my class.  The sad thing is that this wonderful story is lost on many of my  classmates.  As can be seen through my classmates reference to reading the  'yellow and black-striped' version. :-)
B0000021RB|4.0|Folks who are only familiar with the radio fodder that was to come, this album will come as a surprise. Raw, rugged, and gutsy, with cuts that take plenty of time to explore ideas instead of chopped down three-minute hits,  and some of the best guitar and horn work of its time (When I started out  playing trombone, I wanted to be James Pankow when I grew up). And thanks  to cd technology, none of us need ever listen to &quot;Free Form  Guitar&quot; again.
0380973634|4.0|If Charles Dickens and Lewis Carroll got rip-roaring drunk and collaborated on a novel, the results would probably be quite similar to Neil Gaiman's Neverwhere. Allusive, witty, and wildly imaginative, this is  one of the best fantasy novels I've in a while. Is it THE best? No, that  honor still has to go to The Lord Of The Rings. Is Gaiman capable, with a  little more practice, of writing something that good? Uh, look out,  Mr.Tolkien...
B00004T1HK|3.0|I really like Britneys first CD, so as soon as I heard about the second, I rushed out and bought it. I was expecting similar music to before but her style and her voice have changed so much. I prefere her voice to before but  the style has got worse. Especially songs like Stronger, you can really  hear the synthisizer twisting and distorting her voice. Fortunatly, Britney  has started to co-write some music which I think will make a difference  when she gets better at doing it. Here is my quick review of the  CD<br />1)Oops!...I did it Again: Good song, similar to baby one more time,  her voice sounds more mature though. The talking in the middle is  corny(very)<br />2)Stronger: Again not a bad song, but the synthisizer wreaks  some of it. The lyric &quot;My loneliness ain't killing me no more&quot;,  the opersite to baby one more time.<br />3)Don't go knocking on my Door: Not  the most inspiring of tunes. the introduction to the next song is bung on  the end of this track(strange! )<br />4)Can't get no Satisfaction: Classic  makeover. I its a touchy subject but I think she did it pretty  well.<br />5)Don't let me be the last to know: This song reminds me of ABBA  despite the slightly oriental opening chord sequence. Good song.<br />6)What U  see is what U get: Cool song. Its powerfull, full and suits her voice.  Can't really fault it.<br />7)Lucky: Cheesy introduction. A bit pointless song  but its definatly a song about Britney herself. I do like the extra voices  in the middle.<br />8)One Kiss from You: Good song, some nice harmonies and  chord sequences. The ending is unconvincing<br />9)Where Are you Now: My  favorite song at the moment. A soothing, mellow tune which has been  brilliantly writen. Can't fault it.<br />10)Can't make You Love Me: Sounds too  much like Oops!... Still, its not a bad song. Most people will be able to  identiy with the lyric at some point.<br />11)When Your Eyes say it: The first  half minute is all talking! I didn't buy this CD to listen to Britney  talking.<br />12)Girl in the Mirror: She must have done a lot of work on her  voice. There are some really strong vocal passages it this. Good base line  to this too.<br />13)Dear Diary: The only song Britney had a part in writing.  Not bad for a first attempt. Completely original subject(not). The shortest  track on the CD.
B000021XS0|5.0|This was the first Dream Theater album that I have ever listened too.  The music on this album is amazing and I love the story that is being told.  This is absolutuly the best rock opera since The Who's Tommy.  The  musicians in Dream theater are world class as well.  Mike Portnoy is one of  the best drummers that I have ever listened too (his double-bass work is  mind-boggling) while Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci are masters of their  instuments and by being a bass player myself I absolutely love the way that  John Myung plays.  This album has already gone right towards the top of my  collection.
6300213668|1.0|Newton-john lost her lawsuit (as usual) to try to get more money from this stupid movie.  I guess the courts don't think she's so great.  And well... this movie is what the title says it is- total trash.  The Grease reunion  was a bunch of old worn out people trying to act young again- it was really  pathetic.  I hope kids these days have something more to aspire to than the  idiots in this film.
B00000D9TQ|5.0|This album has almost all of the great hits from Phil Collins.  It includes two of my favorite songs, &quot;Another Day In Paradise&quot; and &quot;Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now).&quot;  Phil isn't skimpy  with the hits.  He includes a new song, a decent remake of Cyndi Lauper's  &quot;True Colors&quot; (with Babyface on backing vocals, not too shabby-a  good appeal to the AC crowd), and some lesser known '90's hits such as  &quot;Both Sides&quot; and &quot;Dance Into The Light.&quot;  The album  shines from beginning to end, containing the hits that get played over and  over again on adult contemporary stations and more.  This album is can't  miss for the Phil Collins fan.  For those that aren't fans of Phil Collins,  why even waste the money buying his greatest hits...and don't spoil the  great time for the rest of us...

B00000IGGA|5.0|7 long years in the making, this is Waits' 1st album since 1993's BLACK RIDER. Here, Waits picks up with an album divided between the extremes of barnstorming surrealism & sepia toned,world weary balladry. Naked Jezebel's have axes to grind, Giants weep in the middle of the road & black elevators go down. Yet, throughout it all there's still a yearning to be in \\"Evelyn's kitchen with old Gyp by my side\\".     Raucous numbers like \\"Big In Japan\\" & \\"Filipino Box-Spring Hog\\" have Waits summoning the ghosts of Howling Wolf & Captain Beefheart with all the conviction of a backwoods preacher. \\"Get Behind The Mule\\" is a one chord meditation right in keeping with classic dirges like \\"Murder In The Red Barn\\" & \\"Gun Street Girl\\". A work song slightly left of the chain gang tradition.    Waits offers up another hilariously ominous spoken word piece in \\"What's he Building In There?\\". Whatever it is, \\"it isn't a playhouse for the kids\\".    As for the ballads, MULE seems to have a generous assortment. \\"Take It With Me\\" is among the most wry & poignant. \\"Picture In A Frame brings the songs of Stephen Foster to mind. \\"Pony\\" draws on old cowboy ballads & \\"House Nobody Lives In\\" is easily the album's most unabashedly sentimental number. The likes of Bruce Springsteen are put to shame with the woeful optimism of \\"Hold On\\". But the true-life murder ballad, \\"Georgia Lee\\" proves to be the most devastating of the lot with it's haunting refrain, \\"why wasn't God watching\\".    Where \\"Chocolate Jesus\\" & \\"Eyeball Kid\\" capture Waits at his most playful, numbers like \\"Black Market Baby\\" & \\"Lowside Of The Road\\" keep things firmly on the dark side.     The rousing Gospel of \\"Come On Up To The House\\" pulls the curtain with such sage advice as, \\"come down off the cross, we could use the wood\\".    Though MULE VARIATIONS may not prove to be Waits' most groundbreaking album, it's certainly a welcome return. A dust-in-your-eye travelogue set in the wastlands just beyond the rusty scrapyard of The Blues.
B00003CX5A|5.0|Unquestionably one of Tim Burton's best films to date.  Burton is, of course, the greatest living film director, and Sleepy Hollow lives up to his standard of beautiful film making.  If you havn't seen this film, you  have no business watching movies.  Burton is the God of film making.

0425170349|3.0|I found this book a good read - just like all the other Tom Clancy novels and I have read most of them - but being from Australia I found myself huffing at the lack of accurate detail about Australia and the Olympics.  I  understand the book was written some time before the Olympics was due to  happen and well before the release date of 1999 (obviously) but it wouldn't  have been that hard, surely, to find out a little bit of information about  Australia's political and police structures before writing it into the  book.  Bill Henrikson flew from Sydney to Canberra for a meeting which  should have taken place in Sydney with the New South Wales police  commissioner and authority being granted from New South Wales' Olympics  Minister!   I enjoyed the book despite the fanatical Americans are the  best attitude but the lack of correct detail on Australia - which would  have taken five minutes on the phone or the net to get right - was a bit  hard to swallow.
B00004T8RK|5.0|Though marred somewhat by duds like the forgettable \\"Breakerfall\\" and the raucous \\"Evacuation,\\" Binaural is overall an excellent disc punctuated with fantastic songs like \\"Insignificance\\", \\"Thin Air\\" and \\"Light Years,\\"  arguably among the band's best ever. Fans may be disappointed at the  album's glaring lack of solid, hard-hitting tunes like \\"Evenflow\\" and  \\"Alive\\" which put Pearl Jam on the map nearly a decade ago, but the band's  goal has since been to slow the roller-coaster of its premature success and  to lower its profile in order to explore its creative dimensions. Binaural  is far more varied, with the song-writing duties split more evenly between  the band's members, and much more of an exploration than its predecessors;  brooding, introspective songs like the album's single \\"Nothing As It Seems\\"  and Vedder's solo ukelele tune \\"Soon Forget\\" transmit the band's artistic  message. Though the angst-ridden, tragic melodies of \\"Black\\" and \\"Daughter\\"  may be forever in the past, Binaural gives Pearl Jam a chance to finally  break away from the mainstream and say what they have to say and clearly  shows why they are one of the very few alternative/grunge bands to have  survived the 90's.
B00000K3CR|4.0|Tom Hanks is great in this comedy. I grew up watching this movie as a child, and as each year I watched it with my family and as I matured, I found different things to laugh at and different things to understand. It's  a great comedy that also stars Robert Loggia, Elizabeth Perkins, and Jon  Lovitz. Great movie, see it for sure.
B00004T8RK|5.0|I just can't stop listening to this album.  &quot;Light Years&quot; is breath-takingly beautiful.  Every song is glorious.
0783231482|5.0|This is the story of the Blues Brothers. Jake (John Belushi) has just gotten out of jail, his brother Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) is taking him in. Together they try to get their band &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; back  together. But complications arise with a police officer (John Candy) a  crazy ex-girlfriend (Carrie Fisher), a mad bar owner (Charles Napier) and a  group of Nazi. A classic comedy with memorable lines. The sequel isn't as  good, and is only for die-Hard Blues Brothers fans who don't care about the  quality in film. I give the sequel two stars.
0767830555|4.0|Taxi Driver is one of the most important film in the American cinema of  the 70's . Also, after almost a quater of a century after its release, it  still is an exciting as well as  horryfing experience to see it. What is  discribed in this movie is still chillingly true in our days.     For  Scorsese fans, the Criterion Laser Disc was long thought to be a must-have  item. The transfer used in this new DVD looks quite different from the  Criterion version which was surpervised by cinematographer Michael Chapman.  Frankly, the LD looks better than the DVD, or at least it's more beautiful.    The rich colors of the Chapman-trasnfer is not on the DVD. The color looks a  bit desaturated and often off-balanced. For instance, in daylight interior scenes like the lelection campaign office,  what you see outside the windows are simply too blue. It looks more contrasty and  you loose certain details in the shadow area.   But I do not dislike this  transfer: while the Chapman-trasnfer makes Travis' Urban Hell look a bit  sexier, Hell's Kitchen in this version is tough, gritty and merciless. The  desaturation of colour employed on the notorious \\"blood bath\\"  sequence is more effective in this transfer (By the way, Chapman himself disliked the effect, so apparently he tried to minimize it on his supervised trasnfer). If you have the chance to see  the film on screen with a good print, the effect is devastating (Scorsese  applied the same technique in Bringing Out the Dead, this time throughout  the entire picture) .    The DVD also features an insightful series of  interviews from the filmmakers including Scorsese, writer Paul Schrader,  Michael Chapman, Robert De Niro and the other cast member, and the special  make-up creator Dick Smith. The interviews with the supporting cast,  especially the one with Albert Brooks (who played the presidential election  campaign worker) is particullary interesting.    Another interesting function  is that you can compare the film with the screenplay simultanously, and  understand how Scorsese preserved the structure of Schrader's script while  filling in more details that makes the characters and the story alive. This  DVD is really worth buying if you like the movie. You can see it  repeatedly, and learn a great deal about how it was made. But I think  Criterion should re-issue their version (with audio commentary by Scorsese  and Schrader) on DVD as well (and also Raging Bull).
B00001ZULV|4.0|Well this album has caused a lot of controversy between Genesis fans (of course, a lot of things can get Genesis fans to argue!).  Anyway, you can almost think of Genesis as two different bands: pre-Hackett and  post-Hackett.  Pre-Hackett albums were progressive with only a pinch of pop  thrown in.  Post-Hackett is just the opposite.  So, basically, this album  is the greatest hits from the &quot;second&quot; Genesis.  Sure, the  &quot;first&quot; Genesis had great songs, but the great songs the first  Genesis had aren't &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; material.  Did King Crimson  ever make a Greatest Hits package targeted to the average music fan?  How  about Gentle Giant?<br />Anyway, if you like the Gabriel-era more than the  Collins-era, then (odds are) you have every Gabriel-era album, and you  don't need a Greatest Hits package.  This album wasn't made for  &quot;Proggies&quot;.  So don't complain.  <br />And feel free to put as many  &quot;Not Helpful&quot;  votes as you want.  After all, I've seen people  get &quot;Not Helpful&quot; votes just cos they said they're &quot;not all  that interested in Genesis's earlier works&quot; or cos they criticized the  two Gabriel-era Genesis songs.  Hey, not everyone on the planet is gonna  like &quot;The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway&quot;;  live with it!
B00000JCB2|5.0|This CD was great! Although my mom didn't like it  because it is a CD younger generations would appreciate more.Yeah it does have explicit lyrics,it just make the song more entertaining! I love Fred Durst so this  may be a little biased. People will have to listen to the songs  provided,because  everyone has different opinions. All I have to say is  that I think this CD rocks!
0312853238|3.0|This book is quite good. Dealing with a war against an alien race, mankind is forced to desperate measures in order to win a war against them. Using children that show the necessary potential to fight the war, they are  trained at a very early age in simulated combat, the hope being that one of  them has what it takes to lead Earth's space fleets against the enemy.  <br />It is an interesting book, especially the description of the games in  the Battleroom that the children have to fight as part of their training (a  form of futuristic laser tag) as a prelude to remotely controlling  spaceships.  Deception is rife, as not surprisingly at every level, people  are not totally honest about what is really going on. The ultimate irony  may be, as what seems to be a fight for survival may have more to do with a  lack of understanding on both sides that comes far too late and that the  war may not have been needed in the first place. Much like real  life.<br />Well worth a look, though in my opinion, the parts dealing with the  training are the best parts of the book.
B000002UAO|5.0|By the time they recorded &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; The Beatles were an unstoppable sensation with classics like &quot;I Want to Hold Your Hand,&quot; &quot;She Loves You,&quot; and &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;  under their belt.  &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; however, marked the band's  first foray into the arty pop that would make up the bulk of their later  efforts.<br />&quot;Drive My Car&quot; and the brilliant, lesser-heard  &quot;You Won't See Me&quot; are certainly of the pure pop ilk, ditto for  &quot;What Goes On&quot; and &quot;I'm Looking Through You.&quot;  And  while these songs are all among rock's finest compositions, a more mature,  forward-thinking spirit inhabits the likes of &quot;Nowhere Man,&quot;  &quot;I'm Looking Through You,&quot; and &quot;Wait.&quot;   Three of the  Beatles' finest ballads are featured as well (in fact, they're two of rock  music's finest ballads), &quot;Michelle,&quot; a country-tinged gem; the  bluesy &quot;Girl&quot;;  and the stately &quot;In My Life,&quot; a  masterpiece that gave the first true glance of the lyrical depth Lennon  &amp; McCartney were capable of.    <br />A minor slip-up can certainly be  forgiven in the face of such brilliance, which is fortunate for &quot;Run  for Your Life,&quot; a deceivingly-happy sounding pop number that offers a  glimpse of the Fab Four's ability to occasionally shock (&quot;I'd rather  see you dead, little girl, than with another man&quot;).  Unlike some of  their other dark lyrics this one doesn't register on the fun scale.   Luckily the same can't be said for the rest of the album...&quot;Rubber  Soul&quot; is one of the brightest moments in rock history, and with The  Beatles' growing taste for experiment, one of the most important as well.
0486281523|4.0|I have accumulated quite a few puzzle books and was never fully satisfied with any of them until I heard about Martin Gardner and decided to pick up one his books.  The puzzles are diverse, ranging from word problems to  geometry problems.<br />The solutions given are very complete and actually  take up the majority of the pages in the book.<br />On a somewhat related  note, if you happen to be interviewing in the technical fields you may run  across interviewers that ask brain teasers.  You'll find many of those  problems (or ones that are very similar) in this book.  For technical  interviewing this makes a good study guide.
B000002UAR|5.0|After 1965's adventurous &quot;Rubber Soul,&quot; The Beatles upped the ante and released an album that branched out even further in both writing and production.  At once highly artistic and commercially accessible,  &quot;Revolver&quot; starts the era most modern rock artists are surely  referring to when they cite a Beatles influence. <br />Stylistically fearless,  the Fab Four break new ground with the greatest of ease: the lovely, Gothic  &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; flows like a concerto, &quot;I'm Only  Sleeping&quot; could just as easily be cited as blues as it could be  country, and &quot;Love You To&quot; was an early glimpse of World Pop.   Also ahead of its time was &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;...who'd have  guessed that the rhythms of the drum-&amp;-bass movement in 90's dance  music was experimented with over thirty years ago by Ringo Starr?  (And  let's not forget the track's trippy sonic boom, either, falling somewhere  World Music and acid trip.)  &quot;Revolver&quot; is also responsible for  the genre-busting, sea-shanty-on-hallucinogens &quot;Yellow  Submarine,&quot; the granddaddy of far-out rock fiction that still remains  a relentlessly singable treasure.<br />There's still plenty of straight-ahead  pop to be had, however: &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Got to Get  You Into My Life&quot; each boast some of rock's brightest shuffles, and  &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; is another gorgeous Lennon &amp;  McCartney chestnut that manages to sound beautifully simple in spite of its  sophistication.<br />The changes within the Beatles cache that subtly began on  &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; were forwarded here, and also dropped hints at what  was to come on the likes of &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot; and &quot;The White  Album.&quot;  As fresh as it is classic, &quot;Revolver&quot; remains one  of rock's standout recordings.
0140277447|1.0|The rape of Nanking was a horrible thing.  However, I saw Chang on TV saying that the Japanese killed 20 million Chinese during the war.  What she is talking about is the killing between Chinese Nationalist forces and  the Communists under Mao.  The Long March by the Communist forces was not  about tea parties throughout China.  Chang has to do more research about  China in the 40s.  And dear God, what about the Rape of Tibet?  Tibet is  about as Chinese as France is.  Will China pay reparations and allow  Tibetans to be Tibetans?
B00002Z88D|5.0|This is my first Metallica CD. I have been a fan of theres since the 80's but this is the first time I have brought a CD of theirs because I have not had enough money to by one before now. The CD is great and it is unusal to  here a heavy metal band being backed by a symphony orchistria and I believe  it is a good CD for one's first CD of Metallicas I like all the guys in the  band and this CD ROCKS!
0312243022|3.0|The prose is good. The descriptions border on excellent. But is it a steady framework on which to build engaging plot and believable characters? I think not. In the inscription, Cunningham discloses his intentions of  writing the story in the image of a cave, with 3 diverging paths which  converge within the depths of the mountain. Yeah,but the cave is about 3  feet deep, maybe.  I found no depth to any of the characters, nor did I  really care what happened to any of them. My emotional reaction to  Richard's suicide was that of &quot;thank GOD, some action, finally!&quot;  Before I read the book, I was intrigued by the so-called &quot;surprise  ending&quot; but found myself totally unsatisfied and unsurprised in the  final chapter. It's a good read sheerly for the word candy, but if you are  looking for a committment rather that a one night stand, this book isn't  for you.
B000023X9W|3.0|I hadn't bought a Neil Young album in years, but the reviews I read of this one revived memories of my favorites -- Neil Young, After the Gold Rush, Harvest -- so I thought I'd give it a try. I am glad for him for the  peacefulness he seems to have found, and I know the musicianship is  excellent, but after four times through I just don't find it very  interesting.  I miss the edgy melancholy.
B000002P5W|5.0|this is my favirote Hendrix album.  Not as loud as others, but even more powerful.  It's more of British sounding album
B00003CWQ2|5.0|From the opening sequence to the final shot,this movie will keep you glued to your seat and your eyes fastend to the screen.<br />This is one of those rare films that blends action,suspense and comedy beautifully and  effectively,not to mention the on-the-nose social comentary.<br />To really  explain this movie would take to long,plus I don't want to give anything  away. Let's just say to explain this movie is to spoil this movie and this  one is to good to spoil. <br />This is definately a must-see movie. The  screenplay is great the acting outstanding. Edward Norton is,as always,  perfect. Brad Pitt shines in his best role to date. If you only buy one  film this year,this is hands down the one to spend your money on.
630575067X|4.0|A lot of negative reviews have been given about Episode I, beyond the scope of Amazon.  I never saw the original Episodes when they first came out in the movies.  I didn't even see them when they first came out on  video.  So when I did finally see all three (all within a week, about 2  years ago) I had a somewhat different perspective.  The special effects  were no longer as impressive as they were in 1979, but I still instantly  loved the trilogy.  Seeing Episode I in the theater was the first time I  saw Star Wars in the movies, so all you Episode I bitter people will  probably chalk it up to that, but I still greatly enjoyed the movie.  I  will say I have seen the video about 5 or 6 times, and I still love it.  I  will concede that Jar Jar was definitely not what Lucas probably intended  him to be, and not everyone is an Oscar contendor for their work.  But I  once heard George say in reference to this movie that he meant it to be  fun.  And that is what it was.  I thought the fighting scenes were  excellent, and to those who say the characters have little to no  sustinance, I believe a great deal is learned through and about Qui Gon Jin  and Obi Won, and look forward to learning more of Anaking and Obi Won in  the next movie. I think anyone who really strongly disliked this movie, or  called it a disappointment, went into it with the wrong attitude.  Did you  think Darth Maul would have had more or a presence in the film?  Perhaps,  but if you are a fan of Boba Fet then you really can't complain at all.   And if anything about the lineage of the characters of Star Wars and the  history of the Jedi interests you, then this film is well worth seeing.   Does Anakin seem like he will become Darth Vadar? No, and that is the whole  point.  If he did, well then we could skip right to Episode 4.  Though I  was just a little one at the time the first three movies came out, from  what I understand they did not get rave reviews when they came out either.   Perhaps 20 years later Phantom Menace will be looked upon as just another  Lucas Masterpiece.  To those of you lingering skeptics and critics who say  the film had nothing but effects, ask yourselves this: Who is the Phantom  Menace?  You may think the answer is obvious to you, but ask a friend  (preferrably one not as bitter).  I did, and it sparked a debate over two  different characters.  Not bad for a movie with &quot;no redeeming  qualities.&quot;
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones has to be one of the best books I have ever read.  I have read all of Raymond E. Feist's books and I got recommended to read this book.. It looked big to me but when I read the first couple of pages I  was into it very quickly.  I just couldn't put the book down.  This book  has so much concept and depth it is excellent.  I have started to read Vol  II and it is as good as the first one.
B000002MUQ|5.0|This CD is a must for any true Van Halen Fan! Every tune on this CD rocks and Eddie's rockin guitar skills are obvious.  This album shows that Van Halen is one of the best Rock n' Roll Bands of all time.
079213690X|5.0|As a descendant of Robert Bruce and many other brave Scots I was relieved to see a movie like Braveheart to finally be released.  It was about time someone recognized what an astounding story the Scottish revolt against  England was.  The movie aside, I dont think casually observers fully grasp  what a monumental task it was for the Scots to defeat the English.  At the  time England boasted the greatest army in the world.  The Scots were made  up of modest farmers and working class people unaccustomed to war.  It  would be akin to Mexico defeating the US in war today.  It was that much of  a miracle.  As far as historical innacuracies, give it a rest.  It is a  movie.  It is meant for entertainment.  It is not my favorite film because  of the history lesson (accurate or inaccurate) it provided.  If you want to  read about how the Scottish revolution really took place I highly reccomend  Robert the Bruce: King of Scots.  If you thought Braveheart was an amazing  tale just wait till you read the completely non-fictional version...
B0000025OP|5.0|I remember playing this album over and over again in my dorm room right after it came out (alternating with &quot;Surf's Up&quot; by the Beach Boys, another neglected classic).  Still sounds powerful to me, honest,  reflective lyrics and GREAT backup by Tne Band.  Recently taught a class on  the Sixties, and used three Dylan songs for beginning middle and end of  Sixties: &quot;Times They Are A'Changin',&quot; &quot;Subterreanian  Homesick Blues&quot; and &quot;Going, Going, Gone.&quot;  Very strong  album.
B000002IGV|4.0|I still laugh when I see the cover of this album.  Dee Snider...with his blond curls, blue eyeshadow, and eating what looks like an animals leg, wearing his black and pink leotard.<br />Surprisingly, I find this album, Stay  Hungry, has some catchy tunes.  Actually, I bought this album when it first  came out; years later, in need of some fun, I bought the tape! <br />The song,  &quot;We're not going to take it&quot;..no we aint going to take it, we're  not going to take it anymore, is a great blue collar workingmans song.  If  your feeling mad at your boss or are underpaid etc, this IS the song for  you!<br />&quot;Your going to burn in Hell&quot;  This song has good rythm if  you enjoy head banging.<br />&quot;I wanna rock&quot; THe best head banging  tune on the album! Those who like to party, will go wild with this one! The  Price, is excellent too.  This song is much more relaxed in sound and anger  compared to the earlier ones I have mentioned
0440234743|5.0|The Testamen...now on my all time list.... is the perfect legal red-tape encased thriller while still birthing a simple romance.  Because of Troy Phelan's exotic death the book has you at page one..it keeps you marveling  at his six selfish children and their scummy spouses. Then you will fall  into the Pantanl. Grisham has you running you for Calomine lotion with his  intense descriptions of Dengue, the heat of the jungle and the peace of  Indigenous villages.  Be prepared for the ultimate adventure with a  surprise ending!
B00004SCX6|4.0|for the most part, the song was pretty good! it was catchy and it sounded pretty good...but in the middle it had her talking with this guy, and it sounded really bad...sorta cheap...with the &quot;awwww, you shouldn't  have!&quot; &quot;well baby, i went down and got it for you.&quot; but  otherwise, the actual song was really good! :)
0805062971|5.0|Though Fight Club is my favorite movie of last year, the book boasts a better beginning and end. Not to metion, the hilarious perfume scene was sadly missing from the film.
B000000OR9|5.0|THE BAND: John Sykes (vocals, guitar), Tony Franklin (bass), Carmine Appice (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1989) 9 songs clocking in at approximately 52 minutes. Included with the disc is a 10-page booklet containing song titles/credits/times, song lyrics, 1 band photo, and thank you's. Recorded at Little Mountain Sound Co, Vancouver, BC. Label - Geffen.<br /><br />COMMENTS: If there ever was an underrated band that never reached their much deserved stardom, it was Blue Murder. Three incredible musicians forming a \\"super-group\\" - John Sykes (formerly of Streetfighter, Tygers Of Pan Tang, Badlands/UK, Thin Lizzy and Whitesnake), Tony Franklin (The Firm, Whitesnake, Don Dokken, Derek Sherinian... *Franklin is/was credited with the introduction of the fretless bass to the world of rock/metal), and Carmine Appice (Rod Stewart, Stanley Clark, Ozzy, Ted Nugent, Vanilla Fudge, King Cobra). England's John Sykes is an amazing guitarist - and he shreds with the best of them. His rhythm guitar work, as well as his solos are simply amazing here. Franklin is an innovative bassist - and his playing here is perhaps the most intriguing part of this album. Appice has always been a very heavy drummer (minus his days of wearing sailor outfits with Rod Stewart's band). \\"Jelly Roll\\" was the biggest hit to come from this album. \\"Riot\\" and \\"Blue Murder\\" were smaller hits also making it to the FM-airwaves briefly. As good as these tracks were, the other deep album cuts provided a full rock experience (no filler)... with \\"Valley Of The Kings\\" and \\"Billy\\" being my favorites. This disc may be hard to find, but it's worth the search. This is classic 80's hard rock at it's finest (5 stars).
B00000J2KX|2.0|Stephen King's The Shining is by far his best novel, imho anyway. I was very disappointed with Kubrick's adaptation, as it changed many of the most important facts of the story. It was especially disappointing, considering  his genius adaptation of ACO. Though very beautifully and masterfully done,  as a fan of the novel, I have a hard time recommending this film  (per)version.
B000002UBB|4.0|THE BAND: Steve Miller (vocals, all guitars), Lonnie Turner (bass), Gary Mallaber (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1976) 12 tracks clocking in at just over 38 minutes. Included with the disc is a 2-page foldout containing song titles/credits, musicians, crew, and guest appearances. Label - Capitol.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Miller was never better than right here. He brings together rock, pop, folk, space synthesizers, ballads and the blues. 3 huge hits still receive airplay 3 decades later... \\"Rock'n Me\\", \\"Take The Money & Run\\", and \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\". 9 of the 12 songs are penned by Miller. The other 3 covers include the slow spacey flower-power \\"Wild Mountain Honey\\" (Steve McCarty), the grooving \\"Mercury Blues\\" (K.C. Douglas), and Sam Cook's light hearted acoustic \\"You Send Me\\". \\"Sweet Marie\\" is a bluesy acoustic guitar and harmonica (played by James Cotton) medley that has a ton of feel to it. The real gem is the album closer... one of the best songs in his catalog as far as I'm concerned... \\"The Window\\". \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" is as definitive as \\"classic\\" rock gets... look for the \\"30th Anniversary Edition\\" to be released July 2006. Steve Miller is an underrated legend on guitar - and \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\" is his best studio album (4.5 stars).
B000002H97|5.0|I believe this to be one of their finest albums, second only to &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; in my opinion. It has the major .......... hits like  Enter Sandman and Wherever I May Roam, but it is some of the lesser known  songs such as The God That Failed and Of Wolf and Man that sometimes are  just as good, if not better than the famous ones. The great thing about  this album is it's consistency. You can listen to the whole thing starting  with track 1 and not skip a single song. Every tune on this album is  great.  After all, it has been called one of the greatest heavy metal  albums of all time for a reason. I recommend getting the Metallica albums  in this order, from  best to crappiest:<br />1)Ride the Lightning 2)THIS ONE!  3)Master of Puppets 4)And Justice For All 5)Kill 'em All 6)Load 7)ReLoad
B00000IAU3|5.0|This album is the best! It's got so much versatility. IT's got sad music, a little hard guitar goin' on, I love it! And Dido does the theme song for the WB hit show ROSWELL, with Jason Behr, he's hottt! This album rocks, i  bust out to it in my room every day!
0767802470|5.0|I am giving this 5 stars based on the added features of the DVD - I personally prefer to watch the German language version but the optional English dubbing is superb, for the most part having been done by the  original German actors speaking English.<br />The director's commentary is  extremely interesting, including a discussion of the earlier attempts to  make this film in Hollywood, first with Robert Redford as the Captain and  later with Paul Newman.  One of these Hollywood treatments would have  placed the action later in the war, so as to introduce an American element  to the film!  According the commentary, all the action protrayed in Das  Boot is based on true events.<br />Incidentally, I had the same reaction  watching this DVD that I had in the theater, that although the crewmembers  are sympathetic and appealing characters I never forgot that they were  fighting on the wrong side!
B000023X9W|3.0|Neil Young has been one of my favorite artists since his Buffalo Springfield and Crazy Horse days.  A lot of people have been raving about this CD, yet I find it just so so.  Most of the songs sound like they were  ones that didn't make the cut of Harvest.  There are a couple that I really  like but most sound so familiar and recycled -- like I'd heard better  versions 15 years ago.  Neil's sound is timeless, and that's not always  such a good thing.  I like to hear an artist progress too.
0385493622|5.0|As an undergraduate math major in the late 1970's, I remember how my algebra professor used to chuckle that anyone who solved the Fermat conjecture would get an &#34;A&#34; in his course. (Some of us got A's anyway.) So I had to pick up a copy of this book when I saw it, and I couldn't put it down until I finished it. Singh does a wonderful job of intertwining the history of Andrew Wiles' life-long fascination with the Fermat conjecture with the history of attempts to solve the problem through the centuries. The necessity for Euler to introduce complex variables into his solution for the case n = 3 gives the first indication that Fermat was probably toying with (ultimately) many generations of mathematicians who would never find a proof that could &#34;fit neatly in the margin&#34; of a page. While it takes a fairly broad background in mathematics to appreciate the book, one does not need to be a specialist in algebraic number theory to follow Singh's historical development of the progress toward final solution. The description of Wiles' attempt to keep his work secret, and of the inadequacy of his first attempt at proof, reads like a first-rate cliffhanger. A splendid read.

B00000J7J4|5.0|I have had this CD from the time it was released until now. This has got to be one of the greatest CD's ever made. The chemistry between all of these artists is just unheard of. If you want great music you will not be  disappointed.
1884822312|3.0|First of all, I'm not saying it is a bad book.  I would say, however that there were certain characteristics that make a difference in usefulness not mentioned in the review. 1. The book is really about 4,000+ mates with the  rest being games and &quot;endgame&quot; positions.  If you are looking for  a good book of all kinds of positions (forks, pins, etc., this isn't it).  2. The solutions are not complete.  In fact, the mates in 2 only have the  first (white) move.  That's it....  A little strange.  The mates in 3 do  have solutions, but I only see one line of play.  I havent' checked through  them all &lt;grin&gt; but I would be surprised if there aren't several  potential lines of play. 3. The notation in the games is a little difficult  to get used to if you are used to the standard algebraic notation.  It is  called &quot;universal&quot; but I found it confusing at times. 4. The  section of combinations have titles f2/f6, h3/h3, etc. and there is no  explanation of why the heck they are named that (other than they all have  the particular move in the sequence. 5. There is really no analysis is the  games, which is unfortunate, because the first few I looked at were quite  amazing. 6. The paper is too thin and as a result, the white squares on the  boards all look dark.  A little thing, but kind of irksome. 7. The thing is  way too heavy.  There is a lot of white space on each page, and the author  could have probably cut the number of pages by a 1/3 without too much  trouble.  You won't be taking this on trips unless you are really  committed.<br />Hope this helps the next person.  I'll keep the book, and use  it, but maybe the next version will consider these items, all of which are  easily corrected.
0783239408|5.0|This movie does an admirable job in describing the dark dysfunction of suburban America.  Each character in the Burnham family is fully developed and Lester's mid life crises is both sad and hilarious.  Annette Benings  portrayal of a driven, materialistic real estate salesperson devoid of soul  is almost tragic.  As a viewer you know that ten minutes into this film  something tragic will happen because the two major characters seem so self  destructive.  The ironic pattern that asserts itself throughout the movie  is that the younger generation has its head screwed on a lot tighter than  the older.  The Burnham daughter and the retentive Marine neighbors son  have a maturity beyond their years, and their wry reflections on their  addled parents is subtley hilarious. &quot;All I wanted was a role  model&quot; muses the daughter.  &quot;Not a jerk that sprays his pants  everytime my friend comes over&quot; This film will be remembered like  &quot;The Graduate&quot; for its controversy in the years to come.
6305750750|1.0|there is no character depth... the entire film is a superficial blow'em up science fiction movie.<br />Dont say the original movies were like that.. because in the old ones George lucas had a lot of heart and character to  the characters... now they're just stand ins in a movie that George Lucas  obviously didn't want to make. I was anxious to see this movie since the  old star wars movies, but now I have no inspiration to see Episode 2. I  hope Lucas doesn't make it.
1573228214|3.0|This book is about Rob, a young man in his thirties who own a record store.  His store is located in London, England where the story takes place.  In the book, the reader is able to follow Rob through his  relationships, as well as his failing career involving his unsuccessful  record store.  In the book, Rob faces the many dilemma adults these days  tend to deal with among them, sex, money and family.    On a scale of  one to ten, I would give this book a seven mainly due to the fact that the  main character, Rob, was a looser.  He was lazy, stupid, blind and  self-centered not to mention the fact that he was unsuccessful in almost  anything he touched.  Also, at times I did not understand the humor because  I felt that it was directed mainly towards adults.  I felt that the first  chapter, describing Rob's worst break-ups, was too drawn out.  There were  details added to this first chapter that were very unnecessary for the  readers to know.  However, after the first chapter the book was a little  easier to read.  I understood the use of vocabulary, however I felt that  the humor used was not meant for a young audience.  The topics that the  humor dealt with were things that most young people have no experience  with, which made it harder to understand.  For example, when Rob talks  about sex, money and extravagant relationships.  I feel that unless a  person has had a lot of experience in the relationship area, they might  have trouble relating to and understanding the complications involved in  the characters emotions.  I suggest that when the reader has trouble  relating to the characters in the book, that they simply use their  imagination and put themselves in the shoes of Rob. In a sense, this book  reminds me of another book by J.D. Salinger called The Catcher in the Rye.   In both books, the main characters are constantly discussing adult topics  concerning relationships, money and life in general.  Out of a list of many  books, I chose to read High Fidelity because I heard that the book was  funny and uplifting.  I think that this book can be enjoyed by many, but  for the most part people with a dry sense of humor or people who have had  experience with bad relationships or relationships in general.
B000002H33|5.0|This is album and Ride the Lightning are Metallica's best to date. My favorite songs are Master of Puppets, Welcome Home(Sanitarium), Disposable Heroes, and Orion. GO buy this now!
6303212263|5.0|I remember with great anticipation at age 8 seeing this movie on the big screen.  What a majestically marvelous movie that to this day is timeless and holds up immensely well in the light of computer-digital special  effects and sophisticated film-goers.  And Christopher Reeve must remain  the only true and inimitable Superman any generation should ever  know!<br />The problem I have with this VHS version is that too much is  cropped off on the peripheral ends of the screen.  The panning-n-scanning  of the camera becomes trite and tiresome after awhile since this  &quot;modified to fit your screen&quot; version compensates to take the  viewer to where the action is.<br />Patiently waiting for a widescreen/DVD  version would be beneficial in appreciating this excellent movie classic.  I have seen the letterbox version from laser disc, and it is spectacularly  panoramic by comparison!  Rumor has it that Warner Bros. is planning a  25th Anniversary re-release of &quot;Superman - The Movie&quot; for 2003.  Perhaps this will also mean re-implementing the 48 minutes(!) that was cut  from the theatrical release of 1978, but restored and aired (only once!) on  ABC in 1982.  That means this movie is actually a little over 3  adventuresome hours long.<br />Even though I still rate this great film 5  stars, this VHS version does absolutely no justice for such a jewel of a  movie.  Wait for a widescreen version before you fly out and buy this one  since it will be the only way to truly appreciate &quot;Superman.&quot;
B000000OTU|4.0|Another Aerosmith compilation. A big bunch of really good songs, but maybe too many. For an Aerosmith fan it is perfect, but for a casual Aerosmith listener like me...too much. I really only care for about 8 or 9 songs on  this CD. Definatly Janie's Got A Gun and Cryin', also Love In An Elevator  and Dude Looks Like a Lady. I like a few others as well but the rest don't  get me into my groove. I give it 4 stars. This is stainboy signing off.
B00003W8NM|3.0|great premise and story telling... but this movie went on WAY too long. I dont want to spoil the film's conclusion but let's just say it gets pointless once the fight club is in existance for a 1/2 hour. There's 45  mins of movie that could have been cut out... for those that have seen it..  the whole &quot;Fight club terrorism&quot; part. 1/2 way through I thought  'this is going to be my favorite movie ever' and then it got stupid and  long.
B0000013G9|5.0|This is the best Pop/R&amp;B ever!
B000023X9W|5.0|This is my second review of S&amp;G.  Last time I gave it 4 out of 5 and declared it not quite worthy of classic status.  Ignore that, I was clearly deluded.<br />I've lived with this CD almost permanently in my CD changer for  about 5 weeks or so now.  It *IS* a classic, one of Mr Young's finest ever  (and that's without the tracks he gave away to the CSNY project!).<br />The  slowies in particular are very moving songs and performances.  We're lucky  to have an artist so capable of cutting the mustard after nearly 4 decades  of music making.  Roll on those Archives!
B00004SE2Y|4.0|This album includes the 12 songs from the American release, plus others.  The album marks a progression from Britney's first album, but still has many of those unmistakable features.  The chunky R&amp;B beat as on  &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; features on almost every track.  Now for the  bonus tracks, &quot;Girl In My Mirror&quot; is especially good, and is on  all the releases of the album except the US one, for some reason!  It's mid  tempo and is quite beautiful.  It has Britney soul searching about the girl  in the mirror (herself) being sad etc (similar in style to the song  &quot;Lucky&quot;).  The song &quot;You Got It All&quot; is standard  Britney fare, &quot;Heart&quot; is a ballad and has some very nice strings.   So all in all, the bonus tracks are very good, they sit with the others  well.  Also, they are part of the album without just being stuck on at the  end.  So if you're a Britney fan this one is definitely worth getting for  the extra songs.
B00001NFCY|4.0|Creed is a wonderful new band. I dont know exactly how to describe them. Kind of like Alternative Hard Rock I suppose. I really love this album and am looking foward to buying My Own Prison. My favorites on this CD are: Are You Ready?, What If, Never Die, With Arms Wide Open, and Higher. Creed is a  band that I see becoming as popular as The Red Hot Chili Peppers after a  few more releases. I give Human Clay, 4 stars...
B0000028RR|5.0|If you like Battle of L.A., and haven't heard this album yet, get it! This is simply their best CD that they've ever made. Zach clearly puts all of his heart (and his anger) into these songs for a really awesome sound for  the whole album. Morello sounds a bit different than he does on the newer  albums, as he plays more traditional hard rock/metal licks than the  creative scratches and sounds (that I still wonder how to do with my  guitar). This was Morello's begining, and it's nothing short of excellent.  Simply put, this is Rage's best album, and an essential component to my CD  collection, as it should be for every Rage fan.
B0000035E7|4.0|This is a great album. It is very different from Nevermind though. When you listen to songs on this album like &quot;School&quot; or &quot;Swap Meet&quot; you can really feel the passion in Kurt's singing. It is  beautiful. If you're a big Nirvana fan who doesn't own Bleach you might  want to wait for the re-issue of it next year because there will be an  added track which will be a Leadbelly cover. Also the Nirvana Box should be  out with unreleased songs and rare live recordings.
B000024Z5N|4.0|The Focus' second seems to be the first album where all the potential of van Leer/Akkerman duo was shown. Not only bizarre &quot;Hocus Pocus&quot; with amazing vocals and great guitar play, but especially  &quot;Eruption&quot; - an eclectic 24 minute suite with some classical  influences, smooth melodies and a drum solo incorporated place this album  high below average. That makes this CD a great introduction to the best  Focus albums - &quot;Focus 3&quot; and &quot;Hamburger Concerto&quot;.
0375420525|3.0|I got about 65% through before giving up. Perhaps a third of what I read was brilliant, but unfortunately he goes over the top with boring pretention (for example, he has a real thing about lists - tedious, long,  boring lists spanning pages and pages.) The author is good, the storyline  is good, but the book is not.
0060282983|5.0|Charlotte's web is a wonderful children's book, about a shy pig named Wilbur, who meets and becomes friends with a spider named Charlotte, who lives in the rafters above his pen. Charlotte becomes a mother figure to  Wilbur who directs Wilbur through the challenges that he faces and life on  the farm. When Wilbur learns of the future that is about to come to him,  Charlotte spins a web to convince the farmer and the town that Wilbur is no  ordinary pig, but a special pig.  Wilbur later is put into the fair and  wins many rewards and he lives a happy life.<br />The two main settings of  this book are located on a farm and at the fair.  These settings teach  children about life somewhere other than the city. Also, the book teaches  us about love and friendship, and the importance of having a relationship  like the one between Wilbur and Charlotte.  This is an excellent book and  directs people while young into a loving and caring life.
B00004RFDW|4.0|...but I enjoyed this film enough to write about it.  The things I liked  most about the film were the characters, and the tension.  Al Pacino (as  Lowell Berghman) and Russell Crowe (as Jeffery Wigand) were terrific.  There protrayals were heartfelt and believeable.  The woman who played  Wigand's wife was weak, but in some sense she was good because you started  to hate her for her lack of virtue.  As for the tension, throughout nearly  the entire film there is this palpable feeling that someone is going to be  knocked off, or something is going to pop onto the screen to make you jump.  The odd thing is that very little actually happens in the film (you could  probably summarize it in 10 sentences), but you're gripped all the way  through.  My only complaint is that it was a bit too long.  After 2:30+ it  starts to get a little dull, and the tension isn't enough to keep you glued  to the seat.  Nonetheless this film is very much worth it.
B000002OZY|4.0|Tommy-The Concept Album. This is a good album, but it is ruined by silly filler (&quot;Tommy Can You Hear Me&quot;, &quot;There's A Doctor&quot;), simply there to get the story across. I think that it would have been  possible to make REAL songs to fill these ideas. However, there are enough  fantastic songs on this record to make up for it. Many songs on this could  have been singles easily enough, although most of them (&quot;Pinball  Wizard&quot;, &quot;We're Not Gonna Take It&quot;) make sense only in the  context of the album. There are no actual songs on this album that are  truly bad: if you don't like the melody, read the lyrics, and vise versa. I  think that this album (for me at least) places the Who as the 2nd best  artists of all time, and Pete Townsend the 2nd best songwriter.
B000002540|5.0|In response to the previous reviewer, Anthony, I have bought 'many a live recording of a band that I was not familiar with' such as &quot;Foghat - Live&quot;, &quot;Black Oak Arkansas - Live mutha&quot;, &quot; Sensational  Alex Harvey Band - Live&quot;, &quot;Allman Brothers Band - Live at the  Fillmore&quot;, &quot;Gamma Ray - Alive 95&quot; to name a few.<br />Such live  recordings gave me a sample of the band in a setting where the energy and  performance is usually heavier and rawer than the studio records and the  sound is much much better than having to see a band live in hockey rinks  and other places that have poor acoustics and PA/sound systems.<br />This live  recording gave me an inexpensive exposure to the first two studio BOC  recordings which I later bought knowing they would be a little less rawer  and heavier but containing the same rocking material.<br />While containing no  'Don't fear the reaper' and 'Burning for you' hits; this live album may be  the most hardest rocking of all BOC recordings and brings to life the great  guitar playing that such afore-mentioned bad sound systems may have robbed  when actually seeing them live.<br />Simply put, most people know BOC's hits,  what they don't know is how well this band can rock with the best of them.   This cd shows it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I guess everyone has heard the great reviews of Ok... I was a fan from the Bends when I got Ok, and so i didnt know quite what to think at first. after a few listens i began to highly enjoy the album. it was so  different...it was so relaxing...so melodic. it was absoutely beautiful. so  i lvoed the album. after i got older and learned more about music, i  realized not only that the songs were absoultely beautiful not to mention  genius, but i realized that EVERYTHING about this album - the production,  the mixing, the playing of the instruments, the vocals...it was all  PERFECT. it was genius. all the little things..after you've listend to this  album as many times as i have, you bgein to notice just what makes this  album what it is. and that is pure genius. althought the bends will always  hold a place in my heart as my favorite album of all time, Ok COmputer very  possibly shows more talent than any other rock album i have ever heard. if  you havent bought it, then stop delaying and just buy it. PLEASE. and after  that, get The Bends. And if you have any room on your credit card left  over, buy Pablo Honey. Rock on. -Jared
B00004S6GL|4.0|Well here we are again. We all know the story by now. Indie hero, beloved, maker of many brilliant but decidely lo-fi albums signs with major label, produces highly polished radio-friendly brilliant album, becomes media  darling. Boatloads of new fans. Truckloads of old fans leave the docks as  they arrive claiming that popularity has once again tarnished the singular  message of their fallen hero. Oh well, ok. Speaking as one of the huddled  masses (I jumped on the bandwagon just after XO was released) I can't speak  for the loss of Elliot's vision (because apparently I was not around to  receive it nor will I be because signing with a major label evidently means  a sort of immediate cerebral fuge) but I will say that an album's budget is  no way to judge it. This album IS more hook-driven than elliot's others.  Thank God. That's not the problem. I think even the most diehard Elliot  purist would have to agree that most of his best earlier work was just as  hooky (think of &quot;ballad of big nothing&quot; or &quot;rose  parade&quot;) just on a smaller scale. The problem of this album is  slightly weaker lyricism in spots. Notice I say &quot;in spots&quot;. Most  of the lyrics, however, are pretty much on par or better than earlier works  (I still wince when I hear &quot;all of you can just fade to black&quot; on  &quot;2:45&quot;). Also, fame has given Elliot another limb to throw on the  barbee. Check out &quot;junk bond trader&quot; or &quot;Wouldn't mama be  proud?&quot; if you don't believe me. Speaking of the latter... yeah,  that's a hook. A blatant one. One radio stations drool over. A good one.  Sing it in your shower. It feels good. You won't burst into flames. I  swear.
B00000ILDF|5.0|great entertainment, and as usual Sigi is up to it. The effects were so real I couldn't tell the difference between the dummy Aliens and the real ones. The film reminded me a bit of Conair with all thos villains being the  good guys. Keep it up Sigi - your my favourite.

1881273156|5.0|Are you sure you know what makes your mate feel loved? If you can answer &quot;yes&quot; without hesitation you are either very lucky or (more likely?) too hasty. Reading this book made me understand more fully what I  thought I knew already: Human beings are different. One person's way of  expressing love may mean little to another person. Gary Chapman identifies  five basic ways of expressing love: Words of Affirmation, Quality Time,  Acts of Service, Giving Gifts, and Physical Touch. If you and your mate  speaks different &quot;love languages&quot; AND NONE OF YOU REALIZE IT,  disappointments and problems are in store. E.g, imagine you give your mate  a gift that you put a lot of work or money in, but s/he would much rather  just be together with you for an hour. Both of you will be disappointed,  you because the gift what not taken as the love sign it was meant to be,  your mate because you spent time on the gift instead of spending time on  him/her. Turn the story around and imagine the joy possible if you both  know what will make each other feel loved and both express love in the  mate's love language. The book is an easy read, full of examplifying  stories from real life, and avoids the pitfall of easy solutions to hard  problems. There are a few Scripture references in each chapter, which is a  plus from my point of view, but the book can be read without those by  anybody ready to think of the loved one before thinking of oneself.  One  reservation about me: I am a bachelor, and this is mostly a marriage book.  The principles of the book can be applied to family and people around me,  but without a mate I am not fully competent to judge to book. At least I  know what to give my cousin when she is married at the end of the summer!
B000002JK2|5.0|If you like the Who and want to explore more of Pete's music, this WAS the place to start BEFORE the release of the Best of CD. If after the you get the BO CD you want more, then get this one - you won't be dissappointed.    A very fine album that has aged well. Wore out a couple of vinyl copies  while in college, still play it at least once a month. Good sound/recording  too - on one of the acoustic instrumental passages, you can hear Clapton  tapping his foot to keep time.

B00004SCX6|2.0|I admire Britney for what she has accomplised, althout this album needed to be a little better.  There are some good tracks but there are a lot of  tacky, shallow songs.  I think she needs to work with a writer that will  compliment her excellent voice.  I thought Babyface was going to work on  this album and when I picked it up and saw that he didn't I was spewing.   Don't get me wrong, it's a good efort just not good enough for what she is  capable of doing.  Infact I like her first album a little better because of  the fact that it contained outstanding tracks.  Overall a dissapointing  efort and I think Britney would agree.  Songs like &quot;Don't go knocking  on my door&quot;, &quot;lucky&quot;, &quot;One kiss from you&quot;,  &quot;where are you Now&quot; and &quot;Dear Dairy&quot; should not even be  on this cd.  I like &quot;Don't let me be the last to know&quot; - catchy  courus although it's sounds familiar.
B000002ITW|2.0|Your vinyl copy is all used up sitting in a box in the basement, so this is one of the albums you decide to get on CD because it is one of those records you have real fine memories of from back in school. But man o man, when you play it back now, you realize it is one of those albums that does  not age well at all. As stated in other reviews, very uneven performances  (thank god for remotes and CD track programming). But I must be honest and  say that I find that after the first listen or two, I almost never go back  and pick out this CD to play, even when in a nostalgic mood and looking for  something different to listen to. Wish I hadnt bought it. Let sleeping dogs  lie and spend your money on something else.
B00004SCX6|3.0|I've always said that Britney has no true talent. As much as I still agree with that for the most part, Britney has a certain way she can get anyone interested in her music. It's songs like &quot;Oops!...I Did It  Again,&quot; &quot;Lucky,&quot; and &quot;Stronger&quot; that have drawn me  to buy this album. Most of the songs on her CD are dancing songs, with a  few exceptions; &quot;Don't Let Me Be The Last To Know&quot; which was  written by 'Mutt' Lange and Shania Twain has a certain air to it, as well  as &quot;When Your Eyes Say It.&quot; Then again, it's &quot;Dear  Diary&quot; and all of the hidden tracks where Britney is talking with her  friends, that remind me of why I never liked Britney Spears in the first  place. If you feel like dancing and singing into a hairbrush this is the CD  to buy.
B000002BYD|4.0|\\"Yield\\" begins in fine blazing fashion with \\"Brain of J,\\" one of my favorite Pearl Jam tunes ever. Mike McCready's crunchy guitar riff on the song is classic PJ, and Vedder's vocals, as ever, are impassioned. He screams the question, \\"Who's got the brain of JFK and what's it mean to us now?\\" The chorus of the song, \\"The whole world will be different soon/The whole world will be relieved,\\" seems to suggest a loosening of the status-quo grip within society after JFK's tragic death, which unleashed a freer era in the 1960s and into the `70s. Whatever message Vedder is trying to convey in the song, he does it forcibly and well, backed up by a lively guitar and rhythm section that get \\"Yield\\" started off in an ultra-lively manner.<br /><br />Following \\"Brain of J,\\" \\"Yield\\" takes an interesting, often more mellow turn. Mid-tempo songs such as \\"Faithful,\\" \\"No Way,\\" \\"Given to Fly\\" and \\"In Hiding\\" are tuneful, often soaring in sound, feature big sing-along choruses and are cleanly recorded. In some ways, the aforementioned tunes represent some of PJ's most radio-ready offerings ever recorded. The quieter tunes on \\"Yield\\" are worthy, too. \\"Wishlist\\" is exactly what the title would suggest: an unattainable laundry list of Vedder's hopes and dreams in life, both big and small. For a singer who usually thinks on such a grand scale, it's refreshing to hear him sing about life's more quirky and romantic desires. Elsewhere, \\"MFC\\" has an atmospheric, longing quality that makes it the perfect road-trip tune; \\"Push Me, Pull Me\\" is a modern-sounding, bizarrely constructed composition with a surprisingly tuneful chorus that makes it endearing; and \\"All Those Yesterdays,\\" the perfect campfire song to close out the album, is gentle in tone, has wary, empathetic lyrics and is simply beautiful. Let the CD play and you'll hear a kind of Spanish-style outro, complete with a slinky guitar and the occasional shout-out by one of the band members. There's a few spots on \\"Yield\\" where PJ lets its guard down and has a little fun, musically, and this is one of those times.<br /><br />One tune that pulls no punches is the raw and angry \\"Do the Evolution,\\" an anti-anthem against the smaller-minded folks of the world. Stone Gossard's rough-n-ready riff is loaded with firepower, while Vedder's accompanying vocals are equally packed with spirited venom. In the ironical but up-front song, Vedder adopts the viewpoint of...let's just say a red-blooded American who might enjoy Fox News, adore President Bush and follow the \\"herd behavior\\" mentality that is a shortcut to thinking in some respects. Anyway, whether you agree with Vedder's views or not, he sure does know how to get his point across.<br /><br />Vedder's vibe is still pretty leave-me-alone and introspective by this point in the late 1990s, but you can tell from \\"Yield\\" that his band's sound is opening up by leaps and bounds. Some would consider this album, quite rightly, Pearl Jam's finest release.wn and has a little fun, musically, and this is one of those times.

B000002AP1|5.0|For nearly 25 years, Raw Power has been regarded very highly as a &quot;proto-punk&quot; record.  It has been hailed as an immediate precursor to what the Ramones were doing only a year or two later.  It  turns out, David Bowie's somewhat heavy handed work as the producer of Raw  Power may have delayed the birth of Punk Rock as we know it by 2 or 3  years.  <BR>Iggy's remix re-infuses the ferocity the Stooges were known  for.  He put something primal back into the music that was missing the  first time around.<BR>As it is, the original mix of Raw Power constitutes  one of the most influential recordings of the last 30 years.  The  remastered version lives up to all of the potential squashed beneath Bowies  sonic chicanery.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is a fantastic album. Other Madonna work doesn't impress me much, but this is a different story. This jungle/electronica/dance/trance music fits very good with madonna. Ray Of Light is the best track in my opinion.  Frozen, The Power Of Goodbye,Drowned World, and Skin are also favourites of  me. Mer Girl has beautifull lyrics. Let's hope that her upcoming album is  just as good as this one. (Or better offcourse.)
B00004SCX6|4.0|I am not a Brittany Spears fan but I did like her new song &quot;Oops,, I did it Again! so I purchased the album.  I think she did a fantastic job for her experience in the business.  I think once you are in the limelight,  much is expected of you.  She is only 18 years old and I think she has alot  going for her.  I was impressed with her singing/dancing on Saturday Night  Live and noticed she is very dedicated and seems to enjoy what she does. I  say, give the album a try.  She seems to be a very positive influence to  the younger generation.  Even though alot of the songs are very similar,  the songs had a great beat.  It's very good.
B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Bizkit prove one thing with their second album. That is in the music industry you don't necessarily need talent, you just need to know the right people. Personally, I think Fred Durst has no talent whatsoever. Stay away  from the Bizkit, because the Durst is yet to come.
B00004T8RK|3.0|Growing up with Pearl Jam in Seattle, I've been a fan since the beginning.  I own all their albums plus a few bootlegs, and I'm sorry to say that this album ranks at or near the bottom.  It is a mix-match collection of songs  that show Pearl Jam's search for their current identity.  Of the 13 songs,  4 or 5 of them sound like Pearl Jam.  The rest of the tracks, spattered  with the yelling of &quot;evacuation&quot; or the generic sounds of  &quot;Breakerfall&quot; and &quot;Gods' Dice&quot; leave me wondering what  the future holds for one of the greatest bands in the last decade.  (The  few songs that are quality might make this a worthy buy to some of you out  there... because they really are good).
B000002MU3|2.0|Clearly the worst R.E.M. album, &quot;Monster&quot; probably deserves 2.5 stars or even three, but it's been overpraised here, so there you go. I don't mind a band trying new things -- in fact, I encourage it -- but they  also must play to their strengths at least a little, and this album does  anything but. Most of the songs, drenched in a fuzzy crunch of sound, just  sit there, absolutely grooveless. The first three songs --&quot;What's the  Frequency, Kenneth?&quot;, &quot;Crush With Eyeliner&quot; and &quot;King  of Comedy&quot; felt like a bad dream when I first heard them. The album  gets better, and familiar R.E.M. attributes do crop up. &quot;I Don't  Sleep, I Dream&quot; is nice, the countryish lilt of &quot;Strange  Currencies&quot; work surprisingly well, &quot;Bang and Blame&quot; is  flat-out great, and &quot;Let Me In&quot; is subtly harrowing. I do like  the pummeling &quot;Circus Envy&quot; too -- one of the few fuzzed-up  bashers here that works. All in all, disappointing, but there are flashes  of brilliance here and there.
6304539282|5.0|Many Sci Fi buffs tend to treat the Star Wars trilogy like it was the second coming. It was a ground breaking effort on the part of George Lucas but not exactly a world shaking revolution.<br /><br />These films put to  death the theory that all science fiction films must be &quot;B&quot;  grade. They were big budget, hi tech, well directed films with some  excellent performances. Star Wars launched the successful careers of so  many people that they are impossible to list.<br /><br />The first film,  &quot;Star Wars&quot;, takes us through Luke Skywalker's discovery of his  destiny. He finds an old Jedi Knight, Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi, who takes it on  himself to train Luke in the ways of the force. Unfortunately Ben and Luke  get drafted by Princess Leia in an attempt to save her and oppose the evil  emperor and his second in command, Lord Darth Vader.  They are aided by a  smuggler/pilot, Han Solo and his copilot Chewbacca in the fastest ship in  the cosmos, the Millennium Falcon. Some heavy duty action is had by all  when Leia is rescued, (losing Ben in the process) and the emperor's death  star is destroyed with only moments to spare before the rebel base was to  be obliterated.<br /><br />The second film, &quot;The Empire Strikes  Back&quot;, disappointed me at the time because of its open ended finish. I  have since forgiven it for this.  As with the first film, the second  starts by skipping some of the intervening background material. So, we are  left to catch up to the plot by ourselves. We find Luke Han and Leia in a  new rebel base on a frozen planet. During an isolated scene where Luke is  captured by a snow beast we find that his Jedi powers have developed a  little more and that the friendship between he and Han has grown even  stronger. But not to the point where their rivalry over Leia has  abated.<br /><br />The empire locates the rebel base and they all have to turn  tail and run. Yes, we discover that the destruction of the death star at  the end of the last film was nowhere near the end of the empire. Everyone  bugs out in an orderly fashion except Luke who heads off to find a new  master, by following the instructions of the now spectral Obi-Wan. Han,  Chewy and Leia find that the Falcon is in need of repair and have to limp  to the nearest port of call.<br /><br />Luke finds the memorable Jedi Master  Yoda, and starts his training. Meanwhile the falcon's crew is in trouble  after Han's friend, Lando Calrissian, involuntarily betrays them to Darth  Vader, resulting in Han being frozen in carbonite. So it's Luke to the  rescue. The problem is that this was Darth's plan all along. Thus we get to  see Luke, fencing with Darth. Luke loses his hand but gains a Father. Both  against his will.<br /><br />The final film, &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;,  was excellent, except for the ridiculously cutesy Ewoks.  We have to do  another leap forward to catch the plot which has moved to the point where  all of Han's friends are involved in an attempt at his rescue. Han has been  sold, as a wall decoration, to Jaba the Hut, a type of Mafia boss in the  shape of a giant, fat, salamanda. Luke arrives and impresses the hell out  of everyone with his new Jedi powers. With a little help he saves everyone  and the movie moves on.<br /><br />The empire is building another death star  and the rebels have a plan to destroy it. Of course Han, Luke, Leia, etc.  are all critical to the success of this plan. They must land on a tropical  moon to disable the force field that protects the half built deathstar. In  the process, Luke is voluntarily captured and tries to turn Darth, his  Father, away from evil. We get to see another great dual between the two of  them.  This time the emperor is on the side lines cheering them on whilst  trying to turn Luke to the dark side of the force. Luke is made of sterner  stuff than that though.<br /><br />Meanwhile the rest of the gang have run  into the improbable Ewoks. Fuzzy, teddy bear like people who seem unable to  walk without waddling. Strangely they turn out to be useful allies, in the  capacity of scouts, diversions and pesky warriors. The force field is  eventually brought down and the rebels attack only to find that the death  star is not nonfunctional after all. If it wasn't for Darth Vader turning  against the emperor at the last minute, in order to save Luke, all would  have been lost.<br /><br />Many people have been awaiting more movies in the  series. A number of good follow up books have been written, Timothy Zahn's  efforts are especially good. However, Lucus has decided to go back in time  and produce some prequels. We will see a young version of Obi-Wan as the  hero. It should be good.le who seem unable to  walk without waddling.

B000002B5L|1.0|I bought this cd thinking it would be a good addition to my cd collection. After listening to it for less than 5 minutes i could not bear to hear this sound that fans of the fugees call music. They are not talented and should  not be as famous as they are today. Don't buy this cd it stinks!
B000002UZ1|5.0|I love every song on this CD, this and the Red Album have to be the greatest collection of music anywhere. I am troubled by all of the Stones bashing. I love both of them equally. They are the two greatest acts by far  in all of Rock n Roll. The Stones, however sold more albums than the  Beatles, so Kyle's statement that the ten worst Beatles songs would outsell  the Stones greatest hits is nonsense. I would have to say that the Beatles  are slightly superior to the Stones, who are a little bit ahead of Rock's  3rd best act, The Who.<br />With regard to this package, Strawberry Fields is  a great opener and Revoluion is a great way to end the first disk,  especially following Hey Jude. The second disk is excellent as well but I  don't like Back in the USSR as the opener. Ob La Di, Ob La Da would have  been my choice to open it up. This disk has my all time favorite Beatles  song, Here Comes the Sun, and for my money their all around best song, Let  It Be. The Long and Winding Road is a great close, too. All in all, buy it.
6300215717|4.0|Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn star in this 1953 classic. With two actors like that &quot;Roman Holiday&quot; hardly needs more selling points. Although at the time Audrey was not a well known actress. In fact some  people at the time thought casting her was a bit of a risk. Well, history  has proven them wrong.<br /><br />The story is simple and not at all original.  In fact if you were just to look at the script  it is likely that you would  think the film not worth making. What made this film great was superb  performances by the whole cast and a fresh piece of directing from William  Wyler. Of course shooting the film in Rome was an added feature of not  inconsiderable weight.<br /><br />Audrey Hepburn plays a young princess from  an undisclosed nation. She is visiting Rome as part of a European tour and  is starting to feel a little claustrophobic. She decides to escape the  confines of her local residence and her hangers on by sneaking out in a  delivery van but not before one of her keepers has given her a little  something to help her sleep. The drug does not take effect until she is  well out of bounds and this is where our hero comes into the picture.<br /><br />Gregory Peck plays Joe Bradley, a disreputable news paper reporter who  is largely down on his luck. He stumbles across Princess Anne as she is  nearly sleeping by the side of a road. Despite his better instincts he  eventually decides to save this bedraggled and presumably drunk, young lady  by putting her in a cab. Unfortunately she is unable to give a lucid  response when asked for an address and thus ends up in Joe's one room  abode.<br /><br />Naturally the disappearance of the princess is hushed up but  not enough to prevent Joe from eventually coming to the correct assumption,  that his poor lost sheep is in fact more than she seems. And so we are  launched on an opportunistic tour of Rome care of Joe and for the benefit  of his clandestine photographer, Irving. Joe's intentions are to gather as  much information and photos of the princess slumming as to make a world  front page story and propel himself back to New York.<br /><br />It isn't long  before the naive and yet heart warming affections of the princess start to  thaw Mr Bradley's self interest. As a result, he misses out on his story  but feels much more richly rewarded in a moral sense. A good message for  the kiddies, yes?<br /><br />OK, it is a bit corny, however it is still  strangely believable, even after so many years. Have you had a chance to  watch Roman Holiday in the last few years? If not, then why not do yourself  a favour and give it another run through. There are worse ways to kill a  couple of hours.information and photos of the princess slumming as to make a world  front page story and propel himself back to New York.<BR> <BR>It isn't long  before the naive and yet heart warming affections of the princess start to  thaw Mr Bradley's self interest.

B00000IQW5|4.0|Let's face it, there's damned few chances in life to root for the dead guy. And when the deceased is a fire fighting hero, a pilot and Richard Dreyfuss, you know your have to love him. But before I become too  premature, let's lay the groundwork. Actually that term is only half  correct for &quot;Always&quot;, as a lot of the action takes place in the  air. You see we are dealing with airborne smokeys, fire fliers who pilot  Air Tankers and dump thousands of  gallons of water on forest fires for  little pay, even less public recognition and no future.<br /><br />So there's  no prizes for guessing the outcome when we are introduced to one of the  more reckless pilots, Pete Sandich, who is in a non-committal relationship  with a beautiful Radio operator back at base, Dorinda Durston, played by  Holly Hunter. But before the inevitable, tragic accident, we are treated to  some quite romantic scenes. The best of which involves Pete gifting his  love with a stunning white cocktail dress. The timing could have been  better as she then has to dance with every roughneck fire-stomper in the  base.<br /><br />Pete's best friend, the improbably named Al Yackey, is played  by John Goodman. He actually has the best role in the film and whilst he  does offer much comic relief, there is much more meat on the character's  bones than just humour. In fact he is an integral part in putting all the  pieces back together following Pete's death.<br /><br />Interestingly, the  story doesn't really take off until Pete is ashes to ashes. You see the  afterlife is not all cheese and biscuits, laying back on  fluffy clouds.  There's work to do, inspiring the living to be the best they can be, or at  least to stop being such losers. Pete gets some on the job training from an  angelic supervisor called Hap, (Audry Hepburn), and is then pushed out into  the world to assist a wayward member of Gods great flock.<br /><br />This  particular sheep is called Ted Baker and he gets one of the best  descriptions in any film when Dorinder claims he is not her type, (too much  twisted steel and sex appeal). You see, it's Teds destiny to be with  Dorinda and hers to be with him. Unfortunately, Pete doesn't work that out  for some time because he is too busy trying to be a part of Dorinda's  life.<br /><br />There's a lot of room for emotional moments in this film, so  don't forget the tissues. I love the whole idea of the film. It's great to  watch Richard Dreyfuss weave his magic with a touching script. And John  Goodman is the perfect buddy for, first Pete and then Dorina. In the end we  have to forgive Ted for wanting to take Pete's girl. It is hard because we  can see Pete is still desperately in love with her. But when he turns the  corner and starts pulling for Ted, we can't help but follow.any film when Dorinder claims he is not her type, (too much  twisted steel and sex appeal).

B00003Q438|5.0|When The Abyss first came out at the cinemas in Australia I shot off to see it. Whilst it was an exciting action film, I thought the plot took a strange and almost unnecessary turn when the Aliens came forward at the end  of the story. Let's face it, with a lost nuclear submarine, a  claustrophobic underwater drilling rig, a hurricane and a world military  crisis building, why does the story need aliens. Especially when they seem  to be tacked on in a thoughtless way.<br /><br />Then I heard about the  directors cut version of The Abyss. All I had heard was that it was much  better especially concerning the aliens. So out I went and bought this  edition on Laser Disc. Wow, what a difference 28 minutes can make. The  characters had more depth, Bud's near death decent becomes very touching  and the aliens have a purpose after all.  I find it hard to believe that  Cameron could have sent the first amputated edition out to the cinemas. So  let's forget the first edition and move on.<br /><br />How can you not like a  film that has so many exciting facets. Just the basic setting is suspense  filled. A drilling rig with crew sitting on a rocky shelf two thousand feet  below the surface of the ocean. Compared to this, the vacuum of space is a  walk in the park. Just imagine the pressure at that depth. It's pretty  scary even for me and I've been diving for years.<br /><br />Add to this scene  a mother ship floating above the rig, both of them connected by a thick  umbilical cable which acts as communications link to the outside world. Now  crash a US nuclear submarine nearby, (off the coast of Cuba), in suspicious  circumstances and ask the drilling rig to come to the rescue. But the rig's  engineers know nothing about military subs so lets send a group of Navy  Seals down to take over the operation.<br /><br />Okay, at this stage  everything still seems fairly under control but not exactly failure  tolerant. So it needs to be brought to the boil with a bit of pressure  induced psychosis suffered by the head of the Seal team. And in order to  trigger a little extra conflict lets get some glimpses of unknown craft,  whizzing around the sub and you are about ready to rock and roll. Hmm, but  there seems to be no time pressure. Maybe an imminent hurricane would help  to focus our minds.<br /><br />Let her rip. In a response to the perceived  Russian threat, the Navy lads rush off to salvage a nuclear war head to  obliterate the downed sub and keep it out of enemy hands. The trouble with  this is they take the only machine that can uncouple the rig from its  mother ship. They therefore don't have time to unhook before the storm  hits, ripping the cable and crane from the mother ship and sending it  plummeting down towards the rig. But not to worry, it misses, only to fall  off the abyss a moment later, and subsequently drags them to the edge of  the drop off. Lots of action, deaths and loss of equipment ensues. Which is  about when the internal conflicts start to heat up.<br /><br />Lt. Coffey  played by Michael Biehn, becomes paranoid and thinks the rig's crew is  against him. As his plans to nuke the enemy (actually aliens) emerge, Bud  (Ed Harris) and his estranged wife Lindsey, (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio)  rally the crew to try to stop him.  After fights and lots of near death  events take place, the bomb is on its way, Coffey is dead and Bud is  trapped with Lindsey in one of the little subs with no motor, a giant leak  and only one diving suit. This is the best scenes in the film. They decide  to let Lindsey drown on the slim hope that the freezing cold water will  allow her to be towed back and still be revived. Ed Harris does a great job  of acting as Bud struggles to revive his Wife.<br /><br />After this, everyone  becomes understandably focussed on stopping the atomic weapon from  detonating. It would not only kill them all but would also start a war with  the an alien race of unknown power. The plan is for Bud to use a special  navy diving suit to go down the further two miles to the bottom of the  abyss and then defuse the bomb. The suit in question is interesting as it  requires Bud to breath an oxygenated liquid hydrocarbon. His decent is not  easy and Lindsey helps by recounting intimate memories of their past life  together.<br /><br />Bud eventually makes it and stops the explosion but his  decent has not left him enough oxygen to make it back. We are witness to  his courage as he waits to die. Which is about when the aliens reappear to  save him. But whilst they are doing this they are also setting up 1000 foot  tidal waves to hang over every major coastal city in the world. Bud becomes  their messenger. It is time for we humans to put away childish things and  stop harming each other. Either that or learn to breath under water.  Everyone is saved by the relatively friendly ETs and all is right with the  world. A corny ending to be sure but very satisfying.to go down the further two miles to the bottom of the  abyss and then defuse the bomb.

B00004SCX6|3.0|Oops, I Did It Again is probably the best song on this cd. There are a few other songs that are really good. One is called What You See Is What You Get. This song is really saying that if you don't like me for who I am then  get lost. That you shouldn't try to change someone because that's not why  you like them. The other songs that I like are Lucky, Where Are You Now,  and Dear Diary. I don't know if this will help you or not. But if your a  fan then I saw go for it.
B000002BPS|5.0|I first heard of the Offspring after the release of 'Pretty Fly (For A White Guy)'. Going backwards I bought &quot;Americana&quot;, &quot;Ixnay On The Hombre&quot; and &quot;Smash&quot;. Looking at the band's style it's  obvious that they are starting to appeal to the pop charts which might do  them good for fame but the music is not nearly as powerful or expressive as  the older tracks. As an older album, Ixnay shows the powerful  characteristics of teenage angst, bitterness and rebellion.  'Gone Away' is  so wrought with emotion; the straightforward lyrics and guitar backing put  into context bitterness and anger that is so often found in sadness. The  rest of the tracks also display the same explosion of emotion and  thought-provoking lyrics. A must for Offspring fans and those who simply  need a way to hear their thoughts as music.

It IS all that.  Each song on  it is different, and each one good.  Santana plays blues guitar on top of  salsa rhythms.  I've never heard that before.  His guitar-playing is really  fine.

B00000K19E|5.0|There was a reason that The Matrix won all the Oscars for special effects and sound over Star Wars: Episode 1. They were revolutionary. How many movies since The Matrix have you seen similar effects shots being used, a  lot. I did like Episode 1 to, but the Matrix did all its effects with live  actors which makes it that more impressive.<br />The story is just great. It  really makes you wonder about reality, but its more entertaining than  anything. Its hard to get bored of this movie, I have seen it many times  now and i still could go see it again and enjoy it. Definetly worth adding  to your dvd collection.<br />There are also some neat special addons to this  dvd, showing how they did a lot of the special effects in the movie, it is  really interesting.
B00004SCX6|5.0|Let's go through the tracks:<br />1. Oops!...I Did It Again : need I say anything about this? i know everyone's heard it. <br />2. Stronger : this is a really cool track. britney sings with a lower part of her voice. at first i  didn't like this, but its really catchy.<br />3. Don't Go Knockin' On My Door  : starting to grow on me, but honestly, not the best out there.<br />4.  Satisfaction : an OK song, slower than the original.<br />5. Don't Let Me Be  The Last To Know : this track is really awesome! it has a countryish twang,  probably because it was written by Shania Twain's husband.<br />6. What U See  (Is What U Get) : awesome. this track is like britney's message to the  world, like the lyrics go &quot;You should never try to change me, I can be  nobody else...and I like the way I am&quot; ...and it has a great message.   <br />7. Lucky : now this is my favorite track!  it is the &quot;story&quot;  of a girl named Lucky, and is kind of sad: she has all this fame as a  &quot;Hollywood girl&quot;, but she still isn't happy. great beat. (another  song that isn't about LOVE, you britney haters!)<br />8. One Kiss From You : I  forget how this one goes, so it must be pretty boring.<br />9. Where Are You  Now : all of you people that say britney has a flat voice with no  talent...listen to THIS!  an excellently written ballad, really  moving.<br />10. Can't Make You Love Me : cool song. not much to say about it,  but its good!<br />11. When Your Eyes Say It : wow! great song! diane warren  wrote this. it suites britney well. a slow ballad.<br />12. Dear Diary :  christina aguilera doesn't write any of her songs. neither does mandy  moore, or jessica simpson. but BRITNEY SPEARS wrote this song! (plus  britney doesn't overdo the eye make up like christina) really fun song, but  slow.<br />BUY OOPS!...I DID IT AGAIN NOW! take my word for it, its worth  every single penny!  :-)
6305657947|3.0|This movie would of been better without the nudity. I thought this movie was going to be more of an action flick, at least thats what the previews seemed to protray it as. Instead in turns into an adult love affair.  Disapointing.
B00004SCX6|5.0|A great follow-up CD.  Much better than her first release.  Satisfaction is a surprisingly great cover of a great song.  Not a bad song on the CD, although I prefer the up-tempo songs.  Hot girl, hot CD.
B00003CWPR|1.0|This movie was just plain bad. I have seen basically all of Stanley Kubricks films, and unfortunatly his last was his worst. The story was just so wierd and twisted I didn't even want to finish watching the movie. With  all the hype this movie generated, and the actors in the movie, i thought  this would be great. Just turned out to be a stinker.<br />Hopefully Steven  Spielberg can do Kubricks other project AI some justice in the future, but  its unfortunate that this movie had to be so bad.
0684867621|2.0|I found this book very long and drawn out, with absolutely no suspense to keep the readers interest. King's format of organizing the beginning of each chapter with baseball \\"Lingo\\" was very inventive. However, I did fine that forcing myself to finish reading his novel was close to a self-torturing act. Just ask my husband.
6303073107|4.0|After learning about this film I became very interested to watch it. The idea of hearing FOUR different people's observations concerning a murder. What caught my attention was how TRUE TO LIFE the story is. Everything in  life is dependent upon how we as individuals interpret situations depending  on our different points of view. Just look at AMAZON!  Here we have  people voice their opinions on music,movies,books ect... And it's all based  on our understanding of what we see and hear. I guess we always know this  about our society but perhaps we stick it in the back of our heads. It's  really amazing if you just sit back and think about it,how events and not  only that but our own lives are judged just on how we delineate things.  Watch this movie and it will really open your eyes to how our society  works. How everything in life is about our view of it. It's just  fascinating!  WATCH IT AND SEE
B00004SCX6|5.0|I must tell you, that  I am feeling this cd.  As a R&amp;B listener primarily, Britney has got me listening more and more to pop music.  I love all the songs on the album, mainly the fast ones.  I love  &quot;Satisfaction&quot;  it has a nice beat to it.  I also like &quot;What  U see Is What U Get.  On this album she is truly showing that she has grown  as a person and artist.  I recommend you get this cd, no matter what genre  of music you listen to.
B00000GJ2B|4.0|The great thing about this is,it combines two things I love:BOXING and MOVIES!  But of course we all know that there is more to Scorsese's picture than just BOXING!  It's the story of a boxing legend's(Jake La  Motta)championship fight with the WORLD. We go through his up's and down's.  Feeling not only his pain,but his happiness as well. This is something ONLY  a film maker of the salience like Martin Scorsese could do. This film is  just about flawless. There's ONLY ONE things that bothers me. And maybe it  has or will bother those's who watch it. Does anyone else think it was a  bit long?  But don't let that stop you from seeing this film. Great  acting(esp. De Niro)top notch directing,and great camera work. If you like  this film another one that came to mind when watching this is &quot;The  Hurricane&quot;. DON'T MISS OUT ON THIS ONE!
B000001FYZ|5.0|This is the best album that the Scorpions have ever put out! This album ROCKS!
B000001ESN|4.0|Another classic recording from the Canadian power trio. Permanent Waves is the first album to go mainstream on radio. Most of the songs are short except for Natural Science and Jacob's Ladder. Through the album there are  songs still being played on radio such as &quot;Spirit of Radio&quot; and  &quot;Freewill&quot;. Truely a timeless classic.
6304508611|4.0|If you dislike the teen genre, because of its over-idealistic portraits of school life and growing up, littered with assorted stereotypes, then this is the film for you. I've seen a number of de Palma's films, and while I  applaud his visual and technical skills, his &quot; homages &quot; to  Alfred Hitchcock, who as far as I'm concerned is the best director the  industry has produced, can be infuriating. The film has an auspicious  opening, what with the vast number of naked teenagers. I can't help but  feel this was exploitative. The scene where Carrie has her period in the  shower is painful for the viewer to watch ( did anyone see the shower head  as a phallic symbol ? ). Sissy Spacek is wonderful as thye troubled teen,  embarassed and repelled by her awakening sexuality. This is no wonder  considering her mother's religious obsessions. It's probably good that  Carrie does not have a happy ending, otherwise what would distinguish it  from other teen flicks? The music was very reminiscent of Bernard Herrman,  especially during the scene where Piper Laurie stabs Carrie ( very Psycho  ). It would be harsh to say that Carrie is a Hitchcock rip-off, because it  works very well on it's own merits. The sequel will hopefully be terrible,  because it sounds a bad idea. The most impressive thing though is the  film's ability to shock. I'd read about the famous ending, the hand  emerging from the grave, and it still scared the hell out of me. All in  all, very good. A shame Mr de Palma's career has taken the commercial and  mainstream path in recent years however. Hopefully he'll learn from Mission  to Mars and especially Bonfire of the Vanities, that he isn't a commercial  director. Instead he is a very controversial, dynamic, and provocative  indie helmer. I hope he re-thinks his carrer pattern.
0671799320|5.0|While &quot;The Prize&quot; purports to be the history of oil, it could just as easily be in part a history of every major human undertaking of the last century or so.  As Yergin stresses, little that has been achieved in  the 20th century could have been achieved without it.  Starting with the  initial discoveries during the mid-nineteenth century and culminating with  the Gulf War, this is a sweeping story in the mode of David McCullogh's  &quot;The Path Between the Seas.&quot;  Yergin is a insightful and talented  writer and the book reads like an adventure story.  Along the way, he very  much gives an important history subject its due.
0440219078|5.0|The Giver written by Lois Lowry is based on a powerful and provacative novel, centered around the theme of Eutopia. The movie, Pleasantville comes to mind when I think of this book.  In both stories, the characters arre  placed in the same perfect setting.  The characters live in a black and  white world.  Eventually color is discovered when they become aware of deep  emotions. In The Giver, Lowry forces readers to bring own thoughts into  play by her descriptive writing.  I could see the world he wsa painting  from the very beginning.  &quot;They moistened a little.  The warmth  spread, extending across his shoulders, up his neck, onto the side of hos  face.  He could feel it through his clothed parts, too:  a pleasant,  all-over sensation; and when he licked his lips this time, the air was hot  and heavy.&quot; The characters she created were adventurous and amazingly  believable.  The main character, Jonas, is a young boy who lives in a  perfect set world wwith no pain suffering love or fear.  Everone has their  own assigned role.  He is assigned a special role, The Giver, when he turns  twelve.  The Giver is very important role becuase he keeps the whole  community intact by holding memories; extreme pain to eternal bliss.  While  I read this book I discoverd how important it is to experience suffering,  grieving and complete happiness.   The Giver is a book recommended that  everybody should read.  It gives an escape from reality that everybody  should endure.
B00000K0T8|5.0|this album is so tight. I bought it right when it came out if you don't have it go buy it.
0141301155|4.0|The gates of Mr. Willy Wonka's famous chocolate factory are opening at last- and only five children are allowed inside. The only way they are allowed in is if they have the golden wrapper from a Wonka chocolate bar.  And the five winners are: Augustus Gloop, Veruca salt, Violet Beauregrade,  Mike Teavee, and Charlie Bucket.   Charlie is the main character, and  comes from a poor family made up of his mom, and two sets of grandparents.   When his birthday comes around, he just gets a homemade scarf and a candy  bar.  But candy seems to be the latest craze all over the world, because it  seems that 5 golden wrappers were hidden with the candy bar.  Whoever  discovered the wrappers would win a lifetime of chocolate, after a visit to  Willy Wonka's chocolate factory.  Each day, a new winner was announced.   Day one was Augustus Gloop.  Day two was Veruca Salt.  Day three, Violet  Beaurgrade, and day four was Mike Teavee.   There was one day left for  Charlie to find the golden wrapper.    And after a fortunate buy, Charlie  discovered it.  Able to bring only one person, he brought his grandfather,  who was closest to him.  And the two went hoping for the chance to become  the most famous people in the world.  I think this book has an  interesting plot, with lots of interesting changes happening to Charlie  along the way. Overall, I enjoyed this book, and I strongly recommend it to  anyone.
B000002MG1|5.0|What can I say but wow? When I first got interested in R.E.M. I spent a long time trying to side whether to buy this one or Out of Time first. Looking back, Out of Time was the better introduction. This album would  probably be better for people who already have at least one R.E.M. album,  but is a definite must for any true fan. It has its one weak moment (New  Orleans Instrumental No. 1 really doesn't belong here.) but the rest is all  unbelievably beautiful. The added strings take it to another level-  &quot;Nightswimming&quot; &quot;The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite&quot; and  &quot;Everybody Hurts&quot; (My pick for the best comfort song ever) are  among my favorites.I also love &quot;Man on the Moon&quot;, &quot;Try Not  To Breathe&quot;, and &quot;Sweetness Follows&quot; (Listen for the lyrics  on the latter two, they're really touching - this is probably the best  R.E.M. album ever for lyrics.) &quot;Find the River&quot; is is the last of  my favorites, and one of the best album closers ever. Oddly enough, I don't  really like &quot;Drive&quot;, which seems to be a lot of other fans  favorite,but it's still way above average, so it doesn't completely ruin  the whole thing.
B000002LVB|5.0|No, my title does not imply that every Velvet fan hates &quot;Loaded&quot;, it is simply a pun based on the first song.<br />     Yet  for those who are unwilling, here is my two cents.  Every Velvet album,  including &quot;Loaded&quot; is as classic as albums come and all four are  without a doubt worthy of your collection.  It's obvious this album is  classic just by hearing the unforgettable opener and closer-&quot;Who Loves  The Sun&quot; and &quot;Oh, Sweet Nuthin'&quot;.  I always wanted to see  &quot;Who Loves The Sun&quot; wind up as a silly film tune, so you can  imagine my reaction when that song, as well as &quot;Oh, Sweet  Nuthin'&quot;, appeared in the recent movie, &quot;High Fidelity&quot; (a  flick for any true music fan).  Anyway, the album itself is a must for all  real Velvet listeners.  Sure, I think Doug Yule is one of history's biggest  idiots for trying to continue the band without any of the oringinal  members, yet I cannot deny that his contributions to this album aren't  horrible.  His vocals aren't all that bad for a Velvet and besides he had  already done vocals before (&quot;Candy Says&quot; on the third album).  In  fact, &quot;Loaded&quot; keeps the tradition of earlier Velvet albums by  having at least one other vocalist besides Lou Reed.  The first album had  Nico of course, &quot;White Light/White Heat&quot; had John Cale, and the  third album also featured Maureen's voice.  The lineup for  &quot;Loaded&quot; may be different...but is that really such a suprise?   The lineup changed slightly for each album.<br />     Anyway, every Velvet  album suits a certain mood and &quot;Loaded&quot; is perfect for when you  are looking for something in the middle from the band-not entirely calm yet  not entirely rowdy either.  I simply love it, but then again I also love  all their stuff.  &quot;Head Held High&quot; is Lou Reed's character coming  at you with full force.  When I witness this fun-loving album and compare  it with the album fromhell-&quot;White Light/White Heat&quot;-I can only  chuckle at the open-mindedness of one of the greatest bands ever.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I have been a die hard Pearl Jam fan ever since Ten was put on the shelves.  I am very pleased with Binaural.  After having No Code and Yield making many Pearl Jam fans displeased, Binaural takes a quick trip back to  the Ten and Versus days.  The first two tracks, Breakerfall, and God's  Dice, sounds like tracks off of versus.. fast, heavy, and great singing.   There are many great songs that you can listen to over and over, but of  course with every album, there are a few you will skip right over.
0671634062|2.0|I guess I was expecting more than a single tape for my $10.  I think there is probably a lot of good information in the book, but it's hard to tell from a single hour of talk on a single tape.  I recommend getting the book  and forgetting the tape for this one.
B00000IAU3|5.0|I heard the song &quot;thank you&quot; when watching the movieSliding Doors and was intrigued. Then I saw the video for &quot;HereWith You&quot; on the Box about twice and was totally taken...She's like a mix of Sarah McLachlan, Portishead, and Dolores O'Reardon (cranberries).  I listened to the CD at work for a week straight. It just keeps on getting better. Just awesome, I love it.  She's an amazing vocalist, soulful, techno, melodic, and cutting to core.  She runs the gamut of a womans feelings in and out of a relationship. Every song on here is truly felt when she sings it. Can't wait for her next album.
630575067X|5.0|Here's the real deal. Many are not looking at the big picture, here. Some have claimed that they wanted this movie to be the movie to end all movies. How can it do that when there are still two more to come? HOLD TIGHT,  CRITICS! The reason why the American populace did not recieve this movie  well was because it was above their heads. Too sophisticated. Those who  claim that this film has no plot possibly can't see the parallels between  this movie and history. How do wars start? Ninety percent of the time by  economic dispute! Why are we so attached to Star Wars? Because for some odd  reason, we can all relate to it! Why? Because Star Wars is subtly a  parallel on humanity. It depicts the way human emotion, conflict, politics,  religion, and relationships all work together, and this is where Episode  One succeeds the most. George Lucas has expanded into new theological  territory that does not consist of explosions every five minutes (though  action is definitely not lost) and the way that America deals with what it  doesn't understand is by exclaiming: &quot;I hate Jar Jar Binks!&quot; The  reason Episode One seems vague and detached from the other movies is  because it does not have the next two installments yet to connect itself.  Star Wars has not sold out. On the contrary, George is expanding the  trilogy into what will end up becoming an incredibly moving saga. For  instance, in ESB when Luke claims he is not afraid and Yoda eerily states  &quot;You will be...You will be!&quot;, why does he say it in that stern,  somehow psychotic tone? My guess is because Anakin's cockiness will be a  major factor leading to his fall to the dark side, and Yoda makes sure  early on Luke does not relive Anakin's fate by shooting down his false  security. If that were the case, how much more will that moment give us  chills!  Everyone relax, and let Lucas develop his own universe, and let's  all just enjoy the ride. Episode One is a fine movie and opinions will rise  once thesix-part saga is finished in its entirety.
B000002UW1|5.0|Wow. If you like R.E.M. this is a must have cd. The music style is slighly diffrent from their other cds but wow! great songs even though its a little old. For thoes that didnt get the title cd name is document. shreaders  destroy bad or incriminating documents. This cd may be incriminating but  definantly not bad!
6304436386|5.0|This is the best movie ive ever seen. A real tear jerker and moving. You may feel uneasy at the end but Besson gives a sense closure and peace in a beutiful film. A MASTERPIECE!
0064440346|5.0|Owl's adventures with The Guest, Strange Bumps, Tear-Water Tea, Up stairs &amp; Downstairs &amp; The Moon are passionate &amp; dramatic. Tear-Water Tea is my favorite &amp; my children would beg me to read this one over &amp; over again. Tear-Water Tea is a bitter-sweet brew. This little book  &amp; the friendly, affectionate Owl were one of my children's best friends  in their early years.  They loved the ideas of looking at life the way Owl  does, they blink in anticipation as the stories gather speed &amp; they  hoot with laughter at Owl's take on life, then they snuggled with  satisfaction when it's all done &amp; we've talked about it...
B00003CX5A|5.0|Director Tim Burton has directed many a fantastical lyrical fantasy, among his best are &quot;Batman,&quot; &quot;Edward Scissorhands,&quot; &quot;Vincent,&quot; and &quot;Mars Attacks!&quot; &quot;Sleepy  Hollow,&quot; however, outclasses these all in heart, pacing, character  development (excluding Christina Ricci's passable but utterly forgettable  female lead, that is), spirit, mood, and something called (in these days of  overly-glossy melodrama like &quot;Star Wars Episode 1,&quot;  &quot;Tarzan,&quot; and, sadly, &quot;The World is Not Enough&quot;--Bond  19) movie magic. This is a film for the ages. Considering the critical and  box office responses (netting over $200 million), expect a sequel to this  heartfelt masterpiece!
B00000J7J4|2.0|Good for Santana for putting out a new album and all, but some people just need to know when to hang up their guitars and go home.<br />After listening to this album, you get the feeling that this album should be credited to  &quot;Santana AND FRIENDS&quot;, not the man himself.  It seems he is  responsible for maybe 10 percent of the album-  simply supplying a  repetitively hypnotic, wailing guitar solo throughout each track.  <br />The  music is decent-  I was a big fan of &quot;Smooth&quot; until I heard it  for about the 80-millionth time, and now I'm completely burned out on it-   I can't stand it.  All in all, it seems like all of the guest apperances  are either one (or both) of two things-  1)  to cover up the fact that  Santana's skill as a musician is waning, and adding a fresh new talent to  his latino jug band will help spice up the sound, or 2)  a shameless and  desperate attempt to get a hold in the Gen-X demographic, a demographic  that has never really been responsive to Santana's music in the first  place.  Well, I've never been a huge fan of Santana (I think he's very  overrated), so this review could be considered bias-  if you like the guy,  go buy the album, you'll like it too.  But us Led  Zeppelin/Aerosmith/Hendrix/AC/DC guys aren't gonna get much of a kick out  of it.
B00004SCX6|1.0|man i heard my girlfriend playing this horrible cd, i was ready to throw her stereo out the window lol. britney has no talent, she is a lip synching fool i have no idea why people like her. At least someone like Christina  Aguilera has some substance and a great voice behind her, Britney is  nothing but terrible choreographed dancing and a voice that is heavily  messed with equalizers and computers. awful. her songs sound just like her  old album, please people stop making this talentless girl rich, stop buying  her garbage.
0345350499|5.0|This book is the best! For once an athor portraid the part of a priestess right!  I am very happy with this book, and if you like magic, love, and spells this book is definately for you!
0440219078|5.0|I loved this book! It kept me hooked for hours! Once I picked this book up I could not put it down. This book is fascinating with its different point of view and completely surreal content with its mixture of light and darkness with color. This story is in a black and white setting with one  boy that is given images of color and memories. There are different twists  and turns that surprised me and some parts made me upset, but I could not  put this book down! I had to see how the book ended and how it all worked  out. I highly recommend this book to people who want to read a strange but  great book. I loved it!
0380788624|3.0|If you liked Snow Crash you will like Cryptonomicon.<br />The character development has many nice touches.<br />Swear words in the characters' dialogue is normal, but the use of swear words in the author's narrative  bothered me.  As did referring to Japanese as Nips.<br />I approve of the  inclusion of some technical computer science, math and cryptography.
B000002GJH|5.0|Cornell as a songsmith says he is proud of this work, and the other TOD members must be as well. And some might say it is just soundjam plus pearlgarden, but it ain't. This is a far superior thing than just the sum  of two parts, like a dialectically new creation in a more developed  state.<br />It is amazing how the process of mourning and grieving a close  friend would give such a masterpiece. Here is such a commitment to the  memory of a prodigy that the music flows just like a feeling. The opener  tune &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot; is heavenly in deed, with a cool  starting arpegio followed by a heavy riff, great songcraft (..words never  listen teachers they never learn...). Next &quot;Reach Down&quot; the  hardest song of the set, still goes on the passed friend memory, and has a  wonderful guitar solo interlude, twin guitars (McCready, Gossard,  Cornell?)and in some bars a third one added. &quot;Hungerstrike&quot;  depicts the first appearance of Vedder, who happened to rehearse with their  future mates, sharing in great form the frontman duties with Cornell, whose  vocals reach a wide pitch register through out the record. I like the  lyrics (...I don't mind stealing bread from the mouths of decadence but I  can't feed on the powerless when my cup's already overfilled....but I'm  growing hungry...). &quot;Pushing Forward Back&quot; is a grinding tune  composed by Gossard/Ament written by Cornell. But hey, none of the  remaining songs are fillers, everyone is a piece of art and feeling on its  own right. Try &quot;Call me a Dog&quot;, I cannot help humming the chorus  thru' all my working day (...and when it's my time to throw the next stone  I'll call u beautiful if I call at all ...), Cornell's vocals are really  impressive. He won't reach as higher a note as say Gillan or Byron, but  what strenght and feeling, changing effortlessly to the bass registers.  &quot;Times of trouble&quot; is another cowork of Gossard and Cornell, the  acoustic guitar arpegiosgives a sense of solemnity, and the lyrics shows  their concern about the skag risks. &quot;Wooden Jesus&quot; makes you  think of fake religious preachers, I ain't sure what Chris really means,  but I, too, geez will cut you in on 20% of my future sin. &quot;Your  Savior&quot; is a grungy tune, again a cowork, depicts a funkier edge on  the guitar riffs underneath Cornell's great voice. &quot;Four Walled  World&quot; rhythmically takes you back to the SH2H or CMAD territories,  another great song. Last but not least &quot;All Night Thing&quot; softer  tune to take us out of an amazing set o songs. What's left to say? Aye! the  rhythm section never looses a note, Ament's bass and Cameron's skins  beating and cymbals chimimg throughout all the songs are perfect. Although  comparisons are hateful, I would rate Cameron in the same quality of  drummers as Ginger Baker, Ian Paice or the late Keith Moon, a small step  ahead of the also late Bonzo.   Thank you Temple of the Dog for this  masterpiece, I share your grieve and won't ask for more. Thanx my daughter  for asking me to buy you this cd.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I thought Pearl Jam was back on the right track with Yield.  Yield was an oustanding effort with the type of creativity found only in their best work to date: Vitalogy.  Binoral is a step back to the No Code experiment which  was a bit more bland and self-serving.  The more I listen to Binoral, the  more I like it.  However, with all thier past recordings(except No Code)  the love was immediate.  <br />Pearl Jam is still one of the best.  This is a  good recording.  I just want the Vitalogy creativity and edge back.
6305320802|5.0|I just had to comment regarding the person who slammed Eddie Albert because he doesn't have a convincing Persian accent in the movie.<br />Talk about missing the point!  The character of the traveling salesman is  supposed to be a PHONY Persian!  He's supposed to be as Persian as Bill  Clinton!  An actor successfully playing the role uses a bad accent ON  PURPOSE.  The guy who played it in the original Broadway cast used  something close to a Yiddish accent.  If Eddie Albert's accent kept  changing throughout the movie, this does not mean he did a BAD job of  portraying the character.  It means he did a GOOD job.<br />The traveling  salesman in Oklahoma! is similar to Harold Hill in The Music Man -- he  travels around trying to gyp people in small towns by selling them phony  products -- one of them, in this case, being an Egyptian elixir.  Eddie  Albert played his role so well in this movie that 4 years later he was  selected to replace Robert Preston in the original Broadway run of The  Music Man.<br />While I'm worked up, someone else said he prefers the  CinemaScope version to the Todd-AO.  He says he realizes this puts him in  the minority.  I'll say!  The Todd-AO version is better in every way, shape  and form, and that's the only one that ever should have been shown to the  public, anyway.  The CinemaScope version is an anomaly of movie history.   The C-version looks brown and muddy.  The Todd-AO version is bright and  colorful.  I know &quot;brown and muddy&quot; is in style these days, and  &quot;bright and colorful&quot; is out, but &quot;bright and colorful&quot;  is much more indicative of the musicals of the 1950s, and evidently was the  original intent of the filmmakers, and really SHOULD be the only version  available.  I have no nostalgic feelings for the C-version, which is the  only one I ever saw for 40 years.  Going from the C-version to the Todd-AO  is similar to going from Kansas to Oz -- everything turns to color!
0783117388|5.0|Sex and the City is, in a few words, the wittyest, funniest, and most entertaining piece of television on the air. With the passing of its British counterpart, &quot;Absolutely Fabulous,&quot; thank God that HBO  has come up with a show that is intelligent and hilarious. Carrie Bradshaw,  a &quot;sex anthropologist&quot; who writes a column about the modern  woman's dating woes, finally finds the right man in Mr. Big, although in  one second season episode she thinks the relationship is over because he  won't let her leave a hair dryer at his apartment. Carrie is the only  &quot;single and fabulous&quot; woman that has a stable relationship.  Although she sometimes strays, &quot;He was straight and a smoker.  Everything that I was looking for that night.&quot; Her nympho high society  friend Samantha has &quot;survived the dating scene in New York for the  past 30 years by becoming a hybrid. The body of a woman with the ego of a  man.&quot; Samantha at least has the decency to sleep with a man only once  before moving on, and on and on and on. Charlotte on the other hand, is a  naive good girl who seems to lure bad boys. Miranda is a successful lawyer  but is a paranoid woman, suffering from various neurosis. In one episode,  she has the fantasy that she will remain single forever and end of dying  eaten by her cat. Miranda prevents this by overfeeding her cat. These are  all very real and interesting women, whose problems you can watch and say,  &quot;Yeah that's exactly what happens!&quot; The show is pure pleasure to  behold, with Carrie and her whacked-out friends trying to survive the  single life in a New York filled with neverending chaos. I hope that they  keep struggling forever, because without Sex and the City, Sunday nights  wouldn't be as much fun! This show is definitely for mature people who  enjoy watching four women work out problems that we all have in real life,  only much much funnier.
B000002UAU|5.0|All of a sudden, everyone is bashing this album!  People still give it five stars, but now it's become totally unhip to proclaim it the best album the Beatles ever did.  Ten or so years ago, nothing could touch SGT.  PEPPER.  Rolling Stone named it the greatest rock album ever made, and few  disagreed.  So what's changed in the year 2000?<br />Everyone's carrying the  torch now for REVOLVER, THE WHITE ALBUM or ABBEY ROAD.  Great albums all,  but why is SGT. PEPPER the first album that people are so quick to say  ain't as good as ABBEY ROAD?  And why do more Amazon customer reviews  appear for this album than any other Beatles album?  Why does the PET  SOUNDS - SGT. PEPPER debate rage on, thirty-three years later?<br />I think  it's because this record is suffering a greatest-album-ever backlash.  People like to argue and stir up debate about this record, but in the year  2010, we'll still be arguing whether SGT. PEPPER is the greatest Beatles  album.  We'll do this because quite simply, SGT. PEPPER remains the gold  standard to which all Beatles albums will forever be measured.
0783226888|3.0|Based on the book by master spy novelist Frederick Forsyth, the Jackal is a loosely based remake of the Brtitish film, Day of the Jackal (also the title of the novel).  This time it is Bruce Willis and not Sir Edward Fox  who bears the title of the intriguing character known only as the  &quot;Jackal&quot;. Originally, the French president, Charles DeGaulle was  the intended target of the high-price assasin. This time however, not only  is the target the First Lady of the United States, but a fictional  character as well. The original film is not only more convincing because it  targets a real political figure (DeGaulle), but the climate of the Cold War  ( 1963)  seems a far more fashionable era for films such as these.  Furthermore, Bruce Willis is greatly upstaged by Richard Gere, who portrays  man  convicted for his terrorist activities in the Irish Republican Army,   and is released only for the purpose of leading the authorities to Willis.  But because unlike the real film, the screen attention is divided equally  among Willis and Gere, it keeps the audience from really discovering what  it takes to be a character such as the Jackal. In the original film which  was shot in Europe and allowed for a much better unveiling of characters,  the Jackal is shown as a clever, mysterious and merciless individual who  plans carefully and covers all angles before undertaking such a daunting  task as assasinating a high-ranking public figure. In this version, the  Jackal (Willis) is more of an actor playing a role than an assasin planning  the murder of the century. This is an entertaining film for its locations  and special effects which include exotic weapons and a lot of explosions.  But at the same time it is a very dry and hastily done picture. And if you  are like the many who enjoy stories of espionage and international crisis,  you would have been better off renting the old version. Especially  considering the old version is far less fabricated.
B000001EPB|5.0|This is an awesome cd.  The second I went to see the show I just had to buy it.  The music makes you want to have the ability to dance as the &quot;Lord&quot; does.  The second I turn on the cd and listen to it I get  up and dance around my room with wow and astounding wonder as to how it is  done.  You won't be disappointed if you buy the cd...I sure wasn't.  If you  are looking for a similar one look at Feet of Flames, it was just as  brilliant and heart stoping.
079073639X|2.0|Director Barry Levinson (Good Morning Vietnam!, Wag the Dog) takes a departure from Vox Americana and enters the realm of science fiction/horror for the first time. Based on the novel by Michael Crichton, Sphere is an  intricate psychological, deep-sea mind-bender with philosophical roots. The  United States military has discovered a 300-year-old spacecraft resting at  the bottom of the ocean. In its needs to find out its secrets, the powers  that be hire an elite group of scientists to dive 1000 feet into the other  wild blue yonder. Dustin Hoffman leads the all-star cast as the respected  psychologist, Dr. Norm Goodman. Along with his colleagues, mathematics  genius Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson) and Sharon Stone as Beth Halperin.  The group finds out that they are in for more than they bargained for when  they discover that the ship contains a large and mysterious sphere inside  it whose function is equally cryptic. As strange communications begin  occurring, the audience is taken on a rollercoaster of speculation as to  what is happening. The film unfolds slowly to attest that what in fact is  going on is at a level greater than that of the physical or readily  comprehensible. What is however quite visible is that the sphere is an  incantation of emotion which quite bluntly forces mankind to face the sum  of all fears. Sphere possesses the claustrophobic terror seen in such films  as Alien, while at the same time evoking the intrigue of the Abyss, with  its stratum of serene blue mist which completely sets the mood for an  escapade into a world which is as overtly cold and removed as outer space.  However, the fact Sphere has the temperament of other science fiction films  does not take away from its unique communication to its audience. Sphere  stands alone in its power to convey the message that as humans, we are far  too often ready to assume that we can deal with anything on any given  level. Sphere will shatter any previous notions that we had about  ourselves.
1573226521|4.0|The hype about this book, way before the movie, was so great that it isn't surprising that the novel didn't live up to the hype, at least in my humble opinion.   I did, however, enjoy the book and bought Garland's 2nd novel  when it came out.
0767803434|4.0|Legendary German film director Wolfgang Petersen brings on another heart-pounding, steel-reinforced, political action-thriller.<br />The cold-war is over but that hardly means that some don't want to exert their muscle  over the United States. This high-flying adventure is not just another  &quot;airplane got hijacked&quot; type of movie. Rather, it is a special  effects and stunt extravaganza which stretches the last vein of adrenaline  and uses a great line-up of actors to do so. Harrison Ford leads the free  world as well as the 40,000 foot high adventure as President James  Marshall. A group of pro-Soviet patriates, led by who else but the most  convincingly psychotic actor on screen, Gary Oldman , have taken over the  presidential aircraft known as Air Force One in order to grab the Western  world by the  b---s (and they do a thorough job of it) in order to ensure  that their leader, one General Radek, played by Jurgen Prochnow, ( Das  Boot, The Man Inside,  English Patient) is freed in order for him to  attempt to restore his regime and take a shot at the title of the being new  Stalin. The cast also includes Glenn Close as the swift-thinking,  decision-making (or is she?)  vice-president and Wendy Crewson, who has  appeared in such films as The Doctor and To Gillian, On Her 37th Birthday,  as the First Lady. This is not another Executive Decision or another  Turbulence. Instead it is arguably the best action, A-list film of the  year. The special effects enhanced by digital sound are remarkable.  <br />Starring: Harrison Ford Gary Oldman Glenn Close Wendy Crewson<br />Directed  by: Wolfgang Petersen ( Das Boot, In The Line Of Fire, Outbreak)
6305627347|5.0|I felt really silly going to see this movie (being a 25 yr. old female) but, I have to tell you.  I laughed so hard I almost had soda coming out of my nose (just like the 14 yr. old next to me).  This movie is pure hilarity  and the mere fact that the cursing of a bunch of (what is it?) 3rd graders?  Can make a  movie so funny, is very sad.  YET, as you all know, it WORKS!      *even my very mature 50 yr. old mother loves this movie.<br />The songs are  classic, the writing suberb, and it's all done with such wit, charm and  down right genius on the parts of Trey and Matt.   These guys are a real  talent.<br />The whole concept of &quot;Blame Canada&quot; is too funny for  words.  There are so many layers that's it easy to just chalk it up to a  cartoon with no redeeming value but, that's such an unfair statement.   There's a lot of dept to this movie.  And, it's just too funny for words.   So worth a look!
0792833236|5.0|A mood masterpiece from director Martin Scorsese, Raging Bull is the authority on boxing films as well as cinematic biographies. The life and times of Jake La Motta (Robert De Niro) are as troubled and bumpy as that  of any great figure. A furious man from the backstreets of the Bronx, La  Motta rises from the ravages of poverty to become one of the most  unbeatable contenders in boxing history. Set amid the backdrop of the  1940's and 50's, this film is the modern pinnacle of the always-arresting  theme of Rise and Fall.  A man who had everything he wanted, La Motta was  forever haunted by personal demons that were expressed through forceful  paranoia and the obsessive need for reassurance. Driven by anger rather  than passion, he was able to defeat any opponent with sheer grit and thirst  for blood. Among his Achilles heels were his young wife, Vikki, whom he met  when she was only fifteen. Moving at a steady and always involving beat, La  Motta is shown taking more beatings, winning more titles and  self-destructing. As through a looking glass, there is always a feeling of  not knowing what this fighting man will do next. And in the great tradition  of  Scorsese's Italian American fables, this film forges a somber and  exciting attitude all the way through. Intensifying the film's dismal and  violent beauty is the soundtrack, which mainly consists of  the Intermezzo,  from Cavalleria Rusticana, an Italian opera by Pietro Mascagni. This choice  of scores not only furthers the feel of darkness, but it immediately  foreshadows La Motta's downfall, while at the same time bestowing Italian  artistry on the picture.     Always worried that his wife is cheating on  him, and thinking that his counterparts are working against him, Jake La  Motta ventures beyond the point of no return. As the film's flashback  approach illustrates,  Raging Bull is more than just a sports film. Rather,  it is a look at how a person's actions decide his fate. It is an in-depth  journey intohow people can shun those around them to the point of doing  irreparable damage, and what carelessness and misuse of ones own limits can  sow. Robert De Niro and Martin Scorsese have undoubtedly constructed a  picture of stark reality and emotional fire. De Niro stretches his  abilities even farther than he does in Taxi Driver. This film achieves  mythical direction and allegorical character figuration. With its black and  white colour as well as its unmistakably subdued tone, Raging Bull delivers  great performances not only from De Niro, but from Joe Pesci as Joe La  Motta (Jakes' brother) and Cathy Moriarty (Vikki La Motta). In between the  ring matches, lies the story of a broken spirit with a destiny for  suffering, for this story is Jake La Motta himself, and not a third person  reciting it.
B000001GQY|5.0|It would be unfair, perhaps, to require any recording of the Second Concerto to match or exceed the Furtwaengler/Fischer of 1942.  That live performance is the non plus ultra in sheer visceral excitement; may, in  fact, be the most exciting recording ever made (with the possible exception  of the Furtwaengler Brahms Fourth Symphony from the 40s).  At any rate,  this Jochum/Gilels Second is splendid: broadly paced though flexible where  needed, sumptuous, full of the strong sinews of healthy life, with a wise  and generous measure of exultation and enthusiasm.<br />The First is hardly  less grand.  It is (at least to my mind) difficult for performers to pull  off the beginning's fiercely concentrated and powerful explosion -- to mix  properly the overwhelmingly volatile elements of a barely-controlled  detonation, with the requisite elements of phrasal articulation.  But our  heroes here manage quite as well as Barenboim and Barbirolli: the result  is, if anything, even more intense, and enjoys even greater freedom in  &quot;feeling its way&quot; through the diverse sections of the exposition.<br />All in all, this set represents a tremendous opportunity to secure  recordings of two indispensable concertos in near-definitive performances.  Heartily recommended.  (And the sound is great, too!)
0553278223|5.0|This was one of my favorite all time books, and one of the first I have ever read by him.  It is completely all sci-fi, and is very well written.  The ideas that he presents in this book are just so awsome it leaves you  wondering about where we are headed.  The end is what makes this book an  old time classic.  I have never read a better ending in my life.  The  characters are wonderful through out this whole book.  Each chapter is a  different little story, but they do connect in some way.  I suggest that  you read this book.  It is one of his best.

0833575112|4.0|The Twit's is a hilarious comedy about a husband (Mr. Twit) and a wife (Mrs. Twit). Throughout the book they are trying to play pranks on each other. For example: at one point in the book Mrs. Twit is really steamed  about Mr. Twit, so she decides to play a really mean trick on Mr. Twit.  Whenever Mr. Twit would go downstairs to work on mechanical stuff, she  would take his cane upstairs and add a tiny slice of wood to make him think  he was shrinking.  She continued this little sherade for just about a  month. After just about a month Mr. Twit started to cry. This is just one  of the many little pranks that they pull in the book, so if you want to  read a hilarious book with a really awkward and funny ending, I would  recommend this book to you (I gave it a 8 out of 10)

I obtained another disc at my video rental store and I get the same message.  Is there too much information on this disc and has my Pioneer 414 become  obsolete?

B000002JS0|5.0|When my adventure with the &quot;Thunder from Down Under&quot; began, I was 12.  My dad loves AC/DC.  I took it upon myself to buy &quot;Back In Black&quot;, and thought to myself &quot;This is a pretty good rock  album.&quot;  He said ,&quot;You should get some of their older stuff, it's  ten times better.&quot;  So, when I received this CD as a gift, I  immediately popped it in.  I was totally blown away.  This was the  dirtiest, rawest, most beautiful thing I had ever heard in my entire life.   Anything less than five stars is blasphemy.
B00001NFCY|5.0|I would like to begin by saying, I wanted to give this cd more than 5 stars because it is more than a perfect album. I am consider myself the biggest Creed fan in South Africa. They are by far the best band and this  album cements this. I listen to this cd from the first track to the last,  Scott Stapp's voice is powerful and causes me to get a lump in my throat  when i listen to the cd. This is the best album I have in my collection.  With Arms Wide Open is a powerful song and my favorite off the album. I  prefer this album to My Own Prison as My Own Prison took more than 1  listen, before I really loved it. This album I have loved ever since I  heard Higher playing on the radio. This album is a must for any fan of  music.
B000000Y59|5.0|This is an incredible album.  It's some of the finest, most beautiful piano playing I've ever heard.  I'm not really even a Bill Evans fan (although I definitely like him).  I picked this album up by accident  basically, and its been one of my favorite jazz albums for about 5 years. I  highly recommend it.
B000002ADT|5.0|Before I purchased Kind of Blue, I thought that jazz was music that was &quot;boring&quot; or &quot;for old people&quot;.

There is not a single wasted second on this entire CD (including the  alternate take of Flamenco Sketches)! Columbia has done an excellent job  remastering and repackaging this classic. This is an absolute must for any  music collection

B000002KLP|5.0|Unfortunately, since Prince's name change, his &quot;weirdness&quot; has overshadowed his music. That is a real shame, because he has released some of the most incredible music of the past thirty years!<br />Dirty Mind is  probably my all time favorite Prince album. It still has all of the bite  that it did when it was released 20 years ago. Time has not diminished it  one bit! The music here breaks down barriers. For example, When You Were  Mine combines Funk, New Wave, and The Beatles. The lyrics are definitely  not for the faint of heart. But, if you like music that gets in your face  and takes chances, look no farther!
0684867621|3.0|I've just recently finished reading this book and in my opinion it is just a simple ride of a book, with many emotional ups and downs. The plot is fine, the story is well written , judging that it is from the point of view  of a nine year old. It is what I would call a mediocre piece of work. It  is, in a sense, sort of long and tiring, leaving the readers feeling sorry  for the main character as she experiences an endless array of survival  problems. It is not boring , just wearisome. I thought that the conflict  was resolved rather too quickly in that on meeting the Wasp God, a terror  that unfailingly evoked feelings of fear, he was quite easily defeated. It  is not detestable, it is ok, and in fact, the storyline is quite  enthralling, a little girl fantasising about her favourite baseball hero so  as to ward off all fears. Not an edge-of-the-seater but simple and nice.
B00003Q08R|1.0|I have been a huge McCartney/Beatles fan for years. For my own personal taste, the albums style and arrangements are not for me. Paul admits making this album for his own enjoyment but was persuaded to release it by  friends. You, however, may like this direction Paul took in 1980.
B00004NHCC|5.0|Sarah Vaughen is without a Doubt one of The Greatest Vocalists the World has ever Heard&amp;too Have Clifford Brown Among the Many Other Great Musicians Featured here make this a Must Have.The Arrangements&amp;Her  Voice Go Hand too a Glove.Beautiful Music from a Beautiful Soul.
B00004SCX6|5.0|After her first album, I was hoping she would lose the little girl image and songs.  Well she did!   The beats on all her songs are just excellent, with the exception of Dear Diary, which is kind of corny.  But I love the  edgy beats on &quot;Stronger&quot;, &quot;Dont go knockin on my door&quot;,  and &quot;cant make you love me.&quot;  and of course the irresistable  &quot;Oops...I did it again.&quot;  Obviously, she doesnt have a strong  voice, but good enough to deliver her talent.  Regardless, that she cant  sing like her counterparts (Christina, Jessica etc.), but with her maturing  in music and performing, I believe she is well on her way to becoming the  next Janet Jackson and Madonna. So I would recommend anyone to buy this CD  that loves good edgy pop music.  Watch out for Ms.Spears in the many years  to come.  I know I certainly will.

B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt.Pepper is the Bible of Concept albums.Every group tries a record like this one,but doesn't come close.Paul got his idea by listening to the Beach Boys,&quot;Pet Sounds.&quot; There's not one single from Sgt.Pepper that  was a hit on the radio,but were still talking about &quot;Sgt.Pepper's  Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; after 33years. The record starts by telling  us about this new band,Sgt.Pepper,then Ringo,as Billy Shears,sings &quot;A  Little Help from my friends.&quot; This is fantastic.Having Ringo singing  the first song off the record,and he's great.The Beatles worked as a team  on this album,even though its Pauls baby. John Lennon's songs are the  best,but they were experiments. I've read in John's last interview how they  always spent more time on Pauls songs then his. When Elton John remade  &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,&quot; and John Lennon co-produced,and  sang backup,he was very happy with the recording,and it was a number one  hit for Elton. &quot;Getting Better&quot; is my favorite song from the  CD,and its used as some TV Ad,what a crime.In a couple of years,Paul will  be able to sing,&quot;When I'm 64&quot; and he will be. How fast time  flies.George Harrison's,&quot;Within you and Without you&quot;finally  showcases George's great songwriting and singing. The last song on the  record is a classic.John's &quot;A Day in the Life.&quot; Just a simple  song,about nothing.This was the first time people thought there was a sign   that Paul was dead .Even the inside cover when Paul has his back toward the  picture.   This album was made after the Beatles didn't have to worry about  touring anymore.They could take there time in the studio,and make the  greatest rock album ever.Also,without George Martin,The Beatles could never  have come up with this classic.He is the 5th Beatle.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is a timeless book. The writing style is superior to many novels, even after 35 years. I admit that I tried reading Dune and then quit(I was in the 7th grade). But after I saw the movie I wanted to read the book. Was  I ever glad that I did! Buy this book. Oh, the sequels. People have mixed  feelings about the sequels, so I recommend that you read them at your local  library before deciding to buy them. P.S. This book is far better than  anything Heinlein ever wrote.

0553278398|5.0|This is the first Foundation-novel I read.  After finishing it, I immediately went to the bookstore to buy 10 other Asimovs, which should say enough.. . . The galaxy sketched by Asimov is so colorfull and realistic,  one is driven to read the entire book at once.  Each department of Trantor  has its own characteristics, just like each culture on our tiny 'Aurora'.   The problems created by these differences are parallel to 'ours' as well.    As I recognised the Big Galactic Problems Asimov adresses in this book in  our modern society, I was curious to see the development of the special  solution Hari Seldon tried to find for them. You can recognise the  scientist in Asimov, when Hari Seldon is asking himself questions about the  development of his psychohistory.  I was very curious about the answers  lined out in the following novels. Furthermore, I was fascinated with the  idea of our Earth transformed into a mere legend, and the unexplainable  'Easterns' and 'Westerns' spread into the vast galaxy. Last but not least,  the plot was very surprising.  Asimov tricked me into some wrong ideas the  entire novel.   I am reading 'Foundation and Empire' now, and I'm still  totally obsessed with it, so I recommend this series to everyone who likes  SF-novels as well as social sciences.
B00004STPT|2.0|You will need: <br />Either no knowledge of classical music OR very forgiving ears.<br />You must mix:<br />One heaping serving of Holst's 'Mars: The Bringer Of War' from 'The Planets'. <br />Roughly three chunks of Richard Wagner,  though most people will know it under the more popular label of 'That Music  From Excalibur'. <br />A few shakes of Vangelis' title music from 1492:  Conquest Of Paradise (another Ridley Scott film -- thank you, Mr. Temp  Music Editor... you have no doubt secured your job on Scott's next pic),  mixed with the umpteenth pastiche of Zimmer's patented 'percussive action  theme', previously heard in scores like CRIMSON TIDE and it's illegitemate  son, THE ROCK. <br />Add an atrocious amount of Henryk Gorecki's Symphony No.  3 (the first movement), only strip the label off and call it &quot;Am I Not  Merciful?&quot;. <br />Sprinkle liberally with Lisa Gerrard's own brand of  moody and atmospheric cues (this will give it all at least a LITTLE  flavor). <br />Do NOT include credits or even courteous annotations of the  sources of most of your music... after all, you've changed every fifth note  to avoid getting sued and most of the original composers are dead anyway.  <br />Half-bake for maybe two months of loud scoring sessions, and there you  have it... <br />Gladiator. A score that deserved SO much better than this.
6305807086|1.0|Sorry, when I watched this movie, I sat there with my mouth open watching in curosity as to when I'd finally be free of this torture.  Maybe I just didn't get it.

B00004SCX6|3.0|When Britney's first cd came out I wasn't a big fan of hers. I even hated some of her songs. I thought she was just another teen pop star who had no talent. But, when I heard this new cd, I changed my perspective. It sounds  like she has more freedom with her songs and is confident with herself. Her  songs have gotten a lot better. The lyrics are more mature and the songs  have more of a beat to them. Even though this cd isn't the best, I would  give it 3 stars. &quot;Lucky&quot; is the best song on the cd.Britney still  has a way to go, but she is on her way.
B000003BD3|5.0|This is a fun one, showcasing as it does the Stones' burgeoning blues attack in all of its raw, as-yet-unpolished energy. I suspect that the  stripped-down, coke-and-blues-tinged &quot;You Can't Always Get What You  Want&quot; -- in particular -- may well be one of the album's strongest  efforts, and the remaining songs in the Stones' extended set offer some  exhilirating moments, as well.<br />The Who's &quot;A Quick One&quot; is a  great performance, and may well be better than the &quot;definitive&quot;  live version found on the band's **Live at Leeds** album, but is quite  honestly the most poorly recorded and inadequately produced track on **Rock  and Roll Circus**. The &quot;A Quick One&quot; found on the remastered  **Live at Leeds**, on the other hand, is luminous.<br />And on to the other  contributors....The Jethro Tull effort (&quot;Song for Jeffrey&quot;) is a  fantastic one, both tighter and more &quot;studio-sounding&quot; than the  &quot;Song for Jeffrey&quot; found on the band's **Living in the Past**  double album (the studio cut seems to suffer from extensive overdubbing,  even on my remastered Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab UltraDisc **Living in the  Past**). Taj Mahal's effort (&quot;Ain't That a Lot of Love&quot;) is a  revelation of sorts: An eminently bumpable, terrifically *fun* blues piece  that probably should have served to win him a more mainstream following,  had **Rock and Roll Circus** been released in either '68 or '69 (as  originally intended).<br />And then there's the Dirty Mac -- Wow. With a  lineup that includes Lennon, Clapton, Richards and Mitch Mitchell, the  Dirty Mac's contribution (&quot;Yer Blues&quot;) has value simply as an  historical concelebration of British Bluesiness. But the Mac's &quot;Yer  Blues&quot; scintillates, rocks, and sounds to my (perhaps beleaguered)  ears altogether more satisfying (and LSD-blues-tinged) than the Beatles'  seminal **White Album** studio cut. In the final analysis, **Rock and Roll  Circus**may well be a &quot;must-own&quot; album simply by virtue of this  defining moment alone.<br />And a brief thought on the Marianne Faithful/Yoko  Ono pieces: I'd write them off as so much filler. In a more optimistic  moment, I'd say that they're necessary lowpoints that help to make the  album's stronger moments -- essentially every other track -- appear all the  more compelling.<br />But I'm rarely that optimistic.

Atticus,  their father, has to make many hard decisions about racism and other  things. If you read this book, you'll never look at a father to children  relationship the same way again.
B00004SCX6|5.0|This CD is much better than Baby One More Time (which was great).  My favorite song on the CD is Lucky.  I highly Recommend this CD.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If there is a soul who has not heard this album, and happens to stumble upon this review, there is something I want you to know about OK Computer: It is humerous! People like to focus on its sadness. But much of the album  is tongue in cheek.      Dont lose sight of the humor in the record as you  pass through tones that are sublime or jangly, insane or intense, melodic  or atonal. It is filled with moods, but we tend to focus on the morbid  ones.       Also, if you do purchase this CD, (I highly recommend you do)  keep listening deeper into the music. It is filled with little touches that  reveal themselves to you slowly.
B00004SCX6|5.0|When Britney first came out, I thought I would hate her until I died (I'm more of a Madonna-Blink182-Courtney Love kinda person)but this album has proven me wrong. This album shows that she has matured vocally and music-wise. The songs are catchy--the perfect recipe for a pop song. The  only song I got sick of was &quot;Dear Diary&quot; (if you like ballads,  it's perfect, but I can barely stand ballads). The bizarre thing is that  this album actually has made me appreciate her earlier works and I'm  considering buying her first album.
0688014291|5.0|I was a little disappointed when 'The One Minute Manager' arrived in the mail and I saw its small size and large fonts. However, this tiny little fairy-tale is the best management book I've read. I strongly recommend this book for managers in all fields, including professors in academia. 'The One Minute Manager' takes less than an hour to read, and if you have any interest in becoming a better manager or a stronger leader, surely you can risk 60 minutes of your time? The ideas are not contrived, artificial mechanisms that interfere with our natural personalities. Instead, the entire strategy can be implemented by following a few simple rules that feel natural and are easy to perform and maintain. Sound too good to be true?  Just try it!<br />A word of caution though, use of the strategy assumes the individuals on the manager's team are intelligent, and the tools presented are designed to encourage subordinates to become more independent and responsible, not reliant on a manager's approval, input or direction on minor decisions. Any manager who wants to be involved in all aspects of a project couldn't possibly use the strategies of 'The One Minute Manager' without driving his team nuts.
0553208845|4.0|This is Hesse's spiritual book about Siddhartha and the quest to find one's true Self.  It pales in comparison to Steppenwolf and Demian, but it is still a very worthwhile read with a vast amount of depth of thought  invested into the short book.  Resembles Nietzsche's Thus Spoke Zarathustra  in some respects.
B00001NFCY|5.0|The sound that these four gentlemen are able to produce is amazing. Lyrically speaking, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out what they're singing about. The typical group of the 21st century isn't too  focused on life's more important issues. (Unity, tolerance and acceptance,  respect for one another, and the list goes on.) Don't get me wrong. I like  all genres of music. I'm not bashing any particular groups. (just to set  the record straight.) The reason why I like Creed is because they've  establish themselves as more than just your run-of-the mill &quot;rock  band.&quot; They are without a doubt very talented musicians. Even more  important is the message. Thought provoking. As sure as I'm writing this,  someone will probably comment, &quot;Who cares about lyrics?&quot;  &quot;You think too much.&quot;  Now here's my question. What's wrong with  thinking?
