B004A91VZU|5|Awesome!
B00AKSCXEI|5|My husband is happy with the gift.
B0032Z7TKO|5|After reading all the comments and reviews I was a bit nervous about ordering the 12 month size dress for my daughter When I opened the box I was first blown away by the quality of this dress. The detail is very impressive and it is a beautiful dress; it also washed very well. The belt is sewed on and unties at the back, allowing you to easily get baby into and out of the dress (which unbuttons in the back) and tie it back up, without a sash belt that will inevitable get lost or pulled off by baby. I got a TON of complements on this dress at her party.<br /><br />As I said, I ordered the 12-month size for my daughter's 1st birthday and it fit PERFECTLY, almost as if it had been tailored exactly to her. She is 18.5-pounds and 30.5-inches long. The headband also fit her perfectly (I'm not sure exactly the circumference of her head but I know she is in the 50th percentile for HC), but she's not into wearing hats or headbands so that didn't stay on longer than about 15 seconds. I can see how this dress *might* be too tight if you have a large chested or chunkier baby since, as I said, it buttoned up perfectly (without being snug) around her midsection. If her rib-cage was a bit wider it might be a little tight.<br /><br />All in all I HIGHLY recommend this dress.
B00K7WZIRQ|1|Gorgeous, well made, too small, doesn't accurately portray measurements.
B001CA8KNQ|4|I wasn't expecting much given that they were fairly cheap and labeled as a costume item, but when they arrived I was immediately pleased. I wore them for a school spirit day (hipster) and I plan on wearing them for my jazz concerts. They are fairly well made. You may want to still treat them with care, however, because they might snap. But overall this is worth it.
B00F15QYL8|5|Okay so I recieved this product two weeks before the arrival date which is always nice! The inside of the jacket is very soft and make itch silky material which ie so smooth and nice! All patches are embroidered except for the back, which is printed. I ordered an XXL and they send me an XXXL and I'm so glad they did! If thwy hadn't then it wouldn't have for! The shoulders are a bit tight actually but nothing too bad! The jacket is the perfect size overall and the length of it is just perfect! Please take into consideration the sizing because I'm actually an XL in American sizing and the XXXL  was somewhat tight but still perfect. The fabric is not stretchable. Overall a nice buy, I'd definitely recommend to everyone who is an SNK fan!
B000L81A82|1|Do not buy from this seller! I have made several attempts to contact this seller due to the product being defective. They have not contacted me in any way. This was a Christmas gift that is now usless!! I actually would like to give them negative stars.
B001YQ6WAQ|1|Product is cheap. Would not recommend purchasing. You can find better quality elsewhere. But if you're looking for a disposable one, this is for you.
B00DED5N84|5|good
B00422M6FE|4|Great overall product I love the size and feel of it. I gave it four stars because some of the credit card slots are a tight fit
B002SEACFE|4|good bra.  fits as expected.
B00H7YV0G0|5|For the price this shirt surpassed my expectations. Very happy with it.
B00817EA82|4|Like them
B00J4MQHAW|5|The reviews I read before purchasing were very helpful.  I actually like the ribbing on the bottom and on the ends of the sleeves--it helps keep the  shirt in place and not riding up on my backside.  I'm a good medium (size 8-10) and am short (5&#34;2') so I like the shirt being longer and this fit (the medium) is great.  I hope to get another one.  It's perfect for fall and winter!
B001R4CABU|3|I was willing to pay a little extra for U.S.A. made, but these are not. They say \\"Made in U.S.A.\\" on the ordering description, but the tag they came with says, \\"Made in Korea.\\"
B00KVZP72K|5|Most comfy pants ever! I wear them all the time. Great for women with hips.
B00R18BPXU|3|cute and well made but runs one size too small.
B003XRPWMS|5|it was a very pretty dress, it fit well, and it was a very nice product to have. awesome, and great
B00H9I486I|5|This is a beautiful tie to wear at Christmas as a change from the &#34;fun&#34; Santa Claus type ties. The material is nice, the design in stunning. Lots of compliments.
B00CMLRC10|5|Great fit. Exactly what I wanted.
B00HX1Z3WO|5|A great hat. Fits good and looks good. A little pricey but worth it.
B005W0LTNA|5|Without a doubt the most comfortable bra I have ever worn. Worth every cent.
B00BTIFSIG|4|Cute but faded after first wash
B0037NYWLK|5|Just what I asked for. Fit perfect. This is the only jeans that my son will wear. I will definitely buy more of these.
B00KSK212C|4|This shirt is exactly what I thought I was getting.
B009VL2A4S|4|The only problem I had with this is that it did shrink a bit. Otherwise, great color & fabric is good.
B006H87002|5|I am on our second pair. First lasted a few years. Thin. She crawled on her knees both years wjich did lead to holes i sewed up as best i could. Good quality. She really put them through some rougj school yard play. I live in minnesota land of ice and snow. I was thrilled to find amazon saved my last order so i could order again. I got them extra big in the waist just to make sure. The legs are very long but with thick boots on its no big deal.
B00I52RD4G|5|great belt,easy to put on and I just love it not having holes to deal with.Saw these at a golf pro shop for 3 times the price.Great deal and a great belt that looks awesome.
B003Y23VZM|4|The camisole is a good buy. The quality is high. It stands up to washing very well. It is a good length, and the color is bright. I am enjoying wearing it.
B004NCGBZE|5|The design is very pretty, especially for it's size.
B00N77HU9M|2|The straps of my 4580 Barely There underwire bra were always slipping off my shoulders and I eventually realized that although I kept adjusting the bra strap slides to make the straps shorter, the slides do not hold and the straps would quickly lengthen to full length.  One would think that some type of product testing would have revealed this problem.  I placed a small safety pin on each strap--a solution but not really what I would expect to have to do with fine lingerie.
B003TA33MA|4|Really liked it kept my kid warm as we went out asking for trick or treat the shipping was a bit of a hassle and the outfit can easily break
B005Q35JDO|5|Go an extra size.
B00M91C6FU|5|Awesome!
B00DGOBSVM|2|Small!!!
B00KWJYGG8|5|This belt is great at holding up my pants.
B002N649P6|5|Used for my daughter communion. Perfect.
B003ZUA6W4|5|Love the color. Like the leg vents for those 40 and sunny days. Love that they integrate with a jacket.
B00NYWE9TY|5|Good ver y good
B007RW2FGG|4|I got this for a wedding, and I measured my (pregnancy-sized!) chest multiple times to be sure. I also double-checked the sizes of the bras that I know fit very well.  Generally speaking, it works just fine; a little tighter around the chest than expected, but perhaps that was good for support under a strapless dress.  The cups were taller than I expected, and felt oddly large, although, again, I checked my measurements over and over. I've gotten slightly bigger now, and it still fits. In fact, it's comfortable enough that I'm willing to wear it as a regular bra.<br /><br />All in all, a good choice: reliable support without too much &#34;uplift&#34; (I didn't want a push-up!). As comfortable a strapless bra as I have found, especially for my larger-than-normal pregnancy breasts.<br /><br />I ordered a 34-F/G
B00EUXHMWM|1|Too small even when ordering largest size. I was looking for looseness and swing. Accidently ended up with two of the same.
B00OHZRLUG|3|Nice blouse, but should have got a large it's a little snuggled but looks cool.
B00KI16V2M|1|To small
B0028RWTV6|5|These nylons are exactly what I wanted. They fit well even though I have large legs from years of cycling and last well.
B00AEB9XKS|5|Great present
B0041EJTL2|5|pretty dope hat. wore it to a rave and got lots of compliments!
B002QFOO2C|4|nice fit, good driving gloves for autumn coolness.  I really don't know what else to say but you want me to fill so I am
B00B59YL9G|2|At a casual glance the jacket looks fine, but the sizing is wrong. I ordered a 2XL which should be plenty large and it wouldn't close. To top it off, the zipper is on the wrong side for a men's jacket.
B0091V7V7E|1|This is not what I wanted I wanted with two things to put in my pants very dis satisfied
B005HGWL1S|5|I thought the jacket was really nice a medium just did not fit.. Medium was the only size available. I had to return it.
B003E1WZAK|4|Good quality and nice looking. A bit thinner than I thought it would be but my daughter loves it! Yea!
B00719FZQW|4|I'm 6'3&#34; 215 pounds and this shirt fit pretty well except around the shoulders. It's not too tight so that I can't wear it, but it can be a little uncomfortable. I have very broad shoulders so that's probably why. Definitely order 2 sizes up, so if you wear a L then order an XXL. Be wary if you have broad shoulders. But if you don't and you're pretty slender then this should fit just fine.
B00JFCC084|1|It's to small and the size chart didn't help to figure out what size a 4x was.
B000EJZCDM|4|The cut was flattering enough to more than make up for it. Anyway, my husband loved it, so I'm a satisfied customer.
B002HL5GKE|5|The only socks I like to buy for serious walking.  I like to wear the little colorful socks or toe socks around the house, but if I am walking a bunch or going to be on my feet a lot, I wear these and only these.  Hanes is the only brand I have found for fit, comfort and durability for socks and underwear.
B0055XG8YO|5|Bought the item for my nephew. It is great. Fits perfect and he does not feel a bit cold with it on. Great investment.
B004NIIKB6|5|Simple and affordable enough. Hat springs right up, bow tie is velcro and goes on/off easy and 3 fingered hands are a riot and comfortable. After Im done wearing it for Halloween...my kids will get to use it for dress-up....
B00MX6D2G8|1|Delivered in timely manner but device was dead on arrival. Have to return it and order another which is frustrating
B00SZCDGT2|5|My favorite BRIEFS at an almost unheard of price!! Too Good To Believe!! Don't Hesitate Before a Price Increase!!!
B0036Z3LUW|2|IT IS SO SHORT IN THE ABDOMEN
B00J1Y3C42|5|The robe was purchased as a gift, and I'm so glad I chose it over cheaper ones. It is soft and plush and the sizing was accurate. It is well constructed, and it washes well - no snags or pilling. Very happy with this robe and would recommend it for anyone. I've seen comments that it is too thick - but if you're buying terry, this is exactly what it is supposed to be. A great robe!
B007VB974Q|2|Cardigan shorter in length than I pictured. Not ideal for a 10 year old. Cuter on younger girls. Donating item instead of returning.
B000LNE9R6|5|Great shorts, my husband is very picky with shorts and he loved these pair so much that he asked me to get him another one!!!
B00EZ6W486|1|This dress is the worst made piece of clothing I have ever bought. First off, the shoulders are meant to be zipped however it's impossible to do it by yourself. It gets stuck constantly and the dress looks tacky and cheap once I received it.
B0007CKNQW|3|Returned them after realizing how unstylish that aspect is. The other color I bought of this style was fine though. Maybe just me...
B00LL3DW8M|5|Love it.
B00KBZP3VU|5|Great shirts
B00BIPWTQO|4|Soft, cute, but sheds like a dog.
B004CO9TSE|5|Can't find these in a store? Get 'em here on Amazon. Yes, it may cost a few more dollars, but these are the best plain t-shirts you can get.
B003LPUOXY|5|These are nice socks, and they're a steal at Amazon's price. They launder nicely and haven't faded. The only note I can make is that they're listed as socks for babies 0-6 months, but I'd say they're more like 3-6 month socks... if you're buying for your newborn, you may prefer something smaller to start with before moving on to these beauties.
B00ASMGRBG|4|I'm fairly large in the chest, but this nighty is very stretchy. it looks very cute on, but I wanted it to be a little bit tighter through the chest for me. That's one star lost for me.  The shoulder straps are also very stretchy, so it does not offer any support. Since I won't be performing aerobics in it, I think it's fine, but some ladies might want more support than this offers. I should note, that because this nightgown stretches, it will indeed fit a large variety of sizes. I wear a size 8, but I imagine that a 12 or 14 could just as easily wear it. It's very cute and doesn't feel cheap.
B00Y247ND2|1|the cap was indicated to be a 7 1/4 while I can wear that size of a cap, this one did not fit.
B008RURKW6|5|If you are expecting a high quality, or very nice belt, this isn't for you. If you have reasonable expectations, this is for you! It looks very cool with dresses, and I can't wait to get a chance to wear it out. I am about a Medium in shirts, and it fits me pretty snug, but I think it might be adjustable (the lacing in the front). Overall, no complaints.
B00E3FKQ6Q|5|Large size fit well, I am about 6'2 210 athletic build.  It has some stretch.  These shirts are expensive, but they are a good value in my opinion...comfortable, stay in place, and keep their form and elasticity over a long period of time.  One thing to keep in mind, the &#34;deep&#34; v-neck model is cut very deep.  I suggest the high v-neck.
B0081SER1G|2|I wanted the animals and got planes and car and such. it says they colors may be different. but not the style. I wish i had read the reviews before i bought these!
B00F10SETI|5|They are a great lightweight short and I love that they are made in the USA...
B00DGRP89M|4|My teenager loved these jeans.  The color was great, just what he wanted.  The only reason for the 4 instead of  5 stars is that Hot Topic took forever to ship these.  Took almost 3 weeks to get them. I would order from them again, just give it plenty of time.
B007IEG64K|5|Awesome - worked straight through a half marathon.
B00EDIMB34|1|These gloves are advertised as having a sherpa lining when in reality they have a sheep's trim at the cuff. There is no lining in them. They are no warmer than any cheap pair of knit gloves. I have to say they are attractive and the magic touch works nice.
B0042GIE56|5|PURCHASED AS GIFT FOR MY SON. HE LOVES THEM. FIT WAS GREAT.
B004RDSYNQ|1|Thought by ordering a size bigger would be comfy fit.....but these shorts were way too small.....
B006FTBSLK|5|that is me!!
B004XMOD4A|5|I loved this robe! I was a little iffy when I was ordering, because so many people were writing mixed reviews, but when it came in the mail, I LOVED IT! It's just past my knee, lovely material (really silky) and beautiful pattern! I highly recommend it!
B00JXE2E44|5|Love these pants. I'm a bartender and bar manager. They fit perfect.  I'm 5&#34;10. They fit my waistine and height so comfortably I will be buying more.
B0009MDEUW|5|I purchased this product and I am very satisfied. I will recommend this product to family and friends. The experience with your company has been very pleasant and all staff and employees have done an outstanding job.
B00QUVPJ4U|5|My son loves superheroes and this was a great backpack. Very well made with the front characters in 3D. Very cool!
B003838HMY|4|I only wear a 9 or 9 1/2 shoe and men's socks only seem to come in size 10-13.  These are too big and the grey area (supposed to be on the heel of the foot) is up much higher.  It is outside of my sneaker and looks really stupid.  Wish they made a men's size that fit but for now these work fine.  This model is a little thinner than most but is not a problem.
B00BWJ2IWG|3|Very nice material but provides minimal support for larger breasts.  I would recommend to others due to the quality and color.
B002IYHEOQ|2|Very big and baggy.
B00IYRCCY8|5|Very warm!!
B000KD44G8|4|They're socks, they fit, seem durable enough.
B009RQK8RI|5|Love it!  Received quickly
B00G82EA4G|2|It was a little bit smaller than I wanted for my daughter. Expected it to be exact size I had ordered.
B003STDNC2|5|Bought these for my husband. They fit perfectly, and are great work pants with tons of pockets. :) He is very comfortable in them.
B00E8JYBOA|4|Nice fit, the stretchy material is very flattering if you are curvy. I wish I could order other colors. I just fell in love. I have no regrets.
B002XGZT5K|5|I bought as a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loved them! The color was beautiful and the material was very soft. I would recommend to anyone that wanted a beautiful and comfortable pajama.  Mrs. G
B00XLV8PHK|5|Fits my 9-year-old grandson perfectly.  I am ordering more because I was not sure of the fit.  Their charts are correct.
B00PILY8V8|5|Really nice.
B000N8PZ54|4|These pants fit great and are much lighter than jeans.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is I want to see how quickly/slowly they wear out.  The double knees make me think they will last quite a while.
B00KVHC4HO|1|The material is extremely cheap which is no surprise but what bugs me the most is it's kind of see through(defeats the whole purpose of wearing the  bathing suit).I do not recomend this, looks terrible
B00FX9ZQW0|5|Good quality Jacket! My wife loves it!
B00AA5WRKQ|4|Pros:<br />-fleece lined=super warm and cozy<br />-the snowflake pattern I got was adorable and exactly as pictures<br /><br />Cons:<br />-The outside stating pilling up after a couple washes<br />-Was surprisingly high-waisted (I was worried they were too small at first)<br />-Kind of needed to be broken in before they were really comfy, only problem was by that point the material was already looking a little ragged.
B00FS5E1TS|2|The pockets were so long that it looked like my husband's butt went half way down his thigh. Returned and won't re-order for that reason.
B00TPZCHUM|4|It does have two tennis ball pockets, which is why I bought it.  As others have noted, the pockets open from the bottom, and while that does facilitate ball retrieval, each holds only one ball.  If I add a second one, it falls out.<br /><br />It fits well and is comfortable.
B00QB0S08W|3|Fits smuggler than my other jackets
B00GUY6UL8|5|Very nice item,so comfortable, fast shipping, great transaction. Thanks!
B00TRVYOUU|5|I love it perfect fit!!
B00HUMJOHQ|4|Very nice, color is as expected as with the fit. It is not really the slim fit where it slims down only below knee, the knee above seems like a regular fit cut. Not cheap looking as well. The stripes are quite defined, would've been good if the stripes are a bit darker but not a big issue. Overall, great buy.
B00CEH0WLY|2|Shipped the wrong product.  Didn't even try it.  Wanted cotton, received microfiber and not even the same colors as in the listing.
B00JK3GJ8K|5|Great shape and style !
B00006AN3Y|5|This top is the most comfortable - I wear it as a sport bra, alone or with another top over.  I am a 36D and wear a medium and it is the best.  Am in the gym every day and have bought it for friends - we all love it.
B00LJUB3PQ|4|great deal!!
B00B9EBI9S|5|It fits as I expected. It looks very nice. I will be buying another one again!!AMAZING Cap Hat, Best Ever! 1
B00RTOFLUE|5|[[VIDEOID:969f83d54e465def8077de93d65fac97]] After looking at the size chart, I chose to go with a medium instead of a large - and I am glad I did. The pencil skirt does cling but fits as it was intended to. The slit is large enough to be noticeable yet small enough to be modest. I love the rich wine color and the gold buttons on the side give it a classy, expensive look. It is knee length so is appropriate for the office or church.<br /><br />The material is stretchy, the skirt seems well made and the seams are all intact. This skirt is made in the USA and the material is 95% polyester and 5% spandex. It was very comfortable, very professional looking, has a good feel to the material and I am very satisfied with my purchase.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I received this item for free or at a reduced price in exchange for my honest, unbiased review. All opinions are my own.
B00DF3KCLQ|5|This outfit is adorable! I got this for my 3 year old son to have spring pictures taken. Knowing this outfit runs small, I ordered a 4T and if fits perfectly. My son is a little on the taller & thinner side. Had I ordered a 3T, it would have been to tight I think.
B00T1P7G7A|5|Great Bra
B000E9UEDK|2|The zipper idea was great. However, the zipper does not stay up in place.  The knot keep slide down about an inch or so and show the collar.
B002PJ58DS|5|This came in much better shape than the picture which shows crinkles from crushing. Fits my 23&#34; head perfectly. I live in a windy place so it is slightly snug. I worry about the chemicals used to cure the leather against sweaty skin... Will was the leather lanyard in hot soapy water and then put it back on. This hat is sturdy but light and perfect for hot sunny weather.  Nicely made in Sri Lanka.
B008KITYGK|1|It is very diffulcult to adjust and put on by yourself and it is extremely uncomfortable.  It does wear well under certain types of clothing.
B000KH99QE|5|Haven't had a Capezio leotard in a few years, and it is greatly improved by the upgrade with today's newer, more flattering fabrics. Will love wearing this as a basic layer in my wardrobe !
B00D7NC71C|1|Poor quality. Very cheap. Would not buy it again. Definitely not satisfied with this order. There was no gel in the girl wrighting only in the country.
B00PK23LIQ|5|My mom loves putting this on her grandson. He looks hilariously cute in it, and it keeps him really warm in Buffalo NY!
B0061MGZGY|5|Excellent item!
B003Y7SFAI|5|Love the way it was packaged together. High quality booties for your little one. Definitely a good buy! Its worth it.
B00HQRMU4O|5|Material is very comfortable and fits perfect. I even sleep in it with no problem. I wear under my clothing and it's great.
B00K022QQ4|5|It is a very nice shirt I would recommend to my friends
B00SH2HGD2|1|Horrible quality. Top is see-through. Not what I wanted or expected
B00FXQ0EFM|5|These are constructed from quality material. They look great untucked. The price was right.  Look great at work, or wear them on a date!
B00SCD5232|3|I have not wore it yet however it do fit fine.
B00GJF5X4S|1|Small!
B00FRNTC2W|3|The quality of the pajamas seemed fine, but the top was a little large and the bottom was definitely too tight in the crotch.  Of course, not everyone may be shaped like I am, but I think my body shape is pretty typical for a fat man.  I had to return them.<br /><br />The pajamas were made in Bangladesh, which made me a little uncomfortable given the low wages and the poor working conditions there.
B002M09DJ0|5|Top quality hat for cheap, feels very sturdy, made out of great materials, feels very real, great for Magic tricks, costumes, and Anniversary surprises
B0029R7SDY|5|Received this coat last year as gift for the holidays.  One of the toughest and dryest coats I own.  I wear this coat with a western felt hat in the nastiest of conditions and I stay dry. It does not come with the liner, but one can be ordered to make this coat an all season jacket.  While oilskin is old school compared to Goretex, it works and this coat is not as fragile as the newer Chinese made stuff from North Face, Columbia and others.  If you spend anytime doing work or outdoor activities in demanding wet conditions this is the coat for you.     If you are the type of man who would rather spend his time at the mall instead of outside or the type of man that drives a Prius and wears facecream, then I don't recommend this coat. If you are the type of man that drives a truck, shaves with a DE razor, opens the door for ladies, enjoyes firearms and works hard to support his family then this coat fits your lifestyle.
B00TT5BRWW|5|Love this swimsuit!! It seems to be very well made. I was surprised at the quality for the price.
B00AKW0S1E|1|These are made so poorly that if you have any kind of curve they aren't going to fit.  Not sure where they came up with the pattern for these leggings but it appears that they just drew the shape of person and cut it out with no regard to how something should actually be put together.  My young, petite daughter was able to put them on but the inseam tore out the first time she wore them.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.  Not to mention that they ship directly from China and took forever.  :(
B002NXM2SK|5|Im a fat guy and its hard to find industrial work clothes that fit. I bought these because my company provided shirts in 4x went down to my knees. These were the right size and length throughout and I  bought 6 so far.
B00JXMDAL2|5|Love them!!!
B004ZX806Y|5|I love these socks for my 1 year old boy, the are so cute and the quality is great but the extra plus is that that don't fall off.
B008R9PEE8|2|we are going to have to send back, but first we have got to get the correct size, this 36w 34l was what he bought two weeks ago at a department store and they fit great, but these are to tight.  he is going to go back and try on this same size at the store and she if it fits him there. and if it does we will return these and just purchase from the local store.
B0097267AY|3|Ok
B0035RFX16|3|This wallet is great sorta.  I have a magic wallet from the infomercial (it looks exactly like the one in the picture) for years that I loved.  The one I got shipped to me is not like the one pictured.  It fits some of my european money but not american money?????  See how (in the picture) the bill is folded over once length wise and it fits? Well the wallet I rec'v cannot fit bills folded this way.  its too small for American money. :(  I'm still using it by folding my money into odd shapes and what not, it works. It just isnt as great as the magic wallet I got from the commercial years ago.
B00LNKWUKO|4|It fit really well
B007PHKR8Q|5|Great
B00DXG9NJ2|5|What is there to say====I love it.
B00HE26M7C|5|This jacket is great! The faux leather looks and feels real. The fit is a little small - I usually would have ordered a M but based on other reviews I ordered a L. I'm glad I sized up. It fits well but I can still zip it up comfortably.
B0048J72ZA|4|I bought this so that I had a slightly bigger one (i have a 7-1/4&#34; head).  I can comfortably fit a baclava under this and then put a hood over the hat.  Nicely sized.  No ear openings tho and the front flap does not snap down.
B0073YQIV6|2|All of my jeans and pants are the same size and none of them are relaxed fit, but I could barely button the Lee jeans.
B00SMGKC9I|4|Really nice but to large will have to send back.
B00D5S1JPE|4|My daughter chose this dress herself and she is very picky! It's cute but I wish the belt can be removed.
B009CTTX6M|3|Well constructed, but thicker material that I would like.  The cloth is more like I would want in long pants in the Fall and Winter.  I would a lighter-weight material for Summer wear.
B000PWKCTM|5|Beautiful dress!!/ Great price!
B0065ECIJQ|5|I originally purchased these from Kohls but they no longer carry online. Found them on Amazon  Very comfy 95% cotton 5% spandex. Nice quality. Good price. I took out the drawstring- gives me a little more room. : )
B00655S6HS|5|Decent quality, its soft and the appropriate size.<br /><br />If you loved the original Zelda or even a new Zelda fan, get this and wear it proudly.<br /><br />It is printed above average quality, I havent had any signs of fading and peeling.<br /><br />I LOVE THE TRIFORCE
B00EFS9CXE|5|I'm giving these 5 stars because they are uh look at them lol.. but they are way too small, I think I will cut the elastic part. The price is so cheap so I would probably buy them again even knowing their tininess.. but now that I really examine the listing it should have been obvious that they wouldn't fit lol, the gal in the pic modeling them is a total pixie stick! The notion of 'one size' and the 'modeling of that one size' didn't cross my mind til just now lol, but yeah if anyone is complaining about them being too small, we should know better.. but they are ridiculously tiny lol, they should be marketed for kids and the cuffs just rolled up at the bottom because most adults are not that skinny
B00GFH9DX2|4|im 5'7'' 36' bust top fit great, alot of padding though..If your big chested get a large, bottoms are way too small for my hips.
B00CIBCJ6M|5|I LOVE THIS SCARF! when it arrived i thought it would be thicker, but turns out it doesnt matter. I bought the black and white version and wear it very often! a few of my friends have also ordered it and love it just as much.
B00M52NU12|5|Love it!
B004AZXO1I|5|It's a good skirt but it is very thin material so you can kinda see through it and it doesn't leave much to the imagination.
B00DMORULS|5|This was my baby's Christening dress. And i looooooooooooove this dress. Very beautiful.
B001ST3GBW|4|Recommend to Everyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Liked the Up to Date Fashions!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Fast shipping!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Extremely easily to Deal with!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00A2TFRN4|3|I bought it because I wanted a red belt and I didn't want to pay $30.00.<br />The belt is very difficult to get through belt loops and would never actually hold up my pants.<br />But hey, I wanted a red belt and now I have one.
B0052YIAY2|5|I bought this product to wear under my yoga shirt. It is flexible and comfortable and perfect for this type of light workout.  If you are large chested, it may not be great for strenuous workouts--but it is not designed for that.  I am very happy with my purchase. Because of the material, it should be hand washed and hand dried, but this is what you're supposed to do with any workout attire.
B00IJEHAOI|2|to small for my wife
B00E8D6TL4|4|Isotoner is a good brand and well deserved. My daughter is getting her drivers license soon. We live in Penna, so lots of cold weather driving. Only thing, the box does not actually say &#34;Driver's Gloves&#34; on it, so I must descreetly mention that they are designed for driving.
B005CSNWEQ|4|These tights go on easily, and then I forget I have them on. Decent quality  - and they look good!
B0011FTK5O|4|Now that I know how to buy overalls I couldn't be happier. It turns out that you have to order the waist size 2 sizes bigger than your regular pant size and the length one size smaller than your regular pant size. I wear a 38/30 in jeans but when I purchased overalls that size they didn't fit. So, I ordered these in a 42/28 and they fit perfect.
B00NHTYUUW|5|Great loved it fast shipment
B00MN6YRJO|1|I really love the wallet until the zipper split and now it won't close.
B00F8LDEVS|5|Super good quality, You can tell by the weight of this hat that it's well made. Came packed very well. Shipping was fast.  This is a heavy hat, so wearing it will feel cumbersome. The decorations are nice, the bullets are fake but made out of solid brass.  That may contribute to the weight. The bottles are also fake but real glass. The watch on the side is suppose to be real.  But mine came not working, I might have to put in a battery. It dose however mechanically be able to work.  This hat gets attention where ever I go.  My other choice was the same hat but with the fake Derringer holstered on the side and the same bullets. I still might buy this latter.  This style and brand was a good price. when I went to event fairs to find hats, the price on these were at least $200 more on up.
B0066SJP8I|4|My wife saw me open the package and said it was for women. I said it was unisex but she insisted that she should take it because it's not for men. I think she just wanted it...
B00GLCMT3W|5|Ordered a medium for female friend. It fit perfect.
B00Q2NN1WS|5|It is a fabulous costume dress.  The small fits me perfectly.  I am a 4 petite, 5' and 108 lbs.  It has adjustable straps so you can raise or lower the neckline.
B000CRDN3W|1|they should cost 7 bucks. the construction is nice but the material is like ruff cotton... i thought it was going to feel like my spandex biker shorts... its not worth 20 bucks.. may be with time they will get softer but it was a big let down
B009IUMT66|5|These are great for keeping my hands warm while working on the computer. They have kept their shape and the material is soft.
B00BPGSC0I|2|If you like this shirt, you better go a size larger than you usually would.  This was too tight for me and I always go with 17  34/35.
B00CA2WGOE|4|not yet worn for evaluation
B00CHS5RMY|5|Beautiful...the photos don't do it justice!  So fun and comfortable to wear.  Love it!
B0060ONQ06|5|The product is great. It has very good material and the colors are fantastic.  I hope you keep selling this kind of product.
B0030BELEC|4|How do you reverse the belt.<br />I can't seem to do ti other wise it is a great looking belt.
B00BU29ZVM|1|This is a nice case, however it brakes way to easily! It was in my pocket with keys and I got it out and it had a chip missing from the bottom. Not a very happy customer.
B009RV1GV0|5|My adult son loves these.  He says they fit very well and they feel great.  Looks like this \\"slim fit\\" is his new T-Shirt type! These also come in black.  [[ASIN:B00A7QU8ZY Hanes Men's Classics Lightweight 3 Pack Slim Fit Crew Neck T-Shirt - Black]]
B00KL7AVAQ|2|Not for busty ladies.... At all. Even the bottoms were a bit tight. It's cute, but any curves (I'm average sized with a large natural bust) and it's tight. I can normally wear large shirt and size 10pants and ordered an XL.
B003RA7MUG|5|Love it or should I say she loves it
B00E9QYUFW|4|Fun design. Well made. Thin socks but not sheer as son cotton socks can be.
B002ZRXMCO|3|Wool is somewhat scratchy do not wear with short sleeves; it is not a tightly bound fabric.<br />Good garment overall, very warm.
B005YSZIV4|5|The pin is just what I ordered.  Couldn't have asked for a better conditioned and authentic pin.  So thank you.
B005GLGYLC|5|Very Happy.. Would order from seller again. .
B00LAR3ATA|1|When you see &#34;Tall&#34; it means TALL and thin, when you see BIG it means a bigger trunk, heavy man.<br />This shirt says TALL and 21&#34; neck, but it comes in 4XL for a huge heavy man, and I NEEDED IT FOR THIS WEEKEND TO BURY MY UNCLE AT ARLINGTON.<br />I'm very angry. Nothing in town I can buy and this was supposed to be the answer
B00S7ZHWG0|2|The print is beautiful - BUT - it is not made from a good material, when I got it the first thing I did was washed it and it shrank incredible, at a point that my daughter is 4 months and this 6 - 9 month pjs fit her small. Also the material is poor quality, the first time she used it a little whole came out in the foot part.
B001LDAOEM|5|It's soooo cute!
B00XLSXV9A|5|I love it! It's a little longer then expected but fits really good and I love the Angel Wings on the back!!<br />Thank y'all so very much, Robin Penicka
B00KRYPQTY|5|Just love it!!!!
B003FIAAF4|5|Whether you're straight edge or just a Minor Threat fan, this is a great shirt. Nice fit so can't complain.
B00BBS4TMU|5|Good quality and comfortable!
B00FFQJ4PQ|4|I'm 5'5&#34; and around 150 and it fits me perfectly as far as height. ( i ordered the adult size)<br />The hood is ADORABLE and exactly as the picture!<br />The only reason i didnt give it five stars is because it's a little too BAGGY and because of that the tail sags in the back and almost touches the floor.... Although personally that doesn't bother me too much.<br />(Sorry for the sh#tty pictures, theyre screen caps from my stream.)
B00SMRN88Y|5|Got the item just as quick as described! Item was in great shape and came with nice case cleaning cloth and another cloth carrying case. It even came with a mini screwdriver set just in case you need to tighten a small screw on the glasses. The glasses themselves are really nice especially for the $25 price and they are even polarized and keep out glare and sun. Would purchase again and refer to all my friends.
B00FZVGIQO|5|I'm leary sometimes about buying tops on line.  I have sensitive skin, and an allergy to wool, which makes buying even more difficult.  But this pullover is soft and comfortable, and the fit is perfect . . . not too small nor too big.  A terrific addition to my wardrobe!
B007ZHPHL8|5|My first pair of Paige denim, I am very happy with the fit. They have a nice amount of stretch yet don't get saggy. Similar to 7's gummy jeans. Bought another pair!
B001DNFAOO|4|Nicely fitting tie, that was priced for my budget. This tie fit well on my neck and looked great with my Tux.  This came with the usual two days of Amazon Program.
B002M5ZHXG|1|Returned it...not worth $30 at all.  I ended up getting the &#34;Discorama Mama&#34; wig for like half the price and it's ten times better.
B001OXN1SK|2|I was immediately disappointed upon removing these gloves from the packaging.  The build quality is incredibly poor.  I ordered two pairs of gloves.  On both pairs, the small velcro squares designed to hold back the fingers when pulled back were both peeling away from the main glove material.  On one pair some sort of defect left a large gather of material in one of the finger holes, which made it impossible to put my finger all the way through.  These gloves did not seem like they would last long so I returned them.
B00EW88E9U|4|I bought this pullover for my daughter and she really likes it. However, the sizing tends to run a bit small.
B00FXPTT68|5|Bought as a gift for my husband. He loves it and says it is very warm.
B004CJ2RHO|5|Great!  As Expected!
B002DZLCLG|4|The jean was shriinks too much for this size, finally jean was 32-29 more or less one size different, bye
B00ENS1JGO|5|Received them early. Nice colour green. Very comfy. Fits everyone in my family from kids to my overweight boyfriend. Thanks so much!!
B00J97661W|5|It was exactly what I was expecting; a cute and perfect maxi skirt for a little person.  My daughter loves this skirt and wears it frequently. Wishing I could find a similar maxi skirt of equal quality...
B00NZIV7BK|5|Really cool shirt. I love the logo and I think it describes a lot of drummers and me as well. I just think it is self explanatory and just really funny. When I wore it the first day my family loved it. I would recommend for drummers who have a good sense of humor because people will love the shirt.
B00QWU5RGE|5|It is strictly a nylon jacket, no liner at all. I bought it as a rain jacket and it's working perfectly.
B00NHPJAZ6|5|Great price and great product!
B000B8UH0E|2|Not sized correctly.<br /><br />I wear Medium Longs in Army spec BDUs and have several pairs in this size.  These are cut different and did not fit right.
B007FPPZP8|3|These stickers were very stiff and didn't take the motion of a face speaking very well. It kept threatening to gouge my eye because the adhesive is slightly weak. I fixed it down with eyelash glue which helped. For the price I didn't mind the discomfort and it did look cool.
B004ZKT3I6|4|Great socks for the price, nice feel and comfort level, and best of all my feet don't sweat like a whore in church with them on.<br /><br />The fancier pairs, I like to tuck my pants in to and then pretend im a old time golfer with.
B00DJ2TH7I|3|Not great, but worth the try.
B000NRRPGM|4|I like my purchase...haha, little did I know it came from \\"Luxury Divas\\", it clearly says it.  But no worries this product is unisex.<br /><br />This is a one size fits all hat, an elastic band.<br /><br />Also, the picture shows a more of a lighter almost khaki colored style but when you receive it it will be more of a darker brown.<br /><br />The suede seems like a good fabric though is fairly thin so don't particularly think this is going to keep your head extra warm when winter hits.  It should still keep the breeze off while looking stylish.<br /><br />Good product even though it took a week or two to get it. Normally Amazon & Partners are pretty speedy.<br /><br />Enjoy this Retro Style Newsboy Cab Hat!<br /><br />----------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />***Update*** 09/12/11<br /><br />So after wearing this cap for a few days I've realized a few things.<br /><br />This cap is really meant for people with smaller heads even though it has an elastic band.  After wearing for a while it tends to leave a mark around the forehead area as well as that feeling as if you were wearing a snug cap all day after taking it off.  Also, the tag says 100% Leather which is actually different than Suede, it has to do with the finish that is applied.  I would think if it was Suede it would say so on the tag rather than Leather.  If you want to learn more about Suede and Leather Google it.  Last thing I noticed was that after even the first day the seems on one side that hold the elastic portion in started to unravel.<br /><br />Other than that this is a fairly inexpensive fashion item.
B00B3W81A0|5|just enough and not too tight around my thighs. love it
B002984JCQ|4|The overseas trip was a success.  The luggage returned in tact and it was so easy to spot on the luggage return carousel.
B00LU57OK8|5|Love this shirt. Will order more.
B004S08TW4|5|The narrow width and slight elastic to these belts make them very comfortable. True to the size as described. They are nice looking. I bought several of them.
B00BB8Y5WO|5|Thank you so much!!! My son loved his John Cena shirt!!
B00AULJEWY|3|I'm sure your experience with these depends on the seller, but the utopia store seller wasn't consistent.  My first order was for 3 silver ties, I received 3 silver ties that were of decent quality (especially at the price), but 2 of them had something smudged on them.  One of the ties was fine.  I washed all 3 of them by hand to see if that would get the smudges out, they came out of one of them, but not the other. So, left with 2 good ties and a third that was iffy, I decided to give them another chance.  I ordered 2 more.  Supposedly they were delivered to my house according to the tracking (it could be a mix up in the mail or they could have gotten stolen i guess), but i never received them. They came from China (if i remember correctly) so they took a long time to ship (which is fine with me), but I've ordered things from other countries before and never had a problem until now.  Like i said before, just watch which seller it comes from, because some of them are fulfilled by Amazon (which is probably better for this item).
B00YCTRTJU|5|This was exactly what I wanted and more. Holds everything needed and I love having the RFID protection for my credit cards. This is a great buy.
B00BWJ2TR0|4|Great for ladies that like to wear skirt and want to feel comfortable.
B00788SLKI|4|I ordered this skirt because there are not many longer length ballet skirts out there that have only a slight taper in the back. I love the length of this skirt - at 5'8&#34; it falls on me where normal length ballet skirts fall on average height women.  I ordered it in navy and it is a very dark navy- the ribbon is clearly navy but the skirt itself looks almost black.  It is not a polyester chiffon but a slightly thicker material (less likely to run than most ballet skirts).  Nice quality, but be careful if you are trying to match the color of the skirt to a leotard color of another brand.
B00AEE590S|5|I find this cut so flattering for any curvy girls, like me.  FYI I am 5'2, 34C and 135 lbs with an athletic, curvy body.  Typically a size small in most clothing, but I go up to a med in bikinis b/c I hate a tight swim suit that cuts into fat.<br /><br />I love this bottom so much, it is my second pair.  Also bought a black one too.  I bought a matching triangle top, but will also mix/match with other tops I have.<br /><br />Be warned, the back is Brazilian meaning that it is very cheeky.  However, I prefer this cut b/c it makes your butt look perky vs a full coverage bottom which can look like a diaper at times.  The color is a bright red coral, looks great with a tan.
B008PUO2Z6|5|The fabric is a little stiff side.<br />But the fit is so good.<br />Looks thin, not the elasticity.<br />Color is the same as the screen size is exactly the one defined size
B009PIQUIE|4|I really like this wrap...neck line is more of a turtle neck and not a wrap collar????  Works for me.  I'm loving it with leggings.
B0035WTSLM|5|a+
B00LVRF15K|5|The material was not as expected .  It was made out of a lycra sort of polyester stretchy material.<br />It is a good dress if you are looking to wear it to be sexy or to a strip club.  Not what I was looking for.<br />Also the front of the dress look like a some one had liposuction and had loose skin but when you put it on it looks like a 5 star dress that expands to fit your body snuggly.  Not sure how they came up with that design.  But if you don't have a good body I wouldn't recommend this dress as it is very revealing, by hugging all your curves.
B00MC1Q25C|5|Great slim wallet that doesn't look so large in my pockets...
B008YWF9PC|3|It's OK. But the price needs to be lower if it's made in China.
B0009MZUW2|5|These are great socks in that they last really long and are very comfortable.  I've worn this brand for years.  I'm replacing my old Thorlos because my current 6 pairs have holes in them after 6 years.  I run in them about 3-4 Times per week averaging about 10-15 miles each week.  I also use them to play tennis in occasionally.  My feet never get blisters when I wear them.  These are good quality socks and I will continue to purchase them when they wear out.
B00BNQW5GM|4|These are casual shorts but the color and fabric make them just a little nicer that your regular raw hem denim shorts.
B0054TWXJI|5|My boy loves the style, and the quality is very good for a light weight pajama.  I would recommend to any young fan of Phineas & Ferb.
B005NRPQ6S|5|Just like it seemed on the site.  will buy a couple more.
B008S1VUP2|5|Perfect
B007NG8SYO|5|My husband loves these boardshorts! Especially with the bottle opener that is attatched to the shorts, I'm not sure if it was meant for that but works great as one!
B00L806DDY|4|Wore this as part of an ensemble for a '60's themed holiday party. Although the plating is a bit brassy, it is well-suited for costumes, especially in low-light conditions. Fits well, and received many compliments.
B007NLX70E|4|The fit is very flattering and the green color is cute (although I really wanted the brown but it wasn't available in my size).  I don't really care for the ties in the back, but those can easily be removed without altering the look/fit of the dress.  Overall, I'm pleased with the look and quality of the dress.
B00LURFGH4|5|I love these pants. They are super soft and comfortable. The fit is great- I'm 5'2&#34; and 130 lbs, if that helps.
B00AZORMDY|5|I love this scarf, so unique, and awesome.  Come on, grab your friends and wrap Lacy Rainicorn around your neck, for adventures!
B00E8D6VOY|5|Ordered these for my 24 year old daughter, and she loves them.  Color is great (just as pictured), and she says she can operate her phone easily. They are very warm - not winter in Alaska warm, but perfect for winter in North Carolina!  All in all, I'm very pleased.
B005HWAUOM|3|Great hats, good quality and cool designs, but unfortunately a little on the small side.
B002FU62QO|5|I am 5'6&#34; and 138 pounds.  I ordered these jeans in a six.  I'm usually a 6-8 but because of the flannel I couldn't even get the button close to the button hole (about a 3&#34; gap).  The length sat right on top of my feet,  I was hesitant to order an 8.  The only size available was an 8 Long.  I've Never worn a long, however, my husband said to go-for-it!  I did ... and these jeans fit perfectly, with a 2&#34;-3&#34; cuff!!!  They are well made and the flannel color is really cute :)  I highly recommend them ... just go a size larger!
B00XBSWLK0|1|Very cheap material, very thin. Never get anything from here again. 0 star for this
B00963QI2G|1|I bought it to be a part of a halloween costume but never got to wear it. I was already torn in the torso side seam before I could put it on. Made very poorly and not worth your money. I was very disappointed!
B00974BETG|5|Gave this to a friend and she loves it.
B00EPHYN34|5|Very nice shrug.  Fit nice, color is nice, feels nice on.
B0007CIWXI|1|That's what I'll say if I see any woman disgracing herself wearing any of these themed shirts. The only way a woman could possibly get away with wearing this is if it were a self-deprecating act of mockery toward those poor women who feel like they're so attached to a television show that they're pride has gone out the window in fellowship with \\"their girls\\" on the show. How can any woman in her right mind be caught DEAD in one of these? YECCCHHH.
B00ACIGVH6|5|fits better than the tommy hilfiger i also got.
B00MWCWJIU|1|I wear size 10 and I'm 5'9, I bought is a 2x because I wanted it big.  Its nothing like I expected.  It barely fits and it too SHORT (IT DOESNT EVEN COVER MY HIPS).  What a waste of money!
B00K5AFQ22|4|Very stylish and utility oriented
B00MZ8F7RG|1|The scarf is difficult to wear. It kept slipping off my bare shoulders, and the sequins would catch on each other when I held it. I was constantly un-snagging it all night.  I would have returned it, but return policy would only allow 50% credit, so I didn't bother, as I would have also incurred postage. Not worth it.
B00XY8O8BC|2|The size I ordered is the. Size I take, but it did not fit. Will be returning product. Should advertise that it runs small.
B00LO2EU6I|4|I just received it I didn't have a chance to wear it so I can't give it a 5 star,
B008MQBHB0|5|I ordered 3 for my brother's wedding for the flower girls and the messenger girl and they fot perfectly. We were very satisfied.
B000S10UYW|5|very nice quality
B00542WR7S|5|my nephew loved this. A little smaller than i would like. Just buy one size larger.Its not a jacket, its very thin.
B00QU4TB0K|5|Ordered after sugery as an alternative to the hospital issued non-slip socks.  These a great! Very we'll fitting and stylish!
B004OWL3LU|5|I am glad I purchased this item and I plan on ordering more!
B00CAAM0T2|5|My daughter is a HUGE fan of Cords, and these were quite welcomed Christmas morning.  She has needed clothes for a while, and it was quite enjoyable to see her really light up with these.  She thought that the included belt was kewl, too.
B0010KXA4W|1|These are way cheap. I needed to replace the ones I lost from Lands End and saw I could get these for a decent price. For some reason I didn't read the reviews ahead of time. Dumb move. Buyer beware.
B003M8H1JA|4|I love having these gloves in the winter because my hands are always cold and I hated taking off my gloves just so I could answer my droid when I'm out and about. The gloves fit well and they definitely keeps my hands warm while using my droid. The finger sensor on the gloves though can be a little tempermental when using it on a touch screen. I have notice that if you're not at the best angle or if the whole finger sensor isn't completely against the touch screen it doesn't always work. Also, I wouldn't say it's one size fits all. If you are a women, with large hands, I think these gloves wouldn't fit on you. I normally wear size small to medium gloves for work (I'm a nurse) and they fit snuggly on me so if your a large to extra large glove person, they probably won't work for you.
B00GKH0MSW|4|I really liked it!
B00702442Q|4|Love the color and fabric. Nice style. It'd look good as an evening attire, with slacks or a mini skirt. Love this blouse!
B00475TVHC|1|Purchased this costume because it was cute and orange. Noticed that the thumbnail on my order status was different from the one represented on the site when I was notified the order had shipped and checked Amazon to track my package. Confirmed with the seller that the costume was purple and black rather than orange. Was miffed, but thought, \\"Oh well. At least I look good in purple too!\\" Received my package quickly, and found a costume with a different model on the front and a completely different pattern. The pattern itself wasn't cute or sassy- it reminds me of the borders that get tacked up on elementary school classrooms for Halloween. Cartoonish pumpkins, etc. Didn't open the package, but the materials of the costume I received looked very cheap, and the hat was really smushed in there. Really not happy, and returning the item.
B00ITX6D0G|5|I love this! I lost a lot of weight lately and I was kinda scared it won't be able to fit me but it did and I'm happy with the style and comfort it gives.
B008VPS5VM|4|My son really likes them.
B0057ML1ZO|5|Just got my shirt today. Excellent material  and fits awesome. So glad bungie now delivers to Canada now =D Great shirt great cause. Congrats on 20 years bungie
B00WJLJUDQ|4|I really like it.  I carry a lot of stuff around with me.  Wish I'd have ordered 1 size larger.  I am 6'2&#34; and 240 lbs.  I still wear it a lot and 1 thing I like is that I can wear it year round as it is not too heavy or too hot.  I have several other vests for different seasons and purposes but this is my new favorite.  Dick Urban
B001G8P28A|2|I very carefully followed the measuring guide on Bella's website.  I wasn't on the edge of sizes, so I am confident I ordered the correct size.  This bra just fits really funky!  The band fit me just fine.  It wasn't too loose at all, and yet there was a bunching up in between my breasts where the underwire meets.  The cup also had a little bunching in the lace part, although the cup was definitely not too big at all.  The straps were positioned very far toward the edge of my shoulder, unlike any bra I have ever tried before.  It was uncomfortable too.  In fact, my breasts ached after wearing it for a day.  I switched bras at the end of the day, and the pain decreased immediately.  The bra also didn't seem to be very good quality.  The lace frayed after a couple of wearings, and so did the elastic in the straps.  Overall, I was very unhappy with it, and I do not think it was due to a size error.
B00CN4QCAI|3|thinner then I like for leggings
B00GYISH8E|4|Ok good
B00CIZT45C|5|I love the half socks.  They are so comfy on my feet.  So glad I decided to try these socks.
B00ALZ53OM|5|Three pair of wonderful, high-quality, long-lasting socks -
B00CJ965IQ|5|It looks just like the picture and is comfortable, soft, and lays well! I'm ordered the other colors now!
B00CYJ9HW2|5|I have not been able to wear underwires since my pregnancy - but I need the support.  This bra gives me the support and is comfortable - please don't stop making it.
B008JFBF8Y|5|I bought these jeans in my normal size and they fit perfectly. I am 5'5 about 140 pounds and I bought a size 28. They were about 4 inches too long on me, as most designer jeans are (I usually wear Sevens and Joe's) so I got them hemmed and now they fit perfectly.<br /><br />I love that they are kind of a &#34;slim bootcut&#34; style so you don't get the uncomfortable tightness of skinny jeans but you still feel sexy in them. I would recommend these jeans to anyone, Joe's Jeans are very soft and comfy- this is the third pair I've bought and I'm very happy with it.
B00JEXE8YI|5|Super!
B00CE3IXV4|5|perfect
B00J8M8RLU|4|I like the fabric and the fit
B00D7VIVQO|5|Beautiful quality!
B00K0WZ96S|5|My mother made me where a money belt on my first trip abroad and I hated it. Now, 40 years later I found the perfect substitute. Your money and passport are always comfortaby with you and so easy to access. I can even sleep safely with my money with these cool panites.
B0095RCNX6|5|By far the most comfortable pair of boxers ive ever worn. you will not regret the purchase of these boxers
B002GCG3YM|5|Received it quickly. My son loved it, but, it was too small.(head too big) they didnt have a larger size, so, their return process was quick and hassle free. really impressed by the return policy....
B000JGCRW4|2|because wearing this wig was like sticking my head into a bag of cotton candy. it was hot, sticky, uncomfortable and got everywhere.
B00CJ6YN10|5|The material is very soft, very nice, the dress is short, just like it shows in the picture. It is very good for the price it is.
B00HGNTUVY|2|Even after washing it this jeans color turned my socks and the inside of my Bearpaw boots blue. My hands are blue all day with this. I have never had this problem with any jeans. What the heck is with this dye. I love the fit but it seems defective.
B008EH0DSA|3|doesn't look as good as picture indicates...very very flimsy material, it also it clings to you, a little pricey for material
B00COM54P8|5|I like the material and the fit is perfect.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone for the price so worth it!!!!  I am almost 5'5'' and and I have a slim curvy leg look.  The S/M black size was perfect for me it came at 3/4 length which is exactly what I was looking for.
B004SD1O82|2|The bra was very cute and indeed enticing, but a bit snug (i am a 38 C). Still, besides obviously cheap material, the bra is tolerable.     The panties are total crap. If you wear a size 7 jeans or bigger, THEY WILL NOT FIT YOU!! Let alone, make it halfway past your thighs. And if they do, they will rip in half in the process. Totally ridiculous sizing, one size does not fit all, in this case. I STRONGLY SUGGEST BUYING SOMETHING ELSE.
B00H223WCM|3|front seems was defected- I to reorder another - hopefuly it was just a fluke- Im hoping the next one will be okay- its a very pretty nightgown
B00E8D79AY|5|I am very happy with this purchase.  These gloves are a beautiful purple, they are comfortable and they are so warm!!! We have been having some really cold weather and these gloves hug your wrists so no air gets in and they are comfortable enough to handle car keys without having to take your gloves off.  I will definitely see if they come in other colors - I just wanted purple initially but it would be nice if they came in red, black and brown.  I would definitely recommend these gloves to anyone looking for stylish and warm gloves.
B004OEH6ZU|5|un verdadero trabajo artistico esta franela es comoda fresca de estampado suave , y tienen una variedad de diseños diferentes
B0018OHQXG|5|My husband loves these jeans. He bought these jeans two sizes larger than he normally wears. Washed them and shrunk to a perfect fit.
B00174G3P4|3|I wouldnt have bought it if I didnt think it had mostly cotton. But I wont return as it costs to do so and they are very pretty.
B003UUSBOO|3|The hat was way to big
B006TJM10S|5|Had one pair and bought 2 more, use them all the time, warm and comfortable! Checked prices and were $10 dollars more at neimans and $20 cheaper at sacs but no black left there.
B009SDU20S|5|Stunning!!!!!! Very delicate but Omg such a beauty
B00I0M3L06|5|My 17 year old son loves these shorts. He wears them all the time, and they look and fit great.
B004ZAR5XQ|5|Good value for the money.
B00FWR4X5Y|4|Fits good good product
B00AM46AGM|5|I purchased this for my boyfriend for his birthday. The back of the sweatshirt has the Dirty Heads octopus on it. I would buy from this seller again, great choice :)
B009AXT3R4|1|I am a size 16 and have thick thighs and this item does not stay up or stretch to fit my thighs. it rolls down and the waist band rolls also it is to thin to stay in place.
B00772AF2W|5|My husband loved it! Definitely not just a piece of junk. He owns a few of the real ones so i was sure he would like this for his key chain and yep he did. Added in with his other Bday gifts. He told me he showed a bunch of guys at work, lol.<br />Oh geez...Boys and their toys ;)
B0012FHPCI|1|This is marketed as a sports bra, but it looks and feels like a regular bra.  That's fine, since I wanted it for every day wear, not sports.  However, it did not fit well at all.  It only provided support when the criss-cross straps were in place.  If they weren't it felt like no support at all.  With the criss-cross attached, though, it was very uncomfortable.  I returned my purchase.
B00DBBHCXI|5|This is a well crafted slim wallet.  It is the perfect size for a handful of credit cards and license. You can fit a few bills in it folded up, but not too many. I don't carry cash with me often, so it's not a big deal. This wallet looks and feels like it will last a very long time. The flowfold tag is a bit large, i don't mind advertising but it would be nicer if it was embedded in one of the sides. Great product!
B00J2D7QT4|2|They were lovely the first time I wore them. THE LENGTH WILL SHRINK in the wash. One wash and now they show my ankles... very awkward.
B00GYPEV1E|4|A perfect dress with good service
B00NQWNO0M|5|coat has a lot of nice detail, good quality, and is warm.  I'm a true medium, 40 chest , 6ft 170lb.  Coat fits great.  Not over sized and not euro slim. Just a nice easy slim cut
B00V5XWD60|4|These leggings are amazing. I purchased a larger size than normal expecting them to fit like regular leggings which are always tight. I would definitely buy your standard size though - I am a size 6 and bought a large. I would rather have a medium. I got so many compliments wearing these! I was a part of a cabaret and all of the mer-sisters wore different colors and it looked amazing!
B00QU634PG|5|Great fitting. Very high quality of product.
B00817EAT6|5|Fit great
B00C66LCVM|3|It is of cheap material but it fits me, and is fun to wear, and it's worth what I paid for. It is short, and I'm not used to it. But I think I'm just getting more conservative as I grow older. Definitely need an underskirt but that doesn't bother me since I've got one and I do like decency.
B00AYQS6FG|4|I ordered a size 4 being all my others at home are size 4 and fit my son perfectly. These were a little snug not sure how long he will be able to wear them. A size 5 would of been a better fit. I recommend ordering one size bigger
B00M5928NQ|5|I got a black one and it looks really good. I normally dont like southpole products but this one doesnt try to make it obvious that its southpole.<br />Its very minimalist when it comes to the branding, which I am glad about.<br /><br />Other than that its warm and looks good. I've gotten several compliments from people telling me &#34;nice jacket&#34;.<br />I also got it for a great deal, under 20 bucks. Wish I would have bought 2 because after wearing it all winter and washing it a few times its just starting to look a bit faded and worn. Oh well....
B00IO60YZ8|2|I liked the material, but couldn't wear these around the house - just too small so back they went.  Wouldn't order the same again.
B00EI4ID8A|4|Get 1 size larger, they run small!
B00D3RX8QU|4|Nice quality, thick fabric with a great underwire bra support in it.  A little hard to get into, since it is a very firm fit.  Once on, though, it is quite flattering, squeezing in all the lumps and bumps nicely.  I probably should have gone with a larger size, but I think it will be fine.  I bet it'll be a bear to get off when wet, though!
B00MVLR176|5|It's cute and soft, fit pretty well but it is a little tight, but not too bad.<br />It's probably my favourite sweater, and it's nice and soft.<br />Not very warm, but it would be nice and light for spring and fall.<br />It is a little bit see through so I can't wear dark shirts under it, but that's okay.<br />I love all the little details like the hear on the zipper, and the bows on the sleeves and on the back.<br />Same as pictured and would recommend.
B00KDPRCQW|5|Cutest Dansko ever made!
B00KC6D900|5|Was so happy to receive...came quickly.  High quality fabric. Soft and good fit! My granddaughter was so excited to have her doll dressed like her.<br />Recommend to other for sure
B004FWZUAO|4|very nice
B00HNKBYRS|2|Nice item, good quality very satisfied with purchase.
B008B5HO2S|3|Fits me well in everywhere but in the length.  The sleeves are about 2 inches too long.  I am 175 5/10 and normally wear a large in these types of shirts.  I should have got a medium.  Hopefully it shrinks up.  I do like the shirt though.
B0058YR1WS|5|columbia pants and shorts are extremely comfortable for work or play
B00513T78C|5|My husband has been wearing this style of jacket for years. This jacket fits and looks like the ones worn in the 80's. It fits fairly close to the body - but is not tight.<br /><br />I ordered the large and it fits true to size. The fabric seems to be of good quality (it isn't the fabric that makes that \\"swishy\\" sound when you move). The elasticized hem and cuffs have the right amount of \\"give\\".<br /><br />The Deep Sea color is very nice. Not a navy blue, a little brighter. It will work well with jeans, black,blue,cream,or tan pants.<br /><br />My husband is very happy with it.
B00FFUZVK4|5|my daughter loved the shirt. i ordered this shirt for my daughter after buying one for my nephew.  really nice shirt.
B003X26SC6|5|Very happy with the quality of buckle and the overall finish of the product...excellent stitch ... looks really high quality ...very very happy with the overall quality and value for money..also..specially the discount i got on amazon...
B0017Z81G2|5|I wanted a pair of gloves to wear when driving to protect my skin from the sun.  They are perfect for that.  The small dots keep my hands from slipping on the wheel and the little bit longer length protects my wrists.  Because they are a skin color, they are less noticeable.
B000VK2IBS|4|Great price and quality bra, however I went back to the Kayla bra due to fit for my body and the wonderful animal prints.<br /><br />AWESOME customer service.
B00B1ZMK8S|5|fit good, happy with item, fast shipping, package good, match outfit for dress, would buy again fit good happy item
B000MXLZ2W|5|My husband like these well enough to order a second pair.  Very unusual for him...!  He is 6'3&#34; but his legs aren't long enough to order a tall, w/o my having to shorten them.  These fit perfectly as they have a longer rise.  Very nice fabric, light weight and will hold up well for travel.
B00YKF18DY|4|I love the way it fits my curves... Comfortable, stretchy material (polyester/spandex).  I am petite and curvy (5 feet, 120 lbs.) and bought this outfit in a Size Medium.  I could've purchased it in a Size Small.  Will also need to shorten the length a little.  Wish they sold it in Petite sizes. But all-in-all, I really like the outfit!
B0052GJPWG|3|Runs very small
B007Q2019A|4|Sweet jammers. Makes me feel like a fish in water. This was my first non-board trunk style swimwear. The difference in feel is night and day. I don't have much to compare these to, but I have no complains. You should be comfortable in your body though because you are pretty much on display out of the water.
B00HTRWAPA|5|A true 2T size!  Beautiful graphics, lovely colors and comfy soft light fabric.<br />Adorable, definitely a perfect fit for a  Beautiful Princess.
B00R7SRMAY|5|Fits great and looks great!
B00IJJKZFO|5|Ordered 3-6 months for my 3 month baby and it is much too small. My baby  was 13lbs and about 23 inches long at the time and I think maybe the 9-12 month may have been better.  They are very tight to hold anything the baby shoots out and so I would recommend getting 1 or 2 sizes larger. Beautiful and great quality. Wish She could use it
B003U4LJGW|5|I am very happy  the fit was accurate and was shipped in a timely manner  keep up the good work
B00U4AEKFW|5|Worked great for our tie-dye project and fit nicely - enough room around the middle so it hid our mommy tummies, but not to loose that you swim in it. A great top.
B0050DZEVM|5|This product is great!  The flowers are interchangeable so you can either match to its own color or change it up by mixing the colors.  Very cute and versatile!
B00MH3VWY6|4|a little small
B00IV6D31S|4|Very pleased with quality and fit
B008F0JKRQ|3|small size but fit for medium
B00ISLM93O|2|The woven labels are fixed on the clothes inside. The baby's skin is very delicate, the woven labels can let it feel uncomfortable.But if I get rid of them, the clothes will be broken.
B00334TCQ8|2|Almost forgot about this pin. It looks SOOOO cute, then it fell apart lol! I would love more than anything to get this again so I could glue everything with super glue as a preventative measure so it wont fall apart once I put it on something. Maybe someday when I feel like wasting another $4, but for anyone looking to buy it, just know it wont last more than a week on your backpack
B00HZEW00M|5|Nice
B004HHNZH2|5|I bought this pants for a gift praying for exact size! They arriaved as estimated and as expected!! Right size, match perfectly and look very fine!!
B00F9F4IZ4|3|The material is not very good and it is comes smaller that what is says.  At department stores I run a Medium or Large and even though I ordered an xl.....it quite small.
B003N23BFI|5|I was looking for a reversible belt for a couple of weeks. I saw this on Amazon so I decided to get it. It is made very well, with real leather  and priced anywhere between $5 to $10 cheaper than local stores
B009AFGZ9Q|5|I bought these jeans as a gift for my daughter. They fit perfectly and are even cuter on. She wears them frequently and loves how they fit her curves.
B008W324NI|5|Love it instead of everything being scattered in the bottom of my purse it all has a place and is nicely organized!
B0027URV6M|5|Ever since I watched the movie Memoirs of a Geisha, I have been yearning for a kimono robe.  My robe arrived in 2 days & I was so excited to try it on.  The robe transformed me into a young Geisha girl instantly.  I ordered the mist color & the silk is absolutely the most luxurious fabric...it just clanged to my body.  The color & the detail hand painting are just stunning...it looks just like the image online.  Don't believe the bad reviews because the measurments are right on the money.  I'm an African American woman with a nice round booty, hips and thighs & I wear a size 10 in pants and an 8 on top, I have what you would call a \\"coke a cola bottle\\" shape.  The robe is a little long because I'm only 5'3 & 1/2, so I may get it hemmed a couple of inches.  I love this robe so much I'm going to buy the plum color also.  I will entertain my own Chairman in these robes.  Enjoy!!!
B00Z2C69EW|5|Awesome
B00BHEFN0K|5|hubby loves
B0052AKT9K|5|I adore this product. While i wasnt sure at first how I was going to like the subtle checkerboard accent and since the night dress was hard to see I had my doubts-but I shouldnt have!<br /><br />Its beautiful in color, seams are clean and finished, straps are comfortable and lovely. I just cant rave enough, everyone whos seen my lovely new houserobe adores it. Take a chance with this!<br /><br />reference: 5'7&#34; 106lbs.
B007JBJA0E|5|This is an amazing comfortable bra that conforms to your shape.  It is very good if you have had breast surgery and need the softness and difference in sides.
B0009MZYEQ|1|I am extremely disappointed with this product.  Thorlo used to be a very high quality sock, with very thick heel and toe cushion, and remainder of sock very thick also, HOWEVER, these new Thorlos are watered down versions, heel and toe very thin material, and remainder of sock is also thin.  Not much cushion in the heel and toe area, poor quality.  I will not buy any more of these Thorlos unless the quality goes way up, VERY DISAPPOINTED, Thorlo has gone way, way, way, way, way, way, downhill, they have gone the CHEAPSKATE route.  Shame on THORLO.
B000S6O5VQ|5|I didn't really expect a great wig, it will service our purpose though
B00BFW97DI|5|Its a duck costume. Awesome!
B00NTOE21M|2|The dress looks cheaply made. Threads were hanging. I don't know if it was suppose to look unfinished but there wasn't any hems on it. I would have sent it back but it just wasn't worth the effort.
B00243FULA|5|The black leather inlays on the buckle are a nice touch and the leather is of good quality. Thank you.
B007IRVVZG|5|Nannette always makes great clothes and this outfit was no exception.  It fits great and for the price looks more expensive than it is.
B00DGWRRDM|5|I bought this as a gift, and he loved it.
B009FV9VT6|5|I love this blouse and have gone back and purchased 4 more in different colors so comfy too. GREAT BUY
B00CJRMCWG|5|I actually bought this at an actual costume store not online and it is pretty cool. Got it to wear to prom (woodland faerie/nature themed and I was an LOTR style elf) and had a lot of compliments. The material is that fake velvety stuff that's on a lot of costume dresses and was sewed well. The only problem quality wise for me was the crown which I wasn't going to wear anyway, but it is two pieces of rubber that are supposed to snap together and the holes for the pieces on mine were torn and it smells like your in a room full of new tennis balls. Took off the gems to use for other stuff. The netting stuff on the sleeves and cloak snag really easily too if you're not care full. The v cut on he neck line might be a bit low. I ended up sewing skin colored fabric on the inside of it. Color wise the actual dress is close to the picture except for the pins on the cloak and sash. The metal on those is gold-ish, not silver like in the picture and the sash pin has peridot colored gems not yellowish like pictured. Overall it was worth the price and looked beautiful on. Highly recommend it.I'll have to find another reason to wear this again. :)
B00QKHZW5U|2|Ordered for 9 year old who is taller than average (not quite a size 12)  and still too tight and length of pant is in her mid leg/pedal pusher more than Capri
B008EHO4O4|2|Great quality, however after my daughter wore them for a week, I kept noticing the right boobie kept falling off. Turns out it is waaaay bigger than the other one. 😕
B00DW7I0SC|3|Shirt is cute but size runs a bit small.
B00ER3UZ7O|5|Fit and style is great.  Great quality as well.
B0001YS2GY|5|This is my second purchase of these jeans. I like the way they fit. They look great and comfortable to wear.
B00AZU86L0|5|Excellent
B00FHL1H1I|4|It is a cute dress not really for a busty woman..You need to wear a slip since its very translucent and it was shorter than expectes
B005VYXSF4|2|It was giant, and I don't mean just the size... it is super long and super fluffy. Even my princess-y 5 year old was turned off by the huge amount of fabric in the skirt.
B00GI6IN2W|5|Love this!
B002DNEUD0|3|Belt is perfect for what I needed it for - and it is very cute - but I dont expect it to last long - pretty flimsy, but the price was right and I didn't have to go out looking for it.
B00IMB2N8G|5|Awesome...
B00W6URIPC|4|I liked it, it's beautiful, but it was too small.
B00AK02VUM|1|This gown was very disappointing. Not only did it have a tear in the seam when I got it along with several snags in the material in various other spots but I also didn't receive any kind of packing slip or return info. Very low quality product. Will be trying to return, will not buy again.
B007P78TEA|5|I recommend this shirt. Nice shirt
B00LI6SWVO|5|My husband loves this! Great Christmas gift!
B004IAKNVY|3|I'm usually a size medium but I got this in a medium and it's very long. It definitely runs larger then the actual size. But this is my favorite band so I'll wear it anyway! The material is very comfortable and the fox on it is the best thing about this shirt.
B00CPTG15M|4|It fits nice
B00J96Y0TS|3|Not completely happy. It rubs on my side. Maybe after I wear it a few times it will be better.
B00MI7Q31S|5|This is just beautiful and I have ordered a few of them. I like the reviewers idea to have these available along with a cord to put around your neck. I take my glasses on and off a lot during the day, so that would be a great feature.<br /><br />This is very elegant, and I carry mine everywhere.
B00L37WFIO|3|The bottom was fine. Top too small
B00FB84WIM|5|the dress run a little bit small, I bought the size 16 because I would like to be relax in this but its ok.<br />I wear it for my son christening its was amazing, prestigious  I love it
B001OA8YZS|3|Product is nice. I did not pay enough attention to where it was being shipped from (China) arrived after Christmas.
B005N50WT6|1|Bought this mask thinking it looked great online, when it got to my house it looks nothing like the picture.  it was flattened in the box, cheap plastic, uncomfortable and looks nothing like charlie sheen
B00M1ANNME|2|Its nice jacket but for an extra large it's tiny.
B00GMOA1KC|5|will be nice with boots and long sweater /top.  very supportive. going to but a pr for my dtr in law, she likes this style.
B00STV2A5U|5|I bought this shirt for my son. He loves math and he loves his new shirt. It fits him perfectly.My order arrived faster than expected.  I will definitely order from ThisWear again!
B001NEKCV4|5|I had been searching for the perfect bra for quite some time, and once I discovered the Olga brand, I stopped searching.  I love the quality and the price of these bras. They are very supportive, which is of the utmost importance to me.  This style is a little different from my other ones, which are very lightly padded. I like both styles and will continue to purchase Olga bras in the future.
B00FXPS4P0|5|excellent
B00KB2WUYG|2|Cheap clip. Snapped in no time pouch is good
B0034G65GA|5|I like it because the size 5 is perfect for me, the size that I wear is medium !!! ...
B000MSHNS2|1|The item sent to me is not as advertised. It does not carry a bow as advertised. The sizing is incorrect as well as the large toddler hat fits the head of a normal adult. g
B00KPPR7CO|5|This style, pleated sans a belt, is not available in my retail stores hence the on line order. The size choice was based upon a decade old pair I did buy in a retail store. That made the fit chances greater. The length was perfect as well.
B002P47DPO|2|looks like it was cut out quickly and stitched just as fast (not well). Job looks like it was rushed but wasn't worth sending back for the price. The psychedelic pattern was not as pictured and not even close but again....won't do it again.
B00DQFF0GU|4|Pleased with it. I don't thinkI have gained weight but is a tad small for a size 10.  Still like it.
B00DMEVJJC|4|Well made, just shrinks when washed due to being 100% cotton.  I bought 2 turtlenecks in 2 different sizes and the larger of the 2 fit my son best.
B0053ABO20|1|shipping was fast. however, the straps were weird. they weren't exactly loose but flared out in the back in an unflattering way. Plus the girl makes it seem like it's mid-thigh when it's really knee length, also unflattering for the type of dress this is supposed to be. I bought it thinking it's cheap, if anything I can return it, but I wouldn't recommend wasting your time and money. Let's just say it's harder to return than it is to buy.
B00E835DM0|5|most favorite purse ive ever owned
B00LGZ22YA|5|Great dress, fits very well. The material is high quality and flowy, but heavy enough so the wind doesn't pick it up. The only concern I had was the length was a little long, my height is 5'3&#34;. I'm use to shorter length dresses, but still pretty enough to wear.
B00A8DDAFQ|5|Arrived on time as estimated for delivery, my daughter loved it, these 2 peace or 3 peace sets are the lovely kind of present that u can order, since it's full cover, fabric is nice and quality, after washing it doesn't shrink or anything like that, I both several sets and they all fit great.<br />Will buy some more in the future.
B000BR2CGC|5|The Trump shirts tha I ordered are of great quality. They ar thick in texture and secure in design. I have received many compliments while wearing the shirts.
B00DIXGQF4|5|Great shirt, high quality material. The green color is a little darker than pictured, but color differences can vary depending on your monitor. Overall, great shirt, brand remains true to size!
B00AARIQCM|5|I am very pleased. Good fit and nice material. They wash perfectly. I am at home 90% of the time and find the pockets quite handy.
B008JRMT9G|5|slim fitting but that was expected because that's how they are in the show. im 6'8 and the 2XXL came down to my waist. the sleeves were long enough to reach my wrists. i normally wear it with a hoodie underneath.
B00WDFJ7R2|4|exactly as pictured and great price!
B00CC3A3KA|5|Seems to be excellent quality; will see after a few wears and washings. I like the cotton blend; it resists wrinkles pretty effectively.
B008F6G2EE|5|I WANTED a black AND a brown one. When I tried to put two different ones on the same order it kept doubling the original pick. I was heading to Pennsylvania and I needed one immediately. So I ordered the black one and had it shipped guaranteed delivery. Then I ordered in a separate order the brown one and had it sent withy my Amazon free shipping.<br /><br />I got two notices of purchase. BUT, I STILL received TWO BLACK shirts and they both came in the same package (after the guaranteed date) on the day before I left.<br /><br />I meant to call and complain but had forgotten after I came home from Pa. Great shirt though!
B0092FW3CW|5|Feels great and the short is the perfect length for someone who is 58 yrs. old
B00DMAB4WI|5|This is not a &#34;support&#34; bra, but very comfortable comfort bra. easy to  put on, esp. after surgery. I  ordered more.
B004UO27NU|1|This is the last time i order something w/o a review first it came 4 days late and i can't blame amazon because they were on point. When it came it was wool. Gray wool with a string on it. No adhesive and it was large as my face. Ridiculous never again.
B000TA8LJ8|5|I bought several pair in 2009; liked them and bought more a few years later, so my sock drawer now consists entirely of Wigwam socks. They're so durable that almost all of the original lot are still in the rotation after six years, and I walk a lot. It's almost impossible to wear these out. Recently some of the oldest ones were losing elasticity and becoming too loose, but the heels were still in good shape so I took them in a little and they fit fine again. This tendency to stretch is their only weakness, but only after they've outlasted other brands by years.
B00COG2BA0|5|What a great costume. I was very sexy and fitted very well. I didn't expected to be this beautiful... I was really impressed and more than satisfied.... It looks and fits so beautiful. I recommended 100% AMAZING
B00G6NVIY2|3|This bra is very cute, however it was extremely uncomfortable to wear after a short time due to the fabric. The material also shows through shirts. I would have not paid this price for it if I would have found it in a store. The fit was true to size.
B008CHF1PM|1|The jeans even though they are supposed to be skinny, they were a little to baggy in the leg. Also they were an &#34;ankle&#34; length cut and that wasn't stated in description.
B00X4SA2Z8|3|Ordered a MEDIUM for our friend and it is on the small side; had I known, would have ordered a LARGE for her.  Otherwise, she liked the shirt.
B001IBIDJU|5|These were a gift for my husband... very classy and I had them ingraved. I have to put more words to let my input stay... so there you go. :)
B00EVVW6OM|5|I now have 2 Miraclebody Judy Pants, one in denim and the new black ones. These are the best fitting pull on pants I have ever owned. They have tummy control in the front that make your pants look so much better on. I would recommend these pants to anyone who is looking for the perfect fit.
B007SD4K8K|2|How do you measure true to size on products that fit 2 waist sizes?  All I know is the large version of these were far too loose for my taste (waist/legs) and the medium version cut the circulation of in my........legs silly.  The waist fit perfect on the mediums but the leg holes are way too small.
B00ILYPR1E|3|Ok product, all cotton and just kind of hangs because it isn't cut with any kind of shape (not at all like the picture and I have a small waist and some hips like the form shown). Not what I expected, but is a loose fitting relaxed tank.
B005KC8NH0|5|Perfect just what I needed, Perfect just what I needed. Perfect just what I needed. Perfect just what I needed
B0037KLF5O|5|Great for crawlers and extra warmth!
B006E9B0K0|5|good
B00MMHGIZU|5|It's a great hat fits great it was shipped on time I'm very pleased with the purchase .
B00JW1XIIE|5|Great hat! Stayed on my sons head through a whole day of hiking. He has a large head and we ordered the 1-2 year.
B00HHZOQFG|5|Good shirt to wear to support the Military and the Seals. They've done a lot for this country
B00HU1XVYY|5|Love the way they feel plan on buying more
B00KDCBPFY|2|I have to return it and I hate to do that. I wish the size option was clearer.
B0035WTSLC|4|They are okay, a little too tight at ankle but I am keeping them to wear around the house this spring
B0026NKE1E|5|I have tried several kinds of tees for under my uniforms, and none of them loked right, were of decent quality, or both. All my scrubs are Cherokee, so I should have known to stick with that good-quality brand in the first place! This one is great, and I will be buying this brand in the future. It fits well, looks good, and is comfortable.
B00T53D7Y4|4|Beautiful! Very pleased!!!!!!!
B000JHFWC0|5|My husband works in construction and his clothes take a beating.  According to him, they fit perfect: not tight and not too loose.  They don't fade and are very stain resistant.  The material is great in that I can wash them every week, sometimes twice a week and the fabric doesn't wear at all.
B004WGPPQW|2|When I saw this dress I loved it and had to buy it. I read the information about sizing and it states that it fits M-L XL 1X. I wear a size 8 (sometimes 6)and am 5'8\\". I weigh 138 lbs. I do wear  size M and the dress was quite big.   When I contacted the seller letting him know that this dress was really big on me he not only told me to pay attention to his information, but had the nerve to charge me an additional $7.00 for re-stocking. When I complained here is what he said:  Seller Response: \\"We measure each article of clothing individually to ensure an accurate fit. Please check YOUR measurements BEFORE ordering and compare to the measurements given in each and every description. Always read the description before buying. Thanks.\\"  Date: September 20, 2011
B0092KFXLA|4|comfy
B00BFWBO4I|2|It's cheap.  Very cheap.  Needed to be glued on arrival.  Price was an adequate measure of quality.
B00HTX2N3S|5|Such a cute shirt that got compliments
B00VSQD9SK|5|Beautiful on!!
B008H6X36M|5|Amazing pants. They fit me perfectly. Want to try JJ in every style now.
B00B3OK4C6|5|I didn't know what to expect having never bought Nautica brand sleepwear before, but when this nightgown came I was pleasantly surprised. The fabric and stitching seem to be of high quality, and it looked very flattering while still being very breathable and comfortable. It's hard to find comfortable yet flattering and modest (without being stuffy) sleepwear, and this fits the bill. I did put mine in the machine on delicate and low dry, and it shrank just a tad - maybe 1/4&#34;, not too much. If I had the choice to buy it again, I definitely would in a heartbeat. Actually, I'm sad now that I can't buy a backup because I'm certain that I'll wear the one I have now often.
B005XLTIQI|3|I would say they are ok they fit ok and wash fine but the knees get saggy and I've only worn them twice
B00HG8C28C|3|As pictured. But please be wise to choose your size, which is impossible to exchange.
B00Q2Z7CYY|5|Can't go wrong with our favorite sponge!
B008RZANP2|5|I have couple other color on this style. I am a big busted women, it is hard to find something that works in several aspects. This one is a keeper.
B00AW83GP6|4|The item looks nice but the quality is not like regular sweatshirts. So, don't expect it to be warm. Overall, it is a nice, decent pullover shirt. :)
B004LKS1UG|5|Great tummy control and great to use to run errands and workout. I love these pants, they are just perfect length, I'm 5'6'' and it goes to the floor but not too long. They are comfy and functional.
B000VO746S|4|for the money it was fine.
B000VTHXK0|5|I love these socks. I got through tons of socks with out tile floors. These last a long time and I plan on buying more!<br />Never going back to any other kind
B00JAI6ZHA|5|Love these!
B0071UVJRK|1|They look good, but are so small I wouldn't advertise these as adult sunglasses.
B00WO4JBGY|5|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this bathing suit. The fit, the tummy area is very flattering. I received a TON of compliments on the suit and the color, which matches me eyes. GREAT suit...thank you.
B00TJ3XWX6|5|These leggings fit just as I expected and are extremely comfortable.<br />I typically wear a size 14/15 so I ordered the XL which fits perfectly if not a tiny bit tight at the top.  However, the top of the leggings reach my belly button so this gives them more of a slimming effect.  They're pretty great for a woman with a little bit of a stomach.  The pattern is also printed so that it is very flattering on the curves of my legs and butt.<br />I am very happy with this purchase and I would definitely recommend these leggings for both comfort and style.
B004NP65VQ|5|Love these scrubs. They feel above average in quality and fit just the way I like them. I ordered them as the same size as my  Cherokee scrubs and they were pretty close in fit to those (since Cherokee now owned the Dickies medical brand, it goes to reason the cuts would be similar). Great material, great build, good color saturation. Very happy!!!
B001O9BEM4|5|What makes these worth your money is the waist band is nice and wide and elastic and very comfortable.<br /><br />Of course the main thing is the pouch.  It provides good support and does not bind.  Stays cool and comfortable no matter what I am doing.<br /><br />They are 100% cotton.  I purchased the XL even though my previous jockey brand was a large.  Over the years I have usually bought underwear one size under what was recommended and that has worked well for me.<br /><br />This time I decided to go with the size recommendations.  When I first tried them on they seemed too large and too high waisted.  I fixed that.  Washed them in warm water and dried medium heat.  They were much better.  Repeated this again and they now on the third wash have stopped shrinking and fit perfect.
B003R6SSWG|5|I was searching for a basic, comfortable, nice-looking camp shirt. I was so happy to find these silk shirts by Tri-Mountain! Since others have found the sizing to be tricky, it may help to know that I'm almost 5'9\\" and relatively slim, and size medium is perfect for me. They iron beautifully; be sure to use steam and a medium setting. I ordered two and liked them so well I bought two more colors.
B00KEJLVLE|5|Just what I was looking for :)
B007C2PVTO|5|i love the cotton of the gerber shirts. thin and soft. This is just basic shirts for babies.
B00C9WEH7E|5|Fast delivery Great quality perfect fit. First time purchasing true religion jeans love it from now on I will just buy true religion jeans, nothing else.
B00BCYDSL6|5|Worth the money! My little girl looked so cute for her first birthday party. I am going to buy the same one for my 3 year old.
B0031KPY6G|4|Great pants for dirty work! The pair I've had have been through hell and back! Heavy Duty and the ability to add knee pads is a plus....
B004TQHBU8|5|I wear a 34/34 and these jeans fit as expected. Ive only wore them a couple time thus far, but I can tell they are going to outlast any other pair that I have.
B00LSXELDK|3|I usually wear a small or size 2 in women's and wear a 32C - if you just want something to cover yourself it's fine.  For me, this bra had very little support and is a little loose feeling.  I was looking for a bra that would be comfortable to sleep in.
B006L1MP6E|4|No complaints. There's lots of buttons but they look great with a black blazer for work.
B000OBB86K|5|Very cute authentic looking costume.  Since it was too tight around the neck I punched some holes in the back and tied it up with a shoelace like a shoe.
B00OM8UDVW|3|Not very tight for average size men. could of been one size down.
B00B58LAUA|4|Strong construction and comfortable. Machine washable or dry clean. What more can you ask for out of a pair of pants?
B00DHX7KPK|4|Fabulous dress.  I did order a size smaller than recommended on the size chart.  I'm glad I did.  With the exception of being a bit long on the arm straps (because I'm 5'1&#34;) and long it was great.  A little tailoring to make it fit me perfect will be worth it.  It was a great value and would look good on the 'red carpet'.
B00URJK0B8|4|NIce tie.  The colors are very true to the picture online.
B00DUH6OBY|4|The product is like page describes. Fabric is OK, color is like photo describes and fit is perfect .... ...
B009SDU20S|4|I bought this mask for my daughter, she needed it for a mascarade school dance. And we loved the way it look.
B00FC8JBJG|5|💋💋💋💋
B00CRWO3Q6|4|Too small
B0077BA10O|5|Recently broke my ankle and need comfortable sock to wear inside big black medical boot. These are not to snug to get on and off my sensitive ankle, just long enough to cover and protect ankle incisions fro surgery, and are pleasant colors. I got the white, orange, and bright pink set as well.
B005OPMWMU|5|Perfect fit. They go well under any kind of pants. They are very comfy. Next time i'm buying Boxer Briefs it's going to be the same brand.
B00D3E24DQ|5|It's beautiful
B005S0TF5S|5|Liked it
B00EAOVX58|5|Bought this as a gift for a Four-year old. It's very cute, fits perfectly and washes nicely. Turn the dress inside-out to wash, and it looks great wash after wash!
B000TA1SFW|5|Great Socks ... great service. Completely satisfied with this purchase!!!
B00192LJCQ|5|I ordered this short for my toddler and when it arrived it was so sweetly packaged I was half sorry I wasn't giving it away as a gift; it arrived in a cute, well made little box with a play tiger stamp on it - perfect gift packaging. The shirt is very cute and well made and looks very comfortable. I will order from this company again .
B00V4DIUPO|5|Love it
B0015APNH4|3|I thought these would fit a man that wears size 12 shoe and is on his feet all day in both cold weather and warm...These fit his wife with size 8 shoe.  Too expensive for a housewife's sock..
B000MN6HGG|4|I really like it, it fit me confortable  and color combination was perfect to me, mid size for a mid size senior was also ok.
B00O2Y9ORU|1|Not at all as long as the picture shows....covers shoulder area and that's it
B00LIMW1MY|2|Super thin fabric
B00EKTB8H6|5|In general, everything is very good, even if both pajamas did not fit, they have satisfied qualities.. The smokey was not really good.
B007GN26II|3|The shirt is fine, I would buy it again, but certain lucky brand shirts just are made of a material that is very comfortable and airy. Where this is a thicker material that is totally fine, just sometimes I wonder if this is really lucky brand. But I would buy it again.
B00JL5NVYC|1|I bought a 2xl and it fits my friend that wears a large. Thats what I get for buying this online.
B0033UR1UQ|5|Awesome top!! Will wear it many times, comfy too! Fits a little larger since I listened to reviews and bought a size bigger but still not too big
B004R8RK0E|5|Excellent work pants.
B001VNBAWM|5|fit well,  my gut ( beer gut they call it but I don't drink )  better than having your belt buckle jam into your gut.  I love these..
B00LOB6FS0|5|I live in these pajamas at home.  They wear well & are so comfortable.  I am 5' & weigh 108 pounds & wear a small.  Length in both arms & legs is perfect.
B000CCIPWQ|5|easy to use.  no need to match shirt to tiedown.
B000QWA2KU|2|Having read all the mixed reviews on this product, I was still very excited to use it.  My plan was to wear it after I delivered my baby to help my body get back to normal and to help me get back into my old clothes sooner.  This product wasn’t all together bad, but I have three words of caution: 1) The reviews that say you will probably need two different sizes for wearing it post-delivery are totally true. 2) If you order it too small, which I probably did, this thing will dig into your back and hurt! 3) After a month or so of wearing, it will develop permanent folds and will not stay flat.<br /><br />That being said, I may have had issues with it because I ordered it too small and my expectations were too high.  If you purchase the Squeam, just remember that there are no magic products out there, and if there are, this isn’t it!
B00JMQ4O2I|5|Love the Morgan stretch shirts. I'm 5'2&#34; and 120 pounds and the small fits good. It does fit very fitted to show off the curves. If you want a little more room, order a size up. The fabric is soft and the shirt is long which I like. I ordered two of these, and will order more soon.
B003R1RV7O|5|My 14 year-old son loves these pants. He has a lean but muscular build and has had trouble finding jeans that fit his width and height. These pants look very nice and the straight leg is not too tight or narrow. My son is about 5' 4 in height and 125lb in weight. We purchased the 16Reg.  I would be happy to answer questions or clarify my review to help others. Cheers!
B0092HQD30|5|Fit and warm, also love the design
B004ARZKJA|5|These are much better than the lousy ones I ordered previously.  The Dockers here are large and soft, just like I like a handkerchief to be.
B0060WCYPQ|5|It arrived a week early and I am very pleased with it.
B000VL29SE|5|I bought this robe as a Christmas gift for my husband, and it was exactly what I was looking for.  My husband is smaller (size 38S), so I wanted a robe that wasn't \\"one size fits all\\"; the small/medium size of this robe fit well, only slightly big.  The appearance of the robe is very attractive: a nice, muted gray plaid exactly as it appears in the picture.  I also love the flannel material, as it is warm and comfortable without being heavy.  This robe is easy-care, although it did wrinkle slightly when I washed it.  Overall, I think this robe is likely to appeal to most men who want a simple yet functional every day robe--highly recommended!
B00LHN98Z2|5|good
B00EM4PWS0|5|very soft
B0043RSVPM|5|This dress is beautiful!!! It looks even better in person. Shipping was fast. I would recommend to anyone looking for a lightweight, silk material summer dress.
B00389X4QW|3|This is the most comfortable and 'invisible' bra I've ever worn. Very soft next to your skin. My teenage daughter and I had a very hard time finding a comfortable bra until we discovered this one.    Update: I changed it to 3 stars from 5 because after several washes it got \\"pills\\" on it and wasn't as soft.
B001C8XZWY|5|Perfect for my witch. Very well made
B007O0CBV0|5|Lightweight & cool, very soft and comfortable. Very happy with these pants! I would definitely buy these pants again and I highly recommend them.
B00KLDY5DE|5|Best band ever! Awesome tour shirt too, I only wish I could be there to see them on tour
B00MPE6RGA|2|Great quality shirt, but runs very large!!
B00OZIZFAS|5|Work very well, holds many cards, works well for my needs.
B00AOMYHDA|5|look awesome!
B00814ZG3I|5|This is a great footie. It's lightweight, which I liked very much. Perfect for spring and summer. It runs a bit roomier, which I like.
B00BDAEPZM|5|This bathing suit is so cute!<br />It's flirty, fun and comfortable.<br />My only warning would be that it definitely runs small.<br />I normally wear an XS-S in clothes, but needed a Medium in this suit. The torso is tight and exposes too much if you buy too small of a size.<br />Definitely go a size up, you won't regret it.<br /><br />The ruffles are adorable and it's super trendy.
B001I28UTW|5|For years I wore only Levi's, now fully converted to Carhartt.  These are very comfortable, very well made, wife loves how they look (always a plus).  Thigh side pockets on each side are very handy for cell phones/notepad/etc.  Also, pen/screwdriver loops on each side, and a hammer loop is actually stitched well enough to hold a hammer.
B006MJHZD8|5|This top is so cute.  It is very comfortable and fits very well.  The material is soft and stretchy and doesn't wrinkle.
B000G72W2Q|1|This is a pair of cheaply-made pants.  The rosso design is not flattering at all, maybe only on a mannequin.  Nobody should wear this outside the house.  I've seen pajama pants from Walmart that looks better at a fraction of its price.  This must be either a knockoff or Miu Miu just slapped its label on a pair of $5 pjs from a discount retailer.
B00863JVQC|5|It is casual enough that I will wear it out with friends, but I dressed it up for work too. Fits well, unlike other reviews I read, I ordered my size and it fits loosely, but not too large. If you want it to fit snug, then order a size down, but I think it looks great being looser
B001U8NDUK|5|Fast delivery on a great product. They even had a handwritten Thank You card from the owners. Come on--no one does customer service like that!! WOW!!  Gloves amazing. I pulled out thistle and other weeds without a scrape or scratch. I tried to hurt myself-but could not.  Best garden gloves I have.
B00BQM755E|3|I like it!  I'm big and it fit me very well!  Maybe I'm going to buy it in other colors...
B004JLZIWQ|5|I love love this! It is so sexy and cute at the same time- exactly as the picture and description shows! I love wearing this with my mini skirt:) LOVE love love!
B00ENIJ484|4|It was a lot thicker then I expected. Nice quality. It was gift for my husband he loves it. very happy with this product.
B008F55KMK|5|My son loves these. He is in to all the super heroes right now and was so excited to get these!
B00IXMGKWY|3|Loved the black dress… beautiful light weight material…. wore it with a black cami underneath it… it is pretty low cut in the back for me….. just got it out of the dryer… think the dress shrunk to my knees… it was to the floor and I am almost 5&#34;10…. hoping it goes back long with some serious stretching… other than the shrinking it is worth the money… pretty and very light for summer… doesn't seem too see through but that is why I bought the black. they have the same dress in a shorter version. I ordered that also.. that will end up being a mini if it washes like this one! by the way it took over a month to receive from this company.. that isn't pleasant. If I ordered a replacement I wouldn't get it for summer!
B00QSKSTXG|3|Fit okay, if not as comfortable as other types I've had. The patterns and colors are incredibly loud.
B0058ZBG46|5|These shorts fit perfect! They're not too tight or too loose. I love the tweed looking fabric and design, these will go with a lot of things. The material is very nice and these are better than just your everyday shorts. I am normally a size 1 in jeans of this brand, but the size 0 in shorts fit me perfectly. I'm 5' 2&#34; and weigh 90 pounds.
B00JVZPM4O|5|I have been wanting these jeans for a very  long time. They fit just perfect, and are a good color for the rest of my clothes. Thanks Amazon I really appreciate you.
B0002TORXU|5|These are soft, comfortable, and have stood up to a few washings with no sign of wear & tear.  I would definitely recommend them.
B00B285BNA|5|I look for gag gifts for X-mas and this one gave everyone a good laugh.  My husband loves bacon!  And it is fine a little large because even if it shrinks a little we'll still get many more laughs from it.  😃
B001CBMLNK|5|This hat is very comfortable and stunning.  I got so many compliments on it.
B007PE0ZN6|4|Even though they run large they still work.  As a diabetic my feet can swell so large is better than tight.  They are very comfortable
B00J0EFSAE|3|it was ok till a week later the side started to tear. I don't carry much in my wallet. so I was disappointed about that.
B008H5WQP2|5|Great quality
B00NVI6UBG|5|Loved it many compliments
B00C7WBZI0|5|good quality and good style  i love it~
B00MYOD2BY|4|this was a really cute corset, look and quality was better than i expected for the price
B00GOJVXSY|3|It's okay
B003RDMJFG|5|I bought this item for the bride to wear at the rehersal dinner luau. Many commented on how pretty the head piece was. It was perfect.
B002B9U8S2|5|I enjoyed  my spurs. they fit just right thanks
B001RTSCTE|4|good selection of color, comfortable fit
B002OG6JGW|5|My daughter is going as a sexy hello kitty. Perfect for her costume ideas... The right color of red. Fast.
B00LO1RP8Y|5|So cool
B00NGUYJFI|4|My son loves it, and it looks good on him. Runs a little tight for him.
B001PKZWWK|5|this fit my husband perfectly amd had really quick shipping,
B00MZ5B46W|5|I have worn these in the past and needed to order a few more.  I love these tops and they are perfect weight and fit for under sweaters and/or sweatshirts.  Nice and warm for the winter.
B008RCEIRO|5|If you're looking for a wallet that stands out and makes an impression, this is the one! The quality is readily apparent the moment you take it out of the box and pouch it comes in. The wallet is flawless in appearance and construction. I was looking for something quite different to carry other than the traditional plain black and brown leather wallets that everyone has, and this one is perfect. Really stands out, and beautiful in form and function. Price wise it's very comparable to traditional high quality leather wallets. A great buy!
B007D3EWCY|5|:)
B008Y4W55W|1|The bra cup is a joke. Maybe for an xs. The width was fine for the bra band and width of the undies too.
B002HOYWCE|4|The beret is comfortable, fits the way I want it to and is thick enough to keep my head warm.  I only gave it 4 stars because the red color is a little washed out, not the bright red I was expecting.
B00FRGNDWY|3|I bought this for my daughter for Christmas and it was absolutely adorable and the seller shipped and processed the order very quickly. I was just a little disappointed by the fabric it was made of it looked like a cheap polyester blend. But my daughter loved it so that's all that really mattered.
B00NMDAIWC|5|I love It
B00AHFJDA6|5|this is the new &#34;thing&#34; with the kids at school.  Quite Pricey but quality is good.  They are perfect for cold weather,  and surprisingly not so cool days too.  Great freedom of movement,  washes and wears well. Just wish the price was lower, but other brands that were the in &#34;thing&#34;  have been worst.
B001JBNICG|2|than by the end of the day you had to keep pull them up
B0001YRBWK|1|These were Returned as they fit like a 36 waist! Also they are a very stiff material they are made of.
B00KGUKCQG|1|Way too small for the average person and shorter than photo
B00AECCYSA|5|as expected. could use some longer stays but that is not the fault of this box, more of not looking closely enough to make sure the size is right on my apparently longer than cool collars.
B00J2UFWEI|4|Having previously bought these jeggings in khaki I was surprised that the denim was cut a bit smaller.  The fabric is of decent quality and COMFY. SO COMFY!
B00P0AD5OI|5|Love love love this item. Definitely a repeat purchase item.
B00JALI1RY|5|Great quality, and exactly what I was looking for! I really wanted a night gown in this style for my 3 month old, and this fi perfect with room to grow! Great for night time diaper changes.
B00K6MQCT0|1|After less then 3 weeks of wearing this to work I noticed the seems were already beginning to split.
B00JJCCGHA|4|No complaints
B003CMXLEA|5|They are going to go great with my Halloween costume. My toddler wants nothing more than to wear them all day every day also.
B00KGCLDFI|5|I’ve had toes socks over the years, but most of them were big and bulky. Of course those were meant to be worn more as cozy slippers during the winter or on nippy fall days. These Mato & hash toes socks are quite comfortable and comfy feeling. They are very stretchable and should fit as expected.<br /><br />I do have a medium-sized foot and should have gotten the small/medium for a woman, which is size 5 to 10. Because they are stretchable, they still fit nicely. There’s some ribbing in the foot part that most likely keeps the socks from bunching up (I hate that) or slipping down into my shoes.<br /><br />The socks are a solid knit with a sewn-in 3/4” cuff at the top. I’m not a runner, but do like to have this type of sock for walking around the house. The quality is quite good and the price quite reasonable. I wouldn’t hesitate to purchase these socks for a gift or for myself if I wanted more of them.<br /><br />FEATURES:<br /><br />► Breatheable Construction - 75% Cotton 22% Polyester 3% Spandex<br />► Hygienic alternative to barefoot feeling without cold feet<br />► No bunching or twisting<br />► Five toe design supports natural alignment of foot for better tactile movement, increased circulation and increased balance<br />► Crew cut for classic fit<br /><br />Sample provided for review.
B00GWT5A44|5|This I will wear often for going places, like doctor, out to eat, it is nice enough to go out to a fancy place, I wore it with a Skort, it looked beautiful. Easy wash no iron. Great quality
B00GVLRNUW|4|I love them. In regards to negative reviews, honestly I wasn't buying these expecting them to be good alone for cold weather. Those thermals have a very distinct look as they have to be thick enough.<br /><br />They fit well underneath daily wear clothes. When it gets 40 and below I wear them to sleep in and they're perfect. I run on the colder side, as is average for an adult woman.
B000UAPON8|2|Pretty cheap bra, the straps have no elastic and the padding is only on the bottom, so there's a huge gap at the top.
B007OWR6MW|5|great just what i was looking for
B005STN302|5|Good material. Good quality. Fit well (I am 5&#34;1, 110lbs and wear a size small). Very fast shipping. Totally love it !!!!
B005KT5Y8Y|2|I used my psych club points for this. im so glad I didnt pay for it! it's paper thin. no woman is going to want to wear it without a full shirt on underneath...not that they make it in a woman's fit so we look kinda boxy (yay...). The logo/graphic is okay, but for the price it's highway robbery. fans deserve better.
B002KDQ7NY|3|I thought for almost $54.00 that these gloves would be made of substantial quality leather, which I have purchased at Macy's.  They were thin and had no \\"new leather\\" smell - almost vinyl-like.  Cashmere was flimsy & caught on my wedding rings.  Simply your average glove at an above average price.  We'll see how they hold up.
B00ENTD4AC|2|They are ok for under a dress or a skirt, but as leggings they don't really work. They are like thick panty hose, so slightly see through :( Just not what I was wanting.
B0011E73WC|5|This bra in extremely comfortable and gives a smooth look under clothing but I especially love the wide comfort straps. They provide excellent support and are incredibly soft.
B0014F1SII|1|Didn't last one wear. Tiger eye came off when trying on!
B00ATCBV0C|2|Nice price, but you're not getting much!  Very little absorbency and super thin.
B004MC3RPW|5|Super durable, I have abused the heck out of this and still looks brand new.
B000CCOIF4|4|just what we needed
B0036GW0BW|5|I really like this bra it has good support fit nicely and I like the color I want to order another but they only have the pink when they get other colors back in stock I will purchase another
B0076RQLPI|2|The size was  more like 1X,. The dress was a little to tight beneath the boost. It is still really cute.  Just wish it was more true to size.
B00JRH1QW8|5|Husband love these pj
B00GR1LEU6|3|while this warm and soft, I would not exactly call this burgandy.  It i more of a red tone.  I was also disappointed with the messy stitching that joins the scarf into a circle.  It is extremely obvious and the &#34;continuous circle&#34; should be more neatly meshed
B00OPUITKO|5|Love love love this product!! I posted a full review on my blog: kerihillbeauty.squarespace.com<br />Check it out!
B004PNW5JW|4|I sometimes fit regular sizes and sometimes need tall.  This doesn't come in a tall size and was a little short in the regular size.  GotApparel processed the return and refund very quickly.
B0083H3R16|5|My boyfriend loves these! They fit great and he often grabs for these over his &#34;nicer brand&#34; shorts that he finds less comfortable. He is 5'10'', 175 lbs., and the medium size fit him perfectly. They have probably been washed 25 or so times yet they still look the same as the day I bought them. Highly recommended!!
B00B7O2WCW|5|Great
B00DNUGO1I|5|I received this jacket today, and I am actually surprised at how nice it is.  It is lined, has a lot of great details, and is a great price.  The jacket has a bit of stretch so it is very comfortable.  It has one hook closure in the front, and padded shoulders, but not too padded.  The sleeves are long(which is hard for me to find) but the body is suited better for a little shorter of a person.  I am 5' 8&#34; and weigh 130 with a 34d bust, and the 6 fits well, a little short  in the body but not too bad.  Overall is it a great jacket.
B004ARVYXQ|5|Husband remembered that his Father had these...and thanked me for helping his &#34;Gentleman&#34; image. They are soft and dry quickly.
B00NM74KZE|1|Another piece of junk in the hat dept
B00SG8DVT0|5|Love it.  It is classy and the material is nice and it fits me just right.  I would buy this again in a different color and the price was very reasonable.  I'm tall and it makes me feel very elegant.
B004GGUA0O|5|Nice print, good quality textile, size is a little bit smaller than expected.
B002QDZIZ6|4|I liked very much. It´s seams like the picture and fit perfect. I bought the xs size for my dauther, she is 13 and it was perfect for her.
B00A159VRM|5|the dress set is perfect! the colors, the size are just right. For a 2 years boy fits perfect! recomended!
B005XRV8RE|5|I got these for all the guys in my wedding party, along with myself. They looked great. Slightly wider than the strip where the buttons on your shirt lie. Super skinny...if that's what you're looking for.
B00DP5NNCY|5|My son loves it!
B00GG6A16U|5|Just beautiful. I can't believe it is so cheap. I really recommend this one.
B00XK1364I|5|She loves it
B00NOIU7NU|2|The material is fine but the colors are very pale.  Not pretty like the picture at all. Disappointed.
B0043O9NMK|5|I bought these shorts for my wife. It gets hot here in North Carolina in the summer.  My wife normally wears jeans or capris when outside. I bought these shorts that she just loves.  The material is lite and cool. She thinks they are to good for working in the barn.
B00432LTZ6|5|perfect
B008MPV9AA|5|Great Belt, Great Quality, especially for the price. Cant beat it. Does not come with a buckle but does un-snap so you can put a buckle of your own choice on.
B0085TFAVW|5|It pulls up in the back
B004COMHH4|5|The cosplay for this was good the only thing bad about it was just that i gained weight and doesent fit me as it used to. the quality of it is very good and I still have it and would wear it occasionally for anime conventions.
B00K1BUUXK|2|The top runs small and the pants were see through.
B007JTIWS2|3|I thought that it would have pads in the inner bra but it doesn't, you can see everything! I have to wear an extra bra under this. Otherwise it looks nice and I think that it is makes me look thinner.<br />I would return it but I would have to pay for the shipping costs as this item is not eligible for free returns and from where I live, in hawaii, it would cost me too much to ship it back so it is not worth returning it.
B00D6G6OAK|3|They are great and cute pants but they run a little small so order a size up!
B00WJPAPDQ|1|Cannot even believe I had to give this one star...This is by far the worst product I have ever purchased on Amazon. When I attempted to return the dress, because it was so poorly made, my request was denied. I actually have a zipper piece sewed into the side of the dress with no zipper or purpose. The dress is so cheaply made and looks nothing like the photo. Absolute disgust and I would hope, Amazon removes this company's selling privileges. I will nevertheless purchase from this seller again.
B008KTMU2Y|5|These gloves are exactly what I wanted.  They extend all the way up the arm only a few inches away from the shoulder.  The color is perfect.  They are a nice stretch satin.  I wish I had discovered these sooner.
B000VXW3W4|4|I wear these socks to work. They are comfortable and a decent quality. I recommend them. The color also seems to hold up pretty long.
B00A7L5RJ6|4|Nice Fitted Hat. 7 7/8 Fits nice Would recommend to any true Trojan fan or alumni or any person who likes nice fitted hats.
B0018OP0Y8|2|I had read many of the reviews before I purchased 2 pairs of these jeans. The Levi's 501 button fly jeans are the only jeans that I wore in the last 10 years since they fit me well, and I buy an average of a pair a year. This is the first time I purchase the jeans from Amazon though. I have to say that the material of these jeans are a lot thinner than any of the jeans I have purchased. The cut seems to be a little smaller too, but enough for me to send it back for an exchange to a size bigger.<br /><br />I hope that this is an abnormality specific to this seller, and not a change in the overall quality that Levi's decided to go with.If it is, I have to start trying out other brands to find something that fits me better.
B00SCG8VS2|5|I bought this dress for my birthday dinner and im in love!!! Its so classy yet sexy and it fit like a glove! ;D although there were some issues/delays with the delivery i appreciate their hard work and trying their best for it arrive on time! And it did! Thank you!!
B007E5PWZ2|3|Great dress! Wore this to my brothers wedding, just had to hem it a little as it was a tad too long for the look that I was going for.
B00DST756M|4|This is a pleasant enough shirt, but I expected it to be longer, like a tunic more or less.
B00EUTGI2G|5|excellent hat.  Light and airy and elegant.
B0046EHR16|2|This item is unusable.  I wear a size 16 and these do not fit over my thighs.  I don't really understand what makes these stocking plus sized....
B00GFAKMNE|5|👍
B00QFKW4OO|5|kid like
B00QU3YK02|4|A very nice dress. It's hard to find things that fit perfectly. My bust is s large but my waist is a medium. I got the large and it fits my bust... But it's a little big in the waist. But I guess there's no getting around that.
B000THF5DG|4|Exactly what I expected.  Love it!
B001FCZ5N4|5|I find my size (42x30) hard to find or extremely expensive.  To get a pair of IZOD at this sales price and in the color I preferred was remarkable.  The fit is perfect plus free shipping with another product was frosting on the cake.  Amazon had indicated expected delivery by Christmas Eve but later notified me that due to unforseen stocking problems each item would be sent separately BUT still with free shipping.  They both arrived on Christmas EVE in separate packages making my Greatgrandson and me believe there is a Santa Claus and there is Amazon.  The only con and  that is minor considering the pro's is the rather large fly button which can easily be altered.  Two suggestions for the shopper.  Deal strictly with Amason if problems arise and READ the CUSTOMER reports before choosing a product.  I highly recommend the IZOD pants at the deal I got to anyone on a limited budget who thrives on  giveaway prices.
B004BN36NU|2|returned for refund, too small
B0083I3EDG|5|Very nice looking hat. My son will be wearing this hat at his wedding this fall.
B00SFHQRS4|5|It's just as it looks. ... it's extremely soft and warm. . Great for my daughter while ice skating. Also very light.  Love is.
B00C5JTIE8|4|Exactly what we wanted!
B000P7WQC8|5|Great fit fast shipping
B00HZ4AJ64|5|My son wore this suit this morning for his Communion. It steamed up beautifully and everyone raved about it! Very good quality, and the tie was also included! Just make sure your boy has white underwear ;)
B00D3JK9PG|5|I like the fabric; it has a little stretch to it, and not thin (I was afraid of cheap/thin cloth). The chest area looks fantastic, but I need to tailor the bottom a little before wearing since my bust fits large (I fill up C cup), while hip is more on the medium/small range.
B00GBQSL5I|2|This rashgauard is good for the function to protect my daughter's skin from a strong sunbeam. But, one thing I would like to let you know is the logo on the front fell after using this twice.
B000Z6Z5XQ|5|I love these bras. Comfortable, and smooth. Fits great
B00EFT1FJ2|3|To call this shirt xx-large is really a stretch (excuse the pun).  The material is comfortable but very thin and I wonder how many washes it has.  OK at the sale price but ridiculous at \\"full\\" price. Would not buy again.
B00RFYK6TO|5|I love this dress.
B00QMBA3T4|5|Came caster than expected.  Good quality.
B00HW92ZL4|4|Great fit!
B00JHG64BW|5|good
B0030DF8Y2|3|Since these pants are too small, I will have to return them. Bought for my son, who is an exact size 34 waist, they were tight not only in the waist, but in the thigh. The material is high quality, but the size is all wrong.
B00JZX31BI|3|Cute shirt, my daughter loves it. It's just really long and cut very slim.
B00R32DSVQ|4|the hat is too small
B00B281MHO|4|Nice weight - not too thin, not too thick. Comes up higher on foot which works well with sneakers (purchased for this purpose).
B0051D7QVW|5|Wears very well.
B005BVRA0Q|1|They were way to big. The breast pocket look like I had 1 pocket on my hip. Order a size smaller then you wear.
B00CFPLYEE|2|Fell apart within a month, one of the zipper's broke, & the lace looked just terrible.
B00KF1DEJ8|3|Not bad for the prize but doesn't close right with credit cards in it but I like the wallet and use it
B00DW6R6GU|1|When we received this my son got it out of the package and it did not extend all the way.  We messed around with it for about 10 minutes and then returned it.  Not going to pay for something then try to make it work - it should work right out of the package.
B00JPWMRNM|2|I ordered a medium which is what i generally wear (VS medium, Walmart medium, and Target medium all fit well). The bottoms are super small, as in they dip very low in the front/barely cover my behind. Granted I have an athletic body, but mediums usually give me plenty of coverage. Another issue was not receiving the product I ordered. I placed the order thinking I would get the bikini pictured, but instead I received a strapless bikini was tassels?! The product was cheap so honestly it's not worth the time to try to get it fixed.
B00PVWWJV0|1|The ugliest thing I've ever put on my body made extremely cheap would never buy it again ugly ugly ugly
B003MQMZ8O|1|I read reviews staying it fits smalloso I bought a size larger than I normally wear. The pants still looked like yoga pants on me! Nice costume, sized way too small.
B004QTFI7G|5|I love this shirt, and I always get compliments on it. Hahaha I wore it to the airport once too and that was funny since a person working there had read it aloud, &#34;evil..&#34; and I had to say B*tch back to him. hahhahaa
B00CY8R9PK|5|I need a hot top to wear with cute black shorts out in LA, I ordered this and it was perfect! it was sheer, but not too sheer that I couldn't just wear a bra and be fine. I could easily wear a tank under and wear it to work too with cute skinny jeans! I got a ton of compliments and will definitely be wearing it again!
B007151Y2K|2|Very comfortable until plastic underwire tore through fabric after two months.  Purchased two bras and both had same issue inside three months.  I cannot recommend this product until this design flaw is repaired.
B00I1LVICY|2|Color is not close to it appears in the picture.
B003IC4UIK|5|the wings are very nice. adjustable fit and bendable but strong wiring. For those who are wondering, these are flappable wings so the sides have no wiring.
B00TPGKYYM|5|Great clip and wallet.  Excellent quality.
B00B46YBN6|2|I am a size medium this coat fit too snug even with nothing under it. and I ordered the large. I am a size 8 jeans and Medium shirt 140 pounds.
B007KZ2QBY|1|Do NOT buy. After wearing them 3 times and washing them once, the socks ripped right at the ankle so I can no longer wear them. Terrible quality for a $12 pair of socks.<br /><br />Save your money.
B00DIXFWWM|1|I recently ordered this shirt seeing as it had mostly positive reviews and it was a low price, however, it turned out to be one of the most disappointing online shopping experiences I've ever had. The shirt took over a month to arrive. Once the shirt did arrive,I opened it up, and the XXL that I ordered looked more like a toddlers small. I checked the size tag and it was the &#34;correct&#34; size. The material was so thin that it ripped as I was taking it out of the bag. It had the consistency of a printed paper-towel. And to top it off, the colors on the design were faded and had stains all over them. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS SHIRT, ITS A SCAM.
B000JTA37C|1|The shirt is cool but the t-shirt company puts their web address on the front under the GOT BUDDHA? logo.  I wouldn't have minded so much if it was on the shirt they show on the online picture.  It does take a little away form the look.  I was a little dissapointed.  I won't be using this company again.  The packaging was a little shoddy as well.
B008CXLEWK|5|I am 5 ft tall and about 100 lbs so I bought the small size. It fit very comfortably, but did not expose my mid section like this ad shows. It went to my waist but is a danskin product which means had a non bulky weight, moves nicely, holds shape, made for dancers. It did not interfere with my wearing a leotard and skirt.<br />Wore it in dance class on a chilly rainy day. It is worth having - comfortable and practical.  Danskin quality.
B0088FT3G6|5|Way better than my old cash and credit card money clip. Sturdy and works very efficiently.
B00QT41M58|5|It fits her great looks awsome on. Really glad I got this. it is a good product with a good design
B0049QMGVW|4|Product is ok.  Keeps warm, but not the high end cashmere you would expect to be able to wear with a suit or for an evening out or business if in a colder area. Seller had good service though, so can't fault them for the product.
B0089KWXEY|5|I really like this bra. I got it in an XL,and I'm a 42DD and it fit me well. I immediately tried it on upside down after reading reviews and it wasnt too snug or uncomfortable. I probably could have gotten away with a L but I didn't know how tight it would be and didn't want to chance it. My wedding dress fits me perfectly and this was purchased to give me some kind of coverage underneath. Don't expect it to support like a bra with under wire though. However it is extremely comfortable. I would definitely consider purchasing a L to wear under lose tank tops
B00KDA4GZC|5|beautiful...
B004G8PMRI|1|These pants were made out of very thin cotton and stretchy.  They looked more like pants for a female than a man.  The picture did not match the product we recieved.  It was sent back for a full refund.
B004YJSGWW|4|I'm 5'8&#34; tall and 135 pounds, and this size is a bit too long for me. I would rather my tights on the larger side rather than smaller if I have to choose, but  this size offers too much excess material that I had to bunch up around the upper thigh to hide. I gave them to my daughter who is 5'11&#34; and they fit her perfectly. The 4 stars is simply to help others get the right size. Otherwise a great tight.
B008T9V6X4|2|The PJ set is made very cheaply and the size is incorrect.  Very disappointed but it's not worth sending back.
B0057EDFWY|5|The color is beautiful.  Ran a little big - probably could wear a smaller size.  Washes nicely.  Packs well for travel.
B008KMV9R8|5|Plush nursing pads that are absorbent and comfortable, a must try. These overnights provide extra coverage for nighttime without sacrificing comfort. Best of all-washable and reusable!
B002MD0530|3|This costume was NOT a high quality costume.   There were threads everywhere the emblem on the chest wasn't even gold and the gold stitching on the arms was already falling apart.     But, it worked. I looked awesome on Halloween.  I agree with all the other reviews, you might want to order a size down because my dress was a little big, which is surprising for a medium on me.
B00EVTR7WK|4|A little bulky, but good. Overpriced though, although if you can get it on sale for around $10 it's an amazing product. It looks exactly like it did in the picture, its well made and very warm. Shipping was fairly quick.
B007T52DW2|4|The Vampire of Versailles Child Costume Size Size 8 was a smash.  My son received all sorts of positive compliments.  Unfortunately, as you know, Halloween was short lived as a result of Hurricane Sandy other wise he would have worn it all week long.  He loved it!
B001MXKESW|5|Oh it is very sexy with easy access
B006LN3HSW|1|Very poor quality. I couldn't continue wearing it after I used once because of the fluff
B00XBZ6INE|4|I wish the bottom was hemmed, and it was a bit thicker, but still a cool design!
B00F2GM4S8|3|My daughter is only two years old and wears no bigger than a 3T in clothing. I have noticed that most Hello Kitty clothing items I order are not true to size, they are much smaller. With knowing that, I ordered a size 5 for her. It fits her perfectly right now, but won't be big enough for next year. It's a cute jacket and the price is great. It has some type of sparkles all over the coat, and they are not the kind that fall off all over the place. It's cute, just small.
B00L3ET4UO|4|It's definitely a keeper but I expected a little more room for heavier sweaters.
B00ACIGVJ4|4|These are my husbands favorite but I was quite annoyed that I ordered the colored option and what arrived was the black and grey.
B00HV6GU1Y|5|Bought it for my hubby's graduation party. He was looking quite sharp.
B00DKLQVPY|5|Love this turtleneck! It's warm and soft, yet very breathable. Seems very comfy. I was worried baby would hate the turtleneck part up around her neck, but she seems to have no problem with it. She even falls asleep quite a bit when wearing this. Stretchy enough that she can probably wear it through Christmas (bought for Halloween). Great item!
B00I3PW638|5|What an awesome art concept. Right up my alley. Feminine cut and a nice fit.
B000HE4ON8|5|Now I need a thing 2.  I told her if I find a thing two she needs to have another one.
B001BZ3XPW|5|Very nice. Perfect size--love that it can expand a little with the neck extension.  Short sleeves are comfy. Cute cut. Looks great on my son.
B00B61DSNS|5|I feel like I am wearing silk this dress is so comfortable and very flattering.  The dress is perfect for slipping on for running errands, or dress it up with a side pony and a cute pair of coral shoes!
B00I25HMA6|5|Awesome super warm leggings! They kept me very comfortable in the mountains.
B004LQ05VS|1|Not the haggars at sears
B00NEJZP1I|5|My husband has warn Jockey long johns for a number of years.  He recently spotted these which are a wicking variety.  He has been very happy with them as they keep him warm while not getting so hot he sweats.  They also hold their shape in the wash.
B000MWH43M|5|I ordered the wrong size and sent back with no fuss and even had the correct size turned around in time for Christmas.  Simple belt, does it's job.  Trust the measurements on the sight.  I overshot but I usually have to, not in this case.
B00FHUPRFQ|5|These shorts are well made, comfortable, hold up well during washing and fit true to size.  They hit just about the knee and were a good price compared to what I have been seeing locally.  There is no belt despite the pictures showing otherwise.  But I don't normally wear a belt with my shorts so I wasn't too concerned.
B004VDK83Q|3|Very light hat, easy to carry, nice fit and color too, getting a lot of compliments - but boy is it flimsy for the money - expected a bit more hat - but did not want to shop around to exchange - would not buy another for the price/quality, but like it fine.
B00ZYS8YMO|5|Amazing even though they didn't get to my house on time I still love them thank you Amazon
B0084YJSI4|5|Love the colors! Super cute! The faux fur isn't as thick as I thought it would be.
B0044XHR1E|5|good
B008I0JB04|5|I have small hands with a narrow palm and and longish fingers; but after reading the reviews I ordered a medium.  And they fit perfectly!  Actually, as if they were made for me. I think the size confusion may result from their being made in China, where sizes tend to run smaller. The only thing I don't love is the lace along the top edges which I didn't notice when I ordered.  But they are still beautiful, soft and pliant with a lovely feel of quality.  Based on these, I do intend to purchase more Warmen gloves.
B00A7B77I0|1|the pins are very nice, but I ordered two and only received one, nice going amazon:-(. As a stroke survivor I thought I'd wear the pin to support stroke awareness, to that end it works great, however, it would work much better if i received what I ordered and paid for.
B0085HA4D8|5|Order a size up because it runs a little small. I'm 6' tall & 200#s so xxLG was good I usually order x LG. I'm glad I ordered two wish it had been 4. Best sweater ever.
B00CBEZIAU|5|Warm hoodie style jacket, not heavy but durable.
B00AHTK6BC|5|I am 6'1 and 175 pounds -- this tank fits perfectly.  The material is very comfortable and it does well in the wash without shrinking.
B0026P46CA|5|it is great i have been having trouble finding a good sturdy bra at a good price and i succeeded in both on this buy.
B00NPCPFF0|5|The best leggings ever. You won't be disappointed. Just got my 3rd pair today.
B009IDY0ZQ|4|I hate going out and trying to look cute, I'm a jeans and T-Shirt kind of person. I love this top because it looks so nice, and its really just as comfortable as any of my old t-shirts. My only sadness comes from it being a little long (or me being too short, rather), but it still looks cute with the scrunched up look at the bottom. I love it, really, and look forward to buying more styles. Shipping was pretty fast, too.
B002G9UE2C|5|Great Product! --- Great Service!
B000NRWYTA|1|ordered this after seeing it at the spa .  very disappointed by the poor quality of material, running threads and clearly looked used . return policy is even worse . would not recommend this turban to anyone .
B005DIMVHY|1|I have worn XXL for years. Unfortunately, the vest fits a XL or an L; disappointed. I can't wear it.
B00DOPM1VE|4|I scored high with this present for my wife. She loves it and it fits great but I did need to order a size larger with Columbia. Price is too expensive in my opinion. Cost = -1 star
B00D85Z75C|5|Super comfortable, especially when I use Glide, for my long walks of 10 or more miles.  My feet never get all sweaty and rub.  I like the cushiony feel too.
B00MUT48FM|5|What a great dress! Well made for a costume dress. It could even be worn for a holiday. Our daughter opened this gift on Christmas morning and wore it for two days straight, including to the family Christmas party. Way better quality than what you find in a store like Wal-Mart for the same price. The hair accessory is very nice, too. The best part - this dress does NOT leave glitter everwhere! There are sparkly details on the skirt but they don't leave a glitter trail like so many other things in my little-girl-filled house do. We would definitely buy this one again.
B0090TOISM|5|Looks cute in it.
B00EZG9ARO|1|It appears to be an unfinished product; no body can wear it. I will not order anything else that comes from outside the USA. I'll use it as a dust rag or the like.
B00M4D81IE|5|Arrived super fast. The material is lovely. So soft. Not thick, perfect for covering tattoos or covering your arms when you feel self-conscious. The lace is sturdy, good material. I do not see this as being fragile. The only thing is I would wash it on gentle and on cold. I am going to buy more colors.... that top is amazing!
B00U3BPBPU|5|Love it!
B00M3SGE4S|1|To small
B00AUDXPKO|2|These were more plain than I thought they would be. Just not cute at all.
B00IUM8J94|5|Perfect work jacket. Could not have found better.  Plenty of pockets, warm and waterproof.
B004VBPO6E|5|I love these calories! They last forever, they hold their shape and they won't tear at the seams.
B00BBB6OXY|3|It was kind of hard to put on.
B002XULOGO|5|Great shorts. Very flexible and provide just enough coverage. Fit exactly as expected. They are not too tight and you are able to move in them.
B0041EOTLC|1|The sizes are way off. It should state that its petite. It is definitely deceiving and would cost the buyer money to return. I was very unhappy
B00BLXHVMU|5|Took me awhile to get this item but when I did it was a great buy :)
B00H1PIR70|4|Great price, nice and warm, very fast shipment
B000J3AWV0|5|Love it! Really glad I bought those panties. Good cotton quality and good size
B00HA4B706|3|very thin material but a nice look.
B000EN0VE8|5|Found this for traveling. It is great and can expand across a bathroom or wherever you can find places to loop and attache the ends. Don't need clips to hang the clothes they are held by the braided rope. Traveling light because we can now wash and ride away.
B000GTFOYM|5|The cashmere lining keeps your hands toasty warm while the lambskin outer lets you firmly grip the steering wheel. The size was true and fit perfectly. The price couldn't be beaten.
B00EPX3IYS|4|Runs a size small, I had to return to get size larger. But, GREAT product, excellent price!!!  Nice leather belt. Can't beat the price!
B006VXXV10|4|Great for smaller rainboots or other boots but not for hunters and not for boots that will allow them to sag down.
B001NYVG7I|5|I love this boots have had 4 pairs in the last 6yrs and would not want to no have THEM,,,, JUST LOVE THEM,,, Great Riding Boot and to Dress Up In ALSO.......... 10 stars,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, &#60;y)
B0095UYRFU|3|these are not the most high quality pajamas i have ever met, they're just okay. but, the seller was very reasonable and helpful, so i feel bad about not loving the pjs.
B00ITLHWHG|5|Love it!!!
B002LIU0J0|5|These flexees are great to wear with slacks and there was no chafing. I will order more when needed
B009I0M9Q6|5|I like it but run little small
B002D0WK80|5|No other thong underwear will do.
B0002TOSYS|5|These are hard to find in most stores and I was glad to be able to purchase them on line.
B00B1EVGCK|5|It's a cool lookin' shirt and it came in the mail on time, I would buy an updated version from here.
B003HC92LQ|5|Nice and warm.
B0002TOZ00|5|These are the only socks I wear and have been for years.
B012FH49NY|1|This art is stolen from an artist by the name of NoFlutter.
B00KB96SCE|5|These were awesome!!
B00F0C9ETG|5|an excellent product, exactly what is offered, excellent delivery times.
B0093JFWGQ|5|Pretty cool wallet! cheap and a great conversation starter. And I have actually used the measuring tape on it more than you would think! Cards and stuff don't seem to stay that well put in it however but it forces me to get rid of useless junk cards that would just otherwise hang out in my wallet.
B007GAXZX6|5|Great fitting workout wear is essential.  This shirt is slightly over-sized (order your regular size) and allows freedom of movement when active.  I wear this shirt when I weight train and find it to be THE MOST COMFORTABLE of all of my workout wear.  I also bought the matching shorts 'cuz I gotta look good when I sweat.
B00J31FC00|5|Little bit lighter in color then what the picture displays but overall great shirt.
B005H261HW|4|Fits as expected, very nice quality, washed it several time and the decal hasn't messed up as of yet. It is soft and nice and I would most definitely re-order.
B00FTV3PTS|2|Was not proportion well.....
B00EC851ZA|2|They were more of a slim fit
B008KGS9WW|5|looks great on my hubby!! he has this shirt in two other colors..it washes and wears great!!
B00006TW8E|5|tHIS COAT IS NOT ONLY VERSITILE, IT OFFERS THE WARMTH NEEDED FOR THOSE NORTHERN COLD TEMPS.
B004Q78G4U|4|I love the suit the color is awesome just ran a little smaller than expected.
B00J5XJIOC|5|Great
B00IEWU6SC|5|Very cute
B00D1I6EIA|3|For the price point, don't expect quality. This is one of those pieces that you can get at street stalls. It feels kind of fragile. Also it gets abit uncomfortable when the weather is hot and humid.
B003IJ1SSI|3|It is darker than the picture and I didn't like it as much but the mommy to be who I bought it for liked it so that was all mattered.
B00FIYSV9A|2|Didn't really firm or smooth & you can totally see it through my thin dresses. It also made my boobs look really weird.
B00AKRKQ5C|1|The mask came in just a paper envelope and was broken right down the middle.  It is hard to glue plastic together.  This mask should have been shipped in a box.  I was not able to use the mask because it was so badly damaged.
B00J9VZ7WM|4|These shirts are awsome never bought here on amazon i purchase at local store, but i love these shirts i buy a couple every few weeks , Due to i like wearing fresh white tees!<br /><br />Pros:: Fresh look and feel, durability<br /><br />Cons: shirts sometimes feel smaller/bigger even when you buy them the same size, (may just be my provider)
B00EOAVBUU|3|dress is even prettier in person. sexy, but appropriate for work function, too.  the 6 is a little small for me but an 8 would be humongous. sadly, it will go back.
B00L18OPOW|5|This one was ok - not too small like the green one, same brand and size.
B001OJGIGG|5|I JUST LOVE THIS MORRISSEY CASE WALLET! I COULDNT BELIEVE \\"SUCHCOOLSTUFF\\" HAD THIS...PERFECT FOR MOZ-FANS! GREAT DEAL AS WELL \\"VIVA MOZ\\"  -THANX, SUCHCOOLSTUFF :)
B0059DWL9Q|5|I did lots of research trying to find the best rain jacket. Finally settled on this one and I sent it with my son to Mexico.  I just received this email from him and thought I'd share his glowing review....<br />&#34;Like straight up, this place is gorgeous.  And now we have hit rain season, so it rains every night from like 5 till 12.  And I mean RAIN.  It comes down hard over here. But, I'm going to endorse Columbia right now; the jacket I have is amazing.  It rolls up nice and tight but the water never soaks into the coat, I'm always nice and warm. It's been nice. hahah&#34;
B009Z42LPO|3|The material is thin. The graphic is true to the picture. The color is true to the presented photo.  It is 34&#34; in the chest. At the time it was ordered, there was not a size describtion.
B009D507K6|5|Fit perfectly and wash well.  I received the wrong pair the first time around and had to reorder.  Amazon was great in handling it and I love my new yoga pants!
B00R24PBEM|3|I got a small and the top is way to small and the skirt fits perfect. I'm super bummed because I love this outfit and now I can't wear it
B008CPUM7Q|5|Very nice wallet. I like the money clip on the outside, it is very handy. Hopefully, it will wear as well as my previous one that is 10 years old.
B00YB4EU34|5|I love it.Have been looking for a Tie Dyed shirt for awhile and my grand kids like it also.
B000QWA2L4|2|Material seemed too flimsy compared to Ann Cherry's Latex Sports Girdle. But...I have seen youtube videos were it has worked well for some young ladies who have not yet had children and have low BMIs. Find what works for you, and be consistent. Good luck! (I returned this product the same day I received it.)
B00DMC8KQY|4|I'm 5'11 133lbs and normally wear size 6 or sometimes 4. I got this jacket in size 6 and it was too small in the shoulders and sleeves were way too short. I exchanged it for size 8 and it's too big. Sleeves in size 8 are still too short yet its quite big in the chest area. I unfortunately had to return as sad as i was, too bad they don't make it in size 7!
B00JOBDQOI|3|I can accept the size around chest and waist, which is I expected. Bu it is very tight around arm, leave not much room to move you arms around.
B002OKNRE0|5|This is a great product, well done, sturdy and the colors are great too. Just love this!!!!
B00MW6FU82|4|Look exactly like it did in the picture was a hit with the bride
B00DK3H68S|4|Love it..very pretty
B00ISI3VCA|1|Don't even! This material is cheap and overall this a hot mess of a swimsuit. I gave the bottoms to my little sister and threw away the top
B00FFAHD3W|5|I bought a size too big because it was the smallest size left and it was only 11 dollars! Really pretty and can't wait for her to fit into it.
B0027NH948|5|Got it for my husband love it!!!! It came right on time and looks just like the picture! If your an anime fan you will love the shirt not only that it has the rouge shinobi label on the back of the shirt!
B008QWPJ6Y|1|OMG!<br />The material was junk,heavy,full of wrinkle and very cheap.It had no shape at all. returned it.  :(
B00O8XPZJ6|2|not impressed
B00GX0RD9C|5|I love all the soild colors, this way you can match them better with colorfull outfits.<br />These are ment for newborns.<br />They stay on very well (because they are small).<br />I think these are needed for new moms and dads
B00MUZON7Y|5|It is so cute on! My daughter loves it.
B00ENO5URM|1|I ordered black but they sent grey, it looks like old lady hair. Not liking it :( but i guess it looks like a spider
B001T8QH6I|3|none
B008HA0T9M|5|I bought these about a year ago.  I keep them tucked just far enough for perfect effect under a Queen Anne style formal chair in my living room all year long! They are just an unexpected bit of whimsy that brings a smile to all my family and friends of any age!  Makes me smile after a long day at work too :-)
B007SLC7FU|4|Very pretty lace. Simply made. Small closure in the back that may not hold up very well. Good for the price though.
B00E6QIJSE|5|such a beautiful shirt, fits perfectly fabric very nice it's so unique, Very happy with this purchase, thks
B00IRFKM76|5|Classic! I wear it on a black dress. So many compliments. Wearing leopard shoes helps make a perfect outfit
B00UJ96IS0|5|I ordered this for my daughter she loves it!
B003XKO7Y4|3|It's hard to find jeans in a plus size and have the length for a tall person.  These had the length; however, the color is not what I wanted.  The color is too striated and not a natural denim.  Wish the color was a darker blue.
B00HIK9CL8|5|beautiful
B007IJQ4DS|2|Too short I like how high it is in front but hoped it would be longer!
B00DENDOFS|4|Very nice dress for the price. Fit as expected, the waist was a little big, however there is a sash in the back that allows it to become more fitted.
B00551MVXI|4|Yay!<br />Great thick absorbent towel for kids- bath time in winter and out of pool. True to size and color.
B00CB3DXOY|5|I got it for my son. He loves it because it just sums up his thoughts on the whole matter. Makes a great present.
B00K5QAQN0|5|I bought this as a sort of rain coat for summer florida stormy days to wear with my red rain boots and it makes for a very fashionable outfit even on the rainiest days!
B00RD5S1P6|5|I love this jacket! It is elegant but sporty. Nice color, great cut and finish.. This jacket has a detachable hood and is water and wind resistant. I highly recommend it !
B00UB13IMK|2|This runs extremely small.  I ordered both my usual size and one size up since I occasionally wear it.  I couldn't even get my usual size over my head.  I could get one size up over my head and on, but that was about it. Not even close to an appropriate fit. Both will be going back.
B002AQ4BTI|3|Jesus Christ !  The height and width of this pant is ok , but the with of the legs... my god !  It make me seems a really fat guy in the legs !  And by the way the &#34;blue navy&#34; is a little bit shinny and thant's no the photo. Buy something more expensive if you find !
B00862DP6A|5|ESXELLENT
B00LERZBF2|5|Muy buen producto.
B004FEEZ80|5|I had the hardest time finding a sunhat for my daughter!  I had ordered her a size 12-24 mon in a similar Carters one and it was too small!  She is 12 months old and I guess has a average to large head...I ordered a XL in this and it fits perfectly!
B000SBKAKG|5|This tie was used by my Granddaughter, as part of a costume.  She is satisfied with it.  As she doesn't wear a tie, her brother put the knot in for her.  It is a nice tie.  Really too nice for how she is wearing it.
B00JKAGH80|5|this t -shirt fits perfect.
B0026NZ81K|5|Solid construction with clear, bright lettering. The medals are colorful and accurate.  The velcro adjusting strap in the back is much better than the plastic ones with holes.  I have received many positive comments from other Vietnam veterans.
B00KZD9UIK|5|I bought this as a Birthday gift for my nice and she loved it!  Fit perfectly!
B00LOU4J4S|5|very good
B00A3YOETG|1|This listing says one size fits most - In what world does a 31.5\\" (including buckle so no room to latch it) belt (which is between an XS and a S) fit MOST???<br />Too bad - they are cute, but unless yo have a tween body, they will be WAY TOO SMALL.
B00B25PFK2|1|Couldn't wait to wear the shirt for season III premier! The shirt size ordered was a ladies 2XL (18).  Don't believe it ... it's a ladies medium/large AT BEST.  My shirt sizes are 1XL & 2XL because i'm a buxom belle ... It's a beautiful color & the design is brilliant ... Gildan makes the shirt; I compared its ladies large tshirt to this ladies 2XL ... the large was BIGGER! ... SO disappointed ...
B00KQHJ2ME|5|Was given as a Christmas gift. My granddaughter looked so precious in it!
B00MYGHCWW|2|👍 I love the dress but I'm a small and I order a medium and it still couldn't fit and it was so tight on me, so that means I needed a large. 😩😩😩
B000VK3TKW|5|As a busty gal, sports bras are a problem for me. I hate smoosh uniboob. This is a great bra that holds the girls steady, even during the toughest bootcamp workout
B00ACIG09K|5|No Problems
B008Q0E5HK|4|Thin is ok but wish they were wider.
B00BGOO7DA|3|The onsie fit true to size. The socks were tiny. The straps on the coveralls were too long. I bought it as a Christmas gift even though it was overpriced. She wore it once. I would suggest buying 3 Carter outfits instead.
B007BYEF9K|5|My son loves this set. Looks exactly like the ones in Minecraft, both items are sturdy and will hold up to hours of play. Would happily purchase again.
B00A7L8ZKE|5|Just to be clear, these stays are not magnetized...but they do work well with the small neodymium magnets you can buy elsewhere on Amazon (which makes sense.).  24 is probably more than I'll ever need but the price is right.  The stays themselves seem to be high quality.  No sharp edges that I could feel.
B009DJCIFE|5|I love these sport bras !! Their so comfy and fit to my liking. I would highly recommend this set to any one .
B00ARYMWP0|2|This isn't the quality I was expecting, the skirt is like a stiff, thin dishtowel. Such a pretty print, but on such bad fabric. The fit was a little off too, doesn't really seem like the piece is completely convinced it is a maternity dress (the cut for the belly is very narrow.)
B009SDU20S|2|Needed a lot of shaping and multiple stones had fallen off by the time it delivered
B0097AVVBQ|5|Very nice and good quality and good price. Just what I was looking for. I'm going to order next for my daughter.
B000P5AYDI|4|A little too expensive for the quality but it was ok because my son loved it and he looks so darn cut in it.
B00MCH7FQ6|1|This belt sucks it arrive soon but when I saw that it didn't have anything to hold the belt from the back I was really disappointed. How am I suppose to wear the belt without anything to hold its self????
B005P0QTDC|2|I received this bowtie in the mail today, but was very disappointed to see that it is a clip-on and not a regular bowtie. Given that there is nothing in the product's description that states that it is a clip-on, I assumed that it was regular bowtie as it would seem to make sense that the default type of tie would be a regular, not a clip-on, tie. I am debating returning this as I personally dislike clip-ons, but I have to decide whether it is worth the trouble as I would have to spend about an hour at least getting to and waiting at the post office to do so. I wanted to write this review, so that any future customers wiould have a better idea of what they are purchasing as the fact that it is a clip-on tie may not be a negative, but they should at least get the chance to know before purchasing it.
B002GHNTPS|5|Very good support........
B006B3T87G|5|Fast! Thank you!!
B00JG3R0G4|5|This is an extremely comfortable, well fitting, very nice looking dress that I feel comfortable in at home or out. It doesn't wrinkle, washes easy in a delicate cycle with cold water and dries on low, delicate heat. The price was amazing for what I got. I couldn't be happier.  I have a small crocheted top that  wear on a cooler day, and it's perfect.  I can wear it all year long.  I like it so much I have it now in four different colors and patterns.
B00J98II12|2|I just received these the other day, they run very small. I had to give mine to my sister. So cute!! But so little 😕
B00NFV2TQY|4|I personally like the idea of the pants, they are very tight yet stretchy so I suggest going a size up, and well you get what is displayed on the photos so no false advertisement here . overall good product, fast to moderate shipping and goes great with almost anything .
B00JVXYNDC|5|perfect
B00BQ95V26|5|Great belt super innovative!
B00JQASUCK|1|Incredibly long sleeves with narrow arm holes and very tight across chest and abdomen even for a XXL size. Not happy with it at all.
B00GHHBUQI|4|style & quality as expected, but width bit wider, will pay attention to this brand, but only will but XX small item
B00FHRYX4U|4|This jacket was an impulse buy, since it was offered at an insanely low price (and had an additional discount) on Amazon Prime Day! The price was so amazing, I couldn't resist grabbing this fleece.<br /><br />It is a really pretty color and the fit is perfect, but the material is slightly strange - it has a strange texture and isn't as soft to the touch as any of our other (name brand) fleeces. For the price, I am not complaining but if this will be your primary fall/spring jacket, you should try to touch it in person (or be sure it is part of Amazon's free return program when you choose your seller) as you may not love the texture either.<br /><br />I will wear this occasionally but it will not be the go-to jacket I had hoped for. Perhaps it will soften up after a wash - I will update my review if it does!
B0046MFRDI|5|Really nice
B00LKZABN0|4|I prefer a larger fit and wider brim.  I am satisfied with this color and different look on me.
B00HCN9Q62|5|Great bra
B00GUDLDQG|5|Very affordable and just my size.  Exactly what was expected and very quick service.  I will be ordering a couple more.
B00UNOMCIQ|5|My daughter loves this suit. Adorable.
B005N4HZ6U|4|I bought this top to wear on an international flight - so I wouldn't arrive looking all frazzled and wrinkled - this shirt is the perfect weight for travel - it actually looks a lot nicer than in the picture.
B002JIO2KK|5|Was very happy with this item, glad i purchased it
B0006HEIPA|2|This product may not run, but it is not a support hose.  If you need for health issues, don't waste money.
B00BQ95OX2|5|I HAVE 2 OF THESE BELTS HAD NO PROBLEMS , IF YOU USE IT TO HOLD YOUR PANTS UP IT WORKS GREAT.<br />I AM GOING TO BUY 2 MORE
B00K1QUI5K|5|very good quality merchandise...I like them very much
B001L9Y6EA|4|Great product
B00UIBXF76|4|It was a gift for my Grandson. I was disappointed that there were no children's sizes. Both of my grandsons play Dragonvale and are into dragons. The Small Men's is a little large for him. He loves the shirt and was very excited to receive it.
B00OHV83DY|3|I'm a tall and slim guy (6 foot 3 and 150 pounds) I ordered this sweater because I wanted to add more color to my wardrobe. when it came it, it fit pretty DECENT but it wasn't close to perfect to be honest in my opinion (the picture is of me wearing it) The chest/core part is a little too loose. which i wouldn't mind if the sleeves were long enough and not so snug, but they aren't too snug. Over all, it's an excellent sweater with a beautiful color. I ORDERED A SIZE SMALL because i wanted it to fit me tight but the only tight part on it is the sleeves, but they aren't too tight. If you're a taller guy who's 6 foot 3 or 6 foot 2, i'd recommend ordering a medium or even a large if you're really tall.  but if you're an average hieght guy who's 5 foot 7 to 5 foot 9, then this sweater would be perfect for you.
B00DL51SZC|5|love it
B00E7NZQK0|2|Nice shirt somewhat small. Thought the material would be more stretchy. Not bad for the price.
B004SZW0HY|3|I should have ordered a little smaller. No silk feel, more like soft cotton
B00CQ89I70|5|Fits as expected. Nice shirt.
B00EJXAI24|4|Perfect fit for size 14, I love it
B001VGN2TI|1|the gloves has a hole along the stitching in one finger, another finger was unusually long, and there were loose threads all around.  Extremely poor quality - I would have expected this from an item in the dollar bin at a discount store but not for an $11 item.  Amazon was very helpful with returning the item.
B00KGWSFQ8|5|I love this brand of Jammie's! The fabric is thick and soft and feels wonderful in the winter months. They wash well and fit very comfortably. I have 3 pairs and already want more!
B00M1GM09U|4|Okay
B0074T7U1M|5|Very comfortable and yet can be used to dress up a bit. I love the way it looks and how it fits. Best shirt I've bought.
B00BLUKFSK|2|Boxer briefs fit as expected and wash well. The shirt shrunk in the first wash and didn't fit my 3 year old after first wash.
B006OTY4DA|5|They were as promised.  My granddaughter loved them!  She can text with them on even though she's only 6.  Thanks.
B00BBT7VGA|4|This is a nice casual dress; the fit is easy and is very comfortable; but it was slightly too big for me but I had it altered and it fits. I ordered a medium as I generally am a medium but it runs slightly larger. I do like it and am happy with it
B00IGOG8NU|5|Not stretchy at all but fit perfectly. Love it!!
B00MOQMJNO|5|Fits perfect great quality and fast shipping
B006LRPBUU|5|We bought this for my daughter for winter, and it's been fabulous so far. She's a little on the small side, so even at six months this is nice and roomy. She seems very comfortable in it, and it keeps her nice and warm (provided, of course, she's dressed in layers underneath). She also loves the fact that she is transformed into a stuffed animal and enjoys sucking on her &#34;paws.&#34; I usually have her in it when I'm wearing her in the Ergo, and it seems great for that--not too bulky or anything. Just very snuggly.
B008J7B0J6|5|Bought this for my daughter's summer camp play (Grease).  Everyone loved it.  Can't wait until Halloween, so she can wear it again.
B00JXZ5HP6|5|love the color-- fit is great
B00ZHZQ3YU|5|Looks and fits great. Gonna get another
B0088EYPEC|5|Good looking and features as advertised
B00960SY8K|4|Very fast shipping. Dress strap came off during the first wear. Easy fix, but I figured it would hold up a little longer :(
B00RW286B4|5|No other Ram hats like it around!
B00E4WZCDU|5|i bought these for my father who is blind and going to stores sort of challenging Perfect size and color he loves them
B00N2OGJ8I|5|My 22 month baby is growing too fast, she already fits size 24 months. So I needed to get her a bigger size to grow into.
B00AQIX6Z2|5|It was a little nicer than I was expecting.  Has a slight sheen to the coat.  All in all this was a great deal!
B009NIJ51K|5|I purchased this sweater vest on Amazon. It came on time and packaged perfectly. I was looking for something to wear under my suits, along with a tie and dress shirt. The material is very sturdy and the fit is just right. At 6ft 3in, and 200lbs, 44 long suit, I ordered an X-large, no issues with the fit. I have no complaints with the product or shipping. Fits to size and looks great. I hope this helps.
B00D6CAN6K|4|The sweater dress part is super cute, the rest of outfit is fine, but just a little cheaper quality than the sweater dress. Overall, my little girl looked adorable and got ton of compliments over the holidays.
B007CCXEUC|5|A process very good, i am satisfied with the purchase. The product it´s in good state and totally new, thak you
B00KY3EUU4|5|Love it, love it, love it best thing I received in a while.
B003M1J3KC|5|For an all in one costume this is really very nice.  The design on the fabric edges is a nice touch and for the money this was a big hit.  Fit my 6 foot tall, large man, hubby perfectly so we were just thrilled with it.
B0078IRSJ8|5|Comfortable!
B00HTX6O9M|3|Baggier in the legs than expected, especially consider the model for these shorts has skinnier legs than i do.  If i could describe the fit in two words-- &#34;mom shorts&#34;.
B002DMTHEI|4|Great look, just a little tight and short
B000WAWH68|5|Great gift
B00GKUY078|5|It's super cute and very soft!!! I love this material! It's very comfortable to sleep in!!! It's a little bit stretchy and loose.  I love it!!!
B00258293Q|5|This is a good quality patch. It is embroidered well. It came with detailed instructions to iron it to clothing.<br />I glued it to a backpack. It is not holding as well as if I would have ironed it.<br />I recommend this patch.
B00IYT14MC|3|completely see through!
B0002TOZ1O|5|Bought as a gift for a brother who will wear ONLY Gold Toe socks - that's how comfortable they are.
B003IH3H8E|1|Horrible horrible wig. My poor sister almost had to look more like George Washington on stage. I had to wash and recurl and basically create a new wig out of this piece of crap before she would consider wearing it. Waste of money.
B00M59MUIO|4|This is a good sweater vest. The material is nice and thick, and it seems pretty good quality.
B007UUB9NA|5|Very please with this purchase.  They fit as expected.
B005I33PUQ|5|He loved them so much, he refuses to wear them to work.
B000GL1ESK|4|It was a bit long on me, so I need to have it shortened; also popped a button, because I need to lose weight. Not comfortable in a hot nightclub, but looks really cool!
B00A14K0LY|5|Cool!
B0006I5AII|5|Very Satisfied
B000KADELM|1|This bathrobe was not at all like it said in the reviewl As soon as I opened the bag it ws in and touched it, I knew it was going back. Sorry! I returned it.
B002ZTK5LI|5|My daughter has raynaud's disease and needs to keep her feet warm in the winter.  She says that these are nice and warm and has been wearing them since they arrived.   Buying more today!
B003EEMBEC|5|This fit my 2 almost 3 year old daughter perfectly with a little room to grow. I LOVE the button snaps they have on the neck they work great. The material was very comfortable. Can't wait for her to wear it when going to the hospital for new baby brother.
B0000ANDUV|4|Short husband and they inseam is 30&#34;  Needs 29&#34;. Can't find them that size... so.....
B00QY2VW9G|2|I was expecting something more fitted with sturdier material.By a size or even two smaller.
B0007OW87C|5|These shorts are awesome...Fit like they are suppose to...wish they had more colors though
B00FHFTM84|1|Wayyyyy bigger than expected
B000H1XYSC|3|THERE IS NO WIG.  This was not obvious to me when I purchased, I felt misled; however, I was going thru in a rush to order so I may have overlooked it.  The glasses, earrings, and necklace are cool.  I was pleased with them, they functioned properly and for the money they held up well.  Kinda bummed there was no wig, that is really what I was needing.
B007OX93O0|5|My son really enjoys theswe pants. He wears them alot and they fite real good. We are happy with this purchase.
B0099OPOFY|5|Loved my jumpsuit!  I was a bit worried the fabric would not be nice or the fit wouldn't be right , but it was perfect! I would recommend this to everyone!
B0019RRZS8|5|My husband is a trucker, and quite often goes where the cold weather is.  It isn't always convenient for him to dress for cold weather, as he's usually in the warmer climate areas.  I bought this for him to have on hand for those times when he unexpectedly goes north, and he's extremely  happy with the warmth it provides without the bulkiness like some of the other shirts he has.
B0007VDN1K|5|Great fit and made really well. I am pleased.
B00L36DVQU|5|Nice weight-good fit. Doesn't itch!
B003K7FECO|5|Really lovely, flattering fit. I really like wearing this tucked in with a skirt. If you are worried about it being too short, go a size up.
B007KH53CG|5|Good morning friends my stuff please do not get me what I need never send to the address VLN6875 ADELSO MONTES<br />2250 NW 114TH AVE UNIT 1V<br />MIAMI, FLORIDA 33172-3652<br />United States<br />Phone: 7869724911 is my personal locker or I make a gift card to buy it again and please i need your help thanks greetings from Venezuela that is my size so just do not know where to communicate with you why I write for this via
B00PL95RYE|5|great fit!
B00G35CHNO|3|I LOVED this sweater. It's made well and it's warm. Just lovely. It is exactly what I wanted but it's sized for Jrs. I always wear a size L (10/12) and the large couldn't be zipped. Thus I had to give it 3 vs. 5 stars. No XL available.
B00AOJHSUW|5|Never can tell if I'm going to need a double or single X the material is excellent, but the cut is slender so I should have gone DOS XX, maybe I'll shrink.
B0061IWUWQ|4|I bought this for a birthday present for my grandson's 10th birthday.  He really likes it and the color is great.  I bought a large and it fits fine . My only criticism is that it would be nice if there were a bit more material to allow for more wrap- around in the front.
B00BCSJWEY|5|I have wanted this shirt for a year and finally got it. It was exactly what I wanted and fits perfectly! They shipped it right away so that definitely got me even more excited about it! Great experience!
B00KERM8Z4|5|Just a bit too big, but nobody will notice but me.  High quality.
B00JX9IG32|4|My daughter is happy with it - thanks!
B006KFWPNO|5|Fast delivery, each headband is really cute and unique. They fit my three month old baby girl perfectly. Really happy with the purchase :)
B00882R55A|5|very cute
B002T4OPRE|1|I've only worn these gloves four times, and they're already falling apart. Specifically, the mitten part on the right-hand glove is unraveling, and flapping away from the rest of the glove. I've contacted the company for a refund - we'll see what they offer.
B00HQBIYY0|3|While this outfit was very cute, and comfortable, its fit was somewhat small, so there was a limited use of the outfit.
B007N5YAPQ|5|the fit as expected. love the colors.
B00K77KOM0|5|As expected.
B001AJU41K|5|My nephew loved the wool hat and was very pleased with the Indiana Jones look.  He wears it as a favorite head gear.
B00GYSFL8S|1|I was not aware of the size difference
B007V1QP3C|4|Weather hasn't been real cooperative here. But love my tan thru suit😊
B00FZVKLBW|5|Birch Box sent me a sample of these, and I loved the fit and comfort so much I purchased more from amazon.  Just a couple of things....  First these are as shown in the photo, sans front (or rear) opening.  So a man has to do what a man has to do when in the loo: adapt and improvise. And then there's the size thing.  I've always considered my 38&#34; waist, &#34;medium,&#34;  But Bread and Boxers says I'm a large, and that proved to be just right for me. You know, the comfort is just superb, offering support where needed without restriction. All my other skivvies fit well when first put on, then seemingly enlarge  at least half size through the day, so that they are hanging off me by day's end.  The Bread and Boxers don't do this.  And I guess, I should add that I've washed mine several times with neither shrinkage nor fading. . They are pricey, but certainly well worth the cost.  I'm investing in more of these things.
B00CVZOJ40|3|Goggles have a good look, but cheap materials are used. The magnifier glasses fell off after an hour without banging into anything. Good overall, but the materials and build quality are not great.
B005CPT57W|5|I use this robe daily. It is very soft, and it looks nice with fuzzy slippers. Very practical for cold days. Thanks!
B00I2Y8GSY|5|Really nice pair of pants however they do run a little big. For example 36x30 is my size so 34x30 fit perfect, they are also a bit itchy and hot even after 3 washes.
B00NX8OWEG|4|Satisfied with this purchase!<br />Pros:<br />- Very warm, tested during Russian winter with temperatures below 5F<br />- They are nice to the body - the lining is somewhat furry<br />- High waist is actually quite convenient because it also keeps your belly warm<br />- They are thin enough to be worn under skinny pants/jeans<br />Cons:<br />- As you can see from the picture, they do have seams on the inside of the legs, and these are visible. It didn't stop me from wearing them as a leggings (I bought tan color), but for some it might be a show stopper<br />- The leg length was a bit short for me and they tend to roll up under jeans, unless I tuck them into socks
B00CNKPKB4|5|My daughter loves moons and stars pajamas!!
B00BDOO7GU|3|My significant other doesn't like the way they hang. Says they look &#34;baggy&#34;, she's the expert here. Prefers the Haggar cotton version.
B003VZF826|5|These are excellent underware and I would recommend this vendor to my friends and family.  I received this shipment in the time specified.
B00COEOWFY|5|These are adorable! I would buy more of these for my girls to wear under dresses because shorts are too bulky and these are so sweet!
B002SOZ36M|4|When I order this they only offered the small size so I took a chance that it would fit and it was too small when it arrived late for the event I needed it for. The Seller was nice to call to me to order thru them directly but it was too late.<br />I hope to order this again in my size and in the purple that I wanted not the pink however.......... this costume is well made and very nice and would have been perfect and a show stopper for sure.
B006MXVXO6|3|bottom part or seem, in the back of swim suit stretch's out first time worn...but looks good..may have to have a tailor fix it...wear underwear under suit.
B00L4XRMJ4|5|I love it
B000BJDPM0|4|My husband is pleased with this wallet. It is small and slim enough, not for the back pocket though. I'd rate it 5 stars if it had a button to keep it closed. Overall very nice, I'd buy it again.
B009043CU2|5|good fit, quality good, price was right
B008H802O6|3|The quality of the replica nun attire was excellent. Unfortunately, not large enough for a heavyset woman. Will be returning it sadly.
B00RKTJB54|4|I like. Roomy, good quality, does not slip off my shoulder, very comfortable.  It is as i expected except i would of rather had fringe on both sides.
B00SRLFAAE|4|wish it was made in usa
B00FARFB2K|4|I order 'Teal' as on the picture, it came dark teal, nothing like on the shown image.
B00J39DWQ8|4|The jacket came early and I really enjoy the jacket.
B001L4CXFY|1|Definetly not work gloves.  I used them for 2 weekends with what I would consider light work and they already tore through 1 finger.
B0018OMIMK|1|The pockets are smaller.  I cannot fit my cell phone into my pants anymore!  The pockets are over 1 inch shorter and the prices are higher!  Time to check out Wrangler.
B003IHJ1QG|4|A much better quality than expected at their level of affordability. The &#34;fit&#34; was as reliable as your favorite brand of shoe or blue jeans. Comfortable and easy to care for.
B001AETK4M|4|Very good quality but just a little too small
B00I9VVAM4|5|nice
B003V3CHAY|2|Came to me with stitching undone... Had to re stitch myself as I needed it for work the same day.
B004MC9DJ6|5|Great shirt but runs just a tad small.  Just order a size bigger and you should be fine.
B00N2KH7JM|5|As long as you read the sizing info carefully, its wonderful. Colors are even brighter in person
B00KKCEAT0|4|wish i had bought this a size up as if i should gain three pounds it wouldn't fit anymore but otherwise i love it. The material is really nice and it fits my body type
B003LV02G2|5|I've no complaints!  The swim pants fit great and work great.  I'm so glad to not have to buy the disposable swim pants anymore.  I've never tried any other kind, so I don't have any comparisons to make, but I'm glad I don't need to - I found just the right product the first time around!
B0013U9STA|5|love them, they look cute
B00FH7LGEA|2|They look nice but they are falling apart. Just wore them a few times. Any way we can exchange them?
B00CDIEQXO|5|I wear these frickin things all. the. time.  I bought them to go running, but when I put them on, I was like 'forget that', I got bigger plans for these... It's too cold to go running anyway, and running is not near as fun as:  wearing them to bed, around the house with my slippers, watching Netflix marathons of some stupid series about vampires and werewolves that I know sucks but just can't help myself about seeing what happens next, greeting my baby drunk when she gets back from work.  They go well with that oversized t-shirt I keep telling myself to throw away and ultimately reminds me of why I hate running in the first place.<br /><br />Get yourself a pair... I know I did.
B00OFHM9NA|3|Slip is too short and dress is see thru sleeves are short too. Color isnt as it seems either. I ordered peach and its more salmon colored. Im 5'3 120 lbs got a med. and its a little hard to get in & of.
B00KTTTIT6|1|I'm so disappointed with this item. Doesn't look anything like the picture. Messy cutting at the back. Bought this item for my vacation and couldn't take it with me.
B00KU06CXO|5|Makes a very loud sound. Your roommates will know what's up. You may even be on the receiving end of some high fives in the early AM .
B005QR7KYG|5|I love this belt.  It arrived fast and just as described.  The price was very good too!  I've shopped around my local dept. stores and didn't find any for such a bargain.
B00KRYLKH6|5|Fit perfectly on me. Super soft and just what I hoped for. I am 5'9&#34; and 148 pounds with a long torso and a medium was a perfect fit for me.
B0017QHIWO|5|i buyed this for me and i love it ..when i wear it to party everybody was asking me where i got it from .which was good :)
B00OX5OJY6|5|If you like New York, if you like cats, if you like sweatshirts, what more could you want?  All silliness aside, she loves it.  This is a JUNIOR sized shirt so make sure you look at the size chart.  I made that mistake first go around and had to send it back for different size.  However, Amazon as usual was awesome.<br /><br />We got the red, and its a nice color, accurate to what you see in the picture.  Sometimes you see something online and you get it and the colors are not even close.  Not in this case.  The seller did a great job of photographing and selecting photos that are accurate in color and detail.  Basically you see what you get.<br /><br />Its good quality, it fits to the chart (and fits good once you get the right size, lol) and she loves it.  5 stars--no questions.
B010NAIHPG|5|ANGEL SECRET Womens Very Sexy Thong Bikini Set  FOR REVIEW<br /><br />I got lucky! it fit my wife like it was made for her; and let me tell you did it ever look good on her. the bikini was built very well and it will out last the season and then some ,unless i cant control my dirty thoughts and intentions. seriously if you are here looking at this suite know this from a mans point of view, this is one sharp looking bikini, and i think it will compliment anyone that wears it. just a warning the top and the bottom ties and i could just about think then to untie (don't I wish) so be careful on how you tie. her bikini did stay where it was supposed to while playing with the kids in lake Michigan and on the beach. i wish you the best of luck and enjoy your bikini.
B00YMUG77Y|5|This swim suit is gorgeous. I am a big fan of leopard so when I seen this, I had to have it! In comparison this swimsuit looks like it's from Victoria secret. For less than $20 it is a steal. The colors are bright and the pattern is bold. The swim suit fits great. I reccomend paying close attention to the description. The sizes are in Asian fashion. If you order a few sizes up, you will be pleased. The company even suggests that you order larger. I can't wait to wear this to the pool again. I received this beautiful swimsuit in exchange for my honest review. But, I would order from them again and again.
B007Y4OC68|4|This belt, as are many on Amazon is poorly sized. In this case, I have a 35-36&#34; waist...ordered the 38&#34; belt, and it is HUGE! There are not enough holes to cinch it up adequately. Love the belt, but refuse to gain weight to wear it! B+
B00OPQ3BIS|5|its a great belt best i ever had !!!! i only wish mission can add a small magnet to the tip of the belt so the belt stays smooth all the way around other than that its great fits perfect every time open release mechanism very sturdy not cheap
B00NU8UDYC|1|A 2x is a medium at best.<br />Sucks sucks sucks
B00ACIGM9S|5|i love this product. i have used other brands and always wished i had not. hanes is the best for me.
B00DHH8BFE|4|feel with to much pad.  looks like a D cup, not like C
B005XZXZXG|5|Great jacket at a very reasonable price.
B00GPQS1CC|5|I really like the quality and finish details
B00NL03VS4|5|this is the best scarf ever! it's so warm and soft and cozy, and it goes with basically any outfit. you can also wrap it around your head to keep your ears warm. getting lots of compliments on this one.
B009FV9TRA|4|I bought 1 size bigger, but it was still a little small.
B009R7UGDS|5|These pants are very warm ,  so wear them in the winter.  They color is very nice and so is the fit
B0036FKA2Y|5|This is my first wallet ever and it's nice not to have to scrounge around my pockets for wads of cash all the time. I was surprised by just how tough this thing is; it won't tear even if you try to rip it in half (believe me, i tried). The design is pretty much the main reason i bought this wallet and it looks exactly as advertised. I'm confident it'll hold up for a long time.
B001A8ZATM|3|Fabric is too stiff even after several washes. I find that even with extra fabric softener and soft water these are still stiff.
B003Z6PP9W|5|I got two of these (the purple and the blue) for my brothers and the two of them loved the color and cut of the sweaters... Turned out to be a great Christmas gift for them!
B000UVHQ60|5|Fit all the expectations I had when I ordered it. Unfortunately the Santa suit I ordered to go with it arrived the day AFTER our party. . . .oh well, there's always next year.
B00851M400|5|great
B00E0QMQD4|4|They are a bit hard to get on but that was expected.
B00K5T7CFM|1|Cups are atrocious.  So pointy I felt like I had been warped back to 1955.  Who's shaped like that?  Sent this back as soon as I opened it.
B0014D8JDM|3|I believe that for the price I paid, this is a good value for most people.  However, I am very particular about the feel (thickness of the material and how it feels) of the garment.  I felt that the material used was too thin for my preference.  I returned the item without a problem.
B0043D1NYW|4|I didn't realize until I got it that it has no pockets! I wish i had know in advance! Other than that I love it!
B002UHPST4|3|Thank you!
B00330V7P6|4|These are a good quality and are very comfy, however they aren't snug enough to be worn alone. I wear 40DDD and I bought these in an XL. they work well with a bra on underneath but not so great by themselves. these are medium to low support for me. maybe if I bought them a size smaller they might work better. but overall its an okay sports bra.
B000YV9CD6|5|It makes a great suit for my Ghostbusters suit
B004F218OG|5|I am absolutely thrilled with this shirt! I LOVE it! It's made from high quality material and still looks new even after being worn numerous times!
B00FBD2G0I|5|Great value and husband says perfect fit!
B00EVC5LP2|4|Big on the length size good on waist but  the length size is big. The sizes never said anythin else but &#34;32&#34;
B00CYI0ZCO|4|I have worn these shorts several times since buying them and I have been overall quite pleased. They have a fairly comfortable waistband which is kind of hard to find in this type of short, the material feels good against the skin and they are very good at wicking sweat away from your skin keeping you dry and cool.<br />The only issues I can find are this, Don't buy them for the compression. They just don't have that much to give. When they are first washed and put on they are fairly tight, but after wearing them for several hours they tend to relax a fair amount. Not to the point of being baggy by any means, but enough that they no longer compress your muscles much at all. Finally they tend to creep up somewhat. Not really badly but they don't have any kind of gripper to hold them down so I find myself pulling them down from time to time. Overall I am happy as I bought them to wear as underwear when it is hot and none of these issues really take away from that use.
B00LCFPN40|1|Terrible quality.
B001OGPRCK|5|I am very impressed with this hat. At the price I wasn't expecting much, despite the other raving reviews for this and other New Era Derby Hats. It has  very stiff frame, with a nice dark brown wool exterior and silk lining inside. there is a leather(ish) band on the inside that rests against your head. I could see that becoming an issue if you sweat a lot as it got a bit damp while wearing it in the sun.    I did purchase this more as a costume hat for a steampunk outfit (it looks great with goggles), but could see myself using it for other purposes as well. The shipping price is a bit steep, but it does come very well packaged so I felt like the fee was well used.
B0096SBBBO|2|Although prompt & courteous, these socks do not fit an average size woman properly. The ribbon distorts & the socks do not come up to the knees. However, the socks are affordable, they cost more to ship than the price of the socks. And remember, you're not refunded on shipping. I paid $18.85 for four pair and was refunded $7.80. You do the math.
B004Y3F7Y8|5|Fast shipping when I was in desperate need of a pair of jeans for my grandson FAST! Thank you!! You can always trust the fit of Levis
B00CYAS4VG|4|I have another pair of Democracy Jeggings I got maybe 2 years ago, and I wear them so regularly I figured I should get another. This pair is a lot more like a traditional pair of jeans. It has a zipper and pockets, and a little less give in them than my other pair. They're also a much darker wash so they look pretty chic. I'm docking a star because they're not as comfy as my other Democracy Jeggings. Hopefully after a few washes they'll be more broken in and as much of a favorite as my other pair.
B006MQEZJI|5|My daughter loves this dress, and so do the rest of the family!
B000UXVAC4|1|I really wish I would have read the reviews before I purchased this costume. I purchased 2-4T for my 2 year old that wears size 3T and it is way to small. I am trying to follow directions on how to return it, but their website doesn't seem to work to get my return number. I hope this wasn't a waste of money and I'm stuck with the costume.
B00SJKNLJU|5|This Jacket fits perfect in length for body and arms.  The material is soft and light weight.  The front pockets are deep to carry your phone without worry of it falling out.  Overall, a very nice jacket for the cooler weather in spring and fall.  My new best find!
B009K4JQH0|5|We bought this for my wife for the Woodland Fairy costume for our anniversary party and it is SO sexy and feminine!  She was hot!
B00GWFU55M|5|Very nice
B00PBHFQXS|5|i LOVE ITTTT<br />thanks &#60;3
B004D3WMEW|5|For these items it is cheap and the material is good enough where no one will notice that it is cheap. Worth the buy.
B00GTCYFRC|5|We bought this with the matching surf shorts and the outfit looks really cute on my boy.  Items shipped promptly.
B00LL47HRI|5|Fits me nicely, not too tight like alot of other costumes.  It's a beautiful Mrs. Claus outfit; wearing it to Christmas Eve service, and will use it for Texas Renaissance Festival and Dickens on the Strand next year!
B004ZMRN72|1|Ladies, Dont buy this. I bought this and I am 5'5 and 140lbs. Not to skinny not to thick, I thought these would fit right. WRONG! The leggings stopped at my knee, which made the connecting fabric run all the way up my thigh and it didn't look right. The leggings are to short and don't go up the thigh like the model has it. Dont buy
B00HVAUQEM|5|this dress fits perfectly - not too much material in the back and chest area, hips and waist perfect. Cant wait to wear it.
B00880IOBG|5|I love to wear a down vest when possible in the Midwest.  This vest from Calvin Klein is so awesome...great color, great fit, handy pocket features on the inside.  The plum color & fur trimmed hood make this vest unique & can be worn casual, but also can make you feel very dressed up.  I am 5'8, and weigh 145 lbs.  I like to leave room for heavier sweaters, or a light jacket underneath, so I ordered a size Large & it is a perfect fit.  Well worth every penny & I am so glad that I found this great buy on Amazon!
B0051BZCWO|5|part of my halloween costume
