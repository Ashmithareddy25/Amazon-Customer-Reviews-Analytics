B008CE0TN4|5|Very strong and easy to use.
B00CJ0B6KC|1|we installed it. and when we pulled the electrical cord thru it. it cracked.
B00A14QM52|5|Great product!
B00SYVH7U8|5|Good
B001E1UZDQ|5|Works well so far, easy to install, easy to use.
B00076QA4C|4|The product works great and it was easy to install using the directions. It's easy to put up and easy to take down when not needed.
B004UTD0RW|2|While the screw holes line up, the overall license plate frame does not fully frame the plate.  So our white plate we have is showing around the outside of this black frame.  On a black car it looks bad.
B00XZ9ORUC|5|works great
B005HFYE1O|5|functions as advertised
B004940ZNK|5|worked perfectly
B0009H51V2|5|Perfect fit, good quality, and $10 cheaper than my local auto parts store for the exact same item.
B005JU5V6E|5|I will only purchase Bosch wipers for the rest of my life!  These are OUTSTANDING wipers, well worth the price.  You will not be disappointed! Installation is less than a minute per blade.  They stay put nicely, and function better than any blade I have ever used. I love how sturdy they look and feel. Just get them, you will not be disappointed.  Just make sure you pay attention to the size, Amazon will tell you on the item page if a specific size fits your vehicle (provided you have entered your vehicle information into your Amazon &#34;garage&#34; which is a feature I LOVE) and will tell you which side that item will fit (Front left or Front right or rear etc) so just keep an eye out for that if you need some guidance.  I really love these blades.  It is so important to have good wipers and I feel so confident and save with Bosch on the &#34;front lines&#34; of my car.  Well done Bosch!
B00CRR5L8U|5|on time and what i needed
B0090QER6S|5|Exact fit
B008JYXYNY|4|Does not work. More cheap Chinese crap.
B00TNOX9IY|5|As advertised.
B001HBXKPI|1|Very difficult to remove clips
B0006IX87S|5|Makes the water taste so fresh in our camper!!
B0048DQ9JQ|1|The configuration and size don't fit my 2015 Subaru Forester, not even close!!  I was really careful in choosing the cover specifically for my 2015 Subaru Forester when I placed the order.  I considered this a deceptive business practice .
B001OMVCIC|5|Vehicle: 2015 Ram Outdoorsman  Installation:  Easier than expected following advice from some other comments I'd read here. There is no need to remove wheels or inner fenders if you connect the air lines to the bags first. Constricting the bags with zip ties once deflated saves a lot of time and they slip into the coil springs fairly easy without the use of tools. Routing the lines was a breeze and I mounted the valve on the bumper next to the license plate for easy access.  Usage:  I inflate them to the recommended 35psi before attaching our 30 foot travel trailer. The unit weighs about 8000lbs when loaded and caused the truck to squat considerably before installing this kit. Now it sits close to level when loaded and feels much more stable with a combination of a weight distribution kit and the air bags.  I just deflate to about 7lbs when not towing and don't really see a noticeable difference in ride quality  Overall: I am very pleased with this purchase. The bags themselves seem very durable although some of the fittings could be a bit beefier but I haven't had any issues yet. After seeing the difference this kit makes I'd recommend them to anyone who tows/hauls with a rear coil suspension.
B00IS93TI0|4|I love the bumper and it was easy to install.  The only problem I am having is a couple of the LED lights are getting moisture in them.
B0002RNSKK|5|Adapter is for constant use for a light up hitch cover. Has worked flawlessly since purchase.
B00TJA9YIG|5|I love these covers they match my silver xterra great
B00T4TEWBQ|5|Really nice.  Durable, removable liner, so easy to clean and the best size.  A bit larger...for trashier people.  :)
B004UR33C6|2|These did what they were supposed to do...they keep my truck level when hauling a trailer.  They also made the ride much more rough.  Rather than having a smooth transition over bumps, the rear now hits the timbrens and bounces back up. My he nice smooth ride of the Ram suspension is altered with the timbren in place.
B000FW2MC2|5|Keeps the dog from spilling my husband's tea.
B007CLNIJK|5|Fits perfectly. Very easy to install. Like OEM. Good job.
B001TETNEU|5|Works fine
B000GD5FMY|5|Great glasses!! I've bought riding glasses for 5 times the price that weren't half as good.  Quick delivery was a plus, got them in less than a week. Going to buy another set as a back up
B00NTOJU28|5|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B005LLL2HI|4|Fit my Prius but makes a lot of chattering after a few months.  Still wipes the rear window clean though.
B000C2UKG0|5|Great price and quick shipping!
B001B5IGVS|1|I've had this clutch installed for 1.5 years now. I honestly have not been happy with it at all, shift shutter, hard starting, extreme chatter (im friends with a lead tech at subaru and he even said it was loud as well), and the pedal is heavier then my friends stage 2 competition clutch ???. Which I think contributed to my firewall welds breaking and the master cylinder blowing out after just 700 miles of having the clutch installed. Im looking into new options and just thinking of going back to an OEM clutch with the lightweight flywheel. Some unpredictable pickup along the clutch. sometimes it will pick up just right, then once it gets a little warm it will pick up in a different spot makes smooth shifting almost impossible.. Possibly I just got a bad unit, but overall would not put this or another clutch thats not oem spec from exedy.  in good news iit handles my ~300wtq perfectly with no slippage
B001P6GONU|5|GREAT GIFT FOR MY FATHER! HE TOTALLY LOVED IT! Great quality and appearance.
B00FDW57VC|5|Good
B00FBPQK7Q|4|We use this under the awning of the new camp trailer and so far so good. Only 3 trips so far so we will have to see how it holds up but it IS easy to clean, feels great walking barefoot on and helps keep dirt and crud from tracking into the trailer. And just plain looks cool out front.
B0002MABGE|5|Great car pet barrier. Assembles easily and can be moved between cars. The finish is good and does not scratch easily. The ends slide out easily to adjust for the width at any moment.
B000E792N0|1|Doesn't work wrong one
B0049GE9TE|5|Exact OE part that was used by Honda NOT a cheap knockoff.
B0000AZ5PM|5|Sands really smooth.
B001O0459M|1|This does not fit a Dodge truck.  Be wary of Amazon's parts matching.
B00V6E5UEA|4|Looks great and was easy to install.
B000CC4O58|5|We haven't yet put these on our vehicles--I bought 2 sets, on for my Tahoe, & one for my daughters Honda;  I've had them on previous vehicles & found them to be extremely helpful when I'm driving through any area where at night (or anytime for that matter?) the deer may come out & cross the road!  I highly recommend them!
B004RT9F3S|5|Great exhaust upgrade over stock. No droning, great fit and it sounds amazing when you get on the gas. This is my first Borla product and I am overall happy with my choice.
B00461L9LS|1|Spring compressor will not open far enough to get the spring off without having to unbolt the compressor from the cyl. head, which it says specifically in the instructions to not unbolt it with spring pressure still on it.<br /><br />Maybe it will work with stock springs, but it does not work as supplied with dual springs(i.e. comp, lingenfelter)
B003554TB8|5|Well made very satisfied
B000CNJKD8|5|Easy installation and it adheres well! Been about 2 months and no issues. Nice to be able to crack my windows again without worrying about rain!
B00K3GBRQ2|5|used on boat transom light for night fishing works well,nice and bright and don't use much power.
B00LBNJEYI|5|The nrg kit came on time only took several minutes to install. The nrg kit came in the original box. Love this thing! The color is the exact same as shown in the pictures only that the one you actually get looks like a special edition of sorts..<br />I wanted the orange one but it did not come as a full kit.the part that mounts to the hub is sold separately for $80 to $120. Although i took a hit as far as the color, this nrg item was cheaper and had free shipping.
B000BGM51A|5|They go perfectly with my rear jacks
B0047N1ANW|5|Excellent car mount!
B009ZBQOYG|3|A bit noisy
B000DT7SSK|1|It sucked. I had to double check i had not put the old one on by mistake. It does not hold my hatch up at all.
B003SS62PS|4|I use it to cool off while eating my lunch in the truck. I would like it better if  it had a rheostat to control the speed though.
B00R8QGITG|5|Excellent, good prices and shipping time was quik,
B005OEIY8W|4|great
B002O1HGZU|5|fit and works well
B00FMV0WFA|4|Works great
B00BCRMAAS|4|I ordered it after searching the product on various sites, but all had one or the other problem. Finally I ordered this. I am happy with what I got. You get what you pay for and this product has value for money. I can recommend it for your old cars. Experience with Amazon was also nice.
B009DJRKLG|5|Perfect fit great price
B00V56U28I|1|Stop working after one week.
B00D3RS64E|5|The only way to get connected around water!
B00NBN1C78|5|This heavy duty &#34;Jack in a Box&#34; will ensure that you're never without the tools to change a tire on your trailer. The steel box can be bolted onto your trailer tongue or trailer frame. It measures 3 inches by 5 inches. The 1.5 ton scissor jack, 4-way lug wrench, and crank handles all fit nicely inside the steel box. This is a handy tool for anyone with a utility or sports trailer of any kind. Don't be caught on the road unprepared. This simple emergency trailer jack comes with all of the mounting hardware necessary to get it quickly attached to your trailer, so you can be prepared on-the-road. This is an ideal item for any outdoor enthusiast, handy-man, or anyone who is routinely utilizing a trailer.
B00CIJ3T1S|5|Looks nice, easy application, quick ship, cheap, what else to say? Recommend!
B0057GVE5C|5|These are awesome and cute.  Since I am sensitive to rubber smells I was surprised they didn't stink
B000CKFKZ8|5|Smooth as butter.  Replaces OEM and improves the noise/vibration 1000%
B0066SE0Q0|5|fit great, works great, looks great. I put these on the bonnet of a 986 Boxter and a 996 911. replaced both sides on the Boxter and just one side on the 911. Highly recommend for this application.
B00MHXFDWS|5|guuud
B006RYVULG|5|Nice and bright, I received these on time and in perfect condition.  perfect replacement for my DS2 4000K, nice light blue tint.
B00ESFEQK8|5|Just received these, very quick delivery, made my quad steer even better!!  will be ordering these again in the future for the other side! Thank you.
B00HD9T2B4|5|perfect fit. on time and as expected. Good Buy.
B00L26U1CI|5|Switch worked great! I like the way the letters and symbol lights up.
B00THRMSCA|4|Fits snug on a 2014 Yamaha Stryker. Leaves lent behind every time I take it off but not bad for the price.
B007TY7K4E|4|Awesome price, not bad for installation...so far so good!
B00SJTL5NU|4|Excellent yosh quality. Installed with some bar end mirrors. Looks way better then open holes where the oem mirrors used to be. Only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because its pretty overpriced.
B006C1NTEU|1|So many scratches on them!
B005VTT4XO|4|Works. How too videos on YouTube.
B00192KYFO|4|Works great as s replacement shower head in my camper
B001O0BJUK|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B007GR4XDK|5|Works as advertised .
B002QUJ92C|3|Build for small face. decent pair for the price paid.
B002MQDY4O|4|Definitely great price as the dealer wanted $80.  This was $6.  Perfect fit with a little jostle and functions great.
B00DJ2D45O|5|Coming from a locksmith , these things are amazing. With standard programming equipment, it takes up at 30 minutes to program a new master key. With this thing, you're done in less than 2 minutes.
B00FRM8CYM|1|Incompatible with a 2007 CLK 550.
B0081J9NWI|5|Looks great, color matches original factory paint.<br />Easy to fit... These are a little bit narrow compared to Toyota OEM mouldings, but look fine.
B00VAVVML4|5|Work pretty good.Train tracks ain't got nothing on me
B00BAYR4AY|5|Well worth the money. Super bright.
B005BYFXD4|5|This is fantastic and represents whom I love.  Wish I could get many more of them .
B004YD1VIY|4|They worked well for the person I bought them for.  This is one of those things that it would be better not to use but OTOH it is better than the ad-hoc solution that the person was using before.
B0061TU2JS|5|These are great lights. They are about 3 times brighter than my stock ones. My girlfriend loves them now in the dark she can do her makeup in the vanity mirror lol.
B00FQD4XQ8|1|It says 6 pack, and I only got one filter. I am very disappointed.
B00597ML2Y|5|Great price and they fit great.  Wore them to 2015 sturgis
B002Y2LC7C|5|YouTube video was very helpful and the decal looks great on my truck.
B00ODVEWPG|5|Just hooked it up to an agm battery. Lights up the entire master bedroom to the least equivalent of a 75 watt warm white bulb. Extremely thin, and has a nice soft blue button indicator that helps you locate the switch in total darkness.  Very low milliamperes draw. Will update when I take an ammeter reading on the Fluke. Definitely recommend for Arab or DIY emergency lighting, low voltage source etc. will be buying quite a few
B00DDTN7KK|5|great filter for the money works great and easly clean
B004AEUOGC|4|So far so good, I installed this a month ago and it works fine.
B006B2V8ZM|5|One of the best add on on my bike. The quality and fitment of the product is excellent and most importantly it's made in USA.
B005FNKFZ2|5|Smartest lock pin ever
B004ZF4NAY|5|Bought these a year and a half ago for my 07 ford fusion, never had a problem with them. They lasted longer than the car !!!! I just bought a new 2014 ford fusion, and gonna go with Kensun for my low, high beams, and fog lights !! Best on the market.
B0014SQVA0|5|The simplest, least expensive option that has worked!  Since we put up our &#34;No Soliciting&#34; sticker, we haven't had any obtrusive knocking at our door. The sticker is easy to apply and arrived quickly.
B00BTHQFMU|1|Do not purchase this product unless you want to replace your light bulbs every three months. When I first installed them, I could not have been happier with the product. They were very bright and worked well. I could tell that I was using less electricity, because even with all the lights on the inverter fan was not running.  I would have given the product 5 stars if they lasted more than three months.
B00R26RCVK|5|great for after the gym
B00REQ1OJY|4|they are just a little bit too long on my 2014 Sorento.
B0002UEOPA|5|Cheap and inexpensive
B00BAZBYTU|2|I replaced with the original which was very long. And the signal became worse and I could not listen to the radio in more and more areas. So I put my old one back.
B00FX40C9C|4|I put this blade on my SUV about a month ago and decided to see how it would wear.  After a month of use, the blade is still wipes clean and there are no streaks in the middle of the windshield.  Definitely seems like a solid product.
B00AKH4XM4|5|BUENO EXCELENTE
B00JGS5PSY|5|Really nice job. Fits well. Not perfect but pretty close. Good velour like feel and almost matches the light gray on the trim of the beetle. Seat shifts a little so could be tighter but still good.
B00139WO9C|5|Excellent
B0085XV9JA|3|It did not come in a box with instructions. Each of the ways you can attach it to  the back of the seat was not as secure as I thought it was.  It came with one piece broken on one of the flip tops, so was not happy about that.  It just was not worth the time to send back.  Very disappointed with what the picture portrayed.
B000CLLLF0|5|as advertised, quick service
B00KY8EZYU|4|The circuit board on these fobs seems to be much more durable than the case.  If you are reasonably handy, it is easy to swap the board and battery to a new case.  The first one of these I got chipped on one edge but it looks good enough for the price that I got another one. The markings on the buttons wear off fairly quickly. Since you are looking at $30 to $50 and some hassle to get a new one, it is a very good deal for the price.
B0097IECXM|5|Took me all of about 5 minutes to install the cross bars. Much easier than I expected, no tools required. They'll be easy to adjust/re-position in future too.
B000C3ZDY8|5|Great Staff. I love it.
B00DLMIIYE|5|Order handled quickly. Lights work great.
B000WJIJNO|3|ok
B003L35936|5|Great filter.
B00S70VMWU|5|Came in packed well fit perfectly and performance is great. Very very good quality
B00J0UZWYU|1|junk it misfired would not hardly run i put my old one back in ran 100% beter i was going to change it seting light off
B00IHQZC1Q|5|Great looking on my goldwing
B001NKS45Y|5|After some diagnosis, it was determined that the low pressure fuel pump on my Four Winns was the culprit for hard starts and random dying while slow cruising. Ordered the airtex, installed it in an hour or so. Fired right up. Test run was a weekend trip several hours away from home. Not one problem the entire weekend. For the price this is the best deal by far. Add in prime and your up and running in 2 days. That was faster than the auto parts store could get it, and cheaper on Amazon as well. Great product with no problems over the past 2 months of operation.
B000C7ZCNQ|5|Have installed and it fit and works great
B00JYG9R8C|5|Awesome all around. Very well made. Fits great and it is light weight. I have no regrets on this purchase.
B00J15YK9C|1|Don't waste your money here if these is for use outside.  ANYTHING to clean the glass will smear the ink; Windex, alcohol, some soaps.<br /><br />Yes, they sent me a picture of their ink cartridge marked &#34;solvent ink,&#34; but it appears to be an aftermarket cheap ink.  They should be coated or laminated then.<br /><br />Anyway, there ARE decals on here that are truly outdoor ink--I have bought them in the past.  It's just junk.
B000CFOK7W|5|Great product super fast shipping
B001LTVHTM|5|MADE IN USA
B0012PV3VM|5|Great product and super fast shipping
B003WZRLZ2|5|Work like a three bit coin
B001D0FMPO|5|Not much to review here. Bosch O2 sensor for a Land Rover that costs 50% less than buying at a local parts store. Worked perfectly out of the box.
B0075XHDHI|3|I broke the tool while trying to double flare stainless lines.  Ended up purchasing a much more expensive Mastercool kit that did a much better job.
B004YK4S1O|5|Awesome upgrade for $10, others asked me where I bought them and ordered them too.
B00H7PQ50U|1|Don't waste your money or sweat on this product. I bought this kit at Sam's Club during a demonstration.  I normally use Wolfgang Fuzion and Pinnacle Black Label Synergy on my metal-flake gray Toyota Camry Hybrid and the metal flakes pop, and reflections are razor-sharp.  They both go on like melted butter and you don't have to wait for them to haze before you buff off, like this product.  If IBIZ is indeed used by detailers and owners of Corvettes and other high-end cars, I feel sorry for the work they have to expend to get a decent shine.  This wax is streaky (yes, I thoroughly shook the bottle before using), and actually DULLED the clear finish my other waxes put on the car; it also smells like the petroleum product base it has.  Fortunately, I only used IBIZ on a side section of my front bumper, and was able to restore the finish with repeated coatings of Wolfgang and Pinnacle again.  I used this wax on my outdoor Jenn-Air stainless steel grill and got the same results, had to (again) cover the streaks with Wolfgang.  Sad product, not worth $10.
B00D3E1E6O|5|Fast shipping and good items
B0009R0VQC|4|good stuff
B00513G82U|5|Works amazing and at a great price!!!! Arrived on time and in good condition!
B004PC4BG8|2|No instructions or wiring diagram with product<br />Wiring was incorrect had to swap some wires in furnished plug to make work license plate lite is not wired into harness.
B00LIR7L10|5|Works great!!!
B00KSIF0FY|1|Way to small to be effective.
B000C53S1G|5|Works great! A must for hauling loads!
B009DJXPCE|4|Overall fit and dimensions was just like OEM specs. The thing I noticed was it was no where near as heavy as the OEM tailgate that I took off. It is not as strong as OEM but cosmetically perfect!
B002IQYO8I|5|perfect fit. original replacement part
B002EW5FWU|4|Works pretty good, but it's not a spray on/spray off.... You really need to put some elbow grease into it.
B00VUC2N8E|5|This was my &#34;introduction&#34; to accessory LED light fixtures, and had never seen anything in use, so I was unsure what to expect. I was amazed by how rugged the fixture is.  It will I hope, provide years of trouble-free service, but it DEFINITELY does an excellent job of lighting  up the area to the rear of my compact utility tractor, which will be important as I am clearing snow in the wee hours of the morning.
B003UT090Y|5|Although the bottle is small, you don't need much to keep your car clean. Performs better than many of the high end washes available at local parts stores.
B00PCKXOLK|1|broke right away. not even worth dealing withe return to get another one.
B007TD1WIK|5|Bought these for my grandkids cars. Good quality.
B00DQ1RV70|5|Surpassed my expectations, excellent measure for my corolla 2013 ring 16
B00407TU5U|1|Runny and splotchy. No white tab that supposedly solves this issue. Color is great but doesn't do any good if it applies in a spitting fashion.
B000IEXKV4|5|These fit perfectly! I have had ones on previous vehicles & love them. Such a great price, quick shipping. Arrived vacuum sealed & in a nicely packaged box. You won't be disappointed!!
B00V2XHQ4W|5|Great product for the price, super bright
B0090JVTYI|5|Exactly as described. Would buy again.
B00I505688|4|It was easy to install
B000BRJPKS|4|Working good.
B00CRR5KXG|1|Pump worked...meter didnt...faulty part.
B000B8J6PG|3|It is just OK.  made of very flimsy material.
B00EVMT6A8|5|Outstanding item; easy installation and looks like it's part of the factory installed equipment. Truly helps with blind spot issues.
B004BWB9JO|5|I bought this for the unusual use of pumping laundry soap into the washing machine. I make my own liquid soap in a 5-gal bucket and this pump does awesomely. A great purchase....
B0015RDKUE|5|the right part and is working so far.
B000RL7GJU|5|Perfect for guiding a boat, space ships, or penguins onto trailers
B00AEBAG2W|5|Received ahead of time.<br />Excellent quality fit perfect<br />Nothing but good things to say about them.
B00T7CRLA4|1|The description of this product and the picture makes it impossible to see that it is one piece and much smaller than one would think. It came woefully short of fitting my bucket seats on an Acura TL, so don't even consider it for that application. It would be helpful if Amazon or the manufacturer were to publish a list of applications the skins fit on. It is only sufficient for a very small seat, though. Remember, the headrest is not separate. It is all a single piece and once you mount the headrest, it will only hang so far down the back of the seat and if you start with the bottom, which must be stretched over the entire bottom of the seat, covering up knobs and gadgets that adjust the seat, it only will stretch up so far, but not high enough to get near the headrest. The headrest cover ended up somewhere between my shoulder blades. I am under 6 feet tall. I wouldn't buy a thing from this manufacturer.
B000C59ZUY|4|Needs a slot cut on the spindle side so that you can hold the end while you torque it down.
B004AQZUX2|5|For the price of the pair, great value. My local Volvo dealer charged $217 more then these. Even if the longevity is lessened, still a great value for the price point!
B00496F0HY|5|happy w/purchase
B003VAVCY4|5|excellent quality. fixed a few drawer on my RV
B000C9S88A|5|perfect fit
B005O0QQ1S|3|almost to rigid
B00AZOI7DS|4|Excellant. Worked perfect and as advertised.
B00N2T7216|5|Very good product.
B005FKBQ3K|5|Well packaged. Arrived on time.  Had my local garage do the install.  They stated it was an well done kit.  Included all the little extras.  As for performance, definite improvement over the old brakes and now I am not as worried about pulling a trailer.
B00LWHPO24|4|Fits well. Just wish it had a little passing in it.  Otherwise very pleased
B00122AXA2|5|Arrived on time, engine runs good. I put a little bit of antisieze on the extension section as car and driver suggested to keep the carbon buildup from being a problem later.
B005VKLGUW|5|Our local dealer wanted $150 to rekey our 2004 Accord  key that broke in ignition.<br />My husband researched & found this.<br />We had to synch it to the ignition system which was a trick a mechanic showed us.
B0036IA6JI|5|Matched perfect.
B00QP3DS7S|5|Very pleased with the product !
B000EVWDU0|5|A bargain considering the accuracy and display. I compared the displayed voltage to a Fluke 8840A which has a nominal accuracy greater than 0.01% and the difference was less than 0.01 volts. That is exceptional in a voltmeter costing less than $14. I really like that the display swivels so you can see it regardless of where the 12v socket is. The display is clear, large, backlit and easy to read. Even if your car/truck has a voltmeter, most are not very accurate, so this voltmeter would be really handy. I used to use 12v plug and adapter to plug into my hand-held Fluke voltmeter but this is simpler and easier. Highly recommended.
B0074ONVU6|2|Expected more from this cap. Not the quality expected for the reviews and price. Had to put some glue on the AMG as soon as I took it out from the plastic because the AMG stamp was unraveling
B008I7NKZO|5|took me about 20min's to replace it.<br />working great
B0002SQYSM|5|They work very well. Extremely sensitive to noise. Nice piece for the price.
B00AQ8H34W|2|The mats did not meet the hook to keep it in place for the drivers side<br />All the others fit ok
B005BNP7YU|1|Did not work at all.
B000C8227E|5|My go to replacement cap, no issues now on 3 cars.
B008RIEQXY|5|I like it
B003XX21TO|5|I'm on my second one of these, but the first one lasted 3.5 years.  It was still working good but like others the rear zipper was starting to malfunction.  It should be noted I use the zipper at least 2-3 times/day to access the back, so I think I did pretty good.  I didn't experience any seams separating and the plastic windows (tinted) still looked really good.  For the price (paid $158) I think it's a great deal and I am more than pleased it lasted 3+ years.  Ordering another one right now so I have a spare ready if I need it.
B000PGVZ30|1|Make sure your connection is tight and all wires are secure. After two years, this plug was the source of a failure of some kind.
B00B6TLJOA|5|Arrived quickly.  Easy to apply.  Looks good on the car.
B004IAB4DK|5|Ok
B00QFND1N4|5|Arrived quickly and just as described.  Thank you!
B00G7KPPOI|5|Really nice sound for just a slip on exhaust. Made my sportster sound great and turns heads when I ride through town.
B008BB6Z2M|4|Ultra bright amazing light!!!<br /><br />This was so easy to install, just choose from the one of the connections they provide, essentially a plug and play device. I installed in my Nissan Titan truck  in two minutes and its amazing how much more light this provides compared to the stock bulb. I would buy from this seller again and this item arrived very quickly.Less then a week<br /><br />Cons, this light gets pretty hot for an LED imo.
B00XJ79O80|5|Recieved this bumper protector earlier than expected, obviously direct from the mfg in China.  I was worried that it might be bent during shipping but it was very well protected in packaging and in perfect condition.  It fit perfectly but I would have liked to have had a few instructions on how best to install it as I found that once the adhesive was down it was not going to be moved.  That is also good in that it will stay in place forever and fortunately I had done some preliminary measuring and marking with masking tape to get it centered and after a couple of dry runs before peeling off the adhesive backing strips I got it in the right place, and it fit just perfectly.  It goes well with the rest of the stainless trim on the car so makes it looks attractive.  I would recommend it to anyone else looking for such a 2015 Ford Explorer Accessory, just need a few instructions/precautions from the mfg to be included.
B005CNNJZ8|5|These liners have saved my car's interior countless times! They're super easy to clean and fit perfectly.
B002UC2UB8|5|Easy to use and read.  It's great plugging into a sight and seeing before you hook up if the wiring is correct.  I also love how you can use this in a 30 amp with adaptor even though it's a 50 amp.  It's nice not having to buy two different products.  The peace of mind knowing your internal items are protected is worth the money.  We also bought this product used or open box on Amazon for a discount.  This was the best deal of the month for me.
B009FNVMVY|4|Ford wanted way too much for their OEM and these fit the bill, I have heard a lot of the keys are the same but a lock only keeps the honest person honest anyway.
B005BHW3CK|5|Great low clearance air cleaner for my project car. Looks awesome. Fits snug. Worth the cash.
B000WNK8OS|2|Cumbersome and a pain to get on my Honda rear shocks
B000EQDYTE|5|installed easily and works as it should. seems to be a nearly identical replacement and good quality on initial inspection and use.
B00N2Z3RU0|1|No instructions and once returned had trouble getting my money back.
B001N72FES|3|This does the job, but it falls apart when I unscrew the knob all the way because the plastic is too loose. So, when I turn the knob a half-turn, as suggested in the instructions, the loose half sometimes touches the knob and makes contact again, thus running down the battery. That is why I started removing it all the way.
B009214RWU|5|Tour Master always delivers a quality product at a good price. I have the matching tank bag as well. Can't go wrong.
B0000AXDG4|5|Perfect for my BMW 7 series. Heavy enough to withstand most winds and rains, yet not so heavy as to be difficult to manage. I ordered the wrong cover initially, but both Budge and Amazon were very accommodating regarding the return and re-order.
B004JAZ0SO|5|Exactly as described. Exactly what I needed. Fast shipping and California legal. The price was great and lower than pretty much anywhere else I could find. I would recommend to anyone else needing a Ca legal manifold cat.
B002XUXUTS|5|yes it did work like it said and easy to put on -thanks alot
B00QOJW1TO|5|Work great in my ranger 570 full size. When screwed tight they hold firm.
B00XI2NFJU|1|No
B0055DROQK|4|Item as described. Arrived on time
B007D463UW|1|did not fit/ not Returnable
B00UWEQI8W|5|great product
B00666HERY|5|Performs as advertised.
B003YCMRA2|5|Works so well for the job we needed them for and will continue to use them seeing that they work fantastically.
B00T0WTL0O|1|Poor quality!
B005J941U2|5|Bolted right on to the rear end of my 2008 International ProStar, ride set at middle setting, rides like a dream, nice and smooth. Much better shock than the International OEM shocks I had previously installed. Will be buying these again for sure.<br /><br />Update, it is 10/17, still running these shocks without issue, no leaks and the truck still rides nice. Set them at medium setting. Will purchase another set prior to the winter.
B00HVOEO2S|4|Pretty much no frills here. It is a threaded antenna assembly that I ordered for my 2008 Honda CR-V. Some happy prankster thought it would be fun to take my old one. Most of my driving is in town so I did not even notice the poor reception unless I drove through a tunnel but I wanted to get it fixed so this is what I ordered. Installs in 30 second if you know how to thread a screw into a bolt.
B00KTJ4WMO|4|like operation but now it all shows change battery on my dash everyday even with a new battery
B007SNARN2|5|I have this framed with a ROTC certificate I received. Love it.
B00C1YI2XA|5|Got them on my classic car
B009DK0K3K|3|Everything matched up pretty well but this bumper is way lighter then the original, so figure you are going to lose some stopping power in an accident.
B00D2OHXBK|1|Well very excited about ordering this product, got a green and blue first go around(ORDERED 2 GREENS), sent back the blue one to get a green one, got a blue one again, sent it back, got a BLUE one again!!!!!!!! Not very happy at all.......never again
B005SB6S3Y|5|Showed up on time and does the job just like I expected.  Very happy with the product!
B000CO9Q0Y|3|Great product, no complaint's there. But this thing was like 5 days late and I have Prime. I was on a time deadline and this totally screwed that up.
B00V2GA3OE|5|I love this sticker!! It came really quickly and then you are supposed to clean off the area you want it applied and there are a few more steps to follow with how to apply the sticker. I got too excited and didn't leave the clear sheet over the decal for a full 24-hours, so I just opted to leave it on for about 30 seconds. A couple of letters didn't appreciate that, but I just situated them and rubbed them down with a credit card and everything worked out perfectly! One of my better purchases :D
B00X123JMU|5|I have a new 2015 car-dark blue in color and was using a beloved 20+ yr.old genuine horsehair brush to wash it.  However, hard water spotting ruined my efforts so I tried the Nanoskin  wash mitt.  What a difference!  No spotting and its as gentle as my horsehair brush.  I think the amount of soapsuds the Nanoskin holds really yields superior results.  I used the same wash agent (Zymol)) and have not noticed it takes more physical effort; seems to be somewhat quicker too.<br /><br />Although I was skeptical this relatively inexpensive product has been a pleasant surprise and seems well-made after four uses.
B00IAZ9HVK|4|Honestly it's not a bad system for the price. I have a 94 del sol that's basically all stock, fitment is good, it's the right length and bolts up well. I took out the studs on my cat when I put it on. As far as sound, I'm personally a fan of how it sounds with the silencer in. It's pretty quiet but still sounds good when you get on it. With the silencer out, it's rather loud and unbearable around city speeds, but upper end in the rpms and highway speeds it sounds nice and throaty.  Over all I'm rather satisfied with its sound, quality, and price.
B00G3KX1N4|5|Works like a charm,no issues.
B0090Q4MZY|4|The spring is very weak to pull back the shade when disconnected. Product does the job its supposed to
B00W6IYG90|5|Perfect fit for 2003 Jetta
B006FYE2BS|5|Great product! Works fine!
B00NQ45228|1|No bought this for my Honda the shade is to small doesn't even get to tear view mirror and its extra wide and doesn't stay on windshield folds back down horrible buy
B000GU7LK6|5|Run this in my 125's, works great, good oil for a hard working motor.
B0052YQIPK|5|very nice grill, we love it!
B00KJ8KZ94|5|Super service! Will buy again!
B006U5ZX4W|1|way too dim couldnt tell they were on even before i put them in the housing
B00Y1ZA6NG|4|Looks great works great, easy install, took me about 5 minutes, only downside is that I have a chip in it after 2 days but it's little hopefully it doesn't occur again or get worse
B003RX14KW|5|I am happy with it
B001EOYK98|5|Exactly what I needed.perfect thanks
B00D8Y762U|5|My husband thinks this is the s***... best stuff he ever has used. My car looks great!!
B00BWX5U6I|5|This is perfect for what I needed it for.  It's stable, it's easy to assemble and it's accurate.  I highly recommend.
B00MJ0RNFY|5|Durability seems very good to date. I'd buy then again.
B000BQYH6Q|5|They are chocks not much you can say here. They work well
B002OO2B1G|1|These are junk
B006JRJ5L8|5|the plastic ones are junk
B001V8U12M|5|hooked it up to a drill and saved my back
B00TK23MZY|2|Not a good adhesive tape. Need to be changed
B002P4E4Z6|4|Works good just wasn't clear that only one mirror was in the package
B00P7R05E2|1|Poor quality, very offensive chemical smell from product, could not install
B001C6Q7Q2|5|Worked like a charm, jsut what I needed and was expecting.
B00C7Y619Q|5|Door opens great now.
B00GV85NS4|1|This item looks like it the correct part, but it did NOT fit..... it was smaller than the original part.
B001ABPKUS|5|They fit over mirrors as expected. They are lightweight but seem strong enough to do the job. The mirror is adjustable by hand, which requires adjustment before driving. (duh!) They are so simple to add on, I worry a little about theft. But they worked great at being able to see behind the trailer and they look nice. Better than some of the alternatives.
B00FKJ114K|5|Excelent product
B000C54068|5|A+++++
B001G7VX4S|5|Fixed my tapping!
B004OFNJZ0|5|So cute!!
B0097SVS6Q|5|I had a pair of these for my 2001 F250 so I knew they were quality. When I traded in the F250 for a F150 EcoBoost I knew what mats I was getting. Before my original purchase I looked at the other well marketed brand &#34;weather&#34; mats. Had a buddy that had them and hated them. I couldn't believe how thin they were (so much so he had curling issues in the cold WX) and how expensive too! Thats when I found the Rugged Ridge mat. If you want heavy duty, rugged, perfect custom fit mats that will retain mud, snow and spills in a great looking mat these are for you.
B000IYLZDO|5|Super easy to install, cruise is working great. I had unplugged my stock cruise harness from the master cylinder due to fear of fire. I'm back in action with this repair kit and didn't have to let the dealership touch my truck. Win win.
B004GEE81S|5|Fit and door opens like new.
B000NPUJQC|1|Round back makes the unusable. All these will do is fall over.<br />Sears makes some nylon racks that are MUCH BETTER.
B002OUF3TM|5|Easy to use with lock collar to tighten on hose.  This end is to use on a extension hose.
B0064NSJVE|5|Excellent product,cancelled return and researched installation.  Looks great,exact fit,just have to follow instructions obtained from local toyota dealer.  Would be better if instructions would be included. Definitely a recommended buy!
B00QKEFBUE|5|Fast shipping and great product thank you for ur business
B008MC7614|4|It mostly fits.<br />It sticks out a bit and is clearly a replaced light, but it works.
B00HAPO0SQ|3|Bought for my 2005 Nissan Murano. Please note that they dont come in pairs so you will need to buy two if you want to replace the two radiator rubber mounts. That really bummed me out when I got it since i assumed that they should come in pairs<br /><br />the texture and weight of the material feels close to the OEM to the touch and to the eye. and the fitment was perfect.<br /><br />shipping was relatively fast. it didnt get here later than they pledged so i guess i cant complain
B00M1X6F9Y|5|This came with all the pins and locking snap keys. Very happy with this product
B001MUN57W|5|Bolted right on and worked great!
B004RVSQX6|5|i love the sticker thank you guys it was quick shipping as-well 4 thumbs up
B00MGTS1WW|5|its not hard like the photo appears but thats a good thing in a lot of ways. get one. they are dope.
B00Q57QKHE|5|The pipes were exactly as described and sound great.  They arrived earlier than expected which is a bonus.
B00OOOUVP2|4|I installed these on a 2006 Acura TL. I had a hard time putting these on since it was about 1/4&#34; too long when fully extended.  I had to use a screwdriver as a lever to compress the arm just enough to pop the socket (on the arm) onto the ball (on the hood). Once on, it's working as expected.
B00GWC1D88|5|nice quality
B013ZDQUQ6|5|I've been using this in my garage for a few months - been working great. I like being able to park in the exact same spot every time, especially with my truck (barely fits in the garage). It was a bit of a pain to aim the lasers initially, but worth it now that I can park more easily in my limited garage space.
B00RYFGGMU|5|Shipped quickly, well packaged & as described . Easy install & satisfied with the results. Thank you
B00GLXHM6K|2|These glasses look great and fit like a glove but the yellow is just too much...yellow.
B000C846LY|5|Bought this for my 2005 Subaru Outback 3.0 H6. I also replaced the radiator [[ASIN:B000JZSOA4 Spectra Premium CU2779 Complete Radiator]] and this cap worked perfectly for that radiator.
B00II99ORU|4|These lights have a slight green tint.  Otherwise they work the same as cheap glass replacements from the parts store.  I was hoping they would be a little bit brighter but they are equal for all practical purposes.
B000LGA94A|5|works perfectly
B00T2P1TWC|5|So far works just great !
B00A2DWDT6|5|Very nice cover, the material used in making this cover is excellent, Definitely worth the price for trailer owners
B00U2C7WMK|5|Fast shipping, working perfect
B001RLTZ7A|5|Had to gap it to.026 for my Mazdaspeed 3.
B004BYX8W8|5|Fit perfectly
B0085IJNNY|4|Just what I needed
B00061NQPY|2|not impressed with it,expected it to work much better
B008P4ZJTK|5|Good price and fast shipping
B0081KXJO0|3|so-so
B00T6RRMCW|3|Good filters but no barbs to hold on the fuel line, very likely to slip off when clamp tightened.
B000GTWNUK|3|ok
B002NDHEC4|2|It is definitely  bigger. Size of a regular pen.  Will post updates as to how long it lasts. Update: Barely  lasted a week or so. Not worth it. Just go for smaller bundle pack and keep relplacing.
B007Y5L6OI|5|Great product, at a great price! 5 stars!
B00FTDJ9FA|5|Had it for few weeks. Work great and as promised they are bright.
B004SD1Q9E|2|Update. Will the water pump has started leaking. It lasted about 30k miles. Not quite as long as I was expecting. It is recommended that the timing belt is replaced every 70k miles. I was planning on replacing the timing belt and everything else at 50k because I have heard that there are issues with this vehicle. Everything was as expected. The all telling tale will be if it lasts til my next timing belt change. I was happy that the water pump had the metal impeller.
B000IYPS78|5|Great fit, direct replacement, still working strong
B000C2UCWC|5|Bought this for my 2005 Subaru Outback 3.0 H6. It was long and had to be cut to size, which is typical. You will have to cut A LOT for this hose to fit correctly and not be pinched.
B0067YFP9E|4|This is my first impression of this tool. Its looks well made and good value for the price. I will do a follow up review in about a years time when then the tool is used by my staff.
B00ADLHN3S|5|These cans are great! They are built to hold fuel and not leak. They are very sturdy and can be stored sideway without fear of leaks. They come with a sticker that says for non potable water only, but the sticker comes right off. Seriously these are 1000 times better than anything that meets the stupid carb compliance laws. You will own this for a lifetime.
B00KWLLMTA|5|Worked great
B000VKODGG|1|It not the rigth size to the Mazda 3 2009. It loose
B007Q8LV98|2|Sizing is incorrect. Leather is stiff and the padding isn't shaped properly to fit arms. The jacket weights a ton, not confortable to wear.
B00B5KYPVE|5|Works and looks great!  The reviews on installation really helped.
B00AC5WX8U|1|The item looks nice but very poor quality. Mickey mouse heads came off next day I put them in the car. Dissappointed
B00ALLZ2QA|5|Bought this (2) for a VW GTI ... LOVE them!!!
B00HRZVC6W|5|Fits perfect
B006CPM36G|5|Excelent
B008RDFXFO|5|Got crossbars in two days and they fit great.
B010MHNMKA|1|Not what I expected
B001FEOSVC|5|Installed the kit on a 2014 Tundra that pulls a 2015 32' Forest River Solara.  Went from Houston Tx. North Colorado last year without the kit and did OK.  However, We have made a few shorts trips with the Ride-Rite Kit installed and it makes a world of difference.  I installed the kit myself in about three hours.  I Would have been faster but I did not lower the rear spare tire ( 70 years old and hard headed).  All of the parts fit as they should have.  10+ product.<br />James Taylor
B003NOD4US|5|This was a great find!  My Hagan magnetic gas door is an expensive unit to replace.  When I accidentally broke a piece off this part I thought I might have to buy the entire unit!  I removed the broken unit and installed this EXACT DUPLICATE in about ten minutes.
B004I17LQS|5|This item shipped and arrived in a timely manner.  Replacement for the part is very simple and quick.  The light comes with new bulbs in the required locations and works as advertised.  Hopefully I won't need to but, if I had to, I would order this part again.
B006O78FG4|5|I love this product and price.
B000AME50Y|5|takes out small scratches really well
B00BCRMBSO|2|This material is poorly made. It ripped while setting it up.
B00K73QBKS|3|The problem is that is standard, and its a little big for my car's trunk. The quality is OK. Not excellent but not bad.
B00N8BD3KC|4|Have not tested them out yet but overall grate look, went on easy and the price was reasonable
B00BR1R8N8|5|The range technology is working just as the manufacturer claims. Now my Tahoe runs and performs like I expect it to. Worth every dime I invested.
B0089PYPQ8|4|It looks good
B006GLEBIO|5|Works great
B00NQCTSLQ|5|Great
B000CDOYWK|5|As described and worked properly. Shipped fast
B004ME4952|5|Serves its purpose
B00PZ6R0SE|3|New but not exactly the same as original.missing slots on side of radiator where clamp goes that holds the AC condenser to radiator. Also they sent only one brass nozzle that connects  tranny lines to tranny cooler. Had to drive around for an hour to find one that fit, hence the 3stars.Radiator is great though which was my primary problem.
B0023W8KC8|5|Good like new
B00N2CX8MK|5|Awesome decals, high quality!
B005LS57T0|5|Perfect
B00EW0EJ9C|5|Very heavy.
B00CBT5GH0|5|perfect price delivered quickly
B00NPKEOZY|5|great product
B00FWP8QBS|1|Paid to have a professional put it on My car because it seemed to not fit well when I tried. 3 days later it is missing. Clearly was defective and didn't fit right. I did not hit any curbs or rocks. Too much money for 3 days of use.
B001BMZE8E|5|Easy to install and looks good
B000KSTCGU|3|Had a difficult time getting the splitter to stay square on the nut that I was trying to break.  Did enough damage though that I could get an air chisel to finish the job.
B00RIV7C4Q|5|Perfect replacement for factory bracket
B00IFPA4AI|5|Easy to install and works perfectly in my 2008 Acura MDX.  Saved me hundreds to purchase on Amazon and install myself.
B008535CTS|1|Had a tear when I got it wasn't very pleased with it
B000GAO2OE|5|Nice straps, well made.
B008V2D4B6|4|as  promised
B00XA3CDR2|5|Installed these in my Audi A6 2001 QT, so far very pleased with these bulbs.
B00II7V4RU|5|Sounds great
B000C5SGD6|5|Came with antiseize. The quality of the O2 sensor is excellent. It fit a 99 Maxima. Durability is yet to be known.
B0028MLFO8|5|Exact replacement for less money.
B000C6MLIQ|5|works good so much dirt on other purolater from last year
B000OV9LWS|1|After reading instructions there is a bold statement at the BOTTOM of the page that states THIS MOUNT CAN ONLY BE USED WITH A WARN LIFT ACTUATOR . THATS A 250.00 part . I wanted to use my winch . NOWHERE did it state that on the part description when I ordered it .
B004ZNCI1C|5|I love it
B00YX734RW|1|Went bad after being in car less than 2 days causing power to ac clutch constantly and draining battery.
B000F3RYGA|4|Work great so far !!! No trailers stolen yet !!!<br />Bill
B00XACAUKU|4|I recieved and it came in a good condition. Thanks.
B006MX8196|5|looks good, much nicer than I expected for the price!
B006O2NPE6|5|great product
B008G3CKNI|5|Easy installation fit right in and already comes with lightbulb
B00E9GVML2|5|Great fit.  Easy to put on.  Worked as advertised.
B008XN7SM4|5|I have purchased individual Titan lug sockets to replace the old, lost or worn.  I am again pleased.  22 MM lugs are becoming a trend on certain vehicles this will complement the lug socket lineup for Roadside Assistance.
B00UZYI9H2|4|Good product
B00C5SUOFG|4|Really haven't put it to the test as our first camping trip isn't unti Labor Day weekend. Will give review then?
B00RCKFG4G|5|Check engine light went out after installing this sensor. took about 5 minutes to change. My old one wasn't leaking into the plug so I didn't change it and the sensor still works fine.
B009RC2HVC|5|Worked great!
B00SFKMRT4|5|Works like its supposed to.  Can't complain bought one for myself and my husband.  Now I'm going to get one for my mother in law too.
B009XROHJG|5|AAA
B0006U21MO|2|It was the right price, but didn't look that great or give me much confidence as to its safety.  I quickly replaced this with a helmet from HJC
B002TW92PG|5|Top Dog spot light!
B00BC7FNNY|5|Yes..mats fit great...carpet quality  is fine..logo is right on..<br />Nice up grade from plain/thin factory mats ..
B00KSXW4O4|2|It's a simple plug n play. Easy to install and is a bit brighter than my other HIDs. Only problem is the 5000K is actually GREEN. I even waited 20 mints to see if it's because it's new but it's still GREEN.<br /><br />What's more Sad is that this H11 bulb is not listed as Prime and so that means that the return process is that I have to pay out of pocket. I paid $6.68 to mail it back. So I lost money and this is not even my fault that it's green.<br /><br />So NEVER buy any HID bulbs that has NO PRIME shipping, you will have to pay to ship it back.<br /><br />I would avoid all 5000K from this seller
B00429NKWK|5|Wow, I can't believe the difference to the headlights of my minivan. After 250,000 miles, you can imagine how scratched and sunburned those lights were. With this restoration kit, the lamps look as they did when the car came off the lot!
B003NU0EM8|1|Suction cup would not get out ANY of the dents. Very dissatisfied. Super glad I only paid 5 bucks
B004J368LY|5|perfect fit fair price
B0048EB8Z0|2|The mat came folded up in a box and when installed it's wrinkled up. It keeps covering my head light sensor and turning on my lights in the day time. I was hoping after a couple of days in the sun it would flatten out but it hasnt.
B007KSZQU4|5|its a filter
B00G1YF068|5|I have several VW's and Audi's that monitor all the onboard lights and alert you if one is out. This can be a problem with some LED lights. I can say I have never had a problem related to the JDM ASTAR LED lamps. I have purchased dozens of these bulbs for my cars and will continue to do so. They give a very white, clean, color that is a huge improvement over the &#34;yellow&#34; color from the original OEM bulbs. I am impressed with the range of bulbs available since some auto bulbs can be a little strange.
B00CMBWPOE|5|Bought for a 2008 Jeep Patriot...easiest install and perfect fit.  No tools required.
B000CF6S3Q|5|Great product, already installed, very easy, and if you have done this before then it's a no brainer on how to install.<br />Even the directions were so simple and very easy to follow, not that it's needed for a second time installer.<br />Thanks
B00NY0S2OY|3|NICE but, too light weight....blows up& off with slightest breeze...I had it in the garage & when I open the door it blows OFF......not good...
B000BUQOAE|4|The water doesn't Make it into my tank from the sprayer, good pressure just not angled correctly.
B000BNXOP4|5|Makes annoying beeping noise just like it should!
B00ZJ527IO|5|Nice and bright definitely better than stock
B0009IBJE4|4|Good charger!
B00Y4GWD7E|5|Did you have of Wonder Woman?
B00192QBPQ|5|Great product! Works great
B00YA0MG4E|5|Great lights, nice that they have no moving parts, good white color, would reccomend to others.
B000XQ2S4M|5|Great machine, great performance great price!
B00ALQQNHC|2|I have used the LEDs for close to a year and one of them burned out.  Checking the bulb I notice the white plastic piece was melting.<br />Cheap plastic quality.
B00OHCUWGE|4|L.E.D lights are to Brite
B00065L2D8|5|Great product great price wonderful seller, Thanks
B00JDPSRTE|4|great
B004AIS0U0|4|Well, I ordered front lower control arms for my 2007 Chevy HHR. I revisited my orders later and before I could get my car to my mechanic and the order stated at the top of the page that these parts do not fit my car. I then clicked to return the items, and since it was a day or two beyond the 30 day order date, it said these items cannot be returned. I've got an appointment tomorrow to get the parts installed, and if they don't fit my car someone will get an ear full. The original order stated that parts would fit my automobile. Not happy at this point.  Well, the parts did fit my 2007 Chevy HHR after all, despite there being a message on the top of the order page that they wouldn't fit my car. The parts were originally for Chevy Cobalt, but I guess the suspension parts are interchangeable on these two Chevy models. So, I am happy especially with the price!
B006K8WCYS|5|Never replaced cam bearings before so I have nothing to really compare it to, but worked very well for my 350 build.
B00I8Y3YBW|5|These struts came quickly and were in great condition all mounting brackets were included and fit just like the original.  My wife is much happier now that her liftgate doesnt hit her on the head!
B008ETMV8I|5|These straps make a nice secure alternative to standard bungee cords. They've held up well so far (almost daily use), are nicely adjustable, and seem sturdy. While they do have some stretch to them, its not as elastic as a bungee cord, which makes for a little more secure load retention.  The only downside is if you have a high mounted muffler; they will melt if they are left in contact with it. Other than that,  I like them.
B0006O2PHQ|5|As advertised...Excellent all the way
B004XDAQA4|5|bigger and more beautiful than I imagined
B007TO3Z02|2|Disappointed. Expected a tinted look but instead came out looking like a matte clear coat.
B000BLKVAC|5|Saved money
B00E5PK83K|5|Great price on this battery. Fast shipping. Fits perfect, and is exactly what I was expecting.
B007P73OCC|5|Exceeded all expectations at a good price.
B00D2UHT7C|5|these things are cool! pricy but cool
B000MISLJ2|5|Very impressed!! Came in two days!! Everything appears to be right, however I haven't installed the items yet.
B009S2ZPTC|5|Worked perfectly, got them ontime everything as advertised and more
B00CS7T0IQ|4|Item was like described but wouldnt fit
B008BLFHS0|5|easy to use ,
B004L5WLZ2|4|Stuff is awesome. Comes off really easy and is applied easy also. Makes the car shine really nicely and very slick.
B0091MACJC|4|It feels great. It's made the bike riding a joy.
B00062ZH3C|1|This stuff makes things much more annoying than they should be. I've been through more boxes of this junk than you could imagine just to tint one window. It does not want to shrink properly. Even shrinking to a side window is annoying, because the film wants to bunch up instead of shrinking evenly.<br /><br />The adhesive is junk. Squeegee all you want, it doesn't want to stick. Yes I washed the windows several times and razored them too. Had a heat gun and not a hairdryer. Have more patience than most people I know, but this junk made me want to punch through my rear window many times.<br /><br />Go find a quality film, and leave this garbage to people who don't know any better. I didn't at first. Too bad.<br /><br />Just so it's clear it's not my admittedly novice skillset to blame. Watch the video. Everything I experienced were legit issues with the quality of the film. It's trash.<br />https://youtu.be/HkJijHDwNCY
B009FU7F5O|5|So far these have been excellent struts... just purchased my 3rd one as I've had two failures one that ruined one of them... but my truck is kinda on the extreme side of off road and I've since figured out their weakness and have a simple modification that solved the issue... Save your old washer from the top of your strut (thick curved) and place it below the rubber bushing with the metal core... this prevents the rubber from sliding down the strut and off of its core... causing the strut to move up and down in the mount on your frame. (Terrible popping noises and wheel hop)
B00TODR110|5|Loading my pontoon has never been easier! Have used this product 8 times since purchased. Failed attempts are a thing of the past. Highly recommend to any owner of a pontoon, especially when loading by yourself.
B000F0QKKO|5|Love this. Makes my car look so much nicer since my dash is cracked. I was nervous it wouldn't fit when I ordered it. But it was perfect. Arrived when it was suppose to and installed her easily
B00UHD4HJA|2|to much kid stuff
B00QGPKFGW|5|Received these in the mail a few days ago.  It took approximately 45 seconds longer to open the box they arrived in that it did to place them properly in the car.  The Rubber is not very tacky (meaning somewhat slick) but they are some what thick and flexible.  The driver side and rear mats stay firmly in place while the passenger side front tends to slide around a little bit.  So far I am very pleased with them.  On a side note the rubber does not have an overpowering smell like some other rubber mats tend to have (the process/chemical smell tends to irritate my senses).  I would recommend these to anyone needing all weather floor mats for their car.
B00A14O8LC|5|Arrived quickly and easy to install
B00KIKZD04|5|A great product.  The connectors are high quality, unlike the parts store junk that I used to use.
B002VVJRKK|2|Product looks like it will work fine, but there are no dimensions listed for the gap and it turned out to be too big for my car and it hung loose because there wasn't enough space for the threading.
B00NXYTCR2|1|Not the full size needed - had to use because I needed to finish the job.
B00CPGQ1GO|4|Nice to use without messing up you concrete or sinking into the mud or sand.
B00CHU8XTG|5|Great product. Go Navy!
B00LNDRN12|5|Great
B00BV4DKN8|5|I like OEM, and the price was way better than the dealer. Will purchase again!
B0046BFXOW|5|great product
B00C3J2ILA|5|did the trick
B00BBNQ3DI|2|Cheaply made didn't work, too frustrated to return
B00CHPUSG2|3|This is well worth the money but I payed for three day shipping on Sunday and Amazon told me the package was to be delivered on Wednesday and I got it on the day I was<br />Going to give it as a birthday gift However a good solid product and with the locking mechanism you can bet it was worth the wait. 😀
B0058GSWDI|5|Nice cheap alternative to expensive liners. Works great! Everything you lay on it definitely sticks and zero movement. Very sturdy and easy to spray off. Traps sand when on vacation for way less mess after beaching!! Also easy to roll down if nee 3rd row seating. Couldn't ask for more! Update: After a year and a half I still LOVE this thing! It has a few places and nail marks from the doggie but it still works as good as the day gotten.
B0063CU57W|5|perfect fit
B00VJ2AKX0|3|All & all good bumper....does have 2 bad spot in the chrome but not really noticeable... Can live with it....
B00LY8VF9C|5|This is my second pair. Love them.  I have bought other brands and they just don't match up.
B005O2869G|4|Product is really nice and everything worked out really well. One small glitch was delivery since the package is larger than your typical shipment. Had to talk to the driver to coordinate the delivery. Also tracking information or more specifically the company name would have been helpful.
B00PMI452Y|5|Quality is good, fitment is perfect, adjustability is good. Cheapest relocator I've seen and it's doing the trick so far.
B000C7QGVI|4|I purchased this at my local autozone and installed it on my 1996 Nissan 240sx and went in no problem. Looks nice. Time will tell if it will hold up.
B010F6LM46|2|Disappointing colors in the ink. Even though the thickness and quality of the backing is there I have had it on the car for a week and it's already fading pretty bad.
B0079Q3I70|5|A really nice decal!  It looks great and it shipped right away. Thanks!
B007ZU4L6M|5|Great exhaust! Surpass all my expectations!
B00412YT8W|5|Bought this for my 2006 Xterra after the original motor started having issues. I was a little hesitant on tearing my door apart but after watching one video on YouTube, I was sure I could do it myself. Much cheaper than at any auto part store in my area. Install was super easy with a flat blade screwdriver and a 10mm socket. Total install took about 30 minutes. I am just kicking myself for not doing it sooner.
B003BZKCRM|4|Fits 2007 Nissan Xterra rear window.  And the installation is super easy.  So far, it has held up well (6 months).  I will definitely buy again when the time comes.<br /><br />Packaging was fine.  A box in a box, so not the most economical .  Arrived on time and I am extremely satisfied.
B008CE0TN4|4|This product is pretty well made. I cannot say that it is top of the line, best of breed but it did meet my expectations. Assembly instruction were miserable. Keep the pictures available or you'll never get it together.<br />Overall I am pleased with the purchase though the much more expensive version that has the easily adjustable ball height would be a real nice option.
B00BTL9ZOG|1|I bought these thinking what a great bargain, nope, all but 2 of these have quit working and only had them for 6 months. First ones starting failing in only 3 months.
B00BLPVGJM|5|Great lock that you can vary locations and easily remove
B0017KHTS8|5|They work and seem brighter than the Stock Dodge Bulbs.
B00NVE5OMQ|5|The bracket fits perfectly on my 2015 Golf TDI
B0012FKF9S|5|Great sturdy product.
B001EP2904|5|Fits well.  Worth buying.  I have a Curt hitch on my 2014 Mercedes e350 wagon.
B007Q4MOGG|5|Less expensive than buying from Mazda direct. Solid. Fits perfectly. Great!!
B00R587N4G|1|the adhesive is not of good quality and with the cold day  appear blue
B003IS3HV0|5|Very rich
B00DP4BHL4|5|Just installed it yesterday.  Took 5 minutes.  Fit, looks perfect!
B0006303QC|5|best filters in my opinion, got them on all mowers, 4 wheeler and golf cart
B000CB42CE|5|These are excellent Shocks period. Used and abused and still going strong in my 93XE Pathfinder.
B0044B0ZEW|5|Perfect fit, no issues.
B0089XOHYU|5|Great oil
B00EC8Y4HG|5|Very pleased!
B00GM2D3IG|5|I saw these recommended on a forum and decided to purchase; I'm very happy I did. They put a nice finishing touch on my E90 M3. They're bright white without being overwhelming. No flickering, codes, etc. Very easy to install with the included legend. Be careful installing, as I blew a fuse for my trunk light which is also the air conditioner.
B00FSC5VFO|5|Works great!
B0041MNQMC|5|A perfect fit
B004GEN882|4|Looks good and definitely reasonable. It's just that it is made to fit 2002-2007 and 2002-2004 are slightly different than the 2005-2007(3/4 ton). Of coarse they fit the older style versus my style. But again, very reasonable and acceptable on a a 8 year old truck.
B002OM8TQE|3|Smells really good but don't last very long at all. Especially if you drive with your windows down sometimes like me. Probably 2 weeks at most.
B00BPZHFGQ|5|As advertised, great fit
B0009IBJE4|4|Not bad for the price
B00NGJEN5K|4|I have a 1998 Ford Expedition for which I bought this tent. The instruction are pretty good but make sure you practice putting it on before you use it camping. Make sure the ground is reasonably flat. After you lift it stake the corners temporarily while you line up the vehicle with the opening. That way you can adjust the position of the tent behind the hatch. It has to be lined up so it will snug up when you attach it to the vehicle. My Expedition has the roof rack and found that using the included extention straps and attaching to the most forward area on the rack works great. Quality is excellent. Seams are sealed. Zip up window covers are a plus. Other tents I researched just have the mesh windows and utilize the rain fly for privacy. Fits great. Can be attached by one person but it's hard to do. Also, throw the stakes out that they furnish and get a set of heavy duty ones.
B001CA9LSE|4|Goood
B001R1SXGY|1|Adjustments do not work  these lights are for cosmetics only
B0036QTHXG|3|OK
B00342XWVK|5|love it
B00AW020SS|5|just right
B008G3KK6C|2|It is not an exact fit. I had to modify slightly. Get a hacksaw...  The mounting holes were correct. It does not sit perfectly against the door post... Black silicone used to seal the gap. Unable to adjust for proper view... Planning on loosening the three screws on the bottom to hopefully change the angle of the mirror to the mount system... Maybe this will work....
B00XAX4B9A|4|very easy to use.
B00GK9XU34|5|Perfect color match. Popped right into place.
B004UR30BK|5|Bike rack as described shipping time was good.
B00CY12QF0|5|Quick easy to do business with Works great
B00G27F03C|5|As described
B005H7D82I|5|Silly name for an engine mount but it fit and is working perfectly.
B00SSMOS5U|5|Fits perfectly on my 2015 Subaru Outback and reflects heat as intended thus lowering the temperature in the car. Got to have one in the summer! I would opt for one especially fitted for your vehicle instead of the generic cheaper models.  This was half the cost of a deflector sold by Subaru.
B00521K7IC|5|The shiz nit
B004AIHKT2|5|I bought this item to replace the OEM Shift Interlock Latch (Pink thingy) on my 2007 Chrysler 300 Touring sedan, which had broken, and locked the gear shifter in &#34;P&#34;ark.  It was a good price, and much sturdier than the OEM part I replaced.  I'm not mechanically inclined, but was motivated to do the job myself after receiving a ~500 dollar quote from the dealer to repair the issue.  I watch a couple of YouTube videos that were relavent to the job, then went about doing it.  It took me about 90 minutes to complete the job (45 minutes of prep work; gathering tools and watching videos).  The part works fine, the ole gal (my car) is back on the road.  One note, I did use some CRC White Lithium grease to lube the latch before installing it.
B000CKGAV6|5|I replaced the stock light housing as they were very cloudy so up-graded to these bulbs at the same time. Can see much better now!!
B00K1C1WC2|5|They work as described.
B00480BWCI|4|I like em.
B00029KAPY|5|simple and straightforward. I got the correct diameter and baseball stitched it on so it looks like a professional did it
B00KYHLDUA|3|Would've been nice to know that you probably shouldn't use this on painted surfaces.  I was re-painting my bike, sanded everything down and decided to give this prep a try on my sanded down layer of paint; it actually warped the paint and then I had to resend it all out again and try to make everything even once again.  So I went back to just using plain old rubbing alcohol.
B004BHZR1A|1|got two of these awhile ago and just recently got around to attaching them (its been months otherwise i would ask for a refund). i had a different one of the same emblem, by a different company, on there before, but got these because they are bigger and more noticeable. the one i had before was on my car for over a year and it looked almost the same as when i got it when i toke it off, despite multiple car washes and even one accident.<br /><br />when i got these i noticed right away it was cheap plastic, and after only a few weeks a lot of the paint has flaked off. and before you ask - no i have not even taken it through a car wash since i put it on, but even if i had, the paint should not be flaking off like that. it looks as cheap as it costs i guess. will be looking for a new emblem in metal from another buyer.
B00HZH66ZY|1|Wont work with 2015 Jeep Wrangler Jeep Unlimited, Jeep rewrote the computer program for the 2015 models and the tuner companies haven't written a tuner that will work with the 2015. This unit will work for 2014 and below, just not the 2015 model.<br /> Only tuner available for 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited is the Diablo tuner. These tuners cost around $1,000.00 and you need a new PCM from them, so thats your only option. The Diablo tuner is not carb legal in California, so no tuner for us folks here in California at the present time.
B0050ZADCA|5|Great product, and FAST delivery through Amazon! I had an issue with one of the bulbs being burned out/defective, and one call to customer service is all it took for them to deliver a new bulb the following day.  This is the 4th set of HID's I've installed on different vehicles, and all I can say is this about the 'Kelvin' lighting number. My BMW has HID&#34;s, and these are rated at 4300k..................and they are WHITE.................I've found that the 5000k bulbs have a 'bluish' tint which I do not care for. That is the only 'complaint' I have, and this is really not a product issue at all.  I've got 4300k HID's on an Outback Wagon, and this the color I will go with in future on any other vehicles I put them on.  Also......VERY easy installation on all vehicles, with only a slight modification to the headlight retainer/cap, but this was remedied in less than 10 minutes.
B00KGSCTYG|5|Great workmanship:)
B000Q71N8K|1|Did Not cool! Returned it for refund
B0002F66DI|5|This fits my 225-75/16 spare tire on my motorhome.  I just installed it so don't know how long it will last. My motorhome sits outside with the spare tire and cover facing to the South usually.  These covers only seem to last about 1 year or so....they start to yellow and then eventually the top portion drys out and then cracks.  The price on this one was very reasonable so hopefully it will at least last the year.
B00TF8G110|4|VERY NICE COVER AND LOOK GOOD
B00NACC80K|5|Great !! Cheapest out there
B00BSGJQ4Q|5|Very happy with the product and with the results!!!
B00W5UCY9I|4|Works great and easy to reach from back seat.
B00D9C2CDO|5|Perfect size for blankets, pic nic chairs, sleeping tents,<br />hammacks, and so on.
B00FYL0H1W|5|Come and getcha some Isis
B00KN6L8G6|2|I had to return this item, did not fit my vehicle although they said it would. I had no problem getting a refund however I was disappointed because they said it would fit my car. The bulbs probably work excellent but I can't really verify it so two stars for saying they fit a 2014 Nissan Maxima.
B00GK9P0OQ|4|This is my second one bought and they are extremely bright and really can't be beat for the price
B008KZKHZ0|4|I purchased these matts for about $45 less than the dealer was charging. They are an original factory accessory. I did notice they are not as plush as they once were and feel more cheaply made. They do fit well and look nice.
B005FNKFY8|5|Works great. Very convenient, nice design. One less key on my key ring.
B0002JMUY8|5|Price was right for my oil filter
B00GEBYS20|5|Perfect fit...  was quoted $200+ for part not including labor to replace regulator.  This is totally unnecessary, everything worked the only problem was the broken plastic part.  If you are reading this you know exactly what I mean.  Highly recommend this for DIY repair.
B00PTFNNWS|3|It is starting to come open. We may need to get electrical tape to keep it together. Can we get a refund?
B005U9JGJ2|4|Works great, looks good. Definitely helps to deflect the heat. It was smaller than I expected, but it still covers 90% of the windshield, and I use the visors to keep it in place. I have a Ford Escape. I've only had it 2 months, but so far, so good.
B000F5QSTC|5|easy to use, my car's side view mirror glass hasn't fallen off
B000A0CASK|5|Great
B00E5OUOCQ|5|I have both the classic accordion style sunshade and this particular one. This one is light weight, can fold into a small circle, and it works. The convenience of being able to be folded quickly and able to deploy quickly makes this worth it. Fits a 2008 Honda Accord LX 4cyl.
B001NYE26U|5|Great product and fast shipping
B00CZEZNGU|5|I bought this to replace a broken light in my trailer.  It's bright, I like the fact that you can turn each side of the light on individually, and it provides better light than the retrofit LED bulbs I'd used before.  I'm replacing all of the lights in my trailer with these.
B0042ZIT7U|5|Wife is very happy with it.
B00496F0GK|5|happy w/purchase
B0002F668I|5|A must have on certain motorcycles.  High quality, carry one with me at all times.
B007PJPYXM|5|I love it
B000CIK6F4|5|This is what I needed to clean my engine.
B007KPX1PE|5|Very well made. It arrived earlier than expected and used to replace '99 springer side mount cowbell style horn. Able to mount easily, sounds loud and looks Great!
B000HEBR3I|4|Seems to pump as advertised.
B007XS3V9Y|5|They work!
B00CWRDQEQ|4|The tool looks well made. Just wish it came with instructions. I think I figured it out.
B00BFE4OPC|4|Working great so far.
B00XEH89EK|5|I unboxed the Sena 10c the night before a 700 mile ride this weekend. Amazing! This headset and camera are easy to learn. Combined with the Waze app yapping in my ear made for a safe and easy ride into new unfamiliar areas.
B000E9C21M|4|guuud
B0030GCF2W|3|the actual part fit and is working well,however i ordered two bushings and got one correct part and one incorrect part both labeled with correct part number, also says in the ad that grease is included that did not happen either.I need to get the other bushing to finish my repair,but its been over two weeks since my return was confirmed and way past the 2-3 days my account should have been refunded.Bottom line if i could have gotten this from a local store i would have,it was not worth the hassle
B00L4E95UW|5|Had to get a locksmith to program it but money well spent. A lot cheaper than the dealership
B002OUQI3W|3|OKAY QUALITY
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Great product at a great price!
B002MY7TFQ|5|Perfect
B007NZ5YZ6|4|Actually like the finish better than the original.  Not a perfect fit but close enough.
B0001YIUZC|5|Work well to raise and lower an attic stairs that I made out of two by six.
B00PTQOF4W|5|Great thanks
B000IYPSC8|5|Perfect fit and seem to be good solid fans.
B00KWDN5NO|1|Air Filter does not fit in my 2014 Lexus IS 350 (Base).  It is about an inch short on one side and an inch too long on the other side.  The part number matches the part number in the Lexus parts catalog...so I am not sure why this filter doesn't fit.
B00DSD4SPE|5|It's a sticker... It sticks... It is err and ignignok. What more do you want? Seriously though, I thought it was one of those stickers that you put on glass and can be removed, but it's a regular sticky one.
B0006GF5SK|5|these work great, no odor at all
B00CITW3YW|5|The liners seem to be very durable.  Everything fit perfectly.  I had ordered the weathertech brand for my car but cancelled the order when I stumbled upon these through Amazon.  They were almost half the price and made in the USA as well.  Very happy with purchase.
B00KTI7DZS|1|Worked great for about a month. About a week ago it started acting like the battery was dying and so I replaced it last night and reprogrammed it and it still doesn't work unless you hold it right next to the door.
B007IVSMTA|5|I have a 2013 CX-5 Grand Touring and could not believe how hard it was to find a sunshade in store that fit my windshield (sorry AutoZone for all the returns!).  I have the the rearview sensor on my car but purchased the &#34;without rearview sensor&#34; model based on reviews - good thing, too!  The shade fits the length & height of the window perfectly, and there is quite a generous dip under the rearview mirror.  Plenty of room for the monitor next to it.  It is a little cumbersome to roll up, but if you want one that is going to fit your rather large windshield, it's going to be a pain no matter what.  Honestly, it only took a few tries to get the hang of rolling it back up.  And above all else - it works!!
B00BG1EVQQ|5|it has everything you need in a keychain holder
B00317952S|5|This is a big improvement to just a speedometer but it is not a replacement of the original equipment.  Fairly easy to install took about ~ 3 hrs on my Suzuki DR650SE.  Been off road and it has held up great!.  Very nice seeing the RPM and the alerts.  The 650 is air cooled so the temperature is measured at the spark plug.  This is an odd place to measure temp. and the OEM does not supply temp data for that location.  The numbers get as high as 210-380 degrees.  Check on the web that is not unusual but hard to see the usefulness of the data (what too hot?).  The temp. wire in very short and will likely remove the feature next time I change the plugs.  The rest of functionality works great, displays easy to read.  Would have liked to have more trip odometers, it comes with just one.  The speedometer on the bike was off by at leas 10%., you can dial the Vapor to be spot on.  One note: the bracket they recommend is only if you remove the old speedometer.  It works fine but had to re- drill holes to avoid cables and get a better view.  Set the gauge back, easy to see but harder to hit the buttons.  The vapor comes with a handle bar mount that gives you a good view, easier to install and you can leave the old gauge alone.  I went the  bracket route but may go back.<br />One big positive, called the support line and they had a real person answer the phone, who was helpful.
B00TOLYU48|5|Got 3 days before vacation. Drove 1500 miles round trip and never had a problem. I took a risk with zero reviews and am glad I did. Very sturdy and little shake. Excellent price for hitch rack. Holds 3 bikes cozy. Love that it comes with lock so no extra purchase required. Even includes straps to tie wheels. Love that it leans so can get in back door and folds down if you want to keep it on though its light and easy to remove. We love it!!
B002969D4C|1|I have bought two cans of the Hemi orange with ceramic additive. I find that the paint is very thin. It has few solids, coverage is very poor. Also the paint does not adhere. The paint flakes off with very little touch.
B009GO6CYO|4|Installed and worked as expected.
B000C9C8EK|5|fits ok
B00KL3ALGO|5|Perfect - easy and effective. Wish I had these prior to others that broke.
B00066UKMG|5|Perfect for my Jeep Grand Cherokee 1995
B00KV6HKL0|5|Perfect fit on instrument panel and gives it an awesome look.
B003ZOLRSM|5|Exactly as advertised! Great purchase.
B00ICSP24Q|4|Be cautious about drilling holes in the trunk lid.  Watch out for whatever may be on the underside.  Start small and work your way larger if you are unsure of the size of the holes.  Instructions and templates did not come with mine.<br />Installation was easy.  Covered trunk with thin cardboard (newspaper will work too).  Measured and marked center-line front to back and side to side with a marker.  Centered the rack and marked the drill holes.  Drilled out the holes.  The one that the wires feed through is a little larger than the others.  Save yourself some pain and take the rubber washers that come with the rack, run up to your favorite hardware store (Ace normally has the most variety) and find some better washers or o-rings (1 needs to be larger than the other 3 but they are all the same size in the package.  I used the originals but trying to get the larger bolt through was a pain.  I most likely will take things apart this week and replace with better washers.  You are guaranteeing leaks into the trunk if you skimp here.<br /><br />The rack looks good overall.  Had on it on the bike for about 2 months now.  Showing some signs of possible rust in corners.  I ride all of the time and just got home from a 800 mile round trip with a good portion in the rain.  I have strapped luggage, icebox and daughter's sax on the rack.  I have a Flag from ProPad that I attach to the rack.  Several buddies like the addition on my bike.  Wired it in with my brake lights - wiring colors matched so nothing to have to guess or experiment with.
B00W4B4ZPE|5|Received the uncut keys on the mail, really fast  took them to dealer and they cut them and programmed them, and they are working perfectly.
B008Y9K7WK|4|Old regulator went out. I ordered this one and aside from the fact the old one screwed in and this one had posts that required me to make a trip to the hardware store from some nuts it was a super easy install. window is working great again.
B00KTIQAZW|3|good price worked well
B00BFDJ6VK|5|Have not found aftermarket blade for this OEM product.
B003CGA6BC|5|Great Clutch Kit, easy Install... comes with pretty much everything you need!
B004LES8F0|5|Awesome
B000COBLKW|5|Great light! Very bright
B00Y5IDP46|3|I fitted the horn and discovered that is was too large. When the bike (Bonneville) goes over a bump in the road the front mud-guard rises up and hits it. I've since mounted it on my crash bar. Not ideal - but it works!
B00EF3SAJQ|5|Great product used for transporting my soft pontoon boat on my Ford Focus worked great.
B000F3RYGA|5|Works and fits great.
B0002U268W|5|This was used on the oxidized headlamps of vehicle that has spent its entire life in the Northeast. The plastic cleaner quickly removed almost all the film and residue, essentially everything but abrasions from sand, etc. I applied the product only once. I purchased on sale but it would be worth buying at regular retail--a little goes a very long way. This cleaner deserves a higher profile. And no, I'm not employed by the 3M marketing department (or any other 3M department).
B000G7AJUS|1|This product contains or produces a chemical known to cause birth defects, cancer or other reproductive harm.  The description says nothing about it but the sticker that is on it does.  No thanks.  I'll buy a different funnel.  Probably one that doesn't kill me or mangle my children.
B005FIUL8S|5|Starts my jetski quickly and is doing well so far!
B000AXYDKA|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B000CIT1CS|5|This was a great solution to a rounded off/rusted fitting on the fuel filter, it could not be removed (2004 monte carlo).<br />It comes with compression fittings, 30 in. of line & fitting on one end that screws into the filter.<br />Just an FYI...don't try bending/forming line by hand,  it will kink. Must use the clamp style tube bender for perfect bends without kinks (see photo).
B0016KFY0O|4|I put these on my boat trailer and have been to the lake several times no problems, they work great.
B0001UZUW2|3|I didn't expect wonders, and I didn't get them.  My son (9) has a lot of fun with this, but neither of us get very many flies. It's just more fun that a swatter but no more effective.
B001GEWBZG|4|crush sleeve was too long. May have ordered wrong kit, but everything else was correct.
B00MXZYU7O|5|Worked great!!!  Fast shipping!!
B008MQ7S40|5|2007 Sportster 883. The biggest issue I had was that I didn't have the &#34;Star&#34; shaped drives that Harley uses for the top mount, had to run down to Ace hardware store and buy some, twice because I didn't get the right size the first time. I noticed one of the mounts was welded slightly crooked, but that was not really noticeable unless you were examining it.  Like they say, there are no instructions, you have to take the horn off. I had no issues with fit because I could slide the top mount in between other things that were mounted there. Used the original bolts on top and the provided bolts on the bottom, which as said in other reviews you will want to &#34;pre-screw&#34; these in and out a few times to  remove the paint. So if you take away the time running back and forth to Ace hardware it was really not that difficult nor time consuming, Looks good and I've already managed to &#34;test&#34; it three times, so I know it holds up.
B00J8QGPVA|4|Perfect fit but didn't solve problem.  Igniter cables are likely cause.
B000BPTUB4|5|Perfect fit and reasonable price.
B00KS5JJ4A|5|Quality product does what it claims
B00N58VRYC|5|The best!
B00GM4WKJM|3|It is very large for the back of my Jeep Cherokee Sport and the edges are hard to get it to fit, it does cover everything but looks a little messy
B000C5CEKC|5|Fit perfectly, works just like it is supposed to....
B012VIJPB8|5|AAA+++
B001O0XMHS|5|Great deal - great pads.  Well so far haha.  They are quiet and they went on easily and they stop the car.
B0057FU52G|5|Perfect fir for 2002 Buick Lesabre w/ 3800, Got to my house a day early and works sweet. Easy install no trouble.
B004NNAHLC|5|Nice, very good....Thank You....!!!!!!!
B004HGY72K|5|Does not fit 2004 Outback wagon. Oops, my fault. Otherwise the tray is great.
B00VQWYMDM|4|I love these mirrors. They are a nice improvement over stock. They took maybe 1/2 hour to install.<br /><br />Pros:<br />They stick out about 5-6&#34; further than stock, so I can see around me much easier. The built in turn signals on the back of the mirror are a nice improvement.<br /><br />Cons:<br />They stick out further than stock, past the end of the handlebars on my Kawasaki Vulcan. I keep hitting the right one every time I park the bike in the shed because it's a tight fit. Keep this in mind when installing. Also, the arrow LEDs in the mirror face are not very bright. On a bright sunny day, nobody but you will see this set. The ones on the back are bright enough though. The wires are a bit short, so plan on extending them.
B0009IBJE4|5|good
B00HRSTJNW|1|Everything was great until the license tag leds burned up and also burned the sockets. The tag leds started flashing rapidly a couple of days after installation. When I investigated this I found the sockets and led on both sides of the tag displaying signs of overheating. Of the 5 leds per lamp most are burned out. I am now concerned that the interior leds might do the same and harm the interior of the vehicle. The only recourse is to remove them all and go back to the original incandescent lamps. It was a great idea and looked great but I'm not willing to take the risk of damaging the interior of the vehicle. Also there was no installation tool included as stated in the ad.
B0089VPI0E|5|This trailer hitch is a must if you want to put a bike rack on your car. I own a 2014 Prius C, and it seems like this model is built specifically for this car. It's easy to instal and comes with everything you need. If you're not handy you can even take it to your local U-Haul, and they instal it for $30.
B00VEMD7K8|5|good job
B002UC4TM6|5|They are red..
B00877SL2M|1|Last about a month bulbs started  flashing
B000F285EG|4|A must have for any HighLift Jack. I just wish this handle keeper would have come with the jack instead of a separate purchase.
B001FIDNGO|4|Worked well on my BMW 5-series. It needed a slip jaw wrench to set the button in place as fingers alone were not strong enough to engage the post. The little nib extends beyond the button but was easy to file off with a nail file.
B00OL4PPB0|5|Assemblies came in just as described and fit perfectly into the Plymouth Breeze.  Unit came with new headlight bulbs but had to use my existing blinker/parking light which wasn't a problem since they worked fine.  Installation in under 30 minutes.
B000IY8OBK|4|Works great
B00SH1SN6C|5|I have unfortunately had to use this a few times now, but it has worked well so far. I have been able to jump my car a few times in a row without much difficulty. The only annoyance has been that my car alarm likes to go off as power is restored. I plan on keeping it attached to the cigarette lighter charger in the trunk to make sure it is always ready to go. The flashlight and usb port are a nice touch as well.
B008P4ZJDG|5|Good product and fast shipping
B000KOR766|5|this thing save my day. Very strong. Once my Minn Kota fall into the river (my mistake), I was able to pull it out because THIS cable did't brake or disconnect from my battery. I got it because the cable from the Minn Kotta to the battery is very short and, if you are using the canoe alone, you should put the battery in front. So, I bought this cable. easy to connect, no problem at all. Again, very thankfull that I was able to recover my Minn Kota with this cable. All connections resisted the big pull with the motor on! (I was and still VERY surprise) and save the day.
B00EUUNJRM|5|Nice bright light. Great price
B0098WEIVS|5|I love it
B005EOMPFK|5|As advertised and a great deal.
B006CRT72W|5|Fast shipping and delivery.  Easy to program.  Works really well.
B00NWF61GC|4|Great price. Would have rated it a five but I had to take it to the dealer to have it activated, the instructions stated that I could do it myself if the VIN.# started with a 1 or a 4. My VIN.# started with a 1 but the driver information center never came up with a remote activation prompt.
B004P0ULUK|4|a lot brighter than expected work great just be sure to tighten the screws that hold the covers on
B0031G8GME|5|Before you have any shade-tree mechanic (or you yourself) cut into your car's wiring harness, do yourself a favor and get one of these!
B009LIKKAC|5|Niceeeeeeeeeeely
B00VNJ4W3S|1|The color red was like a pink color not even close to the red they show in the picture.. Had to paint it to to a red..
B0031794W4|5|I like it sound amazing
B0126YHORE|5|[[VIDEOID:484a31d9564cd2f6408dbc1420b055e4]] I have provided a video review that shows a before and after in the bulb change out on my Wife's Civic. I encourage you to watch it to see the results for yourself.<br /><br />I recently done a full conversion on my Tahoe to LED bulbs and I wanted to start on my wife's car. It is such a cleaner and more modern look. Not to mention how much better you can see with bright white lights vs the old halogen style brown yellow bulbs that come in most cars. An amazing difference. If you are still not sure on LED technology but you want to try some out then this is great place to start. They are cheap and provide a ton of light. Start with changing out your plate lights on your auto. You will see the difference right away. Then if you like it, like I did, move onto something else. I have replaced every single bulb in my Tahoe with LEDS...even the light lights in the power window switches..which was a pain but the payoff was amazing.<br /><br />These bulbs are a tad bit longer than standard bulbs so make sure you have plenty of room wherever you putting these. I ran into one place on my tahoe door lights where I needed a shorter bulb. So just make sure you have the room for them. ALSO PLEASE NOTE they do have a + and - so if your bulb doesn't work, flip it around in the socket. If the bulb itself is not defective that will fix your problem.<br /><br />These little KDL bulbs really kick out some light. They don't get very hot. They do produce some heat but you can still grab them..not like the old ones that I used a towel to remove so I didnt burn my hand. You have 4 sides with 9 leds on each side and 6 on the top. These could be used in a multitude of applications. Even our landscape lighting takes these 194 bulbs. by the way, I switched all of them to LED's too. Love it and the low voltage means I can run more lights off of my power pack. Either way you go, you wont go wrong with these lights.<br /><br />I am giving these KDL Car Lights Bulb T10 42 SMD 12V White 3528 LED 194 168- (pack of 2) a 5 star review. 10 stars if I could, they are bright!! No flickering as of yet but I will update my review if I have any issues.<br />If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the comments. I will respond. If you found my review helpful, let me know. Lets keep making better buying decisions together. Thank you and as always Be Safe & Happy Shopping!!<br />I received a sample product to test and evaluate. If anything changes during my usage, I will update my review.Lights Bulb T10 42 SMD 12V White 3528 LED 194 168- (pack of 2) a 5 star review. 10 stars if I could, they are bright!!

B007TG7HVI|2|In Iowa, these lasted one year.  They were installed on April of 2014, worked well for a while, but in April of 2015 they were streaking significantly.  By July 2015, they were leaving more streaks on the windshield than they were removing and had to be replaced.<br /><br />Given the price and reputation, I'd really expected these to last more than one year.
B0017K69MA|5|Works well!
B001KS86YS|5|Excellent replacement fit like the original.
B000KKKRTO|5|perfect! Exactly what I needed!
B005R21SH0|5|Works great, tight fit. Fast shipping with Prime
B00AMLQ6W8|5|Fit like a glove with perfect alignment to the existing mount points on the truck.  Full install took less than 30 minutes.
B00OZ0ZO16|3|LOUD. Like stupid loud. This pipe sounds awesome BUT its basically a straight pipe. Which makes the bike idle like garbage during a cold start even after resetting the bikes ECU. If you do decide to buy this buy ear plugs and a power commander and get your bike dynoed. Have since removed.
B00G3YYTP4|5|Perfect.  Easy to replace, switchgear feels like quality, all good!
B00DERDU44|5|Put a little spark back into you relationship with you and your auto, and these little gems are the perfect way to do just that.
B009DJJQ1I|5|My 318i had one issue when I purchased it in spring... The AC fan blower would constantly run full blast (unless turned completely off) and I had no temperature control - despite a response on the dash unit's digital screen....    Enter this AMAZING product! Fit perfectly and did the trick. Full control has been restored! AutoZone and mechanic quoted over $100 for just the part!! I installed myself after a little homework on YouTube... Took 15 minutes :)    Best $25 you'll ever spend on the Bimmer!
B008R0F71C|4|Great mask, but I had to make the nose area larger.
B000Q6UHQK|5|Good for my new British cars
B00COYNVKQ|5|great product, exceeded my expectations
B000E7YP7I|5|The most helpful organizer for groceries.  Very stable and solid!
B00NRV9LK4|5|This one is the best
B001N72FES|5|worked for my application on a jet ski, need to resize holes as expected, but viable option for my purposes
B007N3P9DA|5|Works as advertised.  Loud pops on slow tight turns, but from everything I've read, this is normal.  Big improvement in offroad performance.
B00074QUC6|5|Fixed my problems thanks.
B0041TUA1A|5|Great! fits as is, blends in perfect without painting. Very easy installation. Only thing is the mirror is zoomed in very close as far as the reflection view. Becomes a little difficult to determine distance at night time, but can take some getting used too.
B000C4087O|5|Fits perfectly on 2003 Pontiac vibe. The exposed nut makes it very easy to take off, especially if you don't have a lot of  hand strength.
B000JFHNQA|5|Great product works well
B001DRHMMS|5|Product was as advertised and at a meaningful cost savings to the OEM BMW part. Easy to install in my 2010 BMW 328i sedan.
B0011O2RYQ|5|Don't skimp on jack stands. Dad is in the auto business and has gone to a few funerals for guys that either decided &#34;one time&#34; to use a jack without jack stands or used a cheap set that failed. These are worth the money.
B00A195P82|5|Solid, fit my 1996 Ram 1500 perfectly. Thanks to extravagant use of corrosive road salt here in Ohio, the original shackle broke in two, resulting in spring hitting underside of truck bed accompanied by lots of noise. This shackle fit perfectly, and was easy to install. The HARD part was getting the remains of the OLD shackle off of the mounts.
B00D2QLEO0|5|Perfect for mid-large SUVS. Better quality than the junk in big box home centers. Just don't overdo it, this thing wont move 50 pounds of snow without breaking. No brush will though. Some people just don't know how to manage their expectations.
B0031I20EC|5|Very nice worked well
B000182F1S|5|Great
B00HE6CI58|5|These fit my 2004 Honda Accord LX 4cyl perfectly. I replaced my dome light and the reading lights. The light shines white (not the 6000k bluish hue). Pick this over the Philips brand if you were considering the alternative brands.
B00K2DU5C8|5|Delivered early!!!<br /><br />Love it
B00BD4SLV2|2|These seat covers are decent, nothing special.  I truly do not believe they are compatible with my car (2014 Toyota Camry).  They fit really tight & I had to rig it together to make them stay in place.
B004XONSJ4|5|easy install
B00E1ILM2M|5|Worked like a charm
B009436GDO|5|A machinist friend tipped me off to these pliers, and they're pretty darned useful.  The photos don't show that the jaws are about 5/16&#34; wide and they open about the same amount.  Regular pliers close on an object while still in a &#34;V&#34; shape.  These jaws close parallel -- more like having a small wrench that closes to any size by squeezing the handle.  I can see all sorts of uses for these, but gunsmithing and musical instrument repair applications come immediately to mind.
B0026XV80K|4|The kit does work with the Novus polish.  I used it to polish the white PVC speaker enclosures of some old Advent /2 (in white).  It did work well.
B00O6MBT3A|1|These are not real!! The listing said Mopar part. Cheapest plastic. Red paint ran off the sides. Nothing like the picture!  Do not buy.
B00SO4K0AY|1|Product DOES NOT WORK !
B008A0YFLM|5|Works fine with CX-9. Don't think it would work with a CX-5.
B00J4TW6ZA|4|If gets the job done thanks for the fun on a 50cc scooter
B000GU293U|5|fits and works great
B000CIQ9TQ|4|Competition Cams 4933 Top Dead Center Stop works well for what i wanted to do, nice and well made.
B009FUFCDQ|5|love it
B0000BVELA|5|Much better then maguires
B00BLS697I|4|There was no picture of the back so I assumed Rainbow Dash was on both sides because there's two pictures of the same thing, but unfortunately the back is just flat and blue. Great quality though.
B00KVO4RZY|5|Exactly as advertised.  Will work well on softer surfaces. Easy to store.
B00E1D1GY6|1|Do you people want to die? Do you want to get in a car accident? Do you want to also kill innocent people? Why the hell would you buy this product???
B0091OE6K6|4|It works really well but it fell off somewhere and I no longer have it so there is the downside
B000BSWEHS|4|Works like a champ with decent illumination
B001HY15Z2|5|I bought my last one of these steering wheel covers at a local auto parts store a very long time ago; when I recently sold my car and bought a new one, I went looking for a new one for the new car.  Apparently, none of the auto parts stores in my city carry them anymore - but I found this one on Amazon!  I love it.  It wears like iron and provides a nice, nubbly grip.  Even in black, my steering wheel doesn't get too hot to handle in the summer sun.  I'm tempted to buy another as a spare, but the way the last one wore, I may not need to buy another one until I get my next new car (I kept the other one 12 years)!
B005GXNOB8|4|Keychain is a described
B000COWU7A|5|Works and sounds great on my 1996 Jeep Cherokee Sport I6. Shorter than the stock muffler, but has a great deep sound. There is a little highway drone, but not too bad, and only around 2400rpm+
B00B4ZRTV8|5|Works well.
B00VK4H33M|1|Purchased these for our 2015 JK Sport with high expectations based on reviews of the 11640.10 product version - as I understand it these are slightly wider (come out horizontally slightly from the vehicle's body), unfortunately however I returned them as soon as I opened the box.  For those familiar with Rugged Ridge products, please chime in, but in my humble opinion these are not even close to adequate quality.  Firstly and main reason relates to the forming mold thickness for the actual product / fenders - these aren't even close to the same thickness as the OEM fenders let alone what one would expect for the price paid - said another way they are very flimsy and likely will not stand the test of time.  Secondly there were several mold imperfections, almost like slight folds / thickness variations - not a huge deal but frankly shouldn't be there.  Finally you need to drill the vehicle's body which in and of itself isn't a huge issue but they don't give you any sort of primer or paint to do it?  WTF?  I would pass on this one.
B008ECCBFS|5|Perfect fit great quality
B008NE8J0I|5|Fits the remote pretty well. No issues.
B007EGH7PY|5|Replaced my cracked and broken ones. Quality product
B004CZ4QOU|5|The precision is awesome
B002P2TWIM|5|Fit my trailer perfectly and rolls very smoothly.
B00K63FST4|5|worked great. the key attaching anchor had pulled out of the old one and was lost.
B00AGRTHVA|5|Fits, works, reasonable price
B000KHZ2HE|5|You can never go wrong with Vim tools
B000CP8DKC|5|Decided to start up my old boat. It had been sitting for 10 years. This is a great tool for my tool box. I would imagine anyone who has let a engine sit up for any length of time would benefit from having the oil pump prime the system and put a nice layer of protective oil on all the bearings. Works as advertised and I would recommend.
B006NES8XS|5|So perfect I ordered another set!
B000L7QZ0Q|3|Bottom-lie up front: If you are an occasional user of mild/light steels or metals, this kit is okay.  If you are dealing with Stainless Steel tubing, this is NOT what you want.<br /><br />I bought this tool to repair a blown-out brake line on my 14 year-old truck.  I also purchased a spool of zinc-coated steel tubing and fittings to do the job. Anyhow, I was able to make decent flares with the mild-steel tubing.  One problem though is that when you gronk the clamp down onto the tubing, the two halves of the clamp piece are not exactly lined up perfect, which can affect the accuracy of the flare.  After completing the repair, I ordered SS replacement (pre-bent) lines for the whole truck.  One of the lines simply would not feed through the little nooks and crannies in one piece so I decided I would cut it at a convenient spot, feed it through, then splice the ends together with my flaring tool.  The flare tool did not work, and after removing the tubing from the clamp I realized that the SS tubing flattened all of the gnurling on the clamp such that it will no no longer hold even mild-steel tubing tightly to make flares.  So now the clamp is trash, at least for 1/4' tubing.  I will note that the box does say inside (very small print) that it is for mild/light metals, so it is pretty much my fault.  Otherwise, this is a pretty decnt tool.  It got me out of a jam, so I was pretty happy, just perturbed that it wasn't strong enough to do stainless.
B005EJJN28|5|Awesome, had it installed on my Lexus ct200h at Uhaul
B0031I4HKW|5|Worked as expected
B006X8BATI|4|Took 5 minutes to install. Threw the instructions away when I opened the box. pretty straight forward...
B00GGX5TGA|5|This seat fit just like the original.
B00KHUQDSG|4|Love the steering wheel cover! It was a little tough initially to get the cover onto my steering wheel, but I eventually got it on and I love it.
B002XYZYBG|5|EVRY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCE
B00JXNK1Z4|5|the seat covers & other items are very good quality. my rear seat covers are a little difficult to get on, for me, but i love them.
B005HNYKEW|5|Easy to install....works as it should.
B00471JQJE|1|didn't fit into the proper compartment or socket, too tight.
B00RAS2YN6|5|very bright during the day and night. just what I was looking for. thanks
B007QC3HP0|5|Worked perfect.
B000LG5O2W|4|Good
B007Y3N1WK|5|Great product and fast shipping
B000A0CALC|5|Exact replacement for less money.
B002303H5A|5|They light up.
B001CA36VW|5|Exact replacement for less money.
B00IO3KQPO|5|It doesn't include lower back support, if you don't already have it in your car's seat. But it is an extremely comfortable solution.
B00BGSFJUG|5|Fuel lubricant works as it should.
B004JSJPPU|3|Not art all less dust as stated - more dust than conventional pads.
B000QI9EQM|5|The part was exactly how it was described.
B000BO8Z9I|5|Great product for keeping your expensive metal work protected on your boat!
B00I93F3RU|2|I was hoping to have the plate tagged ' There was no place to put anything you may have wanted the plate to say while ordering.
B00CO2QQQ4|4|Appear good quality
B00PJPHEBO|5|Perfect. Does what it says.
B001EU3732|5|just as described
B00CC3XPZK|5|The vets at the VFW and the Legion love them.
B010EYQ60E|4|Nice Trio
B007V2BSG0|5|Perfect fit 2010 Tundra DC. Protects the dash from the heat and UV. Not the cheapest but worth it!
B00YI3IGA6|4|It perfectly fits my car windows (bmw 3 series). It's very neat. It works really well. However, my husband said the visibility is an issue at night time. But it's fine for us because we remove it at night time.
B0042Z307E|5|It was exactly what we needed.
B004SL8568|5|Better than toyota red
B00J0JHQ3G|5|Just what I needed, thanks, Bob.
B00B11SVEY|5|Moves my mountain cat 800 around very well. I could have made a better one but not for the price.
B00GXBEUEW|3|The lights work great and installation was easy. The 3 stars are for the lack of information in the original product description. My car is the sport wagon, which has a different number of lights and a slightly different package would be required. The ad did not specify which 3-series the lamp package would fit. I was therefore short lamps and needed two additional lamps. So just make sure you count the number of lamps you need before ordering.
B00ELQ5RPW|5|I installed them myself
B0006H938M|5|Very good
B00X8SVVQI|5|Works great on both my ipad and Galaxy s5.
B00DVG721A|5|My husband loved this for his bike
B003BL1H0M|5|My last light bar lasted about ten years so I replaced it with this unit.  Wow!  The lights are much brighter and very cool looking at night.  The white back up blast was the icing on the cake.  Very cool and great quality.  This is not one of the cheap led tape strips with 3M adhesive.  This is a well made plastic strip that is solid and can be screwed on or use double sided tape.
B00S1Z7Q1C|5|These gauges work great for my application of monitoring well pump pressure. No complaints.
B00LH05Q88|5|This is a solid, high-quality tool. It's frustrating that Toyota chose to make it necessary to have a specific tool to do a simple oil change, but this is a good, inexpensive solution. Made the job easy. Works perfectly on the 2GR-FE motor.
B000M5Y720|5|Incredibly bright
B000CIPUR8|5|I added this to my 1989 Volkswagon Vanagon and it almost immediately ran smoother and had more pep and lo and behold, I DID pass emissions with very low numbers. My van has always passed with low numbers, so I can't 100% attribute it to this product, but it sure didn't hurt. And who knows...I may have failed had I not added this stuff.
B000DELVU6|5|4seaons parts always work good and fit right and this one was made in the USA
B00GUHQUV0|5|Great price!
B005RNF6OA|1|Is this thing suppose to be shaped like a bowl? So disappointed when I saw it...
B00LIXEWXO|4|Just a single sheet of sand Material.  spongy and very durable
B00BD3G2IC|5|Good shocks.  Can't beat Bilstein for the 2007 Grand Cherokee
B002MY6ZZG|5|Works great on my winch cable.  Not to hard to install.
B000GZLUBM|5|Really nice items one of the better improvement I've made to my Goldwing
B00CCIM1YQ|4|If nothing else this lock truly looks like it will protect your stuff. It is huge and heavy, which is a deterrent to thieves, but a burden to carry around while riding. My lock came in the mail kind of beat up, but that's acceptable since I'll be using it outside anyway. I was looking for a heavy duty lock and I'm satisfied with this one. I'm using it as a U-Lock for my new bike.
B00G0OM2BK|4|Worked as expected. I discovered a crack in my 13 year old Air Flow tube and had this on my doorstep in two days. Fits a 2003 Honda Accord EX V6. Thanks Amazon.
B00S8DIOU4|5|What I like about this Splash guards is the size ,there just right ,not to big and clumsy . They do a good job keeping dirt off my Sorento. &#34; perfect&#34;
B004NKUEMC|5|fit like it should
B000EPVYOW|5|The original supports were no longer working in my 2004 VW Beetle. These supports were very easy to install and have been working well since I installed them. I'm glad these were available on Amazon.
B00JH23PUO|2|Like the other commenter - the nuts for the battery are too big to fit.  I am returning for a refund.  Useless to me as supplied as I don't have time to mess around with this low of quality control.
B00BITHS3E|5|Plugged it in and works perfectly so far.<br />Note: Look up youtube videos and installation does not require removing the door panel.
B000F20KWQ|5|Perfect fit - could not have asked for a better product; just what a 6 year old Saab needed!
B0009JRVWC|5|Just as described.
B001UFRV7O|5|As advertised, I would recommend to anyone.
B002Y2NYUK|5|Great product. Super sticky
B00FP2CV2I|5|Excellent quality.  Fast shipping.  Fair price.
B00DJ5KEF4|5|This is a little jewel of an item. I have a battery tender on my Yamaha XT600 and it works fantastic to charge my GoPro while in transit and my phone (Note 4) as well. Can't do them at the same time but that's not an issue. I love this thing. Very pleased.
B00I5BAUCE|5|Yes it was perfect.
B002E5AQAI|1|Made in Taiwan. Only lasted 1 week before the motor burned out.
B00XZ9MXQM|4|Programmed right away with easy to follow instructions.  Looks just like the one that quit working.  I didn't replace it earlier because dealership wanted to charge over $150 plus programming!!  Thank you so much!!  Trunk button doesn't work.
B001LHVOVK|5|works like it should
B0007IMBIO|4|Seems to work fine.  However a spray bottle would be better
B001NZ0SP8|1|Amazon Rating 1-STAR not the part. Check Amazon fit listings, they are frequently incorrect. In this case Amazon says this doesn't fit a 2011 Ford Escape Limited. Ford says it fits all 2011 Ford Escapes regardless of trim level.
B00C42T9HW|5|Great price, Great product
B00L3LLG3A|5|Purchased as an extra set of key for my 2014 Ford F250 Super Duty. Items arrived on-time and work like my original keys for the truck.
B00E3VVLE6|5|Quick shipping, worked great on auxillary fuel tank.  Also got an electric solenoid and hooked it up to a switch.  Now I fuel up driving down the road.
B001GMX8TG|5|Delivered fast, plug and go installation on 2005 Grand Cherokee in well under an hour.
B00K36EB74|5|This is a terrific item much better than the ones available at the auto parts store. But it should be the price is also higher than the auto parts store.
B008XM7MJ4|5|If you do your own tire rotations and have &#34;Mag&#34; style aluminum wheels, you need a proper 6 point deep socked to protect your wheels.  This is an excellent product.  Keep in your vehicle to remove a flat when on the road.  Also buy a good torque wrench to properly tighten the lug nuts when reinstalling a wheel.
B0002UQAM0|5|Inexpensive way to condition the 50 yr. old paint on my 1966 Jaguar Mark 10 per the suggestion of Mike Phillips, Autogeek.com's resident chief detailer.  After applying Meguiar's No. 7 by hand I successfully polished the finish by machine (Cyclo orbital) without degrading the non-clearcoat  paint.
B00A0Q4IBQ|4|Great exhaust and sounds great, easily installed by myself in my garage. My only complaint is the Chrome Tip yellowed withing a week of having it on, I wish I had the option of the Black Tip.
B00KTHZZ3Q|2|Pretty cheesy and the key doesn't come out at all. Very cheap feeling.
B00B5ZY07I|5|Just what the Doctor ordered.  Great product and service.
B00LG1YVMU|5|GOOD
B0053ZJ2C4|3|Isn't the decal used on actual police cars. Decided to plaster it onto my passenger airbag, looks just fine.
B00O6CVL7O|5|Perfect..perfect ..perfect. This thing is very heavy weight ..solid and doesn't look or feel cheap as other I have bought. I have had it all summer 2015 and keep my 4 wheeler outside and a battery tender hooked up and ..no water issues no problems....I am very happy.
B003CG9QFY|1|I keep getting sent the wrong item, says this is for 2013 JK but instructions say 07-11. Clearly does not look like the picture or fit like my friends
B00651C5SS|1|Terrible reception. Only receive 1 of the 12 stations I get with the OEM antenna.
B00CMWI5X8|5|Great product for the price. Don't pay Ford prices.
B008BMN8X0|1|Had less than a month
B00N3VYMJ8|5|Good quality, works well, difficult to attach.
B002E5BW74|5|Perfect size for 2008 Nissan Altima cabin air filter.
B004N1NLOE|5|It was the right part and on time.
B00EEKFT0S|4|As expected
B00ELBCSZY|2|These are okay, but certainly not heavy duty like the Dickies name would have you believe.  The side material is very thin, not sure they will hold up in a vehicle with active use.  I wouldn't buy them again, and would pay more for a product that was more durable.
B00D8IKH04|5|THANKS
B000E3FDXM|5|Fit great. Looks great. Great price!
B00JOY6U7U|5|Bit pricey, but works as intended. I bought this for my Viair Air Compressor which requires 15 amps. Don't skimp out on your car cables guys, you do not want to play around with 15 amps on flimsy cables. The cable is stiff, girthy, and looks like it will last a while. The clamps are plastic, but they seem durable as well. It's actually a good thing that the clamps are plastic to prevent them from shorting if they touch each other.
B004AQYXO4|4|You just never know when you may need this. Great to have available on the boat.
B00K7YI808|5|Much better than paying twice the price for OEM
B00M9MH85W|5|These Biltwell grips are far superior to the factory Harley grips that came on my Iron 883, and they were a breeze to install in about 5 min. using a razorblade and some WD40.  My factory grips had become sticky/gummy feeling and were making a mess as the rubber started to brake down.  These are a bit beefier than the factory grips, the textured pattern in the grip is aggressive but not so much that it will make your palms sore.  They seem to be made of a more durable rubber than the OE grips, I think they will hold up to the elements better... only time will tell.<br /><br />All in all I would definitely recommend these grips as an affordable replacement for anyone looking to swap out their factory Sportsters grips.
B00WOY33EA|5|This product is worth its weight in gold.... I've been without the use of the rear lift gate, both glass and door, on my Expedition for over a year because of the notoriously bad cable ends on all Ford door cables. I popped my rear door trim off, cut the coating off the cables and these billet ends fit perfectly!!! This repair took less then 30 minutes.. Much better fix then spending over $150 to buy new cables from Ford (a dealer only item). These aluminum ends fit snugly in the mounts too. THANKS for a great, affordable solution!!!!!!!! Highly recommend.
B002WHABJY|1|wrong side& still in the box.
B00429NKWK|5|Giving this 5 stars because my headlights look brand new.....for now. Just follow the instructions and don't rush through it. The whole process takes about 45-60 mins to complete both headlights. Mostly everything you need is in the package. Things YOU need to have is a water source (bucket of water with a rag or a hose) and a towel to dry it. I was a bit worried because all the way up until before the final step your headlights will look terrible. Completely hazy. The final step is applying the UV protection. From that title alone it makes it seems like &#34;ok now to protect these hazy lights apply this&#34;. But the UV protection clears everything up and my headlights look amazingly clear.<br /><br />Now a while back on another car a salesman at a gas station did a demonstration with his headlight restoring spray on my headlight and for the first day the headlights looked restored but a few days after that they returned to being hazy. This kit makes more sense then just a spray bottle but I will return here in a month or two and re-rate this product.<br /><br />FYI, make sure you read the instructions in it's entirety. After the final step you need to let the headlights remain untouched which includes keeping it out of the rain for 4-6 hours. They don't tell you that until the end so pick a day. With florida's crazy weather in the summer I was lucky to avoid rain.
B007369ZE6|5|very good product and time to deivering
B009EVOWPU|5|Excellent black twill top!!!  We didn't bother with instructions, just went online and pulled up YouTube video on how to install, piece of cake!!!  Step by step instruction on YouTube video, it was great.  Set up computer in our work area, pressed pause after each step, and it went together without any problems!!!  Approximately 2 1/2 hrs with two people, I would not have tried by my self you need the extra hands.  YouTube video on folding back either half of vehicle or all the way down.  It was great!  This is an excellent product very high quality!!!!<br /><br />The only complaint I have is the rear window has a permanent indention in middle of window.  I keep hoping it will smooth out but it hasn't and it's been 3 months.  So if this happens to you call immediately and they'll replace it for you, I should have called immediately so that's on me not them.
B007TKJMU8|5|Amazing works really well very easy to put on
B000182DVU|5|worked great
B00BYNJ7HY|5|Excellent quality, great price. Fit perfectly.
B0006N9N18|5|applied with no bubbles if you use a card to smooth it
B00G4DJUT4|4|Pretty good, a lot of stuff gets around the edges but thats to be expected.  They fit well otherwise, don't slide to much and look good if you even notice them unlike the weather tech and similar projects.
B00CVFIJ28|3|Pretty good fit. The star logo doesn't fit centered in the cutout hole like pictured, but it's pretty close. Also, the gold color chain attached is just gaudy and not to my taste. My main goal was to protect the key when it's in my pocket with other keys or if it gets dropped. This gets the job done and matches my car in the process.
B00BTGDRB8|5|I got this kit because it's far cheaper than buying the pads individually, even if you only need three. They work great, and the backing is strong. I've had them up to full speed on my Bosch D/A sander/polisher and they haven't come off, and peeling them off repeatedly hasn't damaged the Velcro backing yet either. Washing them isn't too bad, I prewash/soak in a sink first to get the bulk of the compound/polish/wax etc. off then throw them in the washing machine. I've washed them on hot, with a little TSP and detergent and had good results. The included cleaner is great for prewashing/soaking. Your car's finish might respond better to a microfiber pad for paint correction, so you may need to experiment. The red and black pads are great for wax and sealant application, respectively.
B006ZSUR5O|5|fit exactly,work well!!!!
B009AKCUCC|5|I ordered these and they came on time and in excellent condition. They are well-made and fit the area perfectly. I couldn't be more pleased with them. I've had them over six months now and they've worn well. Keep up the good work!
B000GZT1GI|5|Worked great just as described
B00W27ICWC|3|the holes in my bracket were star shaped instead of circular, which i would have preferred. also i was disappointed to find that I was mislead to believe this kit comes with the brakelight, since one is in the picture. i later found in the description that the light is not included, but i wish i knew prior
B00D9C2CDO|3|Worked good but it got a small rip in the front when the velcro in the front got pushed up from the wind. It would have been better if they had velcro sections around the entire bag.
B001GJ3E5C|5|Soft bristles makes it safe on upholstery
B00SGFZCTA|5|Great quality, simply love it!
B002ULLIGM|1|Cheap material
B000GU7HQ4|5|Good fit. Color match. Great parts.
B0031HNHQI|5|Fits nice and snug in my 2007 Jeep Patriot Sport 4x4
B00S5ES00K|5|Worked fabulously and fit my car great
B00JN64MF6|1|crappy, broke apart as soon as they were installed and pricey
B0051RHHIA|5|Great
B004I6RQFO|5|excellent product for price
B007DMWILM|5|Get it!
B00ISLA1WA|5|Perfect! fits good Mazda CX-3
B009E8AGDK|5|EASY INSTALL, WIFE VERY HAPPY, VERY NICE LOOKING ON BUICK ENCLAVE, THANKS STAN
B001GF7MT0|5|Quality product! Makes a big difference with keeping heat out
B00545NWY2|5|Used the blue one for southwest. Flew a total of 4 flights, each one a different length seat belt and needed anywhere from 2 to 9 inches of extension and this extension worked great. If flight crew even noticed they never said anything to me.
B009FIC5CY|5|Very nice
B00144B2QM|5|Fast shipping works great
B000G72UOQ|4|Purchased for 2012 Honda Fit...covers 95+% of window.  I install so that the rear view mirror is on the sunny side of the shades.  Once you figure out the trick, which I have not yet mastered, it is quicker to fold and more compact than regular accordion folding sunshades.  To close, I slide the two covers together,grasping each side along opposing edges (thumbs on top), and twist in opposite directions, left thumb back towards me and right thumb away...getting it from this point to folded in a flat circular shape is the hard part, and I really can't explain it because I still have issues, but usually a try or two gets me there.  We've also found that the panels slide back (open) nicely between our backseat windows and our car seats for complete sunblocks for our kids on long trips...huge bonus because they can't stand the sun on them when driving.
B00COYNXYK|5|Love it
B004A30WWY|5|When the supply valve started leaking in my motorhome I thought this was going to be a big deal. However this part made it an easy fix and I am ready for camping!
B0087NB088|4|Great Bluetooth addition to my motorcycle helmet. I bought the lesser model and returned it for this one. This model has much better speakers and better microphone. I couldn't even hear my music over the wind with the other model. It was worth the extra money to get this model. The feature to remove and take the Sena with you works great and leaves me feeling secure that it will not be stolen. I
B00IIM6DSU|5|What a great idea to be able to organize your front seat and then just pick it up and move it when someone needs to get in the front seat!  Thumbs up rating!
B001IZIFLC|5|We haven't had it too long, but so far we really like it.  Nice and heavy with lots of tie downs.  Good price too.
B0094BL7F8|1|Advertised to fit my car and wasn't even close. And the 4 self tapping screws that came with did not even come close to lining up with my car.  Company wouldn't even reply to my messages
B008YZGB7Y|5|Great helmet! Well worth the price,
B000COX484|4|Great price at the time, and arrived early.  No problems from these spark plugs at all.  Thank you.
B00X9IL5RW|3|Lights started to fade away within two weeks. Need a little improvement.
B000ZBHTAI|4|What a great wax!!  Very easy to apply and take off.  It has really held up well against the sun and rain and my car still looks great.
B00GY6TVA4|5|Great product works perfectly on my rzr 900 s
B00FGLS1JU|5|Excellent shield, works great and looks even better.  I've had compliments on how &#34;cool&#34; my helmet looks because of it.  It provides decent relief from the bright Colorado sun, and is still ok for night riding.  It's a bit dark, but you can still see at night.  Being the reflective iridium, it can be a little difficult to see the knobs to install on your helmet, but I knew this going in, and it looks great.  The only other complaint is that I swear bugs are attracted to it, never used to have so many splatters on my clear shield!  However, it is still a nice shield, and I like it much better than my clear one.
B006WY8NAC|5|Great fit
B00GULK44K|5|Works great!
B00BVL7LUY|5|Works Great
B00K35RSRA|1|It,s the wrong one for my truck ,it's still in the box my mechine used another one just like it & it kept braking the belt.Thanks
B005N76UCW|4|As described. Both wife and I like them.
B00BQN5SUW|5|Has  worked  well  over  more  than  a  year
B005HAYDR4|4|This product is all around good. The only thing is that there is many stitches and the canvas is in a way unraveling. Probably wouldn't buy again. I WOULD GO WITH THE MOPAR ONES INSTEAD
B000C2UJNO|5|Belt fit perfectly on my 2005 Honda Civic Hybrid.
B0076AUCX2|5|Worked for what I needed.
B00CNEQYNS|5|Replaced the factory OEM parts with no trouble at all. Vehicle involved is a 2006 Nissan XTerra.
B00DC4U772|5|Elegant.2014 2015 genuine Mitsubihi outlander knob shift
B006IYWRP8|5|Highly cost effective, great quality, and works well! I've had my bike on these for over a month while just doing maintenance on it and it's awesome, very sturdy.  Only slight issue is that there is surface rust in the treads of the bolt, i had to clean it out with some wd40 and a good rub down.
B000HBGKWE|1|Totally ineffective.  Don't waste your money, this product did not perform as advertised, glue was not effective in holding the tab in place even after cleaning contacts and waiting 24 hours to dry.  Save $10 and buy 2-3 Starbucks coffees, much more satisfying.
B009XIWRXI|5|This is a very awesome set up. Quality made and Fuel Tool has excellent customer service. Very pleased with this purchase.
B00MY3W4PA|5|All good!
B00GBVHPV4|4|Great product, much better than I thought when ordering. Very impressed. Would definitely order again!
B000CF1XAY|5|Replaced oxygen sensor in 2007 Toyota Sienna.  Fixed error code.
B00AQ47JYU|5|It worked fine I just installed it on 08/16/15. Thank you
B000BGJWA2|5|I installed 2 of these on my popup camper. Perfect match and easy to install. I recommend using RV caulk to seal it.
B00IO4EYMY|4|Great product!  No extras like Oil or Stop Leak, just good old R134a.  Fast shipping as well.
B002GQFF7O|5|Great stuff
B0055B121U|4|works well....no problems so far..
B00JF5LRN0|4|Well built and sturdy but cargo tray is not straight it stays slightly on an angle don't know if that is how it is but thought basket would be straighter
B008E951R6|5|Good quality build, bright as well.
B00392AAB0|1|Even after verifying with Fords web site and googles parts check it was still the wrong set of pads.
B000E4TQF2|5|Great fit and worked perfect
B00HZ54H66|4|Worked as advertised. I only gave 4 stars because the color is starting to bleach out, but not everything can be perfect
B007ED9JFS|5|he loves it
B008DRJA30|5|perfect
B003D32OK0|5|Just installed it last week, install was easy. I`ll give it a few months then write a new review.
B00802GIW4|5|Great People/Product. Will Recommend to others
B00NQD21AK|4|Good product for the price.
B00S9OM0AM|2|I sure did look great when I first put it on my truck, but in the Florida sun, the pink has faded.
B000BUU5Z4|5|Works like a charm.  Very happy with it.
B0106TA60S|5|Fit my Dodge Journey just fine...can't beat the price!
B002LGOI22|5|Arrived faster than estimated and fit perfectly on my 14 F150 extended cab. Installation was easy and fast.
B000HEBR3I|5|Makes it very easy to fill up the mowers now.
B000CIJUGK|5|Tires go on so much easier if you lube em up first!
B009AA9WVY|5|Great product!
B00ESLBQXM|4|Will this work on a 2005 Cadillac Cts
B00UVSI26A|4|Great mirrors.  Like the other reviews I disagree with the instructions.  They work much better on the LOWER inside corner.
B00P2K08J6|2|Awesome design but all plastic....curious to see how long it will last. Also once the bulb burns I don't believe it's an easy change....if it can be changed???
B000F0Z7NA|4|it fits.
B009D35UEQ|5|Works great received it very fast.
B000BUQOBS|5|Exactly as advertised! Great purchase.
B000N9RPKQ|5|Excellent product, US made
B00NPIUFMM|5|MORE LIKE 10 STARS!!! these aren't just bright, they are super bright; crazy bright... and the light goes everywhere, so backing up a yukon xl with tinted windows at night is a whole lot easier, plus loading up after unlocking the truck at night gives you ample amount of light to see, without killing the battery.<br />I bought them for my reverse and daytime running light, really happy with both. (interchangeable 4114 and 3157)
B00JMCCGDQ|4|ordered the wrong oil but will keep it for future use
B005SUV77W|4|It took a while to adjust the wheel chock to my motorcycle but once I did it worked as advertised...good value.
B00CVVUQ50|3|The emblems on the hood and trunk are fading and changing color but nice just wish they would last longer . only 2 moths old and looking for replacement hood and trunk emblems that will last
B00T3W3FB2|5|Handy and versatile is how I describe this tool.  Well made for the price and the case is nice.
B00NUDZKWW|5|This is a great sunshade. I have a Mini and it fits just fine. The flexibility of the materials allows me to get that shade in the window, just right!
B00ONHRM8O|1|For honda accord 2 doors ?
B006H34AE6|5|Works excellent at picking up the hair off of the car seat covers and carpeting.  You can easily pull the hair off of the brush.
B000BYAOBA|5|Works awesome in my VR4, very pleased and happy with the car!  Just keep in mind that these cables are a bit bigger in diameter compared to the stock so they will no longer fit into the little trays that are on the car!!
B0016KFVV6|5|Our Reese Towpower 44569 hitch is doing its job and was not a problem to install by our mechanic.
B00BLR16HM|5|Beautifully machined.  As others have mentioned the instructions are pretty vague.  I removed the left side air cleaner and crossover tube (Vulcan 1600 Classic).  I also removed the idle solenoids and reed valves, along w/ all the associated hoses (but taped off the wires rather than cutting them). There was no information on the filter element itself -- is it already oiled?  Does it need to be? I finally ASSUMED that it's oiled since it's purple-pink (like K&N oil) and not white.
B00K0VMXDQ|5|I had bought my wife the Scorpion a couple of weeks ago. she snorted, &#34;What's this? Why are you spending money on another gadget? We don't need it.&#34; I told her it was for her and reminded her that her battery had died three times in the last month (don't ask!). It sat on our kitchen for those two weeks until one morning I insisted she put it in her car.<br /><br />She has a three hour commute during the week and since our two youngest kids ride with her, I successfully appealed to her motherly instincts.<br /><br />I didn't have to wait long.  Yup. You guessed it. Her car was dead that morning. We took the Scorpion out of its small case, placed it on the battery terminals and started the car right up. My wife beamed and said, &#34;I can do that!&#34; She then placed it in a hiding place in the car which let me know she had been sold.  So now I have peace of mind, my wife can leave on the lights, and my son looks forward to the time he can test the adapter to charge his phone.<br /><br />I think I need to buy one for my car now.
B00LNIPBPW|1|These were on my truck for less than six weeks and the cover for the driver seat split all the way across. What a piece of junk.  Warranty is parts only, parts won't fix a seat cover that is ripped all the way across.
B00KJWW7GO|5|Perfect fit and easy to install.
B00NCBPSDS|5|Mounted easy to ranger 570 full size .Can take bumps and bangs
B001C89GV8|4|Would not buy it again did not perform good
B00KH3I4QC|5|Perfect.
B00B4W8B8G|4|Knob is not the same as original but work as advertised
B008D7PHGE|2|Spend $2 on a stainless hose clamp and accomplish the same thing.  Seems like someone is trying to skin the sheep here.
B005HJIZH4|4|Exactly what I was looking for; great, simple gift for the avid farmer or gardener.
B001C6JBY2|5|great srevice
B0009IQZH0|5|Excellent merchant. Items ordered came exactly as listed. ☺ 5 ★ STARS ★ Thanks!
B005CLMQ04|5|good product and fast shipping
B00CTLGSZO|5|I have really wanted a back up camera for my pick-up truck. I finally came across the Hopkins 50002. Very easy to install in less than 2 hours.<br />I have only had unit for a month, but it works great. I did not have to cut any wires since I had the standard 7 pin wiring hitch already on the truck. A big plus. I was warned about the wireless units giving problems.<br /> The warning indicator as you get close saved me last week from a mail truck that had just pulled up behind me in a parking lot in pouring rain. The mail truck was not there when I ran for the truck. I put my truck in reverse and the warning indicator saved me. Actually, the camera more than paid for itself right there.
B007LICSBS|5|looks great
B00DLMHTGC|5|Everything in the kit, works great.
B000GBD2L2|5|For a fraction of the OE cost ($55 for discount online infiniti stores and a heck of a lot more at the dealership), this was a perfect fit for my failed hood struts - just one of these was enough to keep the hood up on its own so two will be more than adequate - as other reviewer stated, plenty of pressure.  Had no issues with the installation.  All you need is a medium sized flat head screwdriver for the R&R.  Highly recommend someone hold the hood open because as soon as you remove one of the struts, your hood will slam shut.  I held it open standing on the side of the car and the hood resting on my head so it is possible for one person to do it - just be careful.  Overall, it was extremely easy to install with an exact OE fit, superb quality and it was very cost effective.  I only wish that the piston rod of the strut was colored black like the OE component but it is chrome which seems to be the default for strong arm.  I guess that's the only concession you will have to make for a generic aftermarket part.
B000C8TBYQ|5|fit perfect, shipped fast.
B003DJLFRM|5|fitsl like a glove thanks
B00SVEQPRE|5|Looks great on my truck. shipped  quickly. Very high quality vinyl decal. I'm very happy with this purchase.
B00KTIR1V4|5|Easy setup (Walmart even cut the key for free).  Works great.  Saves a fortune off getting a spare from the dealer.

B000WJYMNK|5|Perfect condition. Very detailed. Recommend for 2005 CBR F4i owners. Thanks.
B00QXLSEZI|5|Great quality and perfect fit.  Easy to put on.  Last set cost over $500 from other vendor and these totally out did those.
B000FW2MC2|5|Great product . Little Velcro and works like a charm
B000HS8NT0|4|Works for me.
B00V3VYHTK|5|I love it& very proud to wear it on my car!
B008CE0R40|5|Excellent product, made well and performs well.
B005G553MY|5|Great battery
B00QTESXJQ|5|They were just what we wanted, the quality is great.
B00BZAIFVA|5|Excellent gauges, good quality. Installation booklet is of perfect quality. Comes with everything you need.
B00LC65T98|2|Light is really good for working on equipment, but the battery only lasted eight months!
B0006HPEE4|3|Unfortunately, the rotor did not fit my distributor.
B00GLLW3AM|5|Perfect for seeing who might be trying to tailgate!
B00E0IK95O|5|If you read the description, you'll get the right equipment.  I have a 2006 DL650 and this setup worked perfectly.  I put it on before a 4,600 mile trip I just finished yesterday.
B00HWI3DFM|2|Quality was alright. Had to replace one of the upper ball joints a couple months after installing due to some play on the ball joint. Also the threading on the ball joint was bad. Never installed the rear camber because how cheap the bushings looked. I suggest you save your money and buy the higher end stuff. Hardrace, Blackworks, Eibach, Blox, Password:JDM, Buddy Club, Skunk2, Godspeed and TruHart are all really good brands to invest in. Don't make the same mistake I did.
B00LMHP89I|3|They are a great size, but I have to give them a three as the edges are so distorted that it was annoying so I removed them.
B001ETE3AY|3|Product fine, just not compatible with the distributor cap that went with it. Still waiting for a refund.
B00M9IJJKI|1|The SAE adapter DOES NOT fit into the battery. Do not buy this. I asked them about it and they didnt even have one in their posession to test fit the adapter into the battery.
B00C7Y8LGW|5|Item as expected and delivered very quickly.  Installation took about five minutes.
B009FC8C5Y|5|Better than expected!
B000GV6RQO|4|This is a good replacement for the stock GL1800 windscreen, as long as you don't mind that it's approximately two inches taller than the stock item--which is why I deducted a star. A replacement should be no shorter or taller than the stock item, without disclosing the difference to the purchaser.  Otherwise it looks like the stock windscreen. If I wanted to keep it, I knew I'd have to cut the excess height from the top of the shield. (I should add that I'm just short of 5'10&#34; and of fairly normal adult dimensions--so what's too tall for me will usually be too tall for others. On a motorcycle one should NEVER have to look THROUGH a windscreen. In rain, or at night in the rain, a too-tall windshield can be hazardous, as it can drastically interfere with visibility. These fairing/windshield combinations were designed with assistance of wind tunnels to insure air flow above the rider's helmet and provide an envelope of air above the top of the shield--and the stock shield does this well. This one, however needed help. I couldn't see over it at all.<br />But it's nerve-wracking to have to cut these down so I can see over the top--though that's exactly what I had to do. There are plenty of instructions on the Web to demonstrate how to use a hand-jigsaw cut one of these down to size, so I won't take the time here to explain it. But this would void the warranty too, so you should only do this with that knowledge.<br />However, I am pleased with the windscreen I now have, and would not hesitate to re-order if this one would were damaged. The stock windscreen from Honda is over $400--if you can find one.
B0002Q7YA6|1|Was not the right one for my vehicle
B001DC9Z8M|5|GREAT PRICE!! FOR QUALITY PRODUCT!!
B00VXNK490|5|just what i needed
B002Z60LLU|5|Was suprised that it is only 1 usually item like this are 2. Great product after ordering and receiving the 2nd was pleased
B00DZIB9GS|2|If you're looking for seriously cleaning power go get Sonax or another wheel cleaner. This wheel cleaner is weak and requires some work to get anything clean.
B000RU9XRY|3|It did not look like a stainless steel product.  my son and the mechanic had the same opinion.  we shall see how long it lasts.my truck is still too loud but this may be due to a leak in exhaust manifold. rthe ss is a 409 ss product
B00DJ5KEEA|5|Got this to charge the battery on my Harley. Love it.  A great buy!
B00BJ5SPO8|5|This product arrived in excellent condition and on the same day that the tracking service promised. I had earlier purchased the 2 inch wide product and it's bonding qualities were excellent. I have only used this four inch product  product one day but of the two product options,  I would select the 4 inch width if the repairs are going to be for underbelly material that is over 10 years old because the area needing to be recovered generally seems to be at least 2 inches and the wider width accommodates the damaged area better. Both are good products; of course it is the same material. The narrower width does have its practical applications; however for most home owners doing their own maintenance, I think the four inch width is more practical and convenient.
B001G63IY2|5|Am satisfied  with  satisfaction  with the  price
B00Y1HUZUS|5|Ok
B0024GWAG0|1|The helmet was impossibly small and does not comply with the listed measurements. I had to return it.
B002LYQALQ|5|Great product, good seal with CLP gun oil puts it right where I need it in small amounts.
B0073XMXMK|5|This antenna was a perfect fit, direct replacement for our factory 2007 Mini Cooper S antenna and looks fantastic! Thank you!
B0001EXGZG|5|looks good
B003V501JG|5|My third one in several years.  Works well and lasts about 15-18 months when exposed to sun all the time.  I use with Rain-X washer fluid additive and it keeps water running off my windshield like it was waxed.
B00BSGE74A|4|So far so good.
B00NB1J0ZQ|1|It bent down where the ball attaches, was 2 tons under its rated capacity.
B0000AXPDU|4|You get what you pay for. That being said, this product would most likely deter someone trying to steal a cheap [trailer] spare tire. I had to drill mine out with a 1/2&#34; drill bit to slip over the lug (see pics). I would keep the lock off the spare until I was using it (wouldn't want to get a flat only to find out the lock has malfunctioned and wont come off).<br />For $6, it's hard to beat.
B00GB8614E|5|have not installed yet but they look very good . nice quality.Like that it has separate wiring for spot and flood nice feature.
B007HRGZDK|5|Great.
B00KTJ1PLU|5|goood:)
B0022ZR3O2|1|Used it twice and braided line leaks air out of it...
B000FQ1XBY|1|One of the bushings the rubber has separated from the outer sleeve in less than 9 months without any off-road driving. Vehicle is Daily driver and was installed to proper torque specs. Don't waste your money, cheap parts are cheap for a reason. Should have gone with moog or aftermarket first time around
B00V2XHMBY|1|Bought two and only one works was told to take a picture of the light that will not work. Took forever to ship when it was listed as in stock. Light is not bright waste of money junk return policy.
B0006IX87S|4|Buy these ever 3 months
B00CHXBR32|5|great
B003BJNT0K|2|shabby piece of plastic waste of money, no way to keep it from getting loose, plastic clip does not hold very well
B010C8FAWW|5|Sticks good. And looks good on my snappy:) other guys in the shop have officially been warned
B0009IQTAI|5|Good product
B009PQD6ZG|5|Perfect fit on my 93 Volvo 850 glt
B003VSAS1O|5|this stuff really works well on rv black streaks
B000WKIKTQ|1|Terrible expensive for filter only, no glass holder. They would not even talk about a refund.
B000CIMG0C|5|Great product. I replaced a leaky stock pan to get the drain plug and the cast aluminum look, and I'm very happy with the results. Hasn't leaked a drop. Had no issues with the linkage clearing and I like the way all of the bolts sit in the recessed holes. The best part is I can now drain the transmission without playing teeter-totter with a sloshing pan.<br />I would advise paying close attention to the filter tube to make sure if you need the supplied extension. But worst case is you have to pull the filter and remove the extension.<br />All in all, it was worth the money. Install was straightforward and it looks awesome.<br />Recommended.
B00DN1GETE|5|fit perfect
B008M7SVBS|5|Item seems to  be just fine, looks great on car.
B00B353VHK|2|Case broken, no instructions provided

B004TC18P6|5|looks good.I have not installed yet.bought just in case
B00HS5HECC|5|Loved how the seller asked all pertinent details about my vehicle before shipping even though it clearly states on the item page that you should check to make sure what you buy fits your vehicle.<br />Perfect fit, look really nice and work as they should.  Haven't had them long enough to see if they'll last, but so far so good.
B001NZZAGU|5|Worked great!  Got this as a backup in case I needed it when replacing the fuel pump.  Sure glad I did because the old ring was as rusty as the old pump.
B00NABVAS2|5|cool thanks
B000M5X0IM|5|It is a good brush.
B000GQ6LF6|5|purchased Feb. 2011.  Installed easy and looks good.  Over four years latter it needs repainted as exposed surface are now rust colored.  Not sure why they do NOT Powder coat hitches.

B004GEVDX4|5|Genuine Hyundai Part and delivered on time.
B000EGJ1UK|5|love it
B0097CEKTY|5|I ordered this for my 2005 Denali. It arrived quickly and was just as described.  The programming was easy to following and took less than 5 min...I was surprised...I thought it was going to be more difficult.  Now my old worn out keyless entry has been replaced with a new one that works with one click!  And at a price that couldn't be beat!
B00FYZWHYI|5|Fantastic product. 'Murica!
B00PQZPMYI|2|Thought these were a great buy until I tried the second seat cover it did not fit like the first one and there supposed to. Be the same on side fits one doesnt!.

B000C7TV6A|5|Direct fit, has held up well for the last 2 years since i replaced it still going strong !
B006GCWOSC|5|Stock VW hub cap made in the Czech Republic. My only complaint, I found the one I lost after I ordered this one!

B004BWU8AA|5|This Tonneau cover is built well, a great value, and very easy to install and remove.  It has been working and holding up great for the last 8 months.  I wanted a cover that was easy to remove, looked good and protected my cargo, but I didn't want to spend a fortune.  I'm so glad I found this cover because it's perfect!  Installation took me about 10-15 minutes the first time, but most of that was spent reading the instructions and applying the included sticky backed foam weather striping.    I added four aluminum tabs to by truck bed (see picture).  They provide the cover clips with something solid to attach to.  I have plastic bed railing covers and those are what the clips were originally attaching too.  This was bad because the bed railing covers are only stuck down with glue.  The tabs I added stick down a little below the plastic lip of the railing covers.   If I didn't have the railing covers, the clips would make contact with the edge of the metal of the bed railing top, on my truck that is rounded off, so they would just slip off, so I would still need the tabs I added.  With the added tabs, I am very confident that the clips will never slip and the cover will not come loose at one of the corners.    The square aluminum cross tubing is slightly bent so that water will run off either side of the cover and not pool up on it.  Since originally installing this cover, about 8 months ago, I have put it to the test.  I've also removed it a number of times.  It takes less than a minute for me to remove this, and only takes me about 2 minutes now to reinstall it.  So if I am planning on getting a load of top soil, or taking a truck load of branches to the recycling place, I just take the cover off.  One great bonus use I found for these covers is that they can help hold down long boards and things that are too long for your bed and stick out.  To be clear, this would be done with the tailgate closed.  Since the clips that hold the cover down to the bed are fully adjustable, you can loosen one, or both, near the tailgate.  This allows you to set them to perfectly hold these long things against the top of your tailgate so that they don't bounce or slide from one side to the other when turning.  Pros: -Looks great on my truck. -Adds some security if you lock your tailgate.  It can not be removed or opened if the tailgate is locked. -Easy to install, remove.  Take me less than 2 minutes now to remove or reinstall it. -Not heavy -Designed so that water drains off either side and will not pool on the cover. -Weather stripping backing is extremely sticky and holds very well.  No leaking at all. -Folds up in seconds for those times you don't need to fully remove it. -Built well and has held up great over the past 6 months or so.  The cover held over 12 inches of snow for a few weeks this winter and was not damaged in any way.  Cons: -Had to install metal brackets in truck bed for the cover clamps to attach to.  Otherwise the clamps only attach to the plastic bed rail covers which are only attached with double sided tape. -Clamps seem cheap but so far they have held up well. -There is no way to lock the cover to your bed, so if the cover is folded it can be stolen in about 30 seconds.  If the cover is not folded and you do not lock your tailgate it can be stolen in 60 seconds.  However, if the cover is not folded, properly clamped, and your tailgate is locked, it would be very hard to steal this without seriously damaging it in the process.
B00GUF74HQ|5|Fit great, nice and easy installations.
B004XONSYE|5|works great easy install.

B00J2CI3L0|2|Not bright at all ...factory  bulbs are brighter
B000OP6KLY|4|The only reason for 4 Star's is because I received 1 duralec and 2 regular 15/40 label , I don't know if the duralec is new product and  received 2 older product but I order 3 and only got 1..its all 15/40 W ..
B0085G9P84|5|Nice product fit the mustang that i have, a good replacement for my old one.
B005U80NMC|5|It arrived in good order! Five star thank you!
B000CPJLHG|4|Hard to come by in brick and mortar stores. it is an essential part of the finishing process if you want your high temp paint job to last.
B00OHVV5NE|5|Exactly like described. Can get a little warm in summer at stop signs, but good product for great price.
B000Q8HP36|5|excellent product

B001D9DP0E|5|Nice and bright at a good price.
B00SGJHX0M|5|Perfect fit, easy install, awesome price. All you need is small, flat tip screwdriver.
B00SF93BI6|1|Grips didn't fit. No end caps. Had to cut the metal bands to get them to fit. Tried to return them and was offered four dollars back if I keep them and try to sell them to a friend. Just bad customer service and not a proper fit. These are more for a bicycle than a vehicle.
B0089FNIBG|5|easy install ,work good
B0060YHLJS|4|Good quality worked well.
B000RZPNOQ|5|I have a 26' pontoon boat and I ordered 4 bottles of this. I think that i probably needed 5 bottels to get the full job done. But I sprayed the product on and let it sit for about 10 minutes and sprayed it off and the boat looks brand new!!
B0024ECD2I|4|like it but had to buy a bushing to install. it was too small for my opening of rv water heater.
B00AGKT8HA|5|Fit perfectly and was just as described.
B00WH2KIOC|4|Very happy.  Maybe some improvement on the trim material<br />, somewhat hard to apply.
B003JH4MQE|5|Fits well on my new 2015 4Runner and way better than the one that come with the car.
B000M3V95U|5|Love the it work great.
B009X1YZJE|5|Worked as promised. Had to change the way i installed, but it worked out.<br />Thanks
B00I6MRYMQ|4|Not as good as the original, but when your original rusts and breaks the stud off...<br /><br />Easier than drilling out the broken stud on your original, but that said, these look like they'll rust up pretty quick. Will end up drilling out the studs on any other things I have to do. Not sure why you can only get one side of these when the rear takes two?
B011C39GYE|3|Everything fit fine except the back seat. I don't have a middle seat are so the seat cover is larger then needed... other then that they are wnderful
B00F0YHZSQ|5|It worked perfectly on our Polaris 900 Ranger.  My husband just found out he has RA  and this makes driving the Ranger and lot easier with the pain in his hands.
B00N2PLPRM|5|They're awesome

B002FO6MG0|5|Awesome headlights
B002WSGMFA|5|Arrived in a timely manner. Worked as advertised.
B0075E8EUC|5|perfect fit for my 18 in. tire, looks great!
B000MWZHM2|1|I bought this battery and it has caused me over $1500 in unnecessary repairs. After buying this battery and fully charging it, I started running into numerous problems that I felt couldn't be the battery since I had just bought it. I replaced my starter (+230) and it still didn't start up. I replace the spark plugs and ignition coil. Replacing all of these parts was causing damage to parts I was taking off and putting back on repeatedly. Before I know it, I was replacing my primary chain and fixing damage done. I will never buy a Yuasa battery again. I'm sticking to batteries from my local AutoZone or other reputable shop.<br /><br />If you want to save yourself pain and headaches, skip this battery and spend a little more to get something that is higher quality.
B00JXNJT8E|5|This is a really nice, thick, heavy duty frame.  The car wash almost rips off my license plate in the front when I go through, so I hoped this would add some rigidity.  It has just slightly bent after multiple washes, which is super impressive.
