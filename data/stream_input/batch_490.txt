B0001LJC2K|5.0|As an old Muse fan who hails from the band's native land, and having just read a whole load of reviews that claim Muse are simply a Radiohead rip-off, I feel compelled to offer my opinion. Yes, both bands come from England (Albeit different ends of it), but as far as I can see the similarity ends there. Thom Yorke and Matt Bellamy both put their vocal talents to full use in their music, but if anything this just stands as a criticism of the blandness of other contemporary singers. Whereas Yorke's quiet, haunting lyrical style puts the listener in a philosophical and, dare I say it, depressed frame of mind, Bellamy's aggressive, relentless voice is a rousing, driving force to Muse's work. Furthermore, Muse relies upon a mixture of heavy, stirring guitar work and classical-sounding piano solos (Such as that in the beautiful 'Butterflies and Hurricanes'), elements that barely figure in 'The Bends' and sound nothing like the experimental prog-rock of 'OK Computer'. If you want confirmation of this, listen to Muse's earlier and almost equally brilliant album, 'Origin of Symmetry'. They might never be as good as Radiohead but to be honest there's not really a comparison to make. If OK Computer's 'No Surprises' made you want to end it all, Absolution's 'Butterflies and Hurricanes' should send a shiver down your spine and inspire you to action.
B0002OERI0|5.0|this cd is the best one ever and defintley should have won album of the year, anyone who says it's bad is completely brainless, green day is by far the best punk band and anyone who says differint is retarded. <br />   all the songs are awesom and tells a interesting story if you listen close enough. the best songs are american idiot, boulevard of broken dreams, give me novicane, holiday,jesus of surbubia,holiday,and shes a rebel. i advice you to buy the cd no matter what anyone says,if you dont like it you are wierd. <br />  <br />
B0007XT87G|5.0|To be blunt, this is my favorite new release since Tool's LATERALUS almost four years ago, and I'm a big fan of various subsets of rock music. As incredible as Porcupine Tree's 2002 effort IN ABSENTIA proved to be, this eclipses it and nears the realm of musical perfection... and reaches the realm of musical bliss with ease. This is what rock music is all about. <br /> <br />The epic title track kicks things off with a brilliant riff that is repeated with a few variations throughout the song, and features hauntingly deep, almost mechanical vocals from Steven Wilson that have not yet been heard on any major-label PT release. \\"Shallow,\\" \\"Lazarus\\", and \\"Halo\\" are the most likely candidates for radio play; the first is fairly straightforward riffage and probably the weakest track on the album, Lazarus is gorgeous and piano-driven with irresistable vocal harmonies, and Halo contrasts funky, bassy verses with a surprisingly upbeat chorus, verbally abusing religious zealots and their hypocrisy all the while. <br /> <br />The following track, \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here,\\" is the centerpiece of the album both mathematically and artistically, and, at 12:02, is matched in length only by \\"Russia on Ice\\" from LIGHTBULB SUN (2000). This, however, makes far better use of its extreme duration by progressing through several very distinct phases -- the hard-rocking section from around 6:50 to 8:50 is about as thrilling as modern music comes. This epic gradually fades out, a precursor to the relative musical calm of \\"Mellotron Scratch,\\" a track whose lyrical theme is anything but calm -- in fact, it is downright heartbreaking, in a way comparable to \\"Heartattack in a Layby\\" from IN ABSENTIA but musically more adventerous -- and this is easily one of the best songs PT has produced to date. <br /> <br />\\"Open Car\\" and \\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" are two outstanding pieces brought together by a common key and a fluid transition between tracks. The former is surprisingly brief byPT standards, heavy, and worthy of more than a few spins on rock radio. The latter is an emotional, wandering venture with particularly atmospheric verses, and yet again proves to be among the most interesting and unique material the band has blessed us with in their entire career. As it fades out, a hint of static is heard, which gradually gives way to the insane sonic buildup of \\"Glass Arm Shattering,\\" the highlight of DEADWING and quite possibly one of the best songs released this decade. The textural focus of early PT (think \\"Dark Matter\\" or \\"Sever\\") is revived, but this time with unbelievable production and jaw-dropping layers of vocals -- if you aren't in heaven at around 4:00 of this song, I guess music cannot take you there. This one has to be heard to be believed. Finally, a bonus track (Track 10) is revealed after several minutes of silence tacked onto the end of Glass Arm -- it is a re-recorded version of the PT classic \\"Shesmovedon\\" with noticeably cleaner production than the original version found on LIGHTBULB SUN. <br /> <br />Not much more can be said regarding the quality of this release; it is at once technically and artistically superb and immensely enjoyable and accessible (you might even say instantly gratifying, though there is so much more to be heard on future listens if you look at it that way). I can practically guarantee satisfaction for anyone who enjoys modern progressive music such as Tool, Radiohead, The Mars Volta, et. al., and for those who don't, I still cannot recommend this highly enough as it is a perfect stepping stone from the bland, commercial rock on the airwaves to more discrete artists such as those just mentioned. Most important, of course, is that this is a masterful, refreshing example of what we can only dream more mainstream bands will begin to strive for.

B000784WMW|4.0|The DVD is formatted into 11 half-hour episodes, with opening and closing credits for each episode.  On the minus side, that is distracting and slows the story down.  On the plus side, you can learn the names of every single supporting actor throughout the story.  (Pilot, Rochester's dog, was played by \\"Shady.\\")  However, if you've worn out your VHS version because you love this story so much, you will be thrilled to see the scenes and pieces of scenes left out of the VHS version, as well as where the episodes stopped when it was originally aired.  Overall, I give it a 4:  5 for the story and performances, 3 for the formatting.  Enjoy!
0553573403|4.0|This book is action packed and somewhat more realistic than other historical fantasy books-more gray characters, good guys get killed, etc.  Some characters are interesting and likable and some are despicable.  Sometimes the violence and swearing is over abundant.
6304712499|1.0|obviously the reviews written below me are either jokes or are people been paid in crackers to recommend this movie. This movie, without a doubt, is one of the worst catastrophes to ever hit the big screen. The story is incoherrent, the acting is laughingly bad and excruciatingly painful. Also, there is no reason why this movie should be rated R. Or hardly PG-13 for that matter. i just sat through the directos cut, the longest hour and a half of my (now) godforsaken life. It took an ENTIRE HOUR into the film for a single swear word- \\"a-hole\\", PG by MPAA standards, to emerge. Not a single drop of red blood is spilled, even when the pointlessly hot Priest gets shot in the head, a place where wounds tend to bleed slightly. The only violence is completely CGI. With only slight trimming this could pass for PG. This is not an R rated movie. The ending scene is stupid. The entire story is butchered and stupid. If you have, uh, any braincells you will agree with me on this atrocious skid mark of \\"cinema\\".
0061020680|5.0|I think this is one of the funniest Discworld books.  DEATH is my favorite Discworld characters.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I watched Closer thinking that it was basically going to be a movie about four people who are entwined in one way or another through sex and deception.  I was right.  But the miraculous thing about this movie is that it is so much more than that.  Through most of the movie, there were scenes that made me laugh (Jude Law and Clive Owen pretending to be two people having internet sex), scenes that made my brow furrow with confusion, and scenes that made me cringe because of not only how sexually open this movie was, but also because of how horrible some of these characters were to each other (the Julia Roberts and Clive Owen break up scene is especially memorable in this case).  But through it all, its been three days since I saw this movie, and I am still thinking about it in my head, because it is really that profound.  Honestly, I give kudos to whoever wrote this script on this movie because it is absolutely beautiful, in a raunchy yet realistic kind of way.  The lines these characters have seem confusing, sometimes even out of place, until the end and you really get thinking about all the things they say to each other and what the director is really trying to tell you about life.  I'm not a big fan of overly done celebrity powerhouse movies, but Natalie Portman is at the top of her game in this movie and Julia Roberts and Clive Owen are extremely good as well.  Jude Law, on the other hand, got on my nerves just a little but is forgivable and finally redeemed in his very last scene (with Portman).  If you want a movie that uses the usual hollywood formula of love, then stay far away, but if you want a movie that will make you think and laugh, then by all means, get Closer.
0060955775|4.0|One of my friends had been telling me to read this book for a few years now and I finally read it.  I could identify with the characters in the book and liked the message that while most people are a little crazy they should still make the effort to function in the \\"real world\\" and fight for their freedom.  I'm not going to give it 5 stars because Coelho's writing is not strong.
B0000541AM|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was 8...I'm 30 now, and I still love it....such a good time. The Baseball Furies are hilarious, and nothing says tough more than dudes with switchblades on roller skates. Yeah, this review is terrible, but I'm not here to give analysis-read the other 150 reviews for that. I'm just here to say that 70's cinema doesn't get any better than this. Awesome. \\"These chicks are packin!!!\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|First, I am not part of the U2 marketing team. I just think this cd is good. In fact, agfter this review im writing one on Jimi Hendrix's Axis: Bold As Love. This cd is not another Joshua Tree or War.It may have songs sounding similar to other earlier songs, but it is its own. <br />Now to the songs: <br />1.Vertigo is very cool rock song.I like the beat of this song because to me it seems fast-paced for a U2 song. However, if you're new to U2 (newer than me) don't expect to get anymore \\"vertigo-like\\" songs.  <br />2.Miracle Drug is a decent song, but not the best on the album. The lyrics on this song aren't the best and are usually sacked by buyers. I think they're okay <br />3.Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own was one of the best songs on this album. Bono (the lead singer) sang this as a ballad to his late father. The lyrics are very emotional and the music is superb. Has Joshua Tree quality.Sounds a little like SHFWILF (track 2, Joshua Tree) <br />4. Love and Peace Or Else is a great rocking tune. Closest to satisfying the \\"vertigo\\" lovers. <br />5.City of Blinding Lights is my personal favorite.Reminds me of \\"Where The Streets Has No Name\\" on fast forward.By the U2 I've listened to, they seem to like singing about the city                        .However, the wonderful lyrics and the inspiring \\"oohh oohh oohh\\"'s in the background could make you praise u2. I love the line \\"Neon Lights, Daoygo Eyes, city Lit by fireflies\\"   <br />And so on and so on... <br />You'll also like Man and a Woman (romantic love between a brother and his \\"little sister\\"), One Step Closer (a brilliant song that's slow and meaningful), and maybe Yaweh(even though it's obviously a distorted \\"One Tree Hill\\", not the best track). All Because of You is also good. I especially like the part where bono goes \\"i am\\".    <br />   Like I said, if you are expecting a punk/ funk rock band and a lot of explicit content get Red Hot Chili Peppers (not dissing them- BSSM rocks and so does Californication!!!!), but if you like a band that's more mature and sings more than songs that rock you're socks get U2.Bono is a very skilled song writer and the Edge's guitar work will take you away. <br />U2 Already listened to:War, HTDAAB, and Joshua Tree. Plus Many songs from Boy, Unforgettable Fire, and Achtung Baby.Going to listen to Achtung Baby and ATYCLB.
B00005JL9B|5.0|WHAT MORE CAN I SAY ABOUT THIS MOVIE THAT EVERYONE ELSE HASNT ALREADY SAID? WELL....
B00005JNTV|2.0|Wow.  Robert Rodregeiz, Quentin Tarantino together again.  The big failure of this film is its screenplay.  It reads like a porno novel, using dialog no one would ever use.  The second failure of this movie is there are NO characters in this film that is likable.  The animation/live action blend is great and the action is pretty non stop.  Also, the film is very violent.  It would make Freddy or Jason flinch!

0345457684|3.0|***** Guaranteed 100% Spoiler Free ***** <br /> <br />Click on a sci-fi BB, usergroup, or head to a con and you'll hear all the time arguments about what exactly is sci-fi.  Many different writers have thrown out many different definitions with the purpose of being about to give a definitive up-or-down yes-or-no to any particular story.  Altered Carbon makes me think about such debates because it is first and foremost a hard-boiled mystery that calls back to Raymond Chandler and the old black and white films of the 30s and 40s.  How to breathe life into this old genre?  Set the story in the future.  Along comes Philip K. Dick and *poof* you've got a new subgenre: future-noir.  And now, 40 years later, future-noir is getting a little grey around the edges.  With Altered Carbon, Richard Morgan doesn't quite re-invent the genre but he offers a compelling addition to its ranks.   <br /> <br />Altered Carbon is roughly 5 parts The Big Sleep, and 1 part Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?, with a couple of pinches of over-the-top action thrown in for good measure.   If you're looking for a mystery, here you go.  If you're looking for science-fiction, well... read on. <br /> <br />The flaw of this book is that the *idea* behind it is at odds with the *story*.  The idea that a person's entire identity and all their memories can be downloaded digitally and transferred from body to body goes against everything we know about neurology, but that would be forgivable if it was the centerpiece of a good story.  Unfortunately, Morgan is so focused on giving his readers a good Mystery, that the sci-fi aspects falter.  There are other needling sci-fi aspects too that could have gotten more play: the role of the central character's conditioning, just how sentient are artificial beings, etc. <br /> <br />Because the action is so focused on the whodunnit, the story only occasionally offers some human ramifications.  When you're done, you can't help but think of all the missed opportunities.  There's lots of examination of seedy sex and ultra-violence, but there is not a lot of the wonder in gee-whiz technology that gives sci-fi a lot of its charm.  Dick was always asking the big questions in his stories (what does it mean to be human, what is reality if not perception, what is the role of technology in our evolution) without letting the stories become brooding meditions.  But here, the questions mostly go unasked. <br /> <br />As you might guess, the flaws to the book kept me from fully enjoying it.  That's not to say it isn't a good book or that you won't enjoy it.  Because it is a good book, especially if you're a fan of those old hard-boiled Philip Marlowe books.  Sci-Fi flaws aside, Morgan definitely does breathe new life into the mystery side of things.  The plot of the book has twists and turns aplenty and will keep you guessing until the end.  And if that's your thing, and you don't mind a little bit of the old ultra-violence, then pick it up.
B00005YU1O|5.0|I really love this movie.  If I had been told this was an animated film before I watched it, I orobably would not have watched it.  I am so glad then that I didn't know.  The skill and artisanal craft with which this movie is wrought justifies itself.  The viewer is so effectively invited into the visual universe of this beautiful move, any ambivalence about the form of the movie is replaced by a thoughtfulness that in some places is insightful and other places windy nonsense.  I liked, for example, the musicians and I loved the music.  I hated the guy on the bridge, that \\"Speed\\" guy phony New York guru who has captured Richard Linklater's attention more than once. All told, this is a careful and moving film.<br /><br />It's not possible to capture the surprising beauty of Waking Life, so there is little profit from knowing anything about the movie before watching it.  Without force-feeding you some wierd alter-reality or worse, a programme involving some version of \\"everyone creates his own reality,\\" this film invites you to reconsider the boundaries of our encounter with objective reality, and our ability or inability to recognize it while it's happening.  If you must know more, read the Amazon review for description, then watch it twice at least.  It would be an essential video at three times the price.
0451207521|4.0|I have enjoyed many of Ken Follett's books--spy thrillers and others.  I really enjoyed reading about a competent women as the main character for a change.  <br /> <br />It's based on the French Resistance in 1944 days before the Allied invasion.  \\"Flick\\" has been part of the resistance for 2 years and goes back for one final critical mission.  What makes this different is she goes in with a bunch of misfits.  The book also follows the story from a Nazi officer's side as he tries to track her down.   The Nazi officer's part of the story is interesting because it offers up the other side perspective.  The most disturbing part of the book, however, is the unflinching look at how he extracts information from these spies.  Torture details, although pretty brief, are fairly graphic and probably could be skipped if one found it too much without losing much of the story. <br /> <br />The story was inspired by the true story of 50 women who were spies that were sent into France.  This story, of course, is all fictional. <br /> <br />The book was a fast read.  With the Nazi officer always at Flick's heels, Follett kept the tension at a high level.  I would recommend this book.
B00005JNVS|4.0|Kung Fu Hustle is from the same person, Stephen Chow, behind Shaolin Soccer. You all remember Shaolin Soccer, right? Oh right, it was cut to pieces by its American distributor and then never widely released in the USA (if it was released at all on the screen).    Shaolin Soccer was about this ex-soccer player (football to all you non-US Americans) that was very good, missed a goal, and was brutally beaten by a mob. That ex-player became a flunky to one of his former soccer teammates, until he leaves and eventually forms a soccer team with some bums he finds in the streets (not all bums). The team ends up entering a competition and the final game is against Team Evil, the team owned by that former teammate. There is something of a coherent plot in Shaolin Soccer (as long as you watch the uncut verison). Kung Fu Hustle is a lot more disjointed.    Kung Fu Hustle is filled with many actors, so much so that it becomes hard to tell which actor, or set of actors we should care about. Hustle is about crime-filled 1920s or 1930s Shanghai, where gangs run rampant, except in the poorest areas. One gang has, apparently, come to dominate most of Shanghai. That gang is the \\"Axe Head Gang\\" (or something like that). The movie opens with that gang \\"fighting\\" the head of a rival gang. The leader of the Axe gang likes dancing around during fights and afterwards.    Later, two con men visit one of those poor areas, Pig Sty Alley (I believe that is the name of the alley). They claim to be members of the Axe gang and demand money, but are disbelieved by the poor citizens of this alley (actually somewhat humorous scene where chief con man, Stephen Chow, keeps picking people out of the audience to fight, only to find out that he keeps choosing some tough looking people). Eventually the real Axe gang turns up, some Kung Fu masters spring up out of the poor mass of the Alley and . . . don't want to give everything away.    The movie can be surprisingly funny at times, but is a lot more violent and bloody than you might expect from a \\"comedy.\\" I would probably give this film 4.22 stars out of 5.    The main actors are: Hisao Liang (leader of the Axe Gang); Stephen Chow (Sing); Wah Yuen (Landlord); Qiu Yuen (Landlady); Xing Yu (coolie; more of a supporting part); Siu Lung Leung (The Beast); Dong Zhi Hua (Donut); Kwok Kuen Chan (Brother Sum); Chiu Chi Ling (Tailor) and etc.    - Michael S.

0156027321|4.0|I have been told for years to read this book.  I kept holding out thinking, \\"What good would a story be about a boy in a boat with a tiger?\\"  Boy was I wrong. I guess I don't have nearly the imagination that Yann Martel has!! <br /> <br />Pi is an Indian boy who is traveling with his family to begin their new life in Canada.  On board their boat is many animals from his father's former zoo that they are selling to zoos in North America.  The boat sinks, and Pi ends up in a life boat with a tiger.   <br /> <br />What makes the book so interesting is before the voyage, Pi talks alot about the pyschology of animals and how to use it.  Pi shows his knowledge while onboard the lifeboat.  I was a bit unprepared for the graphic description of some of the animals deaths, however.  Martel makes it all see like a weird fairy tale.  Even more weird, is it some how all seems believable--especially with the \\"interview\\" format he uses at the beginning and end of the book. <br /> <br />The book really takes off when they get on the lifeboat.  Martin does a good job of keeping the tension high.  Will the tiger eat him?  Will he get enough water, food, etc?  I really enjoyed the survival skills aspect of the story as well.  Makes me feel almost prepared to be in a lifeboat with a tiger for 3/4 of a year.  Highly recommended.

B000002GQK|4.0|While certainly not the best of the Moody Blues \\"classic seven (\\"Days of Future Passed\\" through \\"Seventh Sojourn\\"), \\"Every Good Boy Deserves a Favor\\" is quite good, and virtually an equal to the group's prior album \\"Question of Balance.\\"  For instance, once again, the two best songs on this album are penned by Justin Hayward.  The classic \\"The Story in Your Eyes\\" is probably one of the best five songs the band ever did, with its stinging electric guitar and driving rhythm. It is simply a timeless classic that I think is even better than \\"Question\\" from the previous album.  In my opinion, the first song \\"Procession\\" really just serves as an introduction to \\"The Story in Your Eyes.\\"  I know that \\"Procession\\" can also be interpreted as the evolution of music, or a tribute to the different music around the world, but I, for one, have grown tired of it. <br /> <br />The second best song on the album is Justin's superlative \\"You Can Never Go Home\\" which builds into a truly moving listening experience.  Justin has never sung, or played his electric guitar, better.  Other stand-outs are \\"Emily's Song\\" written by John Lodge about his daughter, in which John avoids being too cutesy by keeping it short and utilizing interesting instrumentation.  Thomas' \\"Our Guessing Game,\\" inexplicably omitted from the Moodies boxed set \\"Time Traveler,\\" is uplifting and powerful, and comparable to \\"The Tide Rushes In.\\"  Pinder's \\"My Song\\" has a hypnotic effect on the listener, similar to his \\"Have You Heard/The Voyage\\" medley. <br /> <br />I find tracks 5-7 tedious, and I generally skip them.  Lodge's \\"One More Time to Live\\" is particularly overbearing and cliched.  Singing a string of words ending in \\"tion\\" (e.g. creation, evolution, pollution, solution) does not necessarily make for deeper meaning (see also U2s \\"Bad\\").   <br /> <br />Overall a very good album.  The next one (Seventh Sojourn) would return the band to the greatness they achieved with \\"Days of Future Passed\\" and \\"To Our Children's Children's Children.\\"
0440236738|4.0|Gone For Good, by Harlan Coben is a great thriller that keeps you planted on the edge of your seat.  This book is about Will who is left without his best friend in the world, his brother Ken.  Is his brother dead or in hiding because of being accused for the murder of his brother's ex-girlfriend?  Live Will's life by his side as he goes through a number of hardships and tries to avenge his brother's disappearance and find out what truly happened that night. <br /> Gone For Good is a great quick read that is recommended for anyone who enjoys reading suspence novels.  The vocabulary is relatively simple and easy to understand.  Another novel that should be read is another one of Coben's called Tell No One. <br />        The downside of this novel is the way Coben seems to introduce random characters.  As the reader progresses through the book, however, he will see that mostly all of the characters fit together in one big puzzle. <br />
0553212478|4.0|Frankenstein is, by far, one of the best novels I have ever read.  Set in the 1700s, the novel follows a captain on an important expedition.  Frankenstein was written for a diverse audience.  Anyone of any age or race could read this book and understand it without any problems.  It not only keeps the reader interested in what is going on, but it also keeps the reader trying to guess what is going to happen next.  The novel has a mysterious appeal.  The plot is filled with many twists and turns which make it uneasy to spoil the story.  The characters in Frankenstein are very unique.  Each of them possess specific characteristics which make them key figures to the development of the plot.  I believe there are many themes to this novel.  I believe that tragedy, sorrow, and grief are the main themes though.  All of the characters experience tragedy sorrow and grief brought on by a series of misfortunate events which occur throughout the story.  This book is considered a classic because it has, over the years taken on its on identity, becoming one of the most popular myths of all time.  There have been many different versions of the book and many movies, but nothing comes closer to the original version written by Mary Shelly.  I would recommend this book to anybody of any age who is able to read it.  It is not a complicated story to read and it is filled with many aspects that any reader could relate to.  Science, love, mystery, and suspense all play a role in making the story interesting and worthy of reading.

0385336810|5.0|If you're looking for an expertly executed light read in the \\"chick lit\\" genre, pick up Can You Keep a Secret.<br /><br />The premise of Can You Keep a Secret is worth the price of admission.  Junior marketing assitant Emma Corrigan is flying home from a disastrous \\"first real business meeting\\" when her plane hits horrific turbulence.  Convinced that her last moment is at hand, Emma confesses her secrets and shortcomings to the guy in the next seat. Except that the plane lands safely.  Fortunately, airplane seatmates never materialize in real life.  Except that Emma's does.  At her job.  And he owns the company.<br /><br />Can You Keep a Secret is a fast, breezy read that will keep you cheerfully turning the pages.  It's pure fun, and I give it high marks in the \\"Utterly without redeeming social value, but I loved it anyway,\\" category.  Have a good time with this one!
B000002UJQ|5.0|After reading the reviews, I have come to the conclusion is that most of the people that don't like Ok Computer or Radiohead in general are the type of people that don't like to listen different music from what they are used to. They would rather listen to the same stlye of music that they have always like and/or comfortable w/. I'm not saying thats wrong, but for me music is an emotion...It just depends on what mood I'm in...so if you want to step out and listen to somthing a bit different then go ahead,Ok Computer is a good choice....I'm sure your musical taste will grow from that!....but in whatever you do listen to what makes you happy....and don't fall into that \\"if it's mainstream\\" crap....it doesnt't matter if music is mainstream or not, your the one that makes the final decision on whether its good or not
B0002XL35G|5.0|I can't begin to express just how much this film touches my soul.  I really feel as though I'm watching a sort of surreal home movie of my childhood.  I can personaly relate to the 'Hunter' character, even as an adult.<br />  The basic plot: Harry Dean Stanton's 'Travis' is a lost soul who slowly redeems himself of past mistakes throughout the story.  Also stars Nastassja Kinski as his estranged wife and Dean Stockwell as his brother.<br />  I had no idea Sam Shephard was even involved in this movie until I recently visited Wim Wenders' website and saw that he wrote it, what a great surprise to me, especially since Jessica Lange's my favorite actress...it seems very cosmic.<br />  Every actor in 'Paris, Texas' is superb!  The scenery is unbelievable and the commentary by Wim Wenders on the DVD extra's is wonderful.  Included on the DVD are deleted scenes (watch with commentary ON); photo stills; and scenes from the Cannes Film Festival of 1984 when it premiered, which is a hoot to watch and the original trailer.<br />  I believe this film will touch your soul as well!!  It's just plain  beautiful.
B00005JNQ8|3.0|This film was good. That's right, just good. The storyline is suspensful and manages to do just enough to suck you in, but I wondered aloud to my friends if they, or I, would even remember the plot after two months. I doubt any of us will.<br /><br />The reason for this is Sean Penn. I have always liked him, especially in roles like The Thin Red Line (which was perfect for his gloomy demeanor), and Mystic River, as well as his ability to direct (Indian Runner and The Pledge come to mind). But here, alongside a strikingly beautiful Nicole Kidman (who does a wonderful job in this film), he loses his audience as a Secret Service Agent.<br /><br />There are long lapses of time when Sean Penn does little more than manage to move a single facial muscle and speak above a monotone. Some would say this is classic Sean Penn being loosed and allowed to act the way he has admittedly craved, but I disagree. Wanting him to move past that classic depressed Sean Penn resonance, I found myself disappointed once more, because Sean fails to do so again.<br /><br />A good film but certainly not what the critics are calling it.
0786890754|5.0|Cecilia Ahern is extremely talented and creative.  This book caught my eye in the bookstore - and I thought why not try a new author.  After reading PS I Love You, I was thrilled with my decision.  At times I found myself laughing out loud and at other times, her poignant writing style left me in tears as one walks through this emotional journey with Holly - the main character.  I am eagerly anticipating her next novel Rosie Dunne.  This book is definitely worth reading.  It is a book that engages the reader and leaves you wanting more!
0440178002|5.0|This book is brilliant.  Shogun is an historical fiction novel based in 17th century Japan.  This book brings to light the fascinating and bizarre Japanese culture told at an important turning point in it's history as Japan begins to clash with encroaching European culture and influence.    The story is centered around an Englishman's journey thru Japan as a \\"stranger in a strange land\\".  His journey begins when his pirate/trade ship sailing from Europe around the tip of South America, ship-wrecks on the coast of Japan.      The book clearly shows the sharp contrast in western and eastern cultures; both at times seeming idealistic and at other times barbaric.  Both have much to learn from each other.    The book has many elements to it including intense action (sometimes a bit too violent), intricate plots, memorable characters, intellectual exchange, and, not to mention, the book is very well written.    Additionally, there is a 3-part Shogun television mini-series produced in the 80s that is supposedly a great film.
B000002KIE|5.0|I love the new punk bands around today (Green Day, Blink 182) but you can't beat this. Sex Pistols defined an era, they spoke out against polotics and religion, and were an inspiration to many punk rockers out there who simply thought 'f**k it, i'm gonna do what i want!\\" They were the first to swear profanity live on t.v during the day, and totally did whatever they wanted on stage. Their lyrics are immature at best, but who cares? They did what they wanted...they pissedoff who they liked... and without them, punk wouldn't be where it is now. <br /> <br />The Jam is also another good old punk bad to watch out for.

014118213X|1.0|Howard's End is the type of book for a dramatic audience. It shows an appeal about love and betrayal. The book has the appeal about everyday struggles that people face each and everyday. This book is for an audience that loves drama. The story is about a woman who stops at nothing to find her true love. She doesn't only remains unable to connect in her life, but she also has no power to inspire others to connect. I think that is story is suitable for dramatic plays because it'll touch the audience hearts. The books has a love appeal to it.This story really explains what true love really is. Henry had a problem with his wife's cheating,but he loved her so much, he just dealt with it. He feels that her reasons for entering a marriage relationship with henry was her goal to change him into someone more like herself. Magaret was never satisfied with her love for Henry Wilcox.From the start of her romance relationship,Henry had to deal with the affairs as a business transaction. I consider this book a classic. It really shows an example of trials and tribulations that couples face. I would recommend this book people that loves romance.
0385510438|5.0|Geez, I don't know why I should bother reviewing a book that has 468 other reviews.  Not like anyone will easily find my review to maybe give me some positive feedback.  I guess I'll write this assuming I'm gathering a small loyal following of Justman review readers.  Ah...I feel energy building from a minor ego boost...let me write...no...CREATE!<br /><br />This is another great Grisham book.  I was going to give it 4 stars but man, the last 10% of the book ends up being a big payoff.  One would think that such a book would plod along to the promised denoument, but not Grisham.  He carries you along to the whiz-bang ending with great back-story about Clanton, MS and its citizens.  What a town, what a life.<br /><br />This book is another example of great writing where the journey is more fun than the destination.  Grisham sucks you in with the middle and uses it to wallop you in the end.  What a ride.  A must read, especially if you enjoyed other Grisham novels.
B0000507QH|2.0|Cedric Kahn's \\"L'Ennui\\" is the story of a middle-aged man, Martin (Charles Berling) who has just gotten divorced and starts having an affair with a women half his age, Cecilla (Sophie Guillemin). At first the relationship is purely a sexual one. He doesn't care for her and we suspect she doesn't care for him. But soon Martin realizes he may love her but she is a girl to love loved. He thinks she is cheating on him. And thus his world begins to crumble as he tries to catch her in the act.<br /><br /> Other movies have dealt with similar ideas. Right now I'm thinking of \\"An Affair of Love\\", which was about two people who answer an ad in the paper about meeting for a casual affair once a week. Soon the two fall in love but never confront their emotions. The other movie is \\"Intimacy\\". A story about two people who meet every Wednesday for their affair. But soon the man realizes he loves her but finds out she is married and tries to win her over. Both films worked. \\"L'Ennui\\" on the other hand doesn't.<br /><br /> Martin is a philosophy teacher and boy does he talk a lot! I've haven't becomed this annoying watching a character in a while. The entire film consist of him questioning Cecilla. But I'm jumping ahead, let me explain. Cecilla was seeing a much older man, a painter, who was drawing nude pictures of her. He died while making love to her and when Martin finds out about this he is intrigued by her relationship with the man, hence all the questions. If only Martin would shut-up once in a while and actually listen to people maybe he wouldn't be in the state of mind he is. Even has he is making love he never stops questioning her. And don't think Cecilla is a treat either. Who is she? What does she want? Does she love Martin? Can she love anyone? Who knows, and more importantly, who cares? We don't like either of these people. I don't see how they can even stand each other out. If I sat in room with Martin I don't think I'd last 30 seconds with this guy.<br /><br /> What \\"L'Ennui\\" needed to do was drop some of Martin's dialogue give him more actions and tells us something about Cecilla. By the end of the picture we have a good sense of Martin, he's a pest and a loser. Cecilla though just seems heartless. But is she really?<br /><br /> The movie was directed by Cedric Kahn who also directed the recent \\"Red Light\\", a much better film. Kahn is interested in human relations. He likes to put his characters in intense situations and just watch them explode. That sounds fine but you have to give us something to care about. I never cared for these people. I never understood them.<br /><br /> Some people may watch the film because they find it erotic. One can't really comment on that because different people find different things erotic. I didn't think it was. But who knows.<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Do you feel like watching two annoying people for two hours? This is your movie!/> What \\"L'Ennui\\" needed to do was drop some of Martin's dialogue give him more actions and tells us something about Cecilla.

B00005JNBQ|3.0|Napoleon Dynamite has some funny scenes. Unfortunately, they do not meld together into a story. Dozens of sub-plots and situations are initiated but then ignored. (milk tasting, thrift store sword, grandmother's boyfriend, and that time travel machine to name a few) I laughed out loud many times while watching this movie, but in the end it seemed pointless. Watching ND gave me the same feeling as watching deleted scenes on other DVDs. The scenes were funny, but they didn't relate to the story and that is why they were cut. On a positive note, the title sequence was excellent. If you want to watch a show about nerds, check out Freaks and Geeks. It has great stories, great characters, and it is funny.
B000002LFU|4.0|It always amuses me the way some call this garbage, and others say it's one of their best. I'll just call it a very solid REM release. To me \\"Green\\" is kind of the last album you can still hear the early sound a bit, but also hear what's on the way in tracks like \\"Orange Crush\\" and \\"You Are The Everything\\". \\"Stand\\" was a big hit at the time, but has since taken on a \\"Shiny Happy People\\" vibe about it. I also really like \\"Get Up\\" and \\"Wrong Child\\" alot, and honestly every track here is good at the least. REM have so many great albums out that it's hard to say what's best, but I'll always have a soft spot for \\"Green\\", since it's the first one of theirs I really absorbed. Oh, and there's 11 tracks, the 11th being one of the best.
076790382X|4.0|Having spent two years in the US of A recently, I found myself puzzeling repeatedly over the quirks and contradictions of our BIG SISTER. Now, FINALLY, we are NOT alone. <br />Every single column in Bryson's brilliant flare describes actual daily happenings. I will testify before any court. IT IS SO. <br />How could the most influencial of democracies survive when its individuals  are totally devoid of the burden of general knowledge, so often lack wit, and do not have any capacity for taking responsibility? repeatedly relating anecdotes of our stay in New England, we found our listeners wearing unbelieving and bemuzed expression.  <br />Of course, generalization is silly. Among the 275 million Americans there are witty entrepeneurs with insight and distinction. I'm sure. It is my suspicion, though, that for the most, these qualifications have been outsourced.... <br /> <br />M. Beeri, MD <br />Israel <br />
B00000K31Q|3.0|Ten Things I Hate About You brings a great overview of the Shakespeare play, Taming of the Shrew. The wittiness and attitude are there definitely for the two sisters, Bianca and Kate. Instead of finding a husband though, the girls in the movie are trying to get dates for the high school prom. Petruchio is the tamer and seems to have a different strategy in the movie. In the play he is very overpowering and demanding, while in the movie he seems to tame her by doing sweet things after he messes up. There is one main example of how these two versions do not relate though, and that is how in the play it is as if Katherina is playing Petrucio like a fool by doing as he wants and it doesn't even seem like she is in love with him. In the movie though, Kate still shows acts of not liking him, but overall she falls madly in love with him and it is like a dream come true. Overall, I believe that This movie was a good example of a relation to Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew.
0380002930|5.0|I really hate to review books that have been so thoroughly reviewed, such as 'Watership Down.' Nonetheless, I will proceed to put in my two cents worth in the name of foolish consistency...<br /><br />I like to recognize authors who have successfully created their own unique worlds in which their characters live and breathe. Tolkein achieved it with Middle Earth, Lucas creates new galaxies for the Star Wars saga and Adams has done the same in a few pieces of open fields surrounded by trees and a small river in the English countryside.<br /><br />It is more than a story about rabbits, it is also a story about the nature of government and the advantages of freedom of association. Far from perfect (one could easily edit out 50 pages wihout harming the story), it nonetheless draws the reader in to the rabbit warren. At the end, you just care about these rabbits!
0393317552|4.0|Mr. Diamond provides a thorough and enjoyable account of the origins of human society and the factors that determined the locations and natures of these societies. <br /> <br />Although at points theoretical (as any work of this scope is destined to always be) I found the evidence presented both entirely compelling and interesting. While there are those who would readily question the author's reliance on geographical factors as the sole influence on the development of human societies, I personally find the theory quite applaudable and impressive. <br /> <br />This timely work should play a great part in putting to rest the racist views long held by many who speculated on the factors influencing the development of human societies. <br /> <br />Very, very well done. The only reason I have not given the full five stars was I would have liked to see the section on linguistics elaborated on a little more (although it is more likely than not my bias alone, being interested in the topic).
B000805796|4.0|I am very impressed with the latest efforts from all of the former Spice Girls. I was very interested to hear the new album from Mel C, having loved the previous ones, and I am not disappointed. There are several hightlights on this album and it is a natural progression from Northern Star to Reason to this. The best songs, in my opinion, are; \\"Better Alone,\\" a wonderul and touching ballad, \\"Beautiful Intentions,\\" the rocking title track, \\"Good Girl,\\" a soft ballad that is sung with great emotion in her voice, \\"Last Night on Earth\\" and \\"Never Say Never.\\" I have to say that Melanie C has consistantly put out great albums and I will be listening to this for a while
B000002LRX|4.0|By this point, the instrumentalists had gelled into a tight unit, what little looseness may have been found on \\"The Real Thing\\" is gone, but most importantly, vocalist Mike Patton is clearly integrated into the band and is obviously more comfortable, both with himself and the material I suspect.  The result is stunning-- Patton delivers vocals of endless diversity, everything from straighforward rock singing, screaming, rapping, crooning, and even some of the vocalizations that became much more prevelent on his later work.   <br /> <br />The material on \\"Angel Dust\\" moves through a number of moods, and is at its best when its at its most experimental-- take standout track \\"RV\\", a song from the point of view of a middle-aged white trash father, spoken word vocals alternating with extraorindary singing over a countryish jazz sound, or \\"Small and Smaller\\", which pulls you in with its grunting bass and brilliant vocalizations and really is the sort of melodrama the band excels at. <br /> <br />Admittedly, there is quite a bit of straightforward material, but much of it is of consistently high quality (\\"Land of Sunshine\\", the haunting \\"Midlife Crisis\\", \\"Everything's Ruined\\").  In fact, what little is uninteresting is always saved by either great bass work (\\"Kindergarten\\"), vocals (\\"Caffeine\\"), or outside guitar noise (\\"Malpractice\\"). <br /> <br />Granted, there's a couple misses-- \\"Be Aggressive\\", with its cheerleader vocals sounds like a better idea on paper than it is on record and \\"Jizzlobber\\" is kind of a mess (although still fairly enjoyable), but all in all, this is a great album.  Recommended.
156224003X|5.0|This may sound like one of those self-help books that everyone makes fun of, but it contains some great insights that only a knowledgeable and reliable person could pass on to us. You will surely have many questions along the way (what is this zen? hypnosis? new age?) - my conclusion is that Kenny Werner embraces all these things or ideas but the stress is on you - and discovering your own greatness. The infinite is contained within you and it flows out from you and into you. If one can realize that from reading any kind of literature - then why not?
1400082773|4.0|Told from his earliest remembrance to his entrance to law school, Illinois Senator Barack Obama chronicles his coming-of-age story in Dreams of My Father. He lived under the shadow of a man for whom he was named but did not know; a man bigger than life and a man he did not meet until he was ten years old.<br /><br />That \\"Barry\\" struggled with his identity was no small wonder. He was the product of white mother and an African father living with white grandparents in Hawaii. As a teen he sought out other kids of African American descent, not always fitting in, always trying to find his place. However, Obama came from a family of love--- from both sides. His maternal grandparents bestowed affection and care on him, sacrificing and taking care of him. When he finally met his paternal siblings as an adult, they embraced him as an Obama.<br /><br />After living in New York after college, Obama found his calling in Chicago in organizing neighborhoods for action and independence. He turned down a well-paying executive position to run a program to roll up his sleeves and go in the trenches working with the poor and disenfranchised. After several years he decided to go to law school, but first he made the trek to the home of his father in Kenya. It was there among his brothers, sisters, cousins, and aunties, he came to know who Barack Obama, the man was. Although his father was dead, Obama learned of the the legacy, pain, hopes, dreams and demons of this man.<br /><br />I found the many pages devoted to his community organizing at times tedious yet my book club members, some of whom had worked in similar positions, emphasized the importance of these chapters in his life as it has been evidenced with his emergence as a national leader. However, the history and landscape of Kenya was at the heart of this memoir for this reviewer. An extra bonus to this updated version of this book first written in 1995 is Obama's keynote speech at the Democratic convention in July 2004. This is a story worth reading.<br /><br />Dera Williams<br /><br />Marcus Book Club (Oakland)<br /><br />APOOO BookClubThis is a story worth reading. <br /> <br />Dera Williams <br />Marcus Book Club (Oakland) <br />APOOO BookClub <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0060589051|2.0|I don't think a lot of people realize that Built to Last was published in 1994. It is only with the skyrocket popularity of Good to Great (published in 2001, but a bestseller in 2005) that Built to Last has re-graced bookshelves at all. The technical aspects of the writing are wonderful, weaving convincing arguments the way a high school lyricist weaves urban tales for his friends. And with the same result: the study doesn't hold up, especially not with the 11 years of hindsight we have on it. For starters, much of the research is on consistent growth and performance of specific companies against the general stock market, from 1926 to 1990. While the author correctly points out that this era covers a fantastic amount of change, he wrongfully dismisses that point, continuing to build his thesis on the shaky foundation that \\"what worked through the 1950's and 1960's is bound to work today\\". \\"Built to Last\\" is an interesting business history, but a terrible roadmap for success.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Wow, I just bought this yesterday but it is quite good... I've loved the Discovery album for a while now, and have wanted to get this dvd but just haven't seen it in a store any where... But needless to say, it's a very good package of movie and music... the anime seems to fit the music perfectly, and the idea is quite amusing and clever, a record company exec kidnapping an alien band and using them to make a hit record on earth... hehe, quite good... <br /> <br />but yeah, it's very enjoyable whether you're a big daft punk fan or not, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys dance music, anime, or both...
0694526088|3.0|Here's the thing about Good to Great: it's a well-written study that belies its underlying flaw - that it's a very tiny study. That is to say the entire set of core principles upon which the book is founded derives from just 11 companies. Now there are some great learnings from the leaders of those companies, don't get me wrong, but I'm not willing to stake my entire paradigm perception of good business models on such a small and dated study (it is now over half a decade old). For a much better look into successful managers and their behavior patterns, see Buckingham's \\"First Break All the Rules\\", which was a Gallup study of over 10,000 managers. Three stars: five stars for excellent research and writing, minus two stars for impact and size of study (and subsequent relevence).
B00005JM2I|4.0|I saw this movie the other night and I was quite impressed with a number of its' aspects.  What struck me the most was the symbolism.  There was a rather bold bit of sexual symbolism about a fourth of the way into the movie.  There was a scene at a marble quarry with our hero, Howard Roark (Gary Cooper), drilling away into the rock.  This image enraptures Patricia Neal who was watching from above.  She's back the next day with her riding crop (but no horse).  They banter back and forth visually like this culminating in a rather violent climax.  This series of scenes may seem corny to many but it is an example of what movies used to do very effectively; show suggestive material without hitting us over the head with us.  This is just the sort of artistic use of visual symbolism that modern American film directors seem totally unable to utilize.  Modern American film tends to put it all up on the screen for everyone to see.  Very little is left to the imagination with the result that most movies are unfit for juveniles to see.  I'm not sure I know many juveniles that would want to sit through \\"The Fountainhead\\" but there's nothing in the movie that would give it anything other than a \\"G\\" rating.  This despite the bold sexual imagery that it displays. <br /> <br />There is a lot of strong acting in the movie which is fitting because the movie is about strong individuals.  The storyline is that society represses the strength and artistic abilities of the individual.  The old adage; \\"to get along you have to go along\\" works to maintain the status quo.  The person with truly new ideas is chased out of town because society abhors change.  This is the premise at least.  I don't happen to agree with it.  Most of us recognize the moment we get married (if we didn't already know it by then) that compromising for the better good of all is the way that works the best.  Some may say that society has compromised way too much but the world view that \\"The Fountainhead\\" portrays getsto be a wee bit too totalitarian.  Nonetheless, the movie does an excellent job of portraying an eclectic group of individualists and makes a statement by showing the breaking point of each.  The one survivor is honored by a quite spectacular ending.  This may have been the ultimate in sexual symbolism.
B0007GAERG|5.0|THis is a great CD!! I loved it. After over ten yrs she still sounds great. Granted she doesn't have what she had with her first album, this cd goes with the times, and change in music <br />I havent stopped listening to it since i got it last friday.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|Okay, we're past the point that Nick Oliveri left and yes it is a sad thing because he was a good bass player. But Josh Homme felt it was the best move for his most mainstream project he has to offer. I would really be surprised to see Nick back but in all honesty this outfit have not lost a beat without him. <br /> <br />But this group really works. With former Danzig and Wasted Youth drummer Joey Castillo, Alain Johannes, Mark Langren, and journeyman guitarist Troy Van Leeuwan this group could do no wrong. Add in special appreances by Shirley Manson and Brody Delle on one song and Billy Gibbons on another and it makes one wonder how much pull Homme really does have. After all he attracted Dave Grohl to the band for some time too. <br /> <br />Oh yes the CD! Anyone who has a radio has probably heard the single \\"Little Sister.\\" But this song while of good quality is not the best song on the album by a LONG shot. IMO I find the solo guitar intro to \\"Everybody Knows that You Are Insane\\" leads me to not only like the song but keep pressing repeat. Same thing goes with \\"Tangled up and Plaid\\" and the much shorter and hooked \\"Medication.\\" Then there's the off-center \\"Burn the Witch\\" featuring Gibbons of the legendary ZZ Top. This is a rather unique song but the scruffy vocals of Gibbons cannot be mistaken for anyone else even if you have a deaf ear towards there music! Then there's the hit single which really should have made way for another song as the single rather. But one thing is for sure and that's the journey that unfolds on \\"Someone's in the Wolf.\\" Another unique title lends its self to perhaps a song which showcases the talents of the new QOTSA the best on the entire CD.  After that epic one it's easy to discount \\"Blood is love,\\" \\"Skin on Skin,\\" and \\"Broken Box\\" as filler which is far from the truth.  But the one song I do find overrated here is \\"You Got a Killer Scene Going There, Man.\\" Maybe I never dug Garbage or Distllers who knows. But \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" isjust that: long and slow. <br /> <br />I guess the short of the long is this: If you haven't bought this CD yet in the month it's been out then get it NOW. It's one of the few reminders that a rock band can be a rock band and not have to sell out, become a gimmick, or just scream until they vomit there vocal box's out. Lullabies is one strong effort and I look forward to the next Homme led QOTSA album in the upcoming years no matter who the line-up is!
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|Wow, this is an awesome album. I can't say much that hasn't been said before about this masterpiece from an artist who deserved much more success than he ever got. I agree that this may sound over-produced at first for those used to Clarks more folk rooted work but give it chance and it will sweep you away and stun you with its brilliance.

It's so bad that he needs to go back to grade school and learn how to speak again, then take singing lessons after 5 yrs atleast learning how to pronounce words and complete phrases.

I bet they're ugly just like their music, let alone their so called 'musical' talent. <br /> <br />Don't buy this garbage!
0393316041|5.0|\\"Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!\\" Adventures of a Curious Character is an awesome book about a nobel prize winning physicist named Richard P. Feynman, who encounters many interesting, and at times, unusual obstacles and adventures throughout the span of his lifetime. Mr. Feynman's crazy antics throughout this book remind me of a more professional Michael Richards (Cosmo Kramer, Seinfeld) but still with humor. The book starts with his life as a child with some short stories, to his college days, up to his assistance to the atomic bomb. This book is an awesome book for people from teenagers on up, and will always draw your attention to the book, wondering what crazy thing Mr. Feynman will do next.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I went to see this in the theaters the opening weekend on Haloween this past fall. I'd have to say that this movie is false advertising. Haloween movies have always been cheesy and bloody and thats how I like them. I was expecting this kind of urban horror movie with all sorts of nasty violence/blood and a decent plot. Dont get me wrong- I'm not a sick f***, but sometimes thats the kind of movie i wanna see. This was a serious dissapointment. \\"Saw\\" tried to pack way too much plot into 100 mins running time, confusing the hell out of me. The ending was absolutely awesome, it makes the experience not so empty and wasted.  If your looking for a gorefest, this aint it. Sure, it got an R in US 18A in Canada, but there's other horror movies at your local store that surpass this easily.If your looking for a movie to make you think, this aint it either. Confusing the viewer doesnt lead to thinking IMO.All in all, not what it tried to be or could have been. I honestly cant recommend this.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson has done it again! In A Sunburned Country was a delightful travel book that allowed me to picture each step as if I was there myself. I have always loved Australia and everything that comes with it. The comic nature of the book is really light-hearted and keeps the reader's attention. Although, he still does get serious at the appropriate times when talking about serious issues. The beginning was one of the main points that drew me to this particular book. It really made me think of how much people outside of Australia don't know about it. The descriptions of some places such as the train Bryson rode on found the Brightside of places that most would just pass up due to the containment or how undesirable they may seem. The vivid descriptions of places such as the Tree Top Walk really made me want to go and experience it for myself. I hope sometime soon I will see the places I unknowingly would pass up.
B0007WZUMO|5.0|After a 5 year excrutiatingly long wait, Trent Reznor is back and better than ever. For a man who's been in the music business for over 10 years, and dubbed the God of industrial, Trent never fails to impress fans with his angst-driven, yet in most cases, beautifully haunting music. From the classic upbeat Pretty Hate Machine, to the heavy hitting yet euphoric The Fragile, Nine Inch Nails has always seemed to cover just about every scrap of ground that one could cover, in the world of Industrial-Rock. With Teeth is somewhat of an exception though. Trent's new album seems like 5 steps backwards, covering what already was, but improving upon it with new material, and an actual live band backing up his vocals. That's right, Trent is no longer a one-man band, he actually has a live band backing up most of the songs on this new release. With Teeth, the former \\"Bleedthrough\\", is a 13 track regression, that covers what already has been in terms of sound, and a tad bit of new sound to add to the flavor of the album. With Teeth is an extremely adverse album, that goes from hard hitting, to upbeat, to melodic, and repeats the cycle numerous times.  <br /> <br />Almost every single track on this 2005 release has major replay value, and not a single song on the album, is bad nor doesn't belong. With Teeth has everything...melody for the lovers of melodic pieces, upbeat tracks for fans of Trent's early years, and hard hitting tracks for fans of disc 2 of The Fragile, and tracks such as \\"Burn\\", and \\"Starfu*kers, Inc.\\" If With Teeth had to be compared to any release that Trent has put out, it'd have to be a cross between Broken and The Fragile, which in my own personal opinion, are 2 of Trent's best releases to date. So with that said, you already know you're going to be getting good music on this disc.  <br /> <br />The subject mannor on With Teeth is for the most part, love-driven. The entire album is based on the ups and downs, of love. This may upset a few fans of Trent, as itmay seem like a midlife-crisis that Trent should've kept to himself, and it may also please other fans of Trent, as...well...the music is just really really good, and you just can't argue with that. Lyrically, this album kind of sinks to a low, and really doesn't offer anything devastatingly amazing, but still finds a way to capture the listeners soul, and send it to a land of angst and euphoria. Also, at times, the album can be lyrically redundant, and extremely saddening. But knowing Trent, this is something a typical 5+ year long fan of Nine Inch Nails, needs to learn to expect, or even has learned to expect. Trent just loves to repeat the same things over and over, and With Teeth kind of proves this. There are even at times, With Teeth song titles in other songs on With Teeth. This may show a lack of creativity, but it's well worth it once you take a listen to it.  <br /> <br />In the long run, With Teeth is going to be an album much debated amongst fans of Trent Reznor and Nine Inch Nails. Some will like it, and some won't. But don't let that stop you from atleast giving the cd a chance. I did, and it's now my 2nd favorite studio release the band (or therein lack of a band in most cases), has put out to date.  <br /> <br />Standout tracks on With Teeth include the following:  <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\", \\"Every Day is Exactly The Same\\", \\"Only\\", \\"Love is Not Enough\\", and \\"Right Where it Belongs.\\"  <br /> <br />Also, \\"Home\\" is an extremely beautiful song that is well worth the money for an imported version of With Teeth.  <br /> <br />The ***UK*** import of With Teeth, comes with \\"Home\\", and \\"Right Where it Belongs (Alternate Version)\\" and costs less money. 15 tracks in all. So I suggest getting it over this one, because in my personal opinion, With Teeth is a great cd, that needs no remixes as filler, just straight songs make it worth while. Remixes infact, might even make this album kind of tacky, and stray from the beauty that it holds. So I could do without aThe Hand That Feeds remix, and just be left with the other 2, which are actual songs, and not remixes. <br /> <br />With Teeth is a great effort by Trent Reznor, and fans of the The Fragile and Broken eras of Nine Inch Nails, need not hesitate, and give this cd a chance. Like it or leave it, it's been made, and it's not going to leave untill it makes its impact on the select few fans who enjoy it. <br /> <br />Give With Teeth a chance, you won't regret it.
B0007TX894|5.0|This is a great album from Porcupine Tree.  What I find ridiculous is that people are criticizing it for not being prog enough, or being \\"sell out,\\" or for not sounding like the albums they liked the most.  Here's the truth: PT constantly changes.  If you don't like that, find some more static band that can keep releasing what you want to hear.  So maybe this doesn't sound like you're favorite PT album. But does lightbulb sun sound much like signify?  Does signify sound much like sky moves sideways?  I don't think so.  This is still PT, no mistaking that.  However, PT is not a band that's going to stay the same. <br /> <br />So knowing that, I suggest that people stop trying to categorize everything and just listen to the music.  Here's the only categories you need: great music, good music, bad music, etc.  Is this album not prog enoguh?  To be honest, I don't even LIKE prog rock.  Now I am not an expert on the genre, but to me it seems pretentious.  Is this sell out commercial music?  NO.  There are a couple songs on here that go for about 10 minutes.  And anyways, is being slightly accessible really the worst thing?  I agree that in general commercial music is bad.  But if the music is good, who cares if it stylistically resembles a commercial act?  One reviewer commented that Lazerus sounds like coldplay.  Well true, it sounds a bit like coldplay, but it's a heck of a lot better and much more complex than any comldplay material I've heard.  Is it too metal?  Well I happen to be a metalhead who discovered PT on tour with opeth.  I think PT is a much better band than opeth, they are not even one of my favorite metal bands anymore.  I am into stuff like napalm death, suffocation-extremely heavy music.  So I don't think I can fairly judge on this point.  But I will say that only a few of the songs are even remotely metal.  The rest of it is pretty mellow.   <br /> <br />If you are looking for something to suit your particular musical taste, then there's a chance thatyou won't like this.  But if you just forget about your prejudices and listen to this with an open mind, I think you will find that it is great music.  Steve Wilson is not going to retrace his steps and make the same albums over again.  You can either accept that and listen to this album for what it is, or you can keep your mind and ears closed and miss out on one of the best albums that will come out this year.   <br /> <br />A great album.
B0007O38F8|1.0|THIS CD IS THA WHACKEST CD I HAVE EVER HEARD IN MY LIFE.DO NOT BUY THIS CD.NONE OF THE SONGS ARE EVEN WORTH LISTENING TO
B000002UCN|3.0|This is an oddball greatest hits album released by Capitol Records that includes seven Harrisongs from his tenure with The Beatles and six of his biggest solo successes. Although it might have been interesting to chart George's compositional development throughout his career, the fact that this \\"Best Of\\" only tells part of the story either way renders it hopelessly inadequate. That's not to say the record isn't worth hearing (with songs like \\"Something\\", \\"Taxman\\", \\"Here Comes The Sun\\", \\"For You Blue', \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"My Sweet Lord\\", \\"Dark Horse\\", \\"Give My Love\\", and the firery rocker \\"What Is Life\\" how could it not be?), its just that it doesn't do him any justice as an artist. I myself enjoy almost all of these songs (although the minor, Number 23 hit \\"Bangla Desh\\" hasn't aged well and, despite its beauty, as a Christian I can't really recommend Hari Krishna-ing along to \\"My Sweet Lord\\"), but wish to goodness that someone somewhere would compile an anthology worthy of Harrison's immense talent and output over the years. HIGHEST POP ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 31.
0156027321|2.0|While \\"Life of Pi\\" is very imaginative I found the entire story so sad and depressing.  Ususally with sad novels there is some value or moral that makes the story worth reading - I didn't find one in \\"Life of Pi\\", it was simply despair.
0553278223|5.0|Ray Bradbury's, The Martian Chronicles is a novel that is focused on one theme, but contains different stories.  The theme is the effect of humans exploring or living on another planet, Mars, which is already inhabited by Martians.  Throughout the novel, humans send four expeditions to Mars to explore the new world, but they are stopped or killed by the Martians. Several stories within the novel tell what life is like when the Martians no longer exist due to their extinction from the humans and how the new world is governed.  Soon, everyone wanted the opportunity to be able to start a new life on a new planet.  At first the wealthy and powerful were able to take a rocket to the planet and later anyone was able to live on the planet including African American slaves.  After several years of humans living on the planet, news breaks out that an atomic war is happening and humans begin to go back to their home planet in support.  The planet remains uninhabited except for one man who was left behind when the people went back to earth. This man begins to go mentally insane due to being so lonely on the planet and ends up wondering it.  Some short stories are encounters with the Martians in a different dimension, humans begin to see their dead loved ones, and the beginning of the migration by African American slaves to the planet.                  This novel is great for a person who enjoys reading science fiction.  In generations to come, the space exploration of the universe will begin to grow and humans may be able to sustain life on other planets.  This novel was written in 1950, and it is what Ray Bradbury pictured the future to be. The exploration of space in our future may be what the author pictured it to be in 1950.  The Martian Chronicles is a novel for any age that is able to comprehend what is happening within the short stories.  It may be difficult for a younger person to understand how the stories relate to each other and also understand the relationship of the stories to the theme of the novel. I enjoyed reading this novel.  It is one of the best novels I have read. What captivated me the most is the amount of mental imagery this novel brought to me.  Thinking of the future 50 years from now would almost be impossible.  The lifestyles of humans are constantly changing.  The fact that Bradbury had the ability to describe the future also captivated me as well.                  The novel has a several connections to the science and/or technology theme. In one case, the novel is based on the science of space exploration.  It is easy to see the differences between the launching of rockets to the modern day shuttle launchings.  The government spends billions of dollars on the NASA program to explore new worlds just like in the novel.  Humans have only been able to explore the moon and remote modules have been sent to the planet Mars.  In the novel, life existed on Mars as well as space exploration that explored even farther past Mars.  People used the planet's materials to build houses and in other cases, houses and cities were built as they are built today.  When people would leave the planet earth, they were limited to the amount of belongings they were able to take. What about the required materials and technologies to the build cities and the houses?  They were the main priority and were sent to the planet first. One short story is about a house that maintains itself and the family that lives there.  The house does the chores that a human would normally have to do.  Imagine a house of the future that is able to cook, cut the grass, and clean the house without human intervention.  Life for humans on earth would be much easier.                  The Martian Chronicles has a lot more connections to the science and technology theme, but that is for you to read and find out.  Enjoy reading the novel and follow your imagination while reading.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I listen to this when I want to unwind after a long, hectic day at work.  Each song is great to listen to.  I especially like to listen with headphones on, it realy intensifies the sound.  A must have for anyone!  You can't go wrong with this one...
B0007TKH66|2.0|I got these DVD's cause I like to think I model my life on Captain Kirk, and Scott Baculauriate was so cool in \\"Quantum Leap\\" I though he'd make a good role model for a couple of my kids, and on DVD I could take it to all their mammas houses when I visit on alternate weekends.   <br /> <br />My problem is that that vulcan just shows too much skin.  I mean, that one episode when they were supposedly covered in alien spores and start rubbing gel all over each other?  Well, I'm not too up on interspecies love, I got put in the drunk-tank in Mobile for that once, so I think it's setting a bad example for the kids. <br /> <br />I give it two stars because the the special effects are better than the first Star Trek, which don't make sence because this is supposed to take place BEFORE captain Kirk...
B000005ALN|4.0|This is such a sweet, more relaxed, kinda easy-listening record to me. Ever since I purchased this used 4 $7.99 @ CD Warehouse near Powder Springs in Marietta, I was amazed I had to copped it including Marvin Gaye's \\"In Our Lifetime\\" which I have which is awesome. After I got home, I started putting into the machine and try to see it's still good 'cuz I download the entire album off on Amazon.com several times and was not dissappointed. It's easier to stick with more than just one genre or one type of music which is rap and/or hip-hop. Sometimes it's easier to let go 4 a minute and try something new, Like Outkast when they put the multiplatinum plus CD Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, that changed everything. It helps me be aware about what I feel about the culture and what's the music that's bein played right now today. As with other releases like Ray Charles posthumous/final release Genius Loves Company, Marvin Gaye's sultry Vulnerable or Romantically Yours, Miles Davis' Kind of Blue, Kanye West's The College Dropout, Alicia Keys' Songs in A Minor, Queen Latifah's The Dana Owens Album, etc. they all have a different meaning on what is about in music history. So as w/ George Michael, he changes his style into a different way w/o ever being more offensive or overrated. I'm not gon get into the full detail on whether he's gay or homosexual, that's something I don't like to discuss at this moment, maybe later. Well back to the album on the 1st track of the CD \\"Jesus To A Child\\", GM speaks with his pleasures and pleasureness on walking w/ Jesus and how to follow Him and his footsteps you know based on the Bible, I actually love the melody and the lyrics that he speaks into his mind which is pretty good tho. Pretty good cut tho. And on the 2nd track \\"Fastlove\\" w/ a more funky R&B sound w/ a lil disco beat to it which kicks off a sample of Patrice Rushen (one of my all-time heroes and also my fav. artist as well) with the classic hit \\"Forget Me Nots\\" (I know ya'll heard of that 1), which the lady doin' the back-up while George does his on his own. I like that it's still one of my favorites. Ok on other songs like the title track, \\"Spinning the Wheel\\", the jazz-lounge influenced \\"Move On\\", the relaxed \\"You Have Been Loved\\" (Kinda reminds me listening to some oldies of similar artists like Al Hirt, Burt Kaempfert, Herb Alpert, Peter Nero, Frank Sinatra, etc. y'know those I just listen back then and is similar to the 1st hit which is all my fav. is \\"Jesus to a Child\\" or \\"Jesus\\" I'll say), Star People (pretty good on my resume and also I may jiggle out right here w/ a bang or a real groove or sumthin' y'knowwhattatalkin'about?), etc. are all that have a meaning to the message what we need in our curriculum to begin our history in the music business and in the music industry as well. I suggest you go check this out, and maybe check out albums from Nas (e.g. Street's Disciple, God's Son, etc.), Kanye West (The College Dropout), Alicia Keys (Diary of Alicia Keys), R. Kelly (e.g., Chocolate Factory, Happy People/U Saved Me, etc.), Quincy Jones (e.g., Sounds and Stuff Like That, Body Heat, The Dude, Q's Jook Joint, Back on the Block, Walking Like Space, Q Live in Paris circa 1960, etc.), Miles Davis (e.g., Kind of Blue, Porgy and Bess, Miles Ahead, Sketches of Spain, 'Round 'Bout Midnight, Birth of the Cool, etc.), Dave Brubeck (e.g. Time Out), OutKast (Speakerboxxx/The Love Below), John Legend (Get Lifted), Michael Jackson (Off the Wall), Jon B. (all albums I'll say incl. his latest Everybody Struggles, put out last year), Guru (I don't know maybe the same), as with Ronny Jordan (e.g. The Antidote, The Quiet Revolution, Light to Dark, At Last, etc.), and among others you may be a more aware to add into your music collection. This is a must have to those that are into jazz, R&B, blues, funk, etc. You'll love this. George Michael is one-of-a-kind artist who is so smooth, more underrated, real diverse, and more God-given like Stevie Wonder or RayCharles (those are 2 of my main artists and beloved mentors and role models.)
B0007GAEW6|4.0|This album overall, to me, sounds like some lost Yes record. And somehow that's a good thing.....Seriously...
B000006TRV|5.0|This CD is undoubtably one of the greatest albums of all time.  It is a timeless classic and will never be duplicated. I cant stand all of these kids bashing it because they cant understand what the words mean or why there isn't an explicit content sticker on the case.  It is unfortunate that people cannot sit still long enough to listen to some real music.
B0006L5RT2|5.0|An awesome album. Very chilled and mellow but you can't escape the lyrics they are passionate focusing in on Blunt's experience of love's in his life and also the time he spent serving in the British Army in Kosovo. My favourite on the album is `You're Beautiful' which just perfectly explains how you can fall in love with someone on the subway by just catching each other's eye, but never see them again. Will be compared to Damien Rice but a bit more up-beat than him and at least I understand the lyrics on Back to Bedlam. Plus such great art work on the CD sleeve, so don't miss out and skip to just downloading it.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|This piece of work is as stunning, complex, and beautiful today as it was on the date of its original release. Fiona Apple is one of those rare talents who's music, upon repeated listening, keeps getting better with each listen. All of these songs are musically superb, lyrically challenging, and unabashedly emotional. What so wonderful about Fiona's delivery is that she expresses rage and anger in her vocals while at the very same time sounding incredibly emotionally vulnerable and fragile. The production and instrumentation on this set of songs is timeless and incredibly well-done. As one might expect, the lyrics revolve around subjects of love, fear, anger, and relationships gone wrong, but refreshingly never sound contrived. This is a heart-felt rollercoaster ride and it's a wonderful listen. If you've gotten as far as wondering whether or not you should buy this CD, think no further and add it to your shopping cart right now.  I have thousands upon thousands of albums and CD's and I have to say that this is one of the finest recordings in my collection.
0375405380|5.0|President Nixon declares war on drug trafficking so in Culiacan, Mexico, United States DEA Agent Art Keller is assigned to destroy the evil empire of drug kingpin Don Pedro Aviles.  In his endeavor, Art meets and befriends Adan and Raul Barrera; not realizing that the two siblings are nephews of rising drug lord Miguel Barrera.  .  Meanwhile in San Diego Nora Hayden decides to get paid for what men want from her at about the same time that Manhattan's Sean Callan becomes a mob hit man.<br /><br />Over the next three decades the paths of these six people intersect several times until 1999 when a no longer idealistic Art sees his side losing the war on drugs with peers coming home in body bags.  He no longer worries about the line between the law and crime as justice is what he demands.  He plans to begin with his former friends the Barrera brothers.  As for Nora as Adan's mistress if she becomes collateral damage so be it even if that means Sean will come after him.<br /><br />Don Winslow provides a deep look at the war on drugs that seem a failure after three decades, which will lead readers to ponder the chances of winning the war on terrorism by military means.  The story line is action -packed though it occurs over three decades and is clearly driven by the key cast members especially the Barrera brothers and Keller.  THE POWER OF THE DOG is that rare thriller that has the audience on the edge of their seats yet analyzing the outcome in terms of the potential of a slow win of the war on terror.<br /><br />Harriet Klausner
B0006399FS|3.0|I have admired U2's musical output for many years and I love their ability to bend the rules and not neccesarily put out musically what everyone expects them to. Unfortunately with this release, it seems that the band simply tried to re-create the magic of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" with mixed success.  There are parts of this disc that shine. The electric crunch of \\"Vertigo\\" is undeniably infectious to anyone that likes to rock-out once in a while, though even that seems to mimic, granted with much success, the same guitar driven raging energy of \\"Elevation\\". The other songs on this CD though are simply quite average, not at all bad, just average. The songs fare better when played on their own than when played as an album in its entirety.  The songs all suffer from being too similar and halfway through the CD, you find yourself wondering if you've accidentally hit the track repeat button on your player.  Don't get me wrong folks, U2 on an average day, is better than most bands on their best day, but this CD is just plain dull.  Musically, the melodies on this disc tend to wander a bit too much and it also suffers from some really uncharacteristically clunky lyrics on a few tracks.  I think Bono and the boys would have benefitted from bringing in someone else to co-produce.  I wish they would have taken some chances with this record like they did with \\"Achtung Baby\\".
B0002EXH40|4.0|At this time in Megadeth's career, Megadeth had the great pressure of doing a followup to Countdown to Extinction. The pressure was great. Was it a worthy follow up to Countdown though? Sort of. It was kind of disappointing. Not really thrash anymore. A little more mainstream. Even though a few of the songs are letdowns, Train of Consequences and Reckoning Day are real good songs, but Victory is definately the best song off the album. Worth getting for megadeth fans, but for the casual fan, go for Peace Sells...But Who's Buying, Rust in Peace, and Countdown to Extinction.
0743454529|5.0|My Sister's Keeper was nothing like I expected. I usually choose light novels, more akin to the 'after school TV drama' genre. I can't express how glad I am that I read this book. I find it rare in novels to not be able to predict the outcome- I usually know what's coming but enjoy getting there anyway. This book turned the tables on me. Written chapter by chapter, from different family members point of view, the book delved into quite a few serious topics. There were times I felt things were left a bit unfinished or certain subjects or characters should have been explored further. However, 'My Sister's Keeper' reads a lot like life itself- somewhat choppy and not always clear. It depicts, in a rather unusual style, the dynamics among members of a family that has for years lived and grown together physically, but not emotionally. There are other wonderful reviews written here about 'My Sister's Keeper' that give an overview of the actual plot, so I'll end here. I highly recommend that you read this book. It evokes strong feelings, both positive or negative, and is sure to keep you thinking.
B000001G53|3.0|I got this back in 1990 -- the only recording of Parsifal available to me for a long while. <br /> <br />Being a very early DG digital recording, the sound is not wonderful -- there is a lack of clarity, but it is bearable. <br /> <br />But the biggest negative is the tenor Peter Hofmann.  Sadly, his singing is woeful!  He is all over the place with mile-wide vibrato.  There is only one note in the whole recording (in 2nd act) which he sings properly.  How DG and Karajan signed him up for a major Wagner recording escapes me. <br /> <br />Otherwise, Kurt Moll is good and the other singers are fine.  The orchestral playing is great when you can hear it clearly.  But the main tenor certainly spoils the whole thing.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|01. Rio <br />I've heard people whine and complain about how much they want the real, extended \\"Rio\\" song with the bizzarre introduction and the saxophone solo. This is where you get that song. No Duran Duran collection is complete without the full version of Rio. This is a great pop song and every time I hear this song I start to think about the overplayed video on MTV. Who can forget Duran Duran on a boat? This, shockingly, gets the silver medal on my scale. <br />--- <br />02. My Own Way <br />This gets the bronze medal on my scale. I'm not sure what version of this song you have, but I have the slower version. I'd actually prefer the faster single version of the song, but the slower version is just okay. It doesn't have the energy of the faster version, which is why I'm only giving it the bronze medal.  <br />--- <br />03.Lonely in Your Nightmare <br />I don't really find this one much of a heart-ripping ballad as Ms. Bessmer describes it, but it's kind of sad, I guess. The lyrics are beautiful, and the bass and guitar fit in beautifully. I think of this as one of the two songs on this album that are horribly underrated, and are one of those \\"Duran2 Hidden Gems\\".  <br />--- <br />04.Hungry Like The Wolf <br />This one ties \\"My Own Way\\" for the bronze medal. You're probably shocked at this. You're saying, \\"But why? This was Duran's most popular song?\\" My answer:Exactly. It was awfully overplayed. There's nothing wrong with the song itself;fits in with the rest of 'em beautifully. It's just the popularity of the song is overwhelming. You hear it everywhere nowadays. The popcorn-like arp is pretty darn neat in this song. <br />--- <br />05. Hold Back The Rain <br />Wow. I forgot how good this song was! The saw arpeggiator is neat as always, and the bass and guitar play in unison without flaw. The lyrics, perhaps, are the weak point on this song. They rhyme perfectly, but...they're kind of simple. Nonetheless, it's still a classic DD song and I was happy to hear them play it recently on their tour. It's good to know they don't abandon the classics! <br />--- <br />06. New Religion <br />Great, great song. This is where Simon's lyrical skills are put at a test. The grade they recieved was a solid A+ in my gradebook! The \\"New Religion\\" bassline is Number 1, I believe. Unlike what Ms. Bessmer states, I feel that John Taylor's basslines fit in perfectly. And, with all due respect, maybe someone else should write Duran's editorial reviews. The unison right before the chorus is spotless as always. Great job on this one. <br />--- <br />07. Last Chance on the Stairway <br />This one recieves the tie for the gold medal. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this song. The guitars, bass, keyboard, and drums all fit in perfectly with Simon's amazing vocals. <br />--- <br />08. Save a Prayer <br />Also tied for the gold. This song is the most beautiful on the album, and I would reccomend you get the single. I'm running out of space...so I'll make it short. Nice, beautiful, nice. <br />--- <br />09. The Chauffeur <br />Okay song. The bass and keyboards are great on this song... I really can't say much of this song, other than the vocals are beautiful. <br />--- <br /> <br />I have to compare Duran Duran to Star Wars. The first three albums were flawless. Then came Notorious, which was as good as Episode 1. Then, Big Thing, Liberty, Thank You, Medezzaland & Pop Trash were like Episode 2. Hopefully Episode 3:Revenge of the Sith will be as good as Astronaut and Wedding Album.
B000002LND|1.0|The role model for every talentless attention seeking waste of space in the whole inglorious world of pop. You have to admire her for making a fortune out of making monkeys of her poor duped fanbase. Her writing is worse than her acting , which is even worse than her singing. Her whole career a sustained exercise in sleight of hand.
076790592X|5.0|I had to read this book for a class and was not looking forward to it.  It looked like your typical best-seller sentimental garbage.  What I found in this easy read was something very deep and worthwile.  It is about a life filled with love in the ugly but very real face of death.  This book is very simple, but it tackles some of the biggest philosophical questions, including some mild buddhist and existentialist themes.
B0002O06N0|4.0|The Black Keys sure haven't felt like letting up on their third release, as they once again pound out their racous formula of persistent, fuzz-dominated blues-rock.  By keeping things primal as usual, the band splatters soul and circumstance across 13 blistering tracks that range from all out Mississippi stomp to poignant and sentimental porchside balladry.  Of course, there's still no bassist to be found, but Dan Auerbach more than makes up for that with his thunderous guitar wallop and Patrick Carney with his funky yet whiplash-inducing work on the skins.  New songs like \\"Just Couldn't Tie Me Down,\\" \\"Stack Shot Billy,\\" and \\"All Hands Against His Own\\" are sure to please current Black Keys disciples, while others such as \\"10 A.M. Automatic,\\" \\"The Lengths,\\" and \\"Act Nice And Gentle\\" (a splendid take on an obscure Kink's oldie) are poised to make believers out of the unconverted.  However, don't be fooled into thinking that this music is exclusive to blues enthusiasts as The Keys are first and foremost a rock n' roll band.  If you wanna move, groove, get down and dirty, and have a good ole time, look no further than the sexy delta stomp of RUBBER FACTORY.
B00001MXXH|5.0|the naysayers who seem to think that only someone who was a teen in the 80s will \\"get it.\\"  How could you not get it?  It's sarcastic, comic genius.  That is, if you have ANY intellect whatsoever and a sense of humor. <br /> <br />I didn't see this movie until I was a senior in high school myself, and I have LOOOVED it ever since.  It protrays certain humorous/ridiculous/ironic qualities of being in high school and coming of age--that do NOT change over time.  There is nothing in this movie couldn't be understood by a teen of the 90s or 2000s.  The only exception would be someone who goes into it thinking \\"This is a dumb 80s movie,\\" (which by the way, I think is an oxymoron).  heheh.  :)
B0007LCNKM|5.0|Matt Berninger's the modern day Morrissey, circa Smiths.  Wild lines of stunning impact and sing-song rhythms, unafraid to even sometimes approach show-tune emphasis in skip-ability, with low-key melody and deep, dark artsy truth.  The guy's a mike poet, like Stipe and Bono and all those 80's icons.  He stands and sings and turns and stumbles and drinks and smokes while putting out his heart in sad laments.  He's already getting hate reviews, just like Moz did back in the day, from people who hate anyone who shakes things up with oddball pop/rock poetry.  He really makes the band, though the rest are damn tight rockers and moody evocoteurs (cool made up word?) as well.  Do you dig finding a great album that will be remembered for years long before your closest pals, and then shoving it in their faces years later about how you were on to a really big thing long before their lame-o rusty ears were?  Cool.  Then buy this and memorize it.  No kidding.  It's real.  And Berninger's obviously just getting started.  The Chancellor.
B000002L7Y|5.0|Though I rarely listen to foreign music, in such a condition, this album 'hunting high and low' is one of my favorite foreign albums. Off course on the other hand, I always listen to Japanese music, however, I have the sounds tendency when I listen to music, that is, about over 90 percent of the genre that I listen to is 80' music. Though there are many reasons that I like such genre, the most important factor is because I was born at the latter period of 70' and I don't know about 80' music even if know about 90'. Now in Japanese music scene, the sounds is artificial mainly, so I am rarely moved by such music, in addition to that, recently the melodies of Japanese music is being destroyed, though I don't intend to deny recent music genre, basically I don't like such recent popular genre like hip-hop or rap music. Certainly, over the world in addition to Japan, digital sounds were main stream at the middle of 80' already, if I see the sounds by another aspect, the 80' digital sounds may be said 'artificial sounds' as recent sounds, but the main genre was pure pop or rock to the end, by such genre the beautiful melodies were maintained. Off course because I didn't touched to such 80' sounds at those days, real-time, when I listen to 80' music, even now I feel the moving things as if I listen to such music for the first time.     Off course I have known about A~Ha a little, the promotion video of Take On Me, too. When I watched the video, I was very moved though I can't express about the feeling well. Anyway, the animation that could feel 80' atmosphere was very good. Needless to say, the song has splendid beautiful melodies and vivid rhythm as I want to dance right away.     And at a day, when I walked at Amason.com, I had the interests to Hunting High And Low of the first album of A-Ha, though I was surprised to the high-rating of reviewers, surprised to many numbers of reviewers, and I got this album naturally after that.     Though I have had the image that they were one-hit single band, the image was changed completely, that is, all the songs included in this album have great sounds, they are just 80' sounds. Even if the listeners are not Norwegian nor American, can feel the great things, the truth is certified by my case, that is, their sounds have universal melodies and rhythms over the borders.     I am writing about 80' Japanese music mainly at Amason.com, if you have the interests about them, please.   Thank you for reading poor English.
B00003CX96|5.0|Breaking Away is one of the best movies of all time (really).  This movie is so brilliant and so beautiful on so many different levels and dimensions.  On the surface, the movie seems to be about cycling, but there is so much more.  It definitely captures that crossroads period in your life after high school when the possibilities are endless, yet slightly frightening.  Some of my favorite scenes are those between Dave and his father.  In one scene, Dave comes home from a race in which his idols (the Italian team) have shattered his dreams and begun to crumble his childhood innocence.  In tears, he tells his father: \\"Everyone cheats, I just didn't know\\".  And his father, unsure how to respond, can only pat him on the shoulder and awkwardly tell him: \\"Well, now you know\\".  In another later scene, Dave's father takes him through the IU campus and proudly shows him the results of his life's work, yet tries to convince Dave that his life can be better than his father's (as every parent wants for their child).  Then of course, there is the relationship between the four high school friends who are beginning to realize that high school (unfortunately) can't last forever.  The final race is a little cheesy and predictable, but by then it doesn't matter.  If you can only watch movies where something gets blown up every fifteen minutes, then you probably won't enjoy this one.  Otherwise, do yourself a favor and watch this one.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000K31Q|4.0|Okay, I lied in the title. I just thought it was clever. In fact, I enjoyed the movie very much. The acting was phenomonal, as was the plot. That's just me talking though. People who are new to the Shakespearian cover scene are introduced to characters who, for the most part, are easily identifiable. The high school's name is Padua, as is the town in \\"Taming of the Shrew\\". (Which, by the way, is where this movie took its plot from. Come on, everyone should know that by now.) I found the humor to be very substantial, meaning for the most part there was always something to keep me laughing. And that is important. While there is no Christopher Sly in this movie, it is probably for the best, as he hardly even had a role in Shakespeare's tale. So do yourselves a favor and watch the movie \\"10 Things I Hate About You\\". It's funny, well acted/scripted, and it counts as watching something educational because it's based on a Shakespearian play. Enjoy the show, for tomorrow, we die. Shakespeare Rules!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|First off let me say if you are a light hearted person this movie probably isn't for you.  The dvd itself has ok extra's.. it comes with 5 trailers and a music video. Now the movie is visually nice.  The story is pretty twisted and sick.. I am a huge horror fan but I have to say I was pretty disgusted watching this movie.. it has alot of torture scenes that will make your stomach turn and disturb your sleep if you are weak hearted. One of the things that makes this movie so disturbing is the fact that there are real life people that actually go through sort of the same chainings and torture that the charachters in the movie go through and that is very unsettling to think bout..  The acting I felt was ok.. it could have been done better.. the charachters don't show the emotion that you would expect a person to have under the cirumstances that they were in.. all in all I give this movie 5 stars because the plot is brilliant.. and the ending is soooooooooooooo unexpected that you'll find your self saying WOW once you see it.  Very .. very sick movie but a good one nevertheless.
0780628551|4.0|I think this is a great fun film! Intellectual types may be offended by its plot stretches and silliness, but it's one of my favorite sci-fi movies, both Johnny Depp and Charlize Theron are great in it!
B000002UAU|3.0|Sgt. Pepper's defined the era of the late 1960's. It was a phenomenon, a cultural event, the music that went beyond music's boundary. I remember a musician said in a documentary that he listened to this record again and again and wondered how they could make this kind of sounds.     However, those days of 60's psychedelia are long gone and Sgt. Pepper sounds too much outdated. I can understand some formatic aspects of this record (special effects, concept structure, theme of dream, drug, etc.) must have sounded revolutionary to 60's listeners' ears, and that shock have made this the greatest albums ever in rock history. But the very fact of that peculiarity of Sgt. Pepper harms its status as a timeless standard.     Most of the songs are actually in the rank of the Beatles' music. Some of them are truly great. \\"A Day in the Life\\" is a great song, still shocking and mind blowing. \\"Getting Better\\", which Paul included in the catalogue of his latest tour, is another strong rocker. \\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\" is the hidden gem that not many fans appreciate its greatness. \\"Lucy in the Sky\\", though I don't believe it is really that great because of its druggish laziness, is still a fine beatles song.     However, many other songs do suffer, which is quite extraordinary, considering this is the Beatles. \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" is interesting but silly. \\"With a Little\\" is cute but childish. \\"She's Leaving Home\\" is another (and repeated) attempt of classical music like \\"Yesterday\\" and \\"Elenor Rigby\\", but does not have such energy and nobleness. \\"Within You\\" is an almost disaster, too long, too exotic, too out of context. \\"When I'm 64\\" is another childish throw out. \\"Lovely Rita\\" is a mediocer song except the ending coda, which is quite strong.     As one can realize, most of these weaknesses come from Paul's overshadowing whole project. He is a music genius, with so much achievements and revolutions, but in Sgt. Pepper's, like his solo career stuffs, his music gets too flat and silly. It is a line of cheap melodies and shabby ideas. When Paul is too much involved or demanding, Beatles almost always gets lost in the way.     I heard this record in 1982 for the first time, so I was way out of the context of late 60's culture and so in a position that could render me a more objective view on the record. From the first listening, it was frankly not that great, and still it is not. I would recommend other great Beatles records to new generation who'd like to appreciate Beatles' music. If I would rank official Beatles albums, the top 5 would be;    1. Abbey Road : Alright, Paul was overwhelming in this record, too, but in a positive way. For me, this is the greatest, without any filler songs.     2. A Hard Day's Night : Great, great, great. You can feel the energy of rock music when it was pure and simple. No songs to throw out.     3. Rubber Soul : Romantic and personal. So beautiful.    4. White Album : A little unfocused effort, with a few experimentals. But overal, great record.    5. Revolver : Another drug record than Sgt. Pepper, but with more good songs like \\"Taxman\\", \\"Elenor\\", and \\"Tomorrow\\".     By the way, it is Rolling Stone that keeps on saying this is the greates album ever made. Other magazines, especially British, generally do not recognize Sgt. Pepper that great.
B00000K31Q|2.0|In comparison to then The Play The Taming of the Shrew, this movie failed to capture the true emotions of Kate, Bianca,and Pertuchio. The movie is portrayed as a love story with Patrick making Kate fall in love with him with his charm. But this is no where near the attitude of Pertruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, where he treats Kate very poorly in order to \\"tame\\" her from the way she has always been. He makes her fast and not sleep for an extended period of time by \\"killing her with kindness\\". However, the movie had a nice incorporation of Shakespeare Line throughout the movie and it was any enjoyable movie for the ordinary high school love story romance.
B0006GAI6Y|1.0|i would have given it two stars had i not watched the original Japanese version.  i simply feel sorry for those big stars who took part in this third-rate copy.  Watch the original one and you will see what \\"elegance\\" means.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|Love, like any other form of civilization, is a colorful stretch of surface.  Once you see a hole poked through it, your feeling will never be the same -you'll never see the surface in itself.   Unless you forget.  Yet men like to discover about what's opened before them, and then they forget, as a safety mechanism to their sanity.  <br />  <br />Some people whose forgetting mechanism has become so advanced that they become a slick professional in getting access to all these holes and cracks beyond the phenomena.   Instead of adding color to the phenomena, like what they do when they were young, they simply lost their feel and don't see a meaning to change what's on the surface.    <br />  <br />The surface is real.   <br />
0920668372|2.0|We received this book as a gift and my husband and daughter think its an ok book, so I am giving it 2 stars instead of 1.  Personally I try to avoid reading it and find it creepy!  The mother in the story only expresses her love while her child is asleep.  I understand the message of the story is unconditional love and the son is aware of and moved by his mothers actions.  But the book still seems to show a bizarre way to express love even if its only meant to be allegorical.
B00005JMK0|5.0|It would be a shame to let this movie go out the same way as our 8 tracks and 45's...we want it on DVD!
B00065MDRW|5.0|When this album first exploded into awareness in the autumn of 1969 I was at my first semester of college in the UK. It was considered then a must-own, an immediate classic of cool, the ultimate creative statement yet of hip, complex, progressive rock, an indication that this genre - our genre - had passed into full maturity and was now worthy to stand alongside all other serious art. A new chasm of depth and intellectual sophistication seemed to yawn open.  Pink Floyd began to look more like Hermans Hermits in comparison. Everybody, from radio guru John Peel downwards, \\"wowed\\" openly as they listened.   The band that made it went on to produce countless other albums through several incarnations over the decades that followed, but for me, while not downplaying their later achievement, nothing quite equalled this first one in its impact. For me this was acid rock England-style like no other, and listening to it now can still recreate the ambience of every trip, good or bad, that emanates out of that confused time and place. From the frightening fragmenting futurism of \\"Twenty First Century Schizoid Man,\\" across the broken nihilistic tinkles of \\"Moonchild,\\" and on to the languid pseudo-medieval gothic dreamworld of the title track, this album ranges through entire aeons of consciousness. It definitely belongs among my life collection.
B00000K0E5|5.0|Many people grow up with their thought of one man as James Bond, depending on when they were born. Some it was Connery, others it was Roger Moore, and for the youth of today it is Pierce Brosman. For many years I thought that Brosman was the only Bond, and this was the first I had ever heard of the famous series. Intstantly I fell in love with it. THe story the acting, the action everything was amazing, and still is. But as I became knowledgebal of the series I realized that Brosman is not he best Bond, Connery is, and Brosman is 4th best. <br /> <br />But lets move onto the good stuff in the movie. Out of the four Bond films that Brosman has made, this one is by far his best. Many people wondered how Bond could possibly be usefull after the end of the cold war, and the writers took this into account and made it a significant part of the script which I liked. The villian, former 008, played by Sean Bean, is brilliant, and the motive of revenge against James Bond, and his knowledge of his tactics made him an extremly entertaining foe for the Bond fans to watch. <br /> <br />Moving onto the women. All the women in the movie were amazing, but who can forget the great Xenia Onnatop (brilliant name, second only to Pussy Galore). SHe is so much fun to watch because of the way thay she kills people. I am not going to go into too much detail with it, but let's jsut say that she take great plesure in it.  <br /> <br />The chase seqyences are fun, and and diffrent from the majority of the series. Gone are the winding empty roads in the middle of nowhere, this time there are cars everywhere as Bond drives a tank through a city. <br /> <br />So if you want to have a fun Bond experience, and don't have the patience for the classica, this is the movie for you <br /> <br />THE GREAT ETNEBOB HAS SPOKEN
B0007XT7V8|5.0|I must be honest, i didn't know who theory of a deadman was until i went to the fair last year in saskatoon, Saskatchewan. I went there for default, but theory of a deadman was the opening act, as soon as i heard \\"leg to stand on\\" i was hooked! Lets just say that when default came on stage i went on rides. After the fair i went to the mall and bought their first CD, Then i found out they had a second CD out and i rushed to the store and bought that one too. I love all the songs on Gasoline, this CD is almost better than their first. Theory of a deadman are a great band, their even better live. If you love this band as much as i do then I'll see you on Friday at prarieland park in saskatoon where they'll be preforming and this time their not the opening act.!
B000002HRE|3.0|FUEL - a nice starter, lyrics are sub-par, but still kicks ass. 9.3/10<BR>DEVILS DANCE - a very mediocre song, the bass is very well done though 8.8/10<BR>THE MEMORY REMAINS - alot of people frown apon this one, but the truth is it is a excellent preformance on all parts with a great intro 9.9/10<BR>THE UNFORGIVEN II - unforgiven 1 and 2 have lots of similiarities, in the ways they both blow everyone away. 10/10<BR>BETTER THAN YOU - a very fast, strong song, the chorus nearly wrecks the song. 9.8/10<BR>SLITHER - not a very good song. 6.2/10<BR>CARPE DIEM BABY - nice song, sort of a disapointment though. 7.7/10<BR>BAD SEED - another mediocre song. 7.4/10<BR>WHERE THE WILD THINGS ARE - a masterpiece from the head of jason newsted, this song is different for the better this time 8.8/10<BR>PRINCE CHARMING - nice riffs, nothing more 7.9/10<BR>LOW MAN'S LYRIC - very slow nice song and relaxing (most of you might not want that in a metallica song) 8.5/10<BR>ATTITUDE - heavy and fast. 8.1/10<BR>FIXXXER - nice closer, not as good as previous ones though 7.5/10
B000089RV6|4.0|Obviously this is one of the greatest rock & roll recordings of all time.  So that is why I decided to buy this \\"remastered\\" version.  Maybe it is the 'digipak' 2 channel mixdown that the glaring yellow label on the shrinkwrap extolls as virtues or some of the other reviews on Amazon that compelled me to buy this classic with \\"higher\\" audio quality. <br /> <br />Well let me tell you I have quite a home system & car system & this mix is shrill.  I feel if you already own the original than you would be better off keeping it sonically.  The highs are rough at best.  I will admit the low end is beefier though.  But overall this CD is sonically LACKING. <br /> <br />So the material gets a solid 5 from this 40 year old rock & roller.  But as far as the mix'down' remaster I think I will wait until they try again & get it right with the sound.  Peace............
B00000J7M0|5.0|I have been searching for Accepts Staying a Life 2CD set for the last 15 years!<br /><br />Unlike the American version the German Import is much better and has an additional 4 tracks on it.<br /><br />The additional songs that are missing from the American release are:<br /><br />Head Over Heels<br /><br />Burning<br /><br />Neon Nights<br /><br />Outro (Bound to Fail)<br /><br />Also the American version is not a 2 CD set.<br /><br />If you are a hardcore Accept fan, I recommend you buy this 2 CD set before you buy the American version.<br /><br />May be expensive, but well worth the money.

B0006MT314|1.0|Other than the fact that this soundtrack has \\"Overdue\\" by The Get Up Kids from their album On A Wire and \\"Kill\\" by Jimmy Eat World this thing sucks.  I mean honestly it has a cover version of \\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" this song is maybe 4 years old and was original written and released on \\"Gold\\" by Ryan Adams.  This version is a bastardized version and sounds like any other acousticish nu metal song.  Gavin Degraw were do I start?  This guys voice is as annoying as they come I rank him up there with other phrat boy singer songwriters like Jack Johnson, Dave Matthews, and Ben Harper.  Then we get to Story of the Year, one of the worst bands in the pop punk/screamo category to date.  These guys have ripped off ever good band I know in the catergory and made their songs into nu metal songs with goofy lyrics.  This cd is a turd go buy Jimmy Eat World \\"Futures,\\" The Get Up Kids \\"On A Wire,\\" and Ryan Adams \\"Gold\\" and leave this waste of money alone.
B000002NIW|5.0|This is the first cd that I ever purchased when I got my first job(with my own money that is), and I believe that there is no other album on which my money would've been better spent.  The deftones single-handedly changed the way I listen to music, and continue to do so to this day.  With that being said, I really do believe this is their finest work.  Some would say that white pony is their best, and all of the big three (adrenaline, around the fur, white pony) are absolutely amazing in different ways.  Adrenaline has raw, somewhat unfocused power (that a debuting badn should have).  Around the fur is more focused, and  the album just flows a little bit better than adrenaline.  White pony is easily their most experimental work (coincidentally their best selling also), but still doesn't fail to have the trademark deftones \\"feel\\" (and if you listen to the deftones, you know what I'm talking about).  Around the fur just stands above the other two to me just by having songs that stick out more in my head.  The entire album is phenomenal, and I honestly don't think it has a bad track or \\"filler\\".  Some are stronger than others of course.  My favorites are Dai the flu, damone, lhabia, my own summer, and lotion.  Can't wait for their new album! (supposedly due out this fall)
1573223085|4.0|Run, don't walk, to pick up this book. In one fact-driven yet fun read, Pink tells a compelling story of the decline of the Information Age (driven by our penchant for left-brain thinking) and the rise of the Conceptual Age, where an equally developed right-brain is REQUIRED for survival and success.  <br /> <br />As business people and as human beings, we are trying to make a living in a world increasingly driven by Automation, Asia and Abundance. Every professional and business leader thus will inevitably face the following questions:  <br /> <br />Can a computer do what I / we do faster?  <br />Can someone overseas do what I / we do cheaper?  <br />Is what I / we are offering in demand in an age of abundance?  <br /> <br />Abundance here refers to what Pink describes as the satisfaction, if not over-satisfaction, of the material needs of millions - thereby boosting the desire for significance, beauty and meaning in the marketplace. As costs decline and quality goes up for every product or service that can be automated or outsourced, the only real differentiator becomes what cannot be duplicated - relationships, empathy, artistry, purpose and soul.  <br /> <br />These unique qualities are the territory of our right brains - the other half of that amazing organ in our heads that we too often to ignore in business today. The good news? Neuroscientific research over the last decade gives us much room for hope - rather than being locked into our current thinking habits, even as adults our brains can be re-trained to think a different way. Pink concludes the book by offering practical ideas for anyone to develop six critical right-brain capabilities: design, story, symphony, empathy, play and meaning.  <br /> <br />A quote from the book is that \\"Perspective is more important than IQ.\\"  My work in Fortune 100 companies with senior leaders constantly shows me the truth of that statement.  The answers to the thorny questions of our times lie not in more data dredging to determine if issues like global warming are real or not. As another chap from Atlanta once said, \\"Frankly my dear, I don't give a @#*!  The more powerful question is what is the kind of world I really want to live in?  And how can I use my brain -- all of it -- to create that world and keep it vibrant, healthy and beautiful?
0316172324|2.0|While this book has some fascinating sections (see the section on autism, as well as the opening chapter) mainly I found Mr. Gladwell's latest release to be boring overall.  Some of his examples of 'thin slicing' were far fetched to say the least, and he did not explore the other possible reasons behind the failure of certain of his examples.  Read it for a book club, and everyone else liked it to give the author credit... but I won't read any of his other books on my own.  After the interesting first chapter I was expecting better, and was let down.  And there was absolutely no reason to include every muscle twitch in the body language section.
B0006399FS|4.0|I think this is an excellent disk by U2. Vertigo is as hard-rocking as any U2 cut, although it may have suffered from the iPod hype and commercialization, but this number rocked in concert. Since I just attended the Seattle 1 show, I thought I would do the review while it was still fresh in my head, so this review is part disk and part concert. What impressed my is that a band that has twenty-five years worth of back catalog could play seven cuts of their most recent album, and the audience was singing along with every one. \\"Love and Peace or Else\\" is a rousing arena anthem, intensified by tribal drumming. \\"Miracle Drug\\" is a tender song about science and healing, and the need for science to continue finding new ways of healing. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On your Own\\" is a moving tribute to Bono's father.<br /><br />U2 have proven their relevance with a resurgence that began with \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind.\\" The band has returned to a back to basics, leaner sound than \\"Zooropa\\" and \\"Pop\\" yet still owes allegiance to that period of experimentation. Also, the social and political voice is as strong as ever. \\"Love And Peace or Else\\" is a powerful anti-war anthem.<br /><br />\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" features a simple yet beautiful piano line intertwined with the guitar melody. This is a \\"love song\\" of depth that will have you moving to the rhythm and wanting to sing along with the chorus.<br /><br />\\"All Because of You\\" is a harder rocking piece with another catchy chorus. Few bands can provide the number of standout cuts that U2 brings, and this is the first six songs!<br /><br />\\"A Man and a Woman\\" is a more acoustic based but uptempo love song. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\" features the signature Edge guitar sound.<br /><br />U2 closes the disk with three powerful tunes that reach deeper into self-examination and spiritual search. \\"One Step Closer\\" is a heartache/heartbreak ballad, but with a glimmer of hope. \\"Original of the Species\\" is a Bono love song where he places woman on a pedestal, as he has done before, but the feelings are earnest and the emotions are clear. \\"Yahweh\\" is the spiritual closer, but more uptempo than the usual U2 closers, with shimmering guitars and soaring vocals that give one a sense that things will be better.<br /><br />This is a great set and time will tell if it becomes a classic.al, as he has done before, but the feelings are earnest and the emotions are clear. \\"Yahweh\\" is the spiritual closer, but more uptempo than the usual U2 closers, with shimmering guitars and soaring vocals that give one a sense that things will be better. <br />This is a great set and time will tell if it becomes a classic.

B00000AFFF|5.0|I find this 1998 album irresistible. Burt Bacharach composed some of the best pop music in the sixties and early seventies, but when he broke up with longtime collaborator Hal David, he seemed to lose his way artistically, especially as he veered toward overproduced dreck with then-wife Carole Bayer Sager. Unfortunately his music still charted, so he had no motivation to come back to the type of pop music  he does best.  In fact, I thought he was exiled into a permanent retro-deification state until I heard this disc. Paired most uncharacteristically with Elvis Costello, Bacharach the composer sounds rejuvenated on this recording as if the last thirty years did not even occur.  The momentous orchestra swells, the piano key tinkling, the unmistakable flugelhorns, the gossamer female background vocals and above all, the sweeping, unapologetic romanticism - they are all back in stylish, timeless form with some fresh, intricate lyrics courtesy of Costello, who sings with surprising vigor without a hint of irony or unwarranted nostalgia.<br /><br />Each song is a gem. \\"In the Darkest Place\\" starts things off in a dusky mood with an intoxicating piano dictating the cocktail lounge rhythm. \\"Toledo\\" is a bouncy though more melancholy cousin to \\"Do You Know the Way to San Jose?\\" with its geography-driven lyrics. \\"Tears at the Birthday Party\\" has the silliest, double-entendre lyrics this side of Jimmy Webb's \\"MacArthur Park\\", but it has an infectious beat and a soaring chorus that its lightheartedness provides a welcome respite. The title track is a lovely ballad driven by a piano and guitar that reminds me fondly of \\"Alfie\\" with its escalating strings and swooning notes. \\"The Sweetest Punch\\" is pop music at its catchy best with a ringing bell response to Costello's crooning of \\"You knock me out/It was the sweetest punch/The bell goes...\\". Both \\"This House Is Empty Now\\" and \\"What's Her Name Today?\\" are powerful ballads that will remind you immediately of Bacharach classics like \\"A House Is Not a Home\\", \\"A Message to Michael\\" and \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\". Regardless, the closing track, \\"God Give Me Strength\\", is the artistic high point and the initial reason why Bacharach and Costello partnered for this recording. Written for Allison Anders' 1996 faux-Carole King biopic movie, \\"Grace of My Heart\\", it was a poignant moment when the Denise Waverly character sings this ballad with such uncertain yearning and romantic fervor that the faux-Brian Wilson character could not help but be impressed enough to sign her up for his label. While I still prefer the more plaintive Kristen Vigard version (to which Ileana Douglas lip synched in the film), Costello sings with a surprising emotional wallop wrapping his voice around a full orchestra led by a mournful trumpet that provides the appropriate crescendo to this masterful recording. Strongly recommended.use Is Not a Home\\", \\"A Message to Michael\\" and \\"One Less Bell to Answer\\".

Candy Shop sounds almost identical to Magic Stick (Which was waaack!), which was overplayed (And included a lackluster collab from the underrated Lil Kim).

B00005O3VC|4.0|With the opening of Mike Nichols' and Eric Idle's \\"Spamalot\\" on Broadway last month, it's a good time to revisit the 1975 comedy classic that inspired the musical. Thirty years have elapsed since its original release, but it is still a movie that veers wildly back and forth between hilariously inventive and downright silly.  If you can hold on tight, it's a worthwhile ride. Almost arbitrarily about a band of adventurers looking for the famed Holy Grail, the movie is just an excuse to create a nonsensical world steeped in medieval history and comically ironic violence. Directed by Terry Gilliam and Terry Jones, it is typical Monty Python fare, which means a lot of clever wordplay and elaborate sight gags with big payoffs. The story begins with King Arthur and his page Patsy galloping on their invisible horses with their clapping coconut half-shells, as they search for worthy knights to take back to Camelot. From there, we meet a cast of characters that only makes sense in Python-land: an increasingly armless and legless Black Knight with a chip on his shoulder, a big Trojan Horse-like wooden rabbit, some disrespectful Frenchmen, castle-bound nymphomaniac maidens, the knights who dare to say \\"Ni!\\", a pedantic historian in the present day and even God, who seems rather impatient with the befuddled knights as He explains their quest for the Holy Grail. Amid these disparate elements, the film holds together as a clever satire on blind pious ignorance and the unquestioning acceptance of organized religion. The pacing gets sluggish toward the end, but the conclusion is riotous and just in time.<br /><br />Well packaged, the two-disc set has several extras. The main menu on the first disc is funny in itself with an option for the hard of hearing. There are two alternative commentary tracks. The first is newer and features Idle, John Cleese and Michael Palin; the second was recorded much earlier with Gilliam and Jones. Both are informative but only fitfully funny since they defer to the movie. The second disc has \\"Mindless Sing-Alongs!\\", where three scenes are taken from the film and subtitled so that once can sing along to the amusing \\"Knights of the Round Table\\" (which inspired the Broadway show title, \\"We dine well here in Camelot, we eat ham and jam and spam a lot.\\"), \\"Sir Robin\\" or chant along in \\"Monk's Chant\\". There is a hysterical little \\"educational\\" short entitled \\"How to Use Your Coconut\\" and two scenes dubbed in Japanese. But the highlight is a 45-minute documentary called \\"The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations,\\" in which Jones and Palin explore the various film locations with humor and a sense of deserved nostalgia. Other features include a mock interview with the cast done during the filming, a Lego version of \\"The \\"Knights of the Round Table\\" song and various sundry features suitable primarily for a Pythonite. For non-Pythonites, the film is still worth a look at a comedy that only looks better with all the witless dreck produced now.y defer to the movie.

B0002XDODU|5.0|Reise, Reise isn't quite the same as the previous albums due to the fact that they are a constantly-changing (evolving?) force.  One simply cannot peddle the same songs of yesteryear in another format like metal god Metallica.  They needed to make a different sound in order to not be grouped with the other bands. <br /> <br />One can say that Reise, Reise is a mix of Herzeleid and Mutter, since Herzeleid was more raw in terms of metal and had less electronic influence than Sehnsucht.  Mutter is arguably their best album, with its haunting riffs and catchy beats, even though the subject matter can be objectionable at times - if you are more interested in their music, then this really shouldn't matter. <br /> <br />The CD opens up with the exerpt from the \\"flugrekorder nicht offnen\\", which is based on the Dalai Lama and His fear of heights (track 3).  The CD art deviates from the usual practice of showing the band members, i.e., in a concert or posing, like in Sehnsucht or Mutter.  It instead shows what appears to be plane wreckage, signifying that there is more to Reise, Reise than we know. <br /> <br />The instrumentals are great, starting out with the accordion, then Schneider hits the drums so you'd know something is coming; pauses like these help build the momentum (like in Sehnsucht's Du  Hast).  Then the electronics enter with their own solo, eventually joined by what sounds like men rowing oars.  After that, what either sounds like an orchestra (Like Mein Herz Brennt) or skillful keyboard manipulation blossoms into the full song.  What an excellent beginning to new CD. <br /> <br />The song Reise, Reise is actually based on \\"Seemann\\"- from Herzeleid.  It talks about the battle between the two \\"Seemann\\" and another battle between them and the fish. <br /> <br />Mein Teil is a dark contrast to the song before it, while Dalai Lama incorporates a male choir.  Keine Lust has the same feel of Ich Will (from Mutter), but with different overtones and an overall different sound.  Los stands out, mostly because of the fact that it sounds like classic 1970's southern banjo rock, but has a deep message, nonetheless.  In Los, they mention that \\"They used to be voiceless, but now have a voice\\".   <br /> <br />Next comes the humorous Amerika, with tongue-in-cheek jokes such as these: <br /> <br />We're all living in Amerika <br />Amerika ist Wunderbar <br />........ <br />Coca-Cola, wonderbra <br />... <br />Coca-Cola, sometimes war <br /> <br />Then they talk about the beauty of Moskau, followed by a woman's feeling of ugliness in Morgenstern.  Stein um Stein is basically about walling someone in and has slow grandeur, exemplifying the fact that what he's doing (in the song) is very slow.  Afterwards, Till Lindemann mourns his loss in Ohne Dich, then says an apparent \\"F$$$ you\\" to love in the end, much like ACDC's Back in Black CD in the end and how they said \\"Rock and Roll will never die\\", telling the people who were against such antics and music to pretty much do the same thing Till told love in the end. <br /> <br />All in all, I recommend it.
B000005H7D|5.0|like Kind of Blue, Blue Train is a terrific jazz album that creates spellbinding interest throughout.  It is not as good as Kind of Blue (what is?) but it is right up there on many lists.  I would recommend getting this as an introduction to Coltrane's music, and if you like it a lot (which you will) I recommend getting A Love Supreme also, which is held in higher regard than this one (I can't say if it is better or not, I haven't heard it yet).  On all accounts get this cd, its cool jazz.  And of course, get Kind of Blue before you start buying any other jazz cds
0767834739|3.0|First of all, I need to get my biases out of the way.  I have followed and played almost every Resident Evil game (both good and bad) from the very first one on the Playstation through the latest and by far the greatest on the Gamecube.  When I heard they were making a Resident Evil movie, I was uncertain of how I felt; were they going to remake a game into a movie or would they create a movie that fit into the Resident Evil mythos?  The first movie did the latter, introducing new characters while fitting pretty nicely into the mythology of the RE videogames.  It wasn't a great movie by far, but it was at least quasi-faithful to the series. <br /> <br />Now we have Resident Evil Apocalypse which falls into the former category as it takes familiar characters and incorporates basically parts of Resident Evil 2 and 3 into movie form.  Unfortunately, it falls flat for me.  On one hand, I was thrilled to finally see the Nemesis on the big screen.  Being the unstoppable killing machine that he is and spouting that famous gravelly line, \\"STARS!\\" I was immediately excited to see the movie but I was worried how they would incorporate Alice from the movie with Jill from the video game.   <br /> <br />To be faithful to the video games, you can't.  It's that simple.  By having this movie, it's as if Resident Evil 3 never took place.  It takes the premise of the movie: people trapped in Raccoon City with zombies and the Nemesis, and completely changes the story.  Every time I started to get pulled into the movie, something would happen that would make me go, \\"wait, that didn't happen in the game.\\"   <br /> <br />That said, my friends who haven't played any of the Resident Evil games had a fun time.  I think those who haven't played the video game will have a better chance of enjoying it.  Although, video game aside, I think the action is pretty stale and there's not a build up of tension like in the first movie.  I enjoyed RE 1 much more than this sequel and so did my friends (both RE junkies and not).  However, this movie and this series is much much much better than the majority of video game adaptations.  With movies like House of the Dead and Alone in the Dark, even this movie stands as a king above them which is kind of sad.   <br /> <br />At any rate, not as good as the first, not very faithful to the video game series and not very thrilling.  But, it can be enjoyable for a rent or to see the Nemesis in a movie.  Hopefully the third movie RE Afterlife will take place before Resident Evil 4 (the game) and won't deal *directly* with any of the games.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|this show is very addictive....i'm mad i missed the first couple of episodes...believe me if u watch it u will get addicted....there are some many hidden clues and new discoveries...so if u like mysteries u'll love this show!!!
B00000FC5H|5.0|Throughout the 70's a group known as Earth Wind & Fire brought happiness to the radio waves and the dance floors.  This group had some outa-sight funky songs that made you tap your foot and roller skate to the rhythm.  Their songs, reflecting the innocence of the era, were colorful and upbeat.  The direction and genius of Maurice White was responsible for making this funk possible.  Vocally, they were a soulful chorus with Phillip Bailey's falsetto leading throughout most of these songs.<br /><br />The opening number \\"Shining Star\\" is more than a far-out funky tune.  Just listen to that vocal blend and that rousing arrangement.  \\"That's The Way of the World\\", \\"September\\", \\"Sing a Song\\", \\"Mighty Mighty\\", \\"Saturday Night\\", and \\"Get Away\\"  are trade mark songs of the group.  Nobody can remake these or has even tried.  Yet, the group has successfully recorded other's songs like \\"Can't Hide Love\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\".  The highlights that deserve giving more than a quick listen are \\"Fantasy\\" which is a gorgeous blend of voices,  \\"Kalimba Story\\" which a totally original song written by Maurice White, \\"Reasons\\" which is a gorgeous love song with Phillip Bailey in the lead vocal, and last, but not least, \\"After The Love Has Gone\\" which is a very fine ballad.<br /><br />One cannot leave out the musical arrangements that accompany the vocal group of Earth Wind & Fire.  While it is extremely rare today to find comparable talent on a recording, it was also quite rare in the 70's era to find such artistry on studio recordings.  But this is what added to the group's sound and what made them so popular.  There were rich sounds from not only keyboards, guitars, drums, and saxophones, but instruments that brought the full experience:  trumpets, trombones, congas, flutes, violins, violas, tubas, harps, and timpani.<br /><br />This collection of songs is fun for those who remember the funk era and fun for those who just want to experience enjoyable, upbeat music.  A must have treasure!!!A must have treasure!!!
B00005N7Z1|4.0|Robocop was one of the two mega-science fiction movies to hit theaters in 1987. The other was Arnold Scharzenegger's Predator. Predator was expected to be a big hit before it was even released, while Robocop became a suprise hit at the box office. In addition, Robocop's fame transcended move theaters, and soon Robocop served as the inspiration for toy action figures, an arcade game, a Nintendo Entertainment System game, and a pinball machine. <br /> <br />The original Robocop is easily one of the top science fiction films of the 1980s. The DVD edition, unfortunately, does not live up to all it could. The only extras are three trailers. It would have been nice to see some footage on the creation of Robocop's well done special effects, such as the designing and creation of ED-209. Also, the DVD transfer does not have the greatest picture quality. The picture quality seems more along the lines of VHS than DVD.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Robocop succeeds in large part due to its adrenaline-pumping action and shoot outs. Robocop's haunting memories of the life of a murdered Detroit police officer, Murphy, add some nice humanity and drama to the intense action. I love the Robocop theme music, which plays whenever the cyborg is crusing the streets of Detroit in his patrol car.
B000040OBS|5.0|Yes, you read correctly - Suicide's first record is more important than any record you have ever heard.  Vega\Rev cross pollinate the classic and avant rock traditions (think Elvis and the Velvet Underground mixed in the cauldron of NYC 60s electornics)creating a music that essentially obliterated \\"rock\\", a blow from which the beast has never recovered.  If the opening pulse of \\"Ghost Rider\\" and the end times scream of \\"Frankie Teardrop\\" don't change how you hear music - you aren't listening......
B00000J7JO|5.0|probably the songs on here are the most beautiful songs they ever made.  touching, arranged perfectly, with elements of funk and soul only RHCP could have crafted.  This album was my introduction to the band, and I recommend it wholeheartedly for new fans.  There is no way in the world that you cannot enjoy all the tracks here, they are just put together so well.  This album made them really popular with teens today, more than any other album of theirs.  just get it, its absolutely wonderful music.
B0002J4X1Q|4.0|I have played almost every Resident Evil game that's come out from the first to the latest and greatest Resident Evil 4.  When this movie came out I was pretty hesitant.  Would they do a remake of the first game or would they create an entirely new movie?  And which would I rather they did?  Having seen this movie and the second movie's attempt to incorporate actual video game parts and movie parts, I must say I'm relieved they didn't remake the first Resident Evil movie. <br /> <br />Instead, they created new characters and created a semi-backstory to the events of Resident Evil the video game.  And, also surprisingly, it works pretty well!  What helps is that we have two cool actresses, Michelle Rodriguez and the always enjoyable Milla Jovovich.  But what also worked for this movie is the tension and suspense that built from the very beginning to the exciting climax. <br /> <br />At the beginning of the movie, we have fully clad men and women ready to kick ass but through a series of events, they end up losing lives and most of their ammo.  That is when the true Survival Horror that the video game stands for begins.   <br /> <br />Now granted this movie is a rip off of many different and better sci-fi and horror films from Alien to the countless zombie films that have been made.  But what it lacks in originality, it makes up in style.  The action and violence is pretty stylized and it was fun to pick up some RE connections.  You're not looking at an Oscar-winning movie of course, nor is it as good as some of the zombie movies out there (28 Days Later, both versions of Dawn of the Dead, etc) but for what it is, it is very well done.   <br /> <br />And, for whatever you can say about the movie in a negative light, Paul Anderson handles the subject matter much more deftly than Uwe Boll could ever do with his own Alone in the Dark and House of the Dead films.  So far, Resident Evil stands tall as the best and, sadly enough, most faithful video game movie yet.  That'snot saying too much, given the competition, but it's still a fun, mindless romp through familiar territory.  And it could have been a lot worse.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Set in Paris in the late 19th century, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" traces the relationship of the young opera singer Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum) and her mysterious mentor whom she calls her \\"Angel of Music\\". This angel turns out to be none other than the Phantom of the Opera (Gerard Butler), a disfigured musical genius who has been haunting the opera house for years, pestering the managers and the prima donna, Carlotta (Minnie Driver) and secretly falling in love with his student. When Christine's childhood sweetheart, Raoul (Patrick Wilson) shows up, the Phantom takes drastic measures to ensure that Christine will be his.    The production features dazzling costumes and scenery. Strong performances are given by the cast, especially Patrick Wilson, Minnie Driver, and Simon Callow and Ciaran Hinds (as the new managers, Mssrs. Andre and Firmin). Emmy Rossum, as the ingenue Christine, leaves much to be desired. Her voice is too underdeveloped to handle the role and she bounces between three different expressions thoughout the whole movie.     The movie owes much to the performance of Gerard Butler, who faced heavy criticism while the movie was in release. In addition, far too much as been made of his attractive physical appearance. Both of these factors should be disregarded when watching this film. Prettiness aside, he is entirely believeable as a man who is consumed with self-loathing on one hand and total obsession on the other. His singing, though rougher than Michael Crawford's, nonetheless still charms and just adds to his decidedly unique portrayal. Viewers are treated to a bonus scene wherein Butler's Phantom sings of his loneliness and unrequited love that was trimmed from the actual movie.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|The Interpreter ***<br /><br />Cast: Nicole Kidman, Sean Penn, Catherine Keener, Jesper Christensen, Yvan Attal, Earl Cameron, George Harris, Hugo Speer, Curtiss I'Cook<br /><br />Director: Sydney Pollack<br /><br />Running Length: 2:08<br /><br />MPAA Classification: PG-13<br /><br />Silvia Broome (Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations.  Late one night, when returning to her sound booth to retrieve belongings, she overhears a plot to kill Edmond Zuwanie (Cameron), president of the fictional Africal country of Matobo when he appears at the United Nations to give a speech.  Broome is originally from Matobo, and has lost the majority of her family to a landmine.  When she overhears the assassination plans, she is spotted, and becomes a target for the assassins too.<br /><br />Secret Service agents Tobin Keller (Penn) and Dot Woods (Keener) are called in to investigate what Silvia has to say.  They are skeptical at first, but given her dislike for Zuwanie, it seems doubtful that she would make the story up.  Tobin comes with some baggage himself, having recently lost his family in an accident.  They begin to form a bond of sorts, and he takes on the role of her protector.<br /><br />\\"The Interpreter\\" is an entertaining and timely political thriller.  Zuwanie is a dictator who started out good, but became corrupted by power.  He enforced a purge of his opposition, and killed many innocents in the crossfire.<br /><br />Kidman and Penn give their usual excellent performances.  The story is top notch, providing action, suspense, and even some thought.  It is effective because it is grounded in the reality of today's world.  It does not cheat or go for an overly happy ending.  This is a good, solid movie and well worth checking out.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Probaby one of the best lines in this zany story about how love, even when it's not perfect \\"is\\". Johnny Depp is amazing with his pure ability to constantly charm. The rest of the cast suits him well. <br /> <br />Other good lines.. <br /> <br />\\"You're out of your tree\\"............. \\"It's not my tree\\" <br /> <br />\\"They're both named Steven one w/ a v and one with ph\\" <br /> <br />\\"I want to HELP\\" (holding up help wanted sign) <br /> <br />Get the movie, blend some peanut butter and Captain Crunch, wear a snorkle and enjoy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />b. ryan akin <br /> <br />
B000002LQR|5.0|what a terrific album, full of extremely strong work.  Yes, it is quite innapropriate (especially the second to last song) but if you are a teen, who cares?  funk rock at its best, and this album showcases the best songs like \\"under the bridge\\" and \\"funky monks\\" that made the band a name for themselves.  Essential to get, along with almost anything else they made.  Amazingly, they were able to follow up this touch of insanity with a terrific album called Californication, which is also essential listening.
B000002INJ|3.0|First off I must say that I like Manowar in general, but this album is a real mixed bag.  The tracks range in quality from outstanding to pure garbage with a heavy dose of the mediocre in between.  I'm not sure why so many people are excited about this record.  Here's a track by track reveiw: <br /> <br />1)Wheels of fire-- an awesome, fast paced opener with a great chorus and fine vocals.  A great way to start the album. <br /> <br />2)Kings of Metal -- a more mid-tempo song, the lyrics brag about how great (and LOUD) Manowar are.  It's a good song, but not really outstanding.  <br /> <br />3)Heart of Steel -- a piano-heavy ballad that's not bad.  It's kind of inspirational, and I like it. <br /> <br />4)Sting of the Bumblebee -- a bass solo with very impressive technique, but I don't care to listen to this very often.  I'd rather hear an actual song, quite frankly.  <br /> <br />5)The Crown and the Ring -- the music on this song is supplied entirely by a pipe organ, with no drums or guitars.  The chorus is supplied by a 100 voice male choir.  The only thing remotely \\"metal\\" about this song is the fantasy-themed lyrics.  I find this song boring and uninvolving. <br /> <br />6)Kingdom Come -- a highly mediocre mid-tempo rock song that really isn't very \\"metal\\" at all in my opinion.  For a band that brags so much about being the \\"Kings of Metal\\" they should really rock out more than this.   <br /> <br />7)Pleasure Slave -- Now here's a great tune!! The slow, grinding riff is just perfect for the sleazy, sexual lyrics.  In fact, the lyrics are hilarious!! Eric Adams screaming \\"Woman, be my slaaaaaaaaave!!!!!\\" is priceless.  One of the best songs on here. <br /> <br />8)Hail and Kill -- one of Manowar's all-time best songs.  A classic power metal anthem. <br /> <br />9) The Warriors Prayer -- this is an incredibly stupid story read by voice actors.  This should have been tossed and replaced with an actual song.  It's filler of the worst kind. <br /> <br />10) Blood ofthe Kings-- this is a pretty good power metal song, but not too spectactular really.  Not a bad way to close the album. <br /> <br />All in all, I find this album highly uneven.  There is too much filler and too much that is not really very \\"metal\\" in my opinion.  I'm sure Manowar die-hards will strongly disagree with this, but that is my take on this supposed \\"classic\\". Two and a half stars. <br /> <br />
B0006FFRW0|5.0|Nine Inch Nails' The Downward Spiral has been a classic album for years now.  It's hard to believe it came out 11 years ago!  As of yet, it's still NIN's crowning acheivement, and Trent Reznor knows it!  He set out and mixed the 5.1 surround sound himself, released it on an SACD.  But how many people own SACD players and the system to play them properly nowadays?  So he released it as a Dualdisc...one of the first...and now anyone with a DVD player and surround sound system can enjoy it.  And enjoy it they will. <br /> <br />Let it be said that this is for audiophiles!  To truly appreciate it, you must be in the center of your surround area and it must be LOUD!!  That way, everything from the rough distortions to the quiet sounds of soft static sound breathtaking, deep and enveloping. <br /> <br />The intro of \\"Mr. Self Destruct\\" begins distantly, coming out of a corner.  When the song bursts in, you're taken aback at how it's all around you!  From then, the rest of the album is like a musical ride.  Parts you thought were just noise become layers of sound in a sort of sonic 3D.  Check out the outro for \\"Self Destruct\\" and you'll see what I mean.  Throuout the record, voices and whispers that were in the background come at you from behind, and the sound is so clear you can easily understand it!  On \\"Closer\\", the outro becomes more than just a chime-like synth pittering away.  The sound is in front of you with wispy synths swimming behind you.  On \\"The Downward Spiral\\", the lone guitar sounds like it's so far away among the distorted sound of water, then it reverberates (sp?) back around and behind you.  Hard to believe sometimes that it came out of a studio.  Even the white noise at the end of the album sounds surreal. <br /> <br />Nothing has been added to this record.  Trent just took what he made in 1994 and brought everything out.  Every single scrap of noise, music, vocals and distortions is audible.  It's almost like a whole new album.  Bottom line, this is worth every cent.  You also get three videos and a complete discography (categorized by \\"halo\\" number).  Buy the deluxe edition for the disc of b-sides, and buy this one for the DVD.  I promise you won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />Someone else's review accused Trent of releasing this for financial purposes only.  Once you listen to this, you'd know that while profit is definitely a factor, Trent Reznor wanted people to actually HEAR this album.  It simply rocks.  A fitting way to show one of the best albums ever made. <br /> <br />
B0007P3582|4.0|First of all the most honest review is the 1st by scott. I feel like he wrote a thoughtful review on this album insted of saying \\"this album sucks\\" and not explaining why. Look I'm a big rap fan, I've loved Dre. and Snoop since I was 7 or 8 years old when the cronic came out, I'll always remember those video's. So I've always been a big fan of the west coast and pretty much anything Dre puts his touch on. That's not to say I don't love east coast as well, Biggie and Hova, but I also love underground like Jedi Mind Tricks, Brother Ali and The Roots (old stuff i.e. Illadelf)  <br /> <br />So to the review, I wasn't a huge fan of 50's first CD. There were a few tracks I like and a lot that I didn't, that's pretty much the same here. There are some tracks that make you go, wow this guy knows how to put together a bangin' track (i.e. Ski Mask Way, Disco Inferno, Hate it or Love It) But man there's a lot of wack stuff as well. But to me honestly those 3 songs make this CD hot!! Ski Mask Way is the song of the last 3 months for me, I hope to god it never get's a video and go's #1 or something. It's to good to let out!! I hope he continues to make his single's the wackest tracks on the CD, (I don't even want to begin w/Candy Shop) Anyway Hate it or Love it 50's on top I won't say this is The Cronic, Doggystyle, Enter the Wu, or The Marshal Mathers LP but it's got some stand out track for sure. My advice, get Bearshare or something and d/l the 3 good tracks, and don't waste your time w/the rest.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|This is the \\"Best Of\\" package you want when it comes to Fleetwood's catalog. All the hits are here and the sound is great as is the booklet. I really can't say more than this regarding this awesome band and what this collection contains.<br /><br />Buy it!!
B00000J7J4|4.0|there are a lot of great songs and collaborations on here, most notably with Dave Matthews, Rob Thomas, and Eric Clapton, who are people I have heard before and enjoyed.  Many collaborations are with \\"artists\\" who I hate or have no respect for (such as the pathetic rappers; rap is extremely overrated), which weakens the album overall in my book.  But there are great tunes, Carlos plays some great guitar, and it is a very celebratory fiesta album for modern times.  The sharp arrangements and production make this the much loved album that it is.   <br /> <br />Many people see fit to compare it to his older stuff, but i really see no comparison.  THis is a completely different thing, very unrelated to songs like \\"black magic woman\\" and the like.  This is a very accessible album; I recommend it in addition to any of his older stuff when Santana was a band, not just him.  I also recommend you check out Shaman, which is just as polished (if maybe a little weaker) than this cd.
B000002B5L|5.0|I have so many albums in my collection, but this will always be at the top of my list.  It is now so old, but I still go back to it everytime.  I love it, everyone should have it.  Make a purchase!
0790732203|5.0|I may be looking too deeply into a movie but.... <br /> <br />I saw Risky Business when I was 13 and thought that although some parts were funny, it was filmed beautifully and the music was dreamlike to me.  The film became more of a personal introspective when high school hit and I began to see the parallels between my life and this Joel character.  I used to live in an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood while growing up; big yards, lots of trees, and yardwork that always needed to be done.  While the folks were out of town on vacation and my brother was away on weekend with friends; was left at home to rake leaves, mow the grass, and do homework (or play tennis) on Friday and Saturday nights instead of dating, partying, and getting into trouble.  Maybe you can identify..  My G-d though!  Where was Rebecca De Mornay when I needed her back then??   <br /> <br />I strongly believe that to call this movie just a mere comedy is a total disservice to the film's artistic elements.  The way the camera focuses on the leaves blowing around in the yard as we see Joel looking around at all this d-mn work that needs to be done.  The slow motion on the hose as he waters the plants, the love-making scene on the train, the train at night, and the instrumental music by TD.  In my opinion, the term \\"Comedy\\" refers to films like Animal House or Caddyshack.  Risky Business would be better compared to Solaris than it would either of those two. <br /> <br />The soundtrack will never be outdated as the \\"Love On A Real Train\\" main theme is still the best instrumental track I've ever heard (If you're a dreamer, then try listening to the soundtrack while you're doing your own yardwork and you might begin to look forward to those precious times of isolation and reflection).   <br /> <br />If you like Risky Business, then check out Three O'Clock High as well.  Different struggle, similar character, set to the serious background music of Tangerine Dream.  Also dubbed as a comedy, but inmy opinion, there are many undertones of drama interlaced. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JNQ8|5.0|I am a big fan of Nicole Kidman. I think she is an amazing actress and I always rush to see her films. This film once again showed her acting skills as brilliant. Her character is very believable and her accent is good too. Sean Penn also did a brilliant job in this film and I think I will be also rushing out to see his next film. <br /> <br />The suspense in the film is great and you are kept guessing as to what will happen. Although it's fairly easy to figure out in advance a lot of the time.  The plot is intriguing enough to keep your mind working hard to keep up with everything. <br /> <br />Yeah sure there is some holes in the plot. Isn't there always. By the way in response to reviewer Ter, the reason Silvia is not placed in a safe house is because they want to initially use her as bait in order to try and catch the assasain. <br /> <br />For me the biggest hole in the plot is how she managed to hide all night in the room that they were keeping Zuwane in after the attempt on his life. I mean come on, they lock him in a room on his own, does anybody not think to go into the room first and check if there is somebody in there. And how does Silvia know that is where they are going to keep him. Also when they were checking the building over that morning how come she was not found. <br /> <br />But don't let that stop you. This is a great film, well worth watching.
1580084621|5.0|`Thai Food' by Australian chef, restaurant owner, and Thai food scholar David Thompson is one of those books which, if you have an enduring interest in food, you genuinely regret it took any more than a few days since its publication to acquire, read, and assimilate the book's material. It is one of those books where you can open it to virtually any page and find evidence of its quality.<br /><br />I recall some reviews of this book which noted that although it was certainly comprehensive, it may be criticized for giving recipes containing hard to find ingredients. While I think this is a valid criticism of a book advertised as having recipes for the home cook such as `Vatch's Thai Kitchen' by chef Vatcharin Bhumichitr, it is not a valid criticism of a scholarly book where the object of the author is to present an accurate picture of a national cuisine. And, Thompson has done this as well or better than virtually every good survey of national cuisines I have reviewed such as Diane Kochilas `The Glorious Foods of Greece', Jean Anderson's smaller book on `The Food of Portugal', Marcella Hazan's `Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking', Diana Kennedy and Rick Bayless various books on Mexican cuisines and the granddaddy of them all, Julia Child's `Mastering the Art of French Cooking'. This may be just a bit unfair to these authors, as not all of them were aiming at a grand scholarly treatment of an entire cuisine. Child, for example, was giving us `cuisine bourgeois', leaving the three other types of classic French cooking to others. Kennedy and Bayless have covered Mexico in not one, but in at least two or three different books, with Kennedy's latest, `From My Mexican Kitchen' being a model treatment of some special subjects in a national cuisine.<br /><br />Thompson has covered the whole range of Thai cooking, including very good essays on Thai history and geographical regions and the regional influences on Thai cuisine. One look at the map of Thailand and you can see how broadly different one part of the country may be from another. The northern section virtually pokes its head into the China, and Chinese make up about 11% of the population, as they seem to do in virtually every country on which they border or every nearby island group such as the Philippines. Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam surround the Northeast. The southern peninsula borders on Malaysia. The central rice-growing region is close to Burma and India. There are some parts of the country such as the far north and northeast to which it was literally impractical to travel from capital Bangkok until the mid-1920's when a railroad was build from Bangkok to Chiang Mai on the Ping river.<br /><br />While China, India heavily influences Thai cooking, and it's Southeast Asian neighbors, it is also different from China and India in important ways. While the wok is important to Thai cooking, it is not used in the same way as their Chinese neighbors. The most traditional Thai wok is actually earthenware, replaced by brass upon contact with European traders. `Traditional Thai stir-frying was not the fierce and furious method of the Chinese, but gentle frying over radiant heat in an earthenware pot.' It is obvious in this very same paragraph that Thompson is not a `scientific' food scholar, as he correctly states that the proper technique is to heat the wok before adding the oil, but describes the level of heat as `white hot'. White-hot temperatures are found only in the centers of stars, not in Bangkok kitchens. Nevertheless, his cooking advice is solid and entirely consistent with observations made by Shirley Corriher on heating metal pans before adding oil.<br /><br />Every major cuisine has their classic techniques for preserving food. In fact, one may almost measure the sophistication of a cuisine by their representative preparation and preservation methods. The Italian cuisine is one of the world's leaders because of their cheese-making for milk preservation, salumi techniques for preserving meats, drying and curing methods with ham, winemaking and olive oil techniques, and salting techniques for fish and capers. While salt is a signature ingredient of Mediterranean cuisine, it is simply not as common in southeast Asia, so Thailand and surrounding countries extending as far north as Korea use fermentation as their primary preservation technique. It seems they simply ferment everything the can get their hands on, such as bamboo shoots, bean curd, fish, rice, watercress, and soybeans. Like the Italians with Parmesan and anchovies, the fermented products are often sources for adding saltiness to dishes.<br /><br />When I go to a Thai restaurant or look at recipes in popular Thai cookbooks, many Thai dishes seem to be a mix of a great number of ingredients. Thompson, on the other hand, states that the ideal of a Thai salad is simplicity, but it is also about a balancing of ingredients, as exemplified in Alford and Duguid's book title, `Hot, Sour, Salty, Sweet'. I will venture the hypothesis that this great mix of tastes comes from the intersection of the sour of fermented ingredients and the strong capsasian chiles used to combat the oppressive Thai heat.<br /><br />Some people, even some foodies, may be inclined to dismiss this book as simply not a type of cooking with which they have any interest. I would recommend they get and read much of this book anyway. One example is the chapter on salads. In spite of the great difference in ingredients, I find a remarkable similarity between Thai and French salad making. This means that Thompson's essay and survey of Thai salads contains some insights into saladmaking that you simply may not get anywhere else. Even if you never go out of your way to find red shallots, holy basil, or Kaffir lime leaves, there is much you can learn here!<br /><br />This book should be on the shelves of anyone who wishes to be sophisticated about food.techniques for preserving meats, drying and curing methods with ham, winemaking and olive oil techniques, and salting techniques for fish and capers.

B000002UWW|5.0|this is an essential purchase for the new fan, because it covers all of the best stuff from their first 3 or 4 albums in the 80's.  Great songs like \\"higher ground\\" (an awesome cover of the stevie wonder song) and \\"fight like a brave\\" showcase the band's talent during this period, before they released the ultrasuccessful BloodSugarSexMagik.  Many people listen to Californication first, which is a good introduction to the band i think.  But you should get this album, BSSM, and By The Way in addition to that one.  This band has a lot of great music; its worth your while to buy all this stuff because they are a terrific band.
B0006399FS|1.0|It's no secret that there're 3 albums that U2 don't give a s**t: October (1981), Zooropa (1993) and Pop (1997), and there's one album that they still think it's such a masterpiece: All That You Can't Leave Behind (2000). <br /> <br />I can't believe that former respetable band have now (from 2000 to present) such amateurish and childish point of view of One Hit wonder bands: Smash hit albums = the best music. WRONG, so f****ng wrong!. They were the best band of the 80's and 90's because they weren't afraid to change things, to break bounders of music, to try something unheared before, etc.  <br /> <br />Since All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2 have been living easily their worst, most unimaginative, self-plagaristic era they've ever done. They didn't care about what \\"expert critics\\" say about their albums until 2000. With ATYCLB the selling out was obvious: Critics wrote again and again articles about how s**t Zooropa and Pop were been so they...  <br /> <br />Why on earth U2 had to listen to those sellout incompetent clowns that just want to praise corporate radio-friendly hit and miss pap for easy teenagers that spend all day long watching MTV and buying CD's they listen to 2 times or maybe 3, and then they forget them because they'll go to buy another canned prefabricated band that's playing as \\"exclusive\\" on MTV? <br /> <br />This is an usual review from a brianwashed U2 poser: \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind is their third masterpiece, is a return to form after Zooropa and Pop downfalls\\". Sadly, this is what most of mass media still write, I mean, Rolling Stone, Grammy, Mojo, New Musical Express, Time, etc. <br /> <br />After those thousands snapshot blinded reviews of All That You Can't Leave Behind, U2, of course, went with the easiest thing to do: Another bland music without any substance album as ATYCLB. <br /> <br />U2 forgot the main thing and missed the point: Just because something is popular doesn't make it good or worthwhile. It's such painful to see a former talented band reduced to a self absorbed sellout piece of horses**t.  <br /> <br />Shame on U2, sorry, shame on this sellout iPod product. <br />
B0007TKH66|3.0|I'd give this show three stars, but the Original Series with Kirk is 5 stars. And that's all I'm gonna say about that. I don't want to upset the fans who like Enterprise, I just think compared to the original (the best) this is mediocre, but entertaining. If you want to compare ENT to TNG, DS9, and Voyager, well then, they're all flawed. The original series, however, is timeless. <br /> <br />People are complaining a lot about continuity between the series, but I don't care, I look at each series individually on its own merits. Afterall it's just a TV show. It's not like it gives people hope for the future, or is exciting to watch, or is adventurous, or has cool ships, or hot women, or deals with important issues in a science fiction medium. No, it's like the rest of the current award-winning shows about autopsies and corpses with butt plugs shoved down their mouth and how the coroners have to find how said butt plug got in said corpses mouth, so they can play some catchy music to spice up the morgue scenes and make weighing internal organs look some Britney Spears video on MTV... but hey style is what matters, and don't forget to clean the brains off that hacksaw you used to get at the guys brain, And all that kind of great family entertainment.
0345403959|5.0|If you loved the Belgariad series, followed by the Mallorean series and wished you could spend more time with these characters in this special world, this is a fabulous read. <br /> <br />As others will say, Eddings isn't the most gifted writer, however this makes his books readable for all ages from teens on up and he has such a great sense of charm, most find themselves hopelessly caught up in the story and characters.  Eddings spent a great deal of thought and time creating this world he's taken us on an extended tour of, and it shows. <br /> <br />I was sad at the end of The Mallorean, figuring I'd come to the end of the story and had to say farewell to Belgarath and his extended family.  After a few years, I decided to give this book a try and was very pleased. <br /> <br />The book probably only 'deserves' 4 stars based on its literary merits but I just couldn't help myself.  >;^)
B000002URV|5.0|I first heard of Enigma when I heard \\"Sadness\\" and when I heard the song, I really loved it! The second time I heard about Enigma was when I saw that Much More Music had mentioned Michael Cretu's birthday one time. Because I did not have the CD nor the tape, I hunted the public library and other libraries around where I lived for the CD and I was badly dissapointed that any of the libraries did not carry the CD and I still looked. One day, when I was in a thrift store in my city, I found MCMXC A.D. on tape and I felt really happy because I would now get to listen to Sadness whenever I wanted! I listened past \\"Sadness\\" and I thought that the rest of the tape was wonderful. Since then, my mom bought the CD version at a bookshop/cafe for 6.99 and she loves it! Thanks!
B00004XQ83|5.0|first off, don't buy this unless you have seen the movie or unless you are very familiar with the artists on here.  I had seen the movie first and enjoyed it a lot, and hearin this music when understanding its context made me appreciate its simple yet rugged excellence.  truly, the simplest things are the hardest things to pull off, but this soundtrack does a wonderful job.  The only problem I have with it is that the movie version of \\"i'll fly away,\\" my favorite song when I watched the movie, has been omitted for a slightly weaker version.  However the new version is still pretty darn good, so I won't deduct stars for that, especially considering the fact that most movie soundtracks do a terrible job.  GET THIS NOW!
B0002KVUKM|1.0|It takes a real lack of directing talent to take classic movie monsters, a vampire hunter, good CGI effects and turn it into an unimaginative snooze-fest of a movie.  Stephen Sommers keeps with his traditional lack of imagination by copying from a dozen or so other movies and characters.  Hugh Jackman's character is nothing more than a \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" ripoff.  He also \\"borrows\\" ideas from the \\"Batman\\", \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\", \\"Underworld\\", etc.  The liberties he takes with the classic movie monsters is horrendous.  What happened to Dracula?  In this film he has some incomprehensible master plan to unleash some sort of vampire gremlins on the world.  He no longer transforms into a bat, but instead some sort of cartoonish winged demon.  He also surrounds himself with midget helpers with cheap Darth Vader masks.  Then there is the Frankenstein monster.  He's created in Germany and gets buried under a windmill almost immediateley.  Years later he's dug out and he speaks perfect english and quotes Bible verses.  Dr. Frankenstein must have forgoten to give his creation any muscles, because he's an overgrown weakling.  He's constantly being captured by Dracula's midgets and in one scene he's chained to a table that's held together with a tiny lock.  That lock would be inadequate to secure a gym locker. <br />As for the story and script, there's nothing positive I can say about them.  If the script-writers for this junk are over 12 years old, I would be shocked.  There are so many scenes in this film where there is nothing but screaming.  There must have been pages and pages of script with nothing but \\"Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh......\\" all over them. If you are expecting any kind of drama or suspense, forget it.  A little witty humor is fine in a movie, but it's overkill here.  After being constantly bombarded with cheesy one-liners, you start to wonder if this was supposed to be a comedy.  Does every action movie require the bumbling comic relief sidekick?  Talk about a done-to-death cliche.  Does every action movie have to use this tired out formula?  I'm sure that if there is a \\"Van Helsing II\\", we will almost certainly get the wise-cracking kid added to the lineup. <br />If you like bad movies or are under the age of 14, you might like this movie.
0800141601|2.0|Okay, I have to admit that I'm not an expert on the various interpretations of the King Arthur legend.  Having seen films such as EXCALIBUR and MERLIN, my knowledge of the legend is based on these two films.  So imagine my surprise when we get a story that adheres hardly at all to the legend that I am familiar with. Where's the sword?  Why is Arthur so old?  Where in the world is Merlin, Mordred, Morgana, etc.?  Although I have admired the works of Sean Connery and Richard Gere over the years, I did not find them convincing in the roles of Arthur and Lancelot.  Julia Ormond comes off fairly well as Lady Guinevere, but she rides into battle with the army?  Ben Cross is cliche in his villainous role, and John Gielgud shows up in one of those \\"let's get Gielgud in the movie and it will be classier.\\"  While the movie does have some dazzling cinematography and a wonderful Jerry Goldsmith score, it didn't do a whole lot to encourage me to like it on its own merits.  I found it dull at times, and Gere's lack of a British accent and sometimes Brooklyn one, didn't add to the credibility.  If you're going to revise or update a legend so well known as King Arthur's, you need to be careful how far you go.  If you didn't know anything about this legend, then maybe you could enjoy this pompous movie.  But for me it was just another swordfight and romance movie.
B00009W0U4|5.0|IRREVERSIBLE is a film shown backwards, scene by scene, that ends in extreme violence (the beginning).  It gradually unwinds to reveal the plot, back pedalling, rather than developing it.  Cinematography is used in a dizzying, turbulent way to accentuate the more intense scenes, and the soundtrack at times also seems to be cutting with nauseous spirals or synthetic organ music.  I'm sure you've read by now, there is a rape scene, and to make the retaliation of such seem more real, Monica Bellucci, who plays the victim, was actually in a relationship with Cassel, the macho, vengeful boyfriend in the movie.  The dialogue was more or less improvised for good or ill.  It doesn't wear on me much if it is bad since I don't speak french, but it was more than functional from my perspective.<br /><br />When I first saw this movie, I reacted, thinking that it was blatant shock value, which would have been fine, but upon a second viewing, I started to realize how much attention to detail there was in the film.  There was a great deal of trouble taken to show the camera whirling in and out of a cab during an urgent scene, to build nerves better.  There was a mechanism to help the camera spin around as a segway to different scenes or in chase scenes.  The plot is littered with little details that give more weight to the centerpiece of the movie, the rape, and give momentum to the reminder: \\"Time Destroys All Things\\".  Aside from the obvious \\"We All Will Die Someday\\" and the like, part of the intention in showing the movie backwards, scene by scene, was to depict how one can forget such brutal situations as they are replaced by beautiful ones, according to the director, Gaspar Noe.<br /><br />There's other details that I really appreciate about the movie, but you either get it or you don't.  I was about to brush off the movie after first view, until someone pointed out a little tidbit from the plot that I missed, so I watched it again.  Now it seems I'm constantly defending my opinion against people who don't seem to think much of the subtleties due to their reluctance to overlook that which is not-so-subtle, whether it be mentally or emotionally.people who don't seem to think much of the subtleties due to their reluctance to overlook that which is not-so-subtle, whether it be mentally or emotionally.
B00005OAE6|4.0|I am not sure that \\"old time rock and roll\\" is a very good song anymore, because it hasn't aged well, but most everything else is good.  stuff like \\"hollywood nights\\" \\"feel like a number\\" and the extraordinary \\"the famous final scene\\" make this a memorable album.  Some of the songs don't sound that great anymore, but they are all pretty darn good and worth listening to.  I recommend this cd to any fan of classic rock, it goes good with a lot of music.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|I didn't start watching this show until late in the season, but after reading the recaps on [...] I had to see it for myself.  Now, I am hooked! <br /> <br />Kristen Bell is fast becoming one of my favorite people on television; without Kristen's talent, the character of Veronica would not be remotely believable.   <br /> <br />I only hope that the DVD comes out soon--my roommate and I are dying to see the first episodes.

B00014NE62|5.0|This is one of the great iconic homosexual novels.  E. M. Forster wrote it during the same period he wrote \\"A Room with a View\\" and \\"Howard's End.\\"  However, he refused to allow it to be published until after his death.  The Merchant/Ivory film is beautifully rendered in every detail.  The acting is superb. James Wilby and Rupert Graves are the lovers - crossing class barriers and thrwarting societal standards to be together.  The supporting players - Hugh Grant, Billie Whitelaw, Denholm Elliott and Sir Ben Kinglsey - are first rate.  What makes this DVD a must are the extras.  When I first brought this home I watched all the extras and was blown away by them.  Seeing the documentaries about films of Merchant/Ivory, one really must wonder why the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences has neglected to honor these two maverick independent filmmakers with an honory career achievement award - it's long overdue.

B000003TAW|5.0|terrific songs like \\"buddy holly\\" and other hits define this album as a classic.  They are a really good band, and if you want one cd of theirs, get this one.  There is a great \\"vibe\\" (I hate that word) about it, making it a classic cd for anyone and everyone.  These guys know how to rock, thats all I have to say.  I am occasionally a little put off by the emo-type complaining on some songs (I hate emo music a LOT) but these guys make it work by making good arrangements that don't emphasize dumbness.

At least for Janet, her fans knew her second name was Damita Jo...<br /><br />Mariah, you've just emancipated at 35?<br /><br />Anyway...<br /><br />I am disappointed by this album. The voice may be back but not novelty. Emancipation doesn't mean creation. Charmbracelet didn't meet the success Emancipation is having right now, but it was better.<br /><br />The songs are too much hip hop (apparently hip hop = money), she sounds like all the R&B singers (Beyonce, Ashanti, Alicia Keys, R. Kelly in \\"shake it off\\"...), there's nothing new in her music (maybe more samples), when she sings ballads she screams and the pictures are so retouched!!<br /><br />There is nothing to say about the production: it is perfect but the soul of Mariah doesn't move me anymore. The lyrics have lost their depth so has Mariah...<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I like the woman. I have all her albums, even this one (maybe the last) but the image she gives is not charming anymore. She may not have a Diva behaviour but she does everything to seem like one. Please Mariah, do not dance!<br /><br />I give 3 stars despite my review because I like some songs:<br /><br />- we belong together<br /><br />- shake it off<br /><br />- get your number (even if JD sounds like Nelly, the song is fun)<br /><br />- to the floor (with Nelly)<br /><br />- it's like that.<br /><br />Mimi, go away.<br /><br />Mariah, please come back.

The mid-to-late 90s bands such as Olivia Tremor Control and Elliot Smith did the 60s. The Strokes did the mid-70s a la Television and Iggy Pop. Interpol re-did the late-70s (Joy Division). Franz Ferdinand did early early 80s (Gang of Four). The Killers did early 80s (Duran Duran). The Dears do the mid-80s Smiths...and now we have Kasabian, re-doing the late 80s Madchester sound. I guess the next revival will be grunge--can't wait!

B0007WZUMO|4.0|Those of you thinking that this long awaited follow-up to \\"The Fragile\\" will be either ambient or pornographically tinged with dance beats like \\"The Downward Spiral\\", you won't get what you're looking for, but if you've been starved of some good music in the last few years, you'll eat this one right up, thanks to what I believe is a more laid back Trent Reznor. That's not a bad thing either. Reznor and his new crew sound more fresh and ready to conquer the mainstream than ever. Even though I wouldn't liken this album to his last two masterpieces, it definitely falls into the vein of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\" with its fast pace and hard-hitting lyrics, all set to tunes that will have you dancing and shouting along when he screams the questions, \\"Don't you f***ing know what you are?!\\" and \\"Will you bite the hand that feeds you?!\\"    Even though \\"With Teeth\\" is a different animal altogether, you'll hear the band's signature sound flow throughout each song, particularly in my instant favorite, \\"Every Day Is Exactly the Same\\". It proves that only NIN can take a syntheseizer and turn each key into a deliciously menacing note. Reznor's lyrics, instead of delving into suicide and machine metaphors, encourage people to snap out of their everyday apathy and take a stand for themselves, among other things. Towards the end, namely in the last two tracks, the album gracefully dies out like it should with whispers of reassurance, and in \\"Right Where It Belongs\\", words of wisdom amidst the brief cheer of a crowd and Trent's trademark piano playing.           This is by no means a dark, forboding album (or a masterpiece); in fact it's quite a departure from what we're used to, but it's fun as hell and will have you banging your head, stomping your feet and raising your fists to the air as if Reznor and co. were jamming in your room rather than on your stereo. This is a true turning point for the band and a taste of things to come, and if these gushing reviews are any indication, the wait and hard-earned money is worth it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've noticed that most of the recent reviews have been from people who've just found, and fallen in love with, Firefly.  All I can tell them is, just wait until you've watched it a few more times.  Then you'll REALLY love it.  I've had my dvd set for over a year now and have watched it at least a dozen times.  After that many viewings of most other shows, I would be getting very bored.  However, Firefly is so detailed, so nuanced and complex that every time I watch it is more enjoyable than the previous viewing.  Even after viewing it so many times, I'm still finding details and connections (between characters and between episodes) that I hadn't noticed before.  Because of that, this show is the ideal dvd purchase.  You can watch it over and over and not only not get tired of it, but get to appreciate and love it even more each time you watch.  How rare is that?  Also, don't worry about the abrupt ending.  The follow-up movie, \\"Serenity\\", will be coming to theatres this September to continue the story.
B00000K31Q|4.0|I think that if you are thinking of reading the taming of the shrew, that it is a good idea to watch the movie as well.  While there are some differences between the book and the movie, you get the general similarities and are able to understand the book a little better, as there are several characters to follow.  In my opinion while watching the movie it seems that Patrick is the one who is tamed, while in the book Katharina is clearly the one tamed.  Overall, I thought it was a good movie to watch if you want to understand the book a little better.
B00078XKDE|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've heard for a good while. I've heard the first single to be released, the incredibly catchy 'Good Ones' a bit on the radio and I ended up buying the album. That was a great impulse buy; the entire album has the same, minimalist guitar and drums and the odd mix of vocals but without ever becoming repetitive or samey. <br /> <br />The two singers are a hell of a combination. At times VV has a voice with a fallen-angel quality before sounding like someone who has been at the Gauloises far too much while Hotel (the man) provides great support vocals. Not quite backing vocals, but I think it's fair to say that VV's voice carries the album more. <br /> <br />In short, it's a great album. Yes, it's a bit of PJ Harvey, White Stripes and Echo thrown in a blender, but I really couldn't care less. Go. Buy. Now.
B0001VWP8I|5.0|The only \\"weak\\" tracks on the album are \\"Pretty Little Dum Dum\\", \\"Sexy Single\\", and \\"Maybe Today\\". That leaves 9 really solid tracks.<br /><br />Just buy the album, listen without skipping and you will see how good 9 of the 12 songs are... this is one of the FEW recent albums that I am actually glad I bought. Most others I wish I had just bought the single.<br /><br />How can anyone compare this woman to that evanescence chick?! Anastacia has a MUCH more powerful voice, and she has several different styles, almost all of here songs inspire me, boost my confidence. On the other hand, most of evanescence's songs are downright depressing (some even suicidal - way to go), and they are basically heavy metal... totally different styles.<br /><br />What I love about Anastacia is you don't have to be head over heels in love to really enjoy her music. Keep it up girl!!!<br /><br />And the comparison with Taylor Dayne? Please- Taylor Dayne sounds more like Whitney Houston. *returns from the spew bucket*<br /><br />I can't understand why the Amazon sales rank is only ~3000 CDs ??!!
B0007O38XU|5.0|It's about time this excellent star wars spoof got the collector's edition treatment. What a worthy spoof of the star wars movies. This one rates right up there with 1.Blazing Saddles 2.Young Frankenstein 3.Spaceballs as the best of Mel Brooks comedies. An honorable mention goes out to Dracula Dead & Loving It which I think now isn't such a bad movie.
B000002LIX|5.0|Jane's Addiction - Ritual De Lo Habitual (1990)<br /><br />As great as NOTHING'S SHOCKING is, Jane's really pulled out all the stops on this one. I'd have to say this is their best effort and truly one of the greatest albums ever. Balls-to-the-wall rockin' combined with highly innovative songwriting, this album is appealing to alt-rock, hard-core and the heaviest heavy metal fans alike.<br /><br />\\"Stop!\\" - knocks me on my ass every time with those whirlwind guitars. I love the female spoken intro in Spanish - someone told me she says something like \\"We are not born of this earth . . .\\" (wish I spoke Spanish) *****<br /><br />\\"No One's Leaving\\" - another killer - \\"I don't care who plays as long as the game is on.\\" Perry's voice is truly like no others. It may be too grating for some, an aquired taste for others, but I love it. It's very expressive and as scratchy as it is, he can still hit the right notes. *****<br /><br />\\"Ain't No Right\\" - love the spacey \\"My sex and my drugs and my rock n roll\\" intro . . . then that hyperkinetic bass comes in before the song blasts off into the stratosphere. When it comes to rockin' hard, it's tough to beat the first three songs on this album. *****<br /><br />\\"Obvious\\" - unusual sort of art-rocker with a jangly piano hammering away. A fitting tribute to closed-minded morons who can't contain their bigotry and contempt for people a little different from themselves. ****<br /><br />\\"Been Caught Stealing\\" - the one you've probably heard over and over if you've been reduced to listening to corporate rock radio (which will surely become obsolete in the not too distant future). A really fun song about the joys of stealing. My dog always gets exited when she hears the barker at the beginning. *****<br /><br />\\"Three Days\\" - a towering epic over 10 minutes long. It's a masterpiece that starts off really creepy and takes you to fantastic heights. *****<br /><br />\\"Then She Did . . .\\" - another extended song and another masterpiece. Absolutely majestic and compelling. Gorgeous orchestral accompaniment. There's even a great jazz piano there in the middle too. *****<br /><br />\\"Three Days\\" and \\"Then She Did . . .\\" are the album's centerpieces. They really transport the listener to places far beyond your typical rock music. A big thanks to D.I. \\"djcrowley\\" for his insight on these 2 songs. I had some idea what they were about but you were very enlightening. It makes perfect sense that \\"Then She Did . . .\\" was originally titled \\"Then She Died.\\"<br /><br />\\"Of Course\\" - strange Middle-Eastern flavored song with trippy violin. ****<br /><br />\\"Classic Girl\\" - really is a classic. It's a really sweet song. *****utely majestic and compelling. Gorgeous orchestral accompaniment.

B00005JLK1|4.0|...but \\"Ghost Ship\\" has its' moments, and is far from the worst horror-movie I've seen. Now I must add; I am a big fan of movies involving old ships and ocean (I don't know why) -so of course this \\"a bit b-scripted\\" movie may recieve some of its' credit by the fact that it is that type of film. From me that is.     The opening-sequel of \\"G.S\\" is something of the most grotesque that I've ever seen, and I'm not easily scared actually -it just looks so... hm... yes, painful. The scene the way it is arranged and \\"made\\" is a well-worthy opening for a horror-movie, and impressive done and thought-out. But from here it's not going anywhere near this scary again. It made me jump a couple of times, and the ship looks really fantastic (as new, and as a wreck) -but once again the effects dominate, the plot is weak (and if not predictable, not very convinsing or exiting to put it like that). But I enjoyed the movie anyway, ignoring the bad acting, and the unsympathetic characters involved. When it comes to quality I'd compare it to \\"Deep Blue Sea\\". But it's not a floating \\"The Shining\\" as some has described it as. The \\"personality\\" of the production simply isn't there, and there's not much style -and the story not very inspiring. It's easy to forget, and has not much originality. But turn your mind off, lean back -and you might just feel entertained.
0783225547|5.0|Dante's Peak, set in the charming and fictional town of Dante's Peak, in the beautiful Washington State, with a towering, and daunting neighbour in the background: Dante's Peak.     Set to be a STRATOVOLCANO, Dante's Peak looked amazingly real compared to Mount Baker, Glacier Peak, Mount Rainier, Mount St. Helens and Mount Adams of Washington.     In the book, the volcano was about 9,100 feet. If you read the Dante's Peak The Book, you can learn more about the characters and the setting.    The movie follows Harry Dalton(Brosnan), Mayor Rachel Wando (Hamilton), Graham Wando(Foley), Lauren Wando(Smith), the USGS team, the towns people and the rest during the massive eruption. In the end the volcano had a Mount St. Helens eruption, and the final product in the credits looks almost like Mount St. Helens.     Dante's Peak a really great and captivating disaster story.
B0007VCZ50|5.0|...the best dvd-release of Sting (so far anyway) besides, of course, the fabolous and fan-dedicated \\"All This Time\\" from 2001. They share some similarities, the behind the stage/the performance-\\"mixed\\" footage, or easier said; we are invited to see parts of the rehearsal, parts of the show, and there are interviews with all the musicians with Sting in the lead. The main difference is; this whole consept behind the 1985-release (and tour) of the \\"Blue Turtles\\"-material was the big risk Sting was taking being a settled artist, but with this new sound, style and (not least) the musicians he'd hired things indeed could have ruined his reputation and carreer. As you very well know, it didn't! He recieved standing ovations from audiences all over, and became a hit also as a solo-artist. Me myself, well, being a Sting-fan mainly, and not of Police -let's just say that I'm not surprised. Sting is one, if not the one, of the most talented composers and performers (including the musician he has and still works with) in the world today, and this release is another proof of that. I am so happy \\"Bring On The Night\\" finally has been released in this format. The sound is superb, the picture too -so let's throw away the old tapes now and really enjoy this! <br /> <br />If you have a capable system, see it in DTS -the drum-opening on \\"If you love somebody...\\", it's like being there!  <br /> <br />Sting somehow becomes, ironically, an \\"early\\" Eminem (not that I compare them at all, they far from share much of anything else, but) the fact that they were both the only white in their black groups and collegues, Eminem with rappers. Sting theming up with these talented jazz-musicians, and of course, this inspired his composings and performances. Not that it's jazz, actually it is hard to catogorize any of Stings' music. It's kind of \\"continental\\". But a lot of the improvisings naturally goes over into jazz. And in 1985 the band was facing a lot of shared opinions about their project. (like Eminem had to face until he convinced his audiences, and that's the similarity I find.) But this was before the final result. Sting convinced as well, and from here it has mostly been \\"going uphills\\" for my favorite artist. <br /> <br />Let me add to this that Stings' early influences take roots in jazz, and he was playing with jazz-musicians in the early days of his life. You can read about this in his biography \\"Broken Music\\". Recommended by the way! <br /> <br />\\"Bring On The Night\\" is very inspiring, and interesting that way. Sting is not the only reason for this, the interviews and opinions and presentation of the band is also \\"very new\\", and presents the project in a way I'd never thought of it before. You get respect for they opininons on the music business none of them see themselves as a part of, it's all about the performing and the love of the music. You realize this, and I especially enjoyed the interviews with Branford Marsalis. Also it is funny to see their unserious sides between the rehearsals, and the way they make fun of Sting in friendly ways. <br /> <br />This is the kind of release that makes you wish you could be the artist if just for a day, and it puts a smile on your face long before the credits start to roll.  <br /> <br />Here's another reason why I am a fan!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Well, when you here the words pop, sexy, attractive the first name that comes to mind is no doubt, Britney Spears, and with her comes the pop phenomenon she developed just six years ago.  <br /> <br />With enough #1 hits and influence to be compared to the Beatles, Britney is reigning the 21st century as we know it today.  Having sold 60 million albums worldwide and being the largest selling female of the past decade, overpowering her competitors Madonna, Mariah carey, Christina, Alicia Keys, Jennifer Lopez and others, and her fourth album, 'In the Zone' selling almost 10 million alone. Her strongest first week sales came from Oops...I did it Again! with 1,319,193 million worldwide. She is the first female to appear on the list (with the highest selling album of the past six years), and goes on to appear 2 more times, in the top 33. <br /> <br />Britney's more mature fourth album, 'In the Zone' brings a new style of pop dance and even some R&B here and there, evident in tracks like '(I Got that) Boom Boom' and 'Outrageous' (produced by R. Kelly). There are also those slower and sexier tracks such as 'Breathe on Me', 'Touch of my Hand', 'Showdown' and others. Great dance tracks like her debut track/video off the album 'Me Against the Music' and the impressively sultry 'Toxic' which talks about being addicted to someone's kiss.  <br />Brit also touches on very heartfelt things such as her two year relationship with Justin Timberlake and the split between the two, in 'Everytime'. The song talks about lovelost and was the first song Britney ever wrote. Justin cast a Britney look alike in 'Cry Me a River' (put the nearest thing you can in your ears when the chorus is about to start), and Justin Timberlake, for you, we wouldn't cry a single tear. <br /> <br />Britney's more mature lyrics (of which many, she co-wrote) and voice come across strongly which ensured a strong debut from 'In the Zone' - her fourth consecutive #1 debut on the Billboard album chart (and from thisshe was also made the 1st female to have 4 consecutive #1 debuts).  <br /> <br />Overall this album is definitely a good buy, and I recommend it to anyone interested in listening to some good dance, R&B, pop and slow heartfelt music. This album has the ultimate variety of styles and clearly displays Britney's excellent vocal talent.
0920668372|5.0|I never thought this story to be creepy.  The first time I read the book (while pregnant with my son), I cried.  I think that the book is a little lengthy for a small child; I started reading this to my son when he was about 18 months and he loves the predictable text \\"back and forth\\".  He asks to read the book over and over.  Don't take the reviews that the book is creepy too literally.  The mother expresses love for her son and driving across town and climbing through the window to rock her adult son is not creepy, but touching.  It shows that when your child is all grown up, your love for him will still be the same.  When we get to that part in the book, my two year old asks if I am going to see him because he is a grown up man.  I tell him that mommy will always be there for him.  He may not understand that now, but I'm sure that he will remember.  He loves the book and I love reading it to him.  Five stars!
B0007NFL1S|1.0|To be quite honest, if I could rate the album at 0 that would be my #1 option.   <br />No offense 50 Cent, but u need to find a new job - advising people on what cars they should buy, or advising celebrities in movies on how to throw money in the air or working at a candy shop. There, you can let girls lick ur lollipop without having it told to 50 million MTV viewers. <br />   <br />The hype of excitement and anticipation put on the album was the only thing that got it this far. The quite lame lyrics and derogatory and sick statements such as 'I'll let u lick the lollipop' on 'Massacre' are hopefully going to make people realize that not much has changed about 50 Cent since his debut 'Get Rich or Die Tryin'' album, which will hopefully also lead them to realize that 50 Cent is a WASTE OF MONEY! <br /> <br />So basically what I'm trying to tell those reader's is that you should save you're money (and ears).
0859652777|5.0|I am a 39 year old female and have never been that much into the goth culture but I've found Manson's music hits the spot when I want to hear some brutally honest anger that also rocks. I listen once in a blue moon - maybe a little more since reading this book. <br />This man is a brilliant writer. He touches on every emotion and state of mind we humans are capable of: extreme embarrassment, conceit, selfishness, depravity, disgust, fear, empathy, ambition, misery, determination, stagnation, being in love, being in hate, feeling regret - I could go on and on, forever! It is a brutally honest book. Manson totally strips himself bare and reveals his total self - stains and all. It has humor as well. Chapter 16 has some hilarious diary entries and the chapter with his lists of rules is hilarious as well. He knows how to describe people better than anyone - and this can be both hilarious and hurtful.  <br />He is so human it hurts. Pages 234 and 235, brought me to tears and I am in no way, starstruck by Manson. I was just a little curious, got the book, and was blown away. The book comes full circle and leaves you feeling full, not empty, which is what is expected - to feel empty. Read this whether you like his music or not.   <br />hannah loesser
B00064AM6C|5.0|We've all watched a live musical performance.  Be it at a concert, on tv or a dvd like this one.  Sometimes we are disappointed by video presentations.  I have seen The White Stripes live in concert and have also seen this presentation which should be an example of how these items should be. Good sound quality, nice shots, impeccable camerawork, and THE BAND.  <br />The grainy 8 mm style gives the presentation a very vintage feel as it should with Jack an Meg's musical style. Their performance is incredible, playing their hits and also some rare and obscure tracks including an amazing cover of Dolly Parton's \\"Jolene\\".  The band plays so well, they gave me chills watching it just as they did when I saw them in concert. <br /> <br />This is something that every fan should own.  BUY IT and own a little piece of rock and roll history.  <br />
B00005JMXX|2.0|I skipped the slots at Vegas last summer to watch this movie on the strip.  I would have been better off dropping my cash in the slots. <br /> <br />I was looking forward to seeing it since the premise of the movie sounded a lot like Art Bell and Whitley Streeber's \\"The Coming Global SuperStorm\\".  And it followed the book fairly closely at first (without giving any credit to the writers that I could find). <br /> <br />The movie did start off well with the storms, hurricanes, tornadoes, hail, etc.  And then, unfortunately, they added the \\"human story\\" to it.  That is where the movie fell apart.  It presented characters that you really didn't care about.  The Sela Ward character was heroic in some sense, but the others didn't bring any emotion to me, I just didn't care about them. <br /> <br />As far as the \\"Science\\" of the movie is concerned, I think that people would be better off reading \\"The Coming Global SuperStorm\\" so they can better understand what the movie is trying to present the viewer. <br /> <br />It had it's moments, and it got me out of the Vegas heat for a couple of hours.  But, bottom line is, this movie really doesn't deliver.
B000002HMH|2.0|This would have been a decent album if Fuel & Devil's Dance from Re-Load had been added and The House That Jack Built, Hero of The Day, Poor Twisted Me, Mama Said, Thorn Within & Ronnie been cut out -- 3 1/2 stars if this been the case.   <br /> <br />Instead of trying to release two albums chock full o'filler, the guys should have kept all their best material for one album.  Although I do respect the chances that were taken with this effort.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|I have many albums that I loved on first listening, but have not had on my stereo in years. Like a meteor, they burned out fast after impressing with superficial flash.<br /><br />Then again, I have albums that took several times of playing through to \\"get it\\".  These have more substance than flash, and they also have longevity.  You hear something new on each subsequent listening.<br /><br />Shangri-La falls into the second category.  Great melodies, finely honed deep lyrics, and songs that are actually about something make up this album.  For me, it is almost a compliment that I like this album, which is rejected by people that are into reading the lists of the top 10 records of the week.  I'll still have Shangri-La in my short list of CDs being run through my players in both home and car when those folks are on their 50th crappy album of mindless fluff.<br /><br />Knopfler is a grown man in his 50s now.  His music should have and did change over the years.  If you don't \\"get\\" this record, it might say more about you than the album.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|Probebly Dylan's first Great Rock & Roll album. All filled with superb songs, especially on side two. \\"It's All over Now, Baby Blue\\" is probebly his finest song of dismissal. A definitive Dylan album.
B000000WF0|5.0|The Verve's 1997 release, \\"Urban Hymns\\", added to possibly the greatest year of music since the late 60s.  With their hit, \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", The Verve struck harmoniously with all those disallusioned with their work, their loves, and the difficulties of life. <br /> <br />This plays into the overriding concept of the album, in my opinion.    While many believe it represents a compilation of simply great pop songs, \\"Urban Hymns\\" is just what the title states, a tome on life in the modern world.  One minute in, Ashcroft takes \\"you down the only road [he's] ever been down\\", and until the heavenly cries of \\"Come on\\", he doesn't let go of you hand.  Ashcroft soon asks \\"can you see it wasting away?\\", and in just the next track, he realizes \\"the drugs don't work, they just make you worse\\". <br /> <br />This is truly a set of urban hymns.  Every song resonates with the disallusionment so prevalent in our often hapless society; this album is a contemporary masterpiece, and it provides a necessary indictment of daily life including all of its hardships. <br /> <br />Buy this album, you won't regret it.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This is not my favorite Bob Dylan album. That would be Blonde on Blonde which is his True Masterpiece. Blood on the Tracks is simply one of the most emotionally moving albums of all time. \\"Tangled up in Blue\\" is a lyrical masterpiece, one of the best written songs of all time. \\"Simple twist of fate\\" still, to this day, bring tears to your eyes while listning to it. Blood on the Tracks is Definitly one of the top 3 Dylan Records ever made, Just a notch or so below Blonde on Blonde.
B00000JPYD|4.0|I was a big Hendrix fan in the late 70's when someone gave me a robin trower record(remember those?) and then I was hooked.  Watched him play on long island in mid 80's and he was still kicking butt.  I would go see him again if he came around so anyone wanting some good music, take a look at what he has
B00005JGAB|5.0|One of the Most influential rock albums of the 70s. All filled with great songs, like \\"Beat on the Brat\\" \\"Blitzkrieg Bop\\" \\"Now I wanna Sniff Some Glue\\" are all great classic songs. Add this classic album to your collection, simply a masterpiece.
B00006FR47|5.0|I love all of the Terry Kath Chicago albums (Chicago Transit Authority through Chicago XI), but this one is masterful.  It is the jazz fusion of A Hit by Varese, While The City Sleeps and Goodbye.  It is the pure power of Now That You're Gone.  It is the brilliant song writing, execution and message of Dialogue.  It is the anger of State of the Union.  It is the sweetness of All Is Well and Saturday in the Park. <br /> <br />This album represents the peak of a superstar band, taking risks as a group and firing on all cylanders.  Musicians will perhaps appreciate this album more than others, but it's a great album for all.
076790592X|5.0|This book is great and has many important insights in life. Makes people more aware about life and all the different aspects of it. Also, teaches people to understand the society we live in and how everything should be dealt with. Excellent book, and not too long as well as very easy to read. I recommend everyone to read the book and enjoy all the information it provides for about life.

Either way, he's the guy who isn't Keanu) This movie is a bonus for ladies (or gentlemen for that matter) who really dig hot looking, hair-metal types,biting things while sporting skin tight and fashionably ripped clothing. The Soundtrack, as well, is most awesome.
0792839730|5.0|This film needs a grand new DVD edition.<br /><br />First of all, the current R1 disc has mediocre image quality, and most of it is due to the source material.  What I'm saying is this film would be greatly served if it had a full Lowry Digital restoration and remastered in DD 5.1 and/or DTS.<br /><br />Hopefully some day this film will get the DVD presentation that it truely deserves.
0812550706|4.0|i have read only 2 of his books ender shadow and the one after it. those books were very well written but i didn't get connected to this book like the others. ender didn't seem to be a good hook for me but i loved the ending there is so much compassion that this main character has. great read
B0006284JQ|1.0|If I don't like Britney Spears's music, I must be jealous of her. That's the response one tends to get from her legion of teenage fans when one is critical of Britney's music. \\"Oh, you're just jealous...\\"<br /><br />I don't like Britney Spears's music, and, frankly I don't find her to be very bright. Now, intelligence was never a prerequisite for a musical performer, but when that musical performer is jammed down our throats on television, radio, at the movies, magazines, on my pop cans... I tend to take notice. Okay, Britney, you have my attention.<br /><br />So what's all the hubbub about? This collection of music?  Is this what all the fuss was about? These Abba-esque knock-offs you call songs? This is all you have to offer?<br /><br />Sure, if you've never heard Abba, Chic, Donna Summer, Madonna, The Jackson 5, Sister Sledge, Diana Ross, Rose Royce, or Janet Jackson, this music would be pure Dance genius. But people, it's been done before; and done better; much, much better by people who can actually sing without significant overdubs in the studio.<br /><br />So if you consider me jealous, fine. But at the very least, check out the other artists above, the innovators who created and nurtured the Dance music genre. (For the record, I'm not jealous of those guys) Even if you casually listen to these artists, you will see what's been duplicated ad nausium by meager talents like Britney Spears.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|At first I only really brought it for Its Like That and I thought that I would like 2 or 3 songs yet from 1 to 14 I lover it.  Yeah her duets with Nelly and Snoop Dogg are okay yet the songs when its just her are extraordinary.  Numbers 2,6,9 and 13 are dedicated to my boyfriend. I love you baby.
B00000ADG2|5.0|Lauryn Hill first exploded onto the global music scene as a member of the Fugees. They swept the world because of their unique style and that girl,Lauryn Hill. Lauryn Hill has won a total of 8 Grammy Awards including 2 with the Fugees, 1 for her work on Santana's album \\"Supernatural\\" and 5 for her solo masterpiece -The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill-. In 1998 this album was released to mass success and rave reviews. With this album she revolutionized the R&B scene at the time paving the way for more female R&B artists.<br /><br />On this album she plays with the issues of birth,depression and a failed relationship. This album is great because each song has a special thing to it. There is no doubting how creative Hill is on this album.<br /><br />\\"Intro\\" starts off the album as well an intro as you can possibly get. Set at the beginning of a school day with a teacher calling the roll, it's hard to rate this \\"track\\" because nothing much happens musically. However it's a nice setting. This is basically the basis for the rest of the album as the title refers to her \\"miseducation\\". At the end of mostly every track on the album a little sort of interlude comes in as part of the track. These interludes are set at the school where Lauryn is supposed to be, but is not. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Lost Ones\\" this is a perfect hip-hop track with a crazed beat that bounces all over the place. Lauryn's rapping is so solid here and definitely not commercial. That's what Ilike about Lauryn, she's a genius and never goes mainstream. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Ex-Factor\\" is one of the best songs on the album. A very emotional song about a failed relationship this track has a very nice arrangement and Lauryn's voice is beautiful and harmonic in the chorus. 10/10<br /><br />\\"To Zion\\" is the song about the birth of her child, featuring Santana on guitar this song is a very powerful song, Lauryn's vocal timbre is so beautiful I think I am listening to an angel serenade to me. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Doo Wop (That Thing)\\" is the most mainstream song on this album but is suprisingly genius. Her biggest hit from her solo masterpiece. This song doesn't use samples and is very feminine in places. 10/10<br /><br />\\" Superstar\\" is not the best song on the album but I like it, the chorus here is very jazzed up and cool. She really is a superstar in her own right. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Final Hour\\" is such a fresh song, Lauryn can do ballads and fresh hip-hop equally as well as each other. On this track she proves herself again. This track in very in-your-face.<br /><br />10/10<br /><br />\\"When It Hurts So Bad\\" is the perfect Hill ballad that signifies her lyrical and musical strength. Here she does no wrong. 10/10<br /><br />\\"I Used To Love Him\\" features a very strong Mary J. Blige,I've always liked how their harmonies are so strong and this duet flows well. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Forgive Them Father\\" is a reggae hip-hop infusion and works incredibly well. I love this song. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Every Ghetto, Every City\\" is where Hill brings back her childhood memories and shares them with us, lyrically the strongest song on the album this track rocks. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Nothing Even Matters\\" is a slow ballad featuring D'Angelo. Both of their voices gel well and are solid. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Everything Is Everything\\" is possibly the coolest song on the album in the sense that I like everything about it, including the freakin cool video for it. 10/10<br /><br />\\"The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill\\" is the most beautiful piano ballad ever, better than any other track on the album in the emotion catergory. 10/10<br /><br />Two Bonus Tracks:<br /><br />\\"Can't Take My Eyes Off You\\" is a rockin cover of a classic. 10/10<br /><br />\\"Tell Him\\" is a cute end to a well formed masterpiece. 10/10<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />Lauryn Hill has shaped  hip-hop and R&B with this masterpiece.<br /><br />This album breaks all conventions and musical boundarys possible.<br /><br />Well Done Lauryn!o Wop (That Thing)\\" is the most mainstream song on this album but is suprisingly genius.

B000002H6C|5.0|...and justice for all is metallica's 4th cd, from 1988, and is one of their best. it started out with guitars building to the great opener blackened, which is one of the best of the album. the second track is the title track, as with all metallica title tracks, and like all metallica title tracks, its one of the best on the album. it last nearly 10 minutes, like the slower and softer to live is to die, but its great from beginning to end. other notable songs are frayed ends of sanity and shortest straw, though there is not a single track that should disappoint you. however, the best here is track number 4: One. One is 1 of the best songs ever made, with its soft parts and heavy parts, and with a classic song, the solos. there are a few, but the most memorable is the tapping solo. this is possibly one of kirk hammet's greatest achievements, though of course he didnt stop there. if you truly enjoy metallica or any metal, you should get this cd. it shouldnt disappoint.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey has been around since the dawn of the 90's. She entered the decade with a bang, selling over 9 million copies of her debut album in the U.S. alone,spawning 4 number 1 singles, and nabbing two Grammy's at the same time. Since then she's topped the charts multiple times, racking up more accumulative weeks at number one on billboard charts and breaking more records than I have fingers. Yet when 2001 rolled around and she had a few hits that weren't number one, but sold as well as the average artist, and a movie that didn't do as well as the public had expected, she's labeled as a fallen diva? When artists like Madonna have had numerous flops, music and movie wise, and no one labels her as a fallen star. The fact is, Mariah is the number one selling female artist in history and her album \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" reminds everyone why. Each and every song on this album is timeless and quite a few can be considered classic. Ballads with an old school, 70's feel, such as \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Circles,\\" and \\" I Wish You Knew,\\" showcase the singer/songwriters powerhouse vocals as well as her soft, sensual falsetto in a controlled yet natural manner that is sure to make you feel like you're going through exactly what she's going through in each piece of music. Other songs that will get your fingers snapping,hips swaying, and send those tingly feelings up your spine; you know the ones Mariah can only make you feel, are tracks like \\"Say Somethin',\\" \\"Get Your Number,\\" \\"Your Girl,\\" and \\"Stay the Night\\" which has Mariah singing in full voice, and in a very high register. Every song on the album is single material and despite the fact that there will be people who criticize this album, saying things like \\"I'm sick of her hitting those high notes,\\" and \\"I'm tired of her baby whispers,\\" the fact of the matter is, no other singer can sing with the style that Mariah has crafted to perfection. Wannabe replacements such as Beyonce' and Christina Aguilera may be talented and have attempted to copy the diva's style, but they are both nowhere near the vocal or songwriter level that Mariah is at. The truth is, no one gives Ms. Carey the credit she deserves. She came onto the scene writing all of her own material and still does, unless she does a cover song. She produces, and she sings far superior than any other singer, and with a range that makes the diva's before her, such as Aretha Franklin and Chaka Khan, jealous. This album should once and for all silence everyone who has something negative to say about this talented woman who has shaped the history of popular music forever and set a standard that no singer, new or old, will ever be able to surpass. She was never gone from the spotlight, she just decided to share it for a short while. So please, call this album genius, call it a masterpiece, call it whatever you will, but do NOT call it a comeback. She's been here all along. <br />
B00000163G|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST HIP HOP ALBUM EVER MADE UP TO THIS DAY. EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS A SINGLE, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM. YOU NEED TO ADD AN EXTRA STAR FOR THIS 2 DISK ALBUM. PAC THE GREATEST OF ALL TIME, NO DOUBT ABOUT IT. MAY HE REST IN PEACE.
0743487478|1.0|I saw him on the Early Show one morning and was intrigued by the little \\"snippets\\" they went through about this book.  My feeling is, don't waste your money!  Sure, there were a couple of good points/highlights in the book.  I feel that my husband and I are loving parents and, in fact, DO take into consideration the feelings of our child when parenting/disciplining him.<br /><br />I don't feel that this form of \\"parenting\\" is truly realistic ~ as a whole.  We have a number of parenting books and keep referring back to Parent Magic 1-2-3 and the Pocket Parent.  I don't agree with this author's definition/description about \\"behaviour\\" when he's referring to it in other parenting books (which, by the way, he's constantly putting down!).<br /><br />Moderation is the key...we've heard many times before...to everything ~ including parenting.  There is a happy medium that can be reached between Mr. Kohn's book and the two books I've mentioned above (as well as other books out there, I'm sure).  His is just one (very) small piece of the puzzle, that I'm sure most parents are aware of and incorporate into their parenting concepts, in general.
B00005JKG7|5.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" is the very purest essence of shivery cold graveyard grue: an unwanted kiss in the inky black of an ancient family crypt, a tug at the ankle in a graveyard, something turning the doorknob first this way, then that, in the bedroom of your lonely old Victorian at the darkest hour of the night.<br /><br />It is an incantation of man's oldest fears, really; the Watery Death. The stinking, reeking, retching, merciless Death that lurches up, drowned, cheeks eaten by sea-worms, rises up from its unquiet slumber beneath the Ocean.<br /><br />Rises up, and kills the disloyal Living.<br /><br />It was the seventies, and horror director John Carpenter was walking the downs of the Salisbury Plain around Stonehenge with Halloween collaborator and producer Debra Hill. A bowshot away from the tottering ring of standing stones, Carpenter and Hill could make out a thick fog, pressed close to the ground, creeping up the hillside. Carpenter turned to Hill and said \\"wouldn't it be scary if there was something *in* the fog?\\"<br /><br />Oh yes, Mr. Carpenter. Scary. Scary indeed.<br /><br />The Bible says that the sins of the Fathers shall be visited down unto the Sons, even to the 7th generation---or some such nasty thing. Basically, Dad unloads some unrighteous whup-a**, and Junior gets to pay the karmic bar-tab.<br /><br />That's the gist of \\"The Fog\\", where Junior gets to pay Grand-Daddy's house bill, in full, with interest. Lots of interest. Continuously compounded interest.<br /><br />The little coastal hamlet of Antonio Bay is having a birthday celebration, a centennial: preparations are made, fetes planned, speeches written and rehearsed, parties thrown. And as with the best of well and long-planned parties, Antonio Bay is going to have a few gate crashers. Gate crashers that cloak themselves in the stealthy, sinuous, implacable fog. Gate crashers that wield hooks and cutlasses and sharp chunks of steel as party favors.<br /><br />Now: anyone living away from the coast, far removed from vast and moody bodies of dark water, cannot fully appreciate what a true Fog is, what it can be, how disconcerting, confusing, disorienting it is to have the absolute veil of a morning fog sweep down on you, shrinking your perspective to three feet in any direction, rendering the most familiar landmark a monstrous lumbering hulk, and coloring everything in chiaroscuro shades of shifting shadow.<br /><br />In a thick coastal fog---the kind that sweeps into San Francisco in the deadly hours before dawn, or the infamous, reeking \\"London Peculiars\\" that amble along that ancient city's midnight streets---how can you tell if the figure inches from your face is Friend or Foe? Or something far worse?<br /><br />Carpenter is a master of his craft, and \\"The Fog\\" isn't elaborate, nor crafty, but instead serves up a classic, well-chilled slab of straightforward seventies horror that gets right to work, sloshes ashore, and sets about the bloody business of frightening you to death and tearing your jugular out.  It's a simple tale, simply told: a class nautical ghost story demanding to be told around a guttering fire on a lonely beach with the breakers crashing in on the rocks---indeed, \\"The Fog\\" starts out in precisely that fashion.<br /><br />Aside from that, what do you need to know? One hundred years ago, a bunch of old men made a terrible mistake, believing, truly and foolishly, that Dead men tell no tales. The rest is the stuff of childhood nightmare: the fog ambling in full of unholy light; gaunt, misshapen silhouetted figures rapping three times at the door, ready to cut and carve and mutilate; everywhere the slow, unhurried tread of the Angry Dead. The camera work---eerily gorgeous and slick, particularly in this new remaster---only serves to heighten the ghoulishness of this nasty little tale from the Crypt, particularly those long, sweeping shots of the California coastal highway and the rolling ocean beyond.<br /><br />The acting works: Adrienne Barbeau does what she has to do in the role of silky-voiced radio DJ Stevie Wayne, providing increasingly terrified radio counterpoint to the Elizabeth Dane's belated, grisly shore leave. Try not to shiver for her when you see the ghastly, glowing fogbank lurch up over the steps leading down to the lighthouse and sweep around her studio.<br /><br />John Houseman, Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee Curtis, and particularly Hal Holbrook (alert: the very presence of Hal Holbrook should warn anyone of slimy, nefarious intent): all show up, and do their thing competently.<br /><br />But the real star of the show is Carpenter, doing what he does best, spiking \\"The Fog\\" with a dollop of juicy sleaze, seasoning well with grue, viscera, and pure unholy terror.  And Carpenter, ever the joker, relishes his gallows humor: Hal Holbrook's Father Malone, for instance, wringing his hands in his church vestry, worrying \\"Why not me? Why not me\\"---and then the inevitable denouement, seconds later. Yes, it's nasty, and brutal, and scary (if you're Father Malone)---but it's damned funny, too.<br /><br />Try watching this evil thing at the tender age of nine, buried beneath a \\"Star Wars\\" blanket with one hand pressed up against your eyes (liked that helped) without being forever altered, maybe even warped---as I was. In the best possible way---in the way that the Brothers Grimm warped many of us---of course.<br /><br />Oh, and Weather reports say there's a fog creeping inland: thick, deep, towering fog, moving sluggishly but with evil purpose, low to the ground, full of baleful lights. I'd lock the doors, if I were you.<br /><br />Sleep tight.<br /><br />JSG<br /> <br />The acting works: Adrienne Barbeau does what she has to do in the role of silky-voiced radio DJ Stevie Wayne, providing increasingly terrified radio counterpoint to the Elizabeth Dane's belated, grisly shore leave.

B000002HK4|5.0|There are times when I feel that Dream Theater started in the wrong decade. There were many epic prog-metal acts that sprang up in the mid-to-late 1980s, but Dream Theater definitely stands head and shoulders above them all. A few things that make this band stand out are the lyrics to their songs, which are usually deeply psychological or introspective, and oftentimes optimistic in their resolution, something practically unheard of in metal music (dealing with matters such as the dignity of the spirit and life after death). Then there is the overall sound of their music: crisp and elegant enough to satisfy the serious music fans, yet also with plenty of bite. These are gentlemen who clearly know what they are doing, and traces of the bands that inspired them (legendary prog acts such as Pink Floyd, Rush, and Genesis) are often easy to hear just beneath the surface of their music. They are a hard band to understand if not approached properly, which is why I always recommend A Change of Seasons to anyone wishing to know more about DT. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that there are only five tracks, and only one of them is a studio recording (the 23-minute title track, told into seven chapters, three of which are instrumental), this album is still an amazing display of the band's talent. First, there's the title track. I know what you're thinking: a 23-minute track? Well, if you're interested in getting to know some more recent masters of progressive music, you'd better get used to the idea. DT has never followed the popular, formulaic approach to songs, and they probably never will. This is less a song, and more an experience. That aside, I'd have to say that the pacing of this is definitely easier to digest than a lot of the band's later, time change driven work. \\"The Crimson Sunrise\\" serves as a fitting introduction, giving the listener a taste of what they're in for before James LaBrie's vocals kick in. It starts out very subdued, but then soars majestically on JohnPetrucci's guitar and Mike Portnoy's drumming, underscored by the keyboards of Derek Sherinian. As far as vocals are concerned, LaBrie achieves a good balance throughout the song between his high high notes (in which he channels Rush's lead singer, Geddy Lee) and his lower, more \\"metal\\" grumbling. The way he keeps the two of them on equal ground during \\"Another World\\" is magnificent. I also enjoy his vocals on \\"Carpe Diem,\\" and the way that chapter seems to suddenly end and \\"The Darkest of Winters\\" suddenly begins. This is one of the finest moments on the album. There's enough edge to make it enjoyable, but there's also things such as random time changes to make it interesting. All in all, if I had been a fan of Dream Theater since 1989 (and not just in the last year), I'd say that this track was worth the wait. <br /> <br />The last four tracks also provide stunning examples of the band's musicianship, as they are excerpts from a concert the band did in London in January 1995, paying homage to artists that the band members grew up listening to. Funeral for a Friend was always one of my favorite Elton John songs. I never thought him capable of writing something like it. The fact that a progressive metal band manages to do it justice is even more amazing. It's a little more driven by percussion than the original, but Sherinian's piano work is spot-on. Perfect Strangers was a song I've never heard of before, but it has instilled in me a desire to listen to more Deep Purple. Their keyboardist just might be more talented than the band's radio-friendly songs would have you believe. Then we have a medley of Led Zeppelin, who influenced just about every hard rock act after 1980. Here, DT adds a new dimension. Instead of opting to play more familiar songs like \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" the group pays tribute to Zeppelin's later work, which is almost always overlooked. Few people realize just what a majestic piece of music \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" was, and DT's decision to play it ata faster tempo seems oddly appropriate. And the truly amazing thing is, they manage to keep the song's extremely complex beat without once wavering. In short, these gentlemen give a REAL tribute to Led Zeppelin, unlike the artists who took part in that pathetic tribute album, Encomium (Duran Duran performing \\"Thank You\\"? You're joking, right?). Finally, it ends with the magnificent hodgepodge of \\"The Big Medley.\\" Here, the band somehow manages to not only condense certain songs (for example, they play only the instrumental parts of \\"Carry On, Wayward Son,\\" but honestly, the bridge solo and the ending are the only parts of the song really worth writing home about to begin with), but they also transition seamlessly between songs that don't seem to have much in common. Though I really wouldn't have minded if they did part of the ending harmony from \\"Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'.\\" That's the main reason it's the only Journey song I like. All in all, though, the band's stellar musicianship, and their ability to carry it through just about anything, shine through in all their covers.  <br /> <br />As I said before, they're a hard group to understand. But \\"A Change of Seasons\\" is definitely the easiest to stomach of all their epics. And despite this fact, it's still an amazing piece of music. And the live material makes it easier to access than their later work, but the musicianship of the band still keeps you engaged. Perhaps this is why I recommend it as the best DT album to start with. It's user-friendly, but it's still Dream Theater doing what they do best.
B00008BXJG|5.0|Mutt Lange brought the brilliant ACDC work up to a new level with this album. The remaster, and the DIGIPACK have a bunch of Goodies, mainly the Booklet. <br />From start to finish, this is a great album. ACDC know what the fans want and they deliver. The Musicianship is solid. The best part of ACDC  is what you hear on record is what you get live ( only louder). <br />Mutt Lang did not change Bon's  voice, Lang did what any great producer does, he made the great voice clearer. <br />Bon's genius with lyrics is , not to put too fine a point on it, better than anything. As a performer he was great, as the FAMILY JEWELS  collections attests. <br />Contrary to some views, Bon Scott picked out Brian as his successor ... this has been sufficiently recorded elsewhere for this to be a fact. And Bon Scott did not die from his drinking, Bon died from Hypothermia on a very cold London night in the back of a car. All a tragedy.  <br />This band worked hard to get their place in rock. As Angus as said, you should have seen the toilets we played to get where we are. And the role of the Australian Police in Harassing the band out of Australia cannot be underestimated. <br /> <br />I usually  summarise ACDC as Blues with volume. And as basic as Angus is on Guitar, he plays with the skill of someone who communicates well. As with most great guitarists, better a few notes from them, than a million notes from a \\"Genius\\" on guitar. <br />And in the simplicity, there is genius. For what better way to communicate, than simply. <br />Ah... what the hell.... IT  ROCKS !!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />ENJOY
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters in December and I was simply amazed. Some people knock this film for seeming over the top and beyond the scope of actual relationships. I walked out of the theater and wanted nothing else but to see it again. It's eloquently written and beautifully acted. It seems as though it is a movie that you either love or hate, with not much in the way of middle ground. It's one of those films that just hits you an you can't forget it, or it goes straight over your head.
6302508878|5.0|When still a pre-teen, I was lucky enough to travel interstate in another country from where I am now, and the fun was in going from a place with 1 and a half ( :-) TV  channels, to a place with several channels. <br />Of course, as a 70s child, watching for primo TV  content was the go; and I had seen mention of KING KONG in various magazines. So, I usually caught up with the film around 3am, and though watched many times, it was always fun. Its that child-like ,kids freshness to the fun of films that I always try and maintain ( even in the super FX, and Super scarey ones). The restored version of KING KONG, the one and only original, made for an interesting watch, and whilst the difference was minimal, it was always intriguing. <br />For a few years, I, for some reason, thought Ray Harryhausen did the stop motion on this film ... still, same quality, and I had seen the films like JASON AND THE ARGONAUTS in a tv  edit, way before seeing KING KONG, although in 1974 I saw a years worth of horror on shows hosted by people who were novelties in Tasmania, but I gather were staples here ( Elvira types), so I enjoyed the spooksters, and even the edited FRANKENSTEIN. <br />But, there was always something about KING KONG that had an innocence, and as the final line said \\" it was beauty that killed the beast\\". <br /> <br />This is a memorable film. Maybe for people of my generation and before, but I hope not. Quality is quality, and in so many ways, good stories, good scripts, and good craft, live forever in the memories of the watchers, and also in the legacy they produce, since thats where they get their influence from. <br /> <br />ENJOY.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Fight Club is one of the best movies made in the past five years if not the best.  It is funny how when one's world view changes so does the perceptions of a work of art. And make no mistake this is a work of art. - high art.  So I write this review in three parts, pre 9-11 (when I first saw it), immediately post 9-11 and my present reflections on the movies message.  Fight Club was based on the short first novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. Although the movie and the book are somewhat different some of the best lines in the movie come from the book. I think if you like the movie you will like the book and if you like the book you will like the movie.  The movie met with mixed reviews, highly mixed reviews, and I am afraid not enough people (especially the right people) saw the movie. For that reason I will try not to give away too much about the relationship between the two main characters \\"Jack\\" and Tyler Durden.  Parts of the film are violent but the  violence is not gratuitous. It is a movie for people who like to think and be challenged and entertained.  This was a movie that was made with love as David Fincher has filled it with all sorts of visual details. The music by The Dust Brothers is exceptional and the lyric of the last song of the movie is very much in line with Buddhist teaching.  The movie is part meditation, part social commentary, part action movie , part comedy (a strange mixture of the varieties of black and light comfortably coexisting,) part love story and from my perspective  a very hopeful film. I see the movie as being great art that is open to numerous interpretations. In a way it is somewhat of a cinematographic Rorschach test.  The movie begins with the introduction of a character who is sometimes referred to as \\"Jack\\" (played by Edward Norton). Jack is clean cut buttoned down insomniac who works a boring job while accumulating trendy possessions (Fincher's special effects of bringing the Ikea catalogue to life is one of the things that brings a clever visual humor to this edgy comedy). Jack's insomnia is driving him over the brink while he continues to travel across the country from one city to another as a recall coordinator investigating (sometimes horrific) car accidents. After trying to obtain sedatives from a doctor the wisecracking physician instead recommends that Jack visit a cancer support group to understand what real pain is all about. This is our first inkling that \\"Jack\\" is on a spiritual journey. Jack not only gets comfort from participating in the support group (even though he is as healthy as a proverbial horse) he becomes addicted to support groups. In one he learns how to let loose and cry at another he participates in guided meditation. However his support groups are invaded by another healthy poser, Marla Singer (a role played to the hilt by Helena Bonham Carter). Marla's problems are slightly different from Jack's. She is a bored unemployed nihilist. The banter between Jack and Marla is priceless.  On one of Jack's business trips he happens to meet Tyler Durden. Tyler is cool: he talks cool, he dresses cool and is probably everything poor clean cut Jack wished he was. They exchange business cards. But after returning from this particular flight Jack finds out that his condominium and all of his possession have been destroyed by fire. Not having anywhere else to turn he calls Tyler. They go out to a bar  and have a few drinks where Tyler begins to explain his offbeat and anarchistic philosophy of life. After leaving the bar at the request of Tyler they engage in a fight that both finds cathartic. Jack having no where else to go returns with Tyler to his dilapidated home. Together they form something called Fight Club an organization where individuals gather for bare knuckle brawls to not only take out their frustrations but reclaim a sense of being alive.  A triangle forms between Jack, Tyler and Marlabut it is as much of a philosophical triangle as it is a love triangle.  However Tyler's plans do not stop there, he has a larger vision of changing the world.  Rather than Tyler coming across as a megalomanic he seems to symbolize the power of one individual in possession of a unique idea with the will to carry it out.  ---------  Immediately after 9-11 this movie was hard to look at. Although in Fight Club through all of the mayhem, violence and vandalism only one person is killed in the movie but it also featured scenes of mass destruction. But I was not able to dismiss the movie after the events of 9-11 - it caused me to reflect more on the movie. Real art does this.  What was the difference from the crazed terrorists that attacked America on 9-11 and Tyler Durden and his army of misfits who caused mass destruction that in the last frames of the movie looked eerily familiar to the attack on the WTC? Well for one thing I saw the destruction of physical structures as being symbolic for a fighting back of individuals who suffered a violence of the soulfrom the banality of modern culture. Further in this imaginary world of Fight Club things were destroyed but no one (except one of the Fight Club members) gets hurt. Finally it was the story of an entire generation of Americans rising up against hypocrisy - a far cry from a group of foreign invaders killing thousands of Americans and forcing their will on us. Still the scene of collapsing skyscrapers in NYCunfortunately takes on a whole new meaning in this post 9-11 world.  --------  Fight Club Redux  When you have a movie where grown men are beating the pulp  out of each other and sky scrapers collapse but  no one gets seriously hurt the violence cannot be taken seriously. So I see the violence being more of a symbol. Rather that Tyler being a Fascist like the vicious Islamo-terorrists that attacked us on 9-11 he is as American as apple pie. He is a man who against the odds helps to lead his generation out of the banality of their lives and restore the American dream. Tyler is avisionary and an idealist. He is not  a fascist who wants to imprison but an everyman who desires to liberate. In the end it is a hopeful movie.  --------  The movie is rated R and I agree with that rating if it is applied the way it is stated - no one under 17 unless accompanied by an adult. Ideally what is meant by that rating is that the said adult is  more than just a warm body that is over 21. The movie is violent but violence is not the point of the movie. So I guess I recommend the movie to thinking adolescents, adolescents accompanied by adults that possess a conscious and are able to communicate with a minor and of course adults themselves that are not psychopaths.  If you can't differentiate between reality and a movie don't see this movie.   When I was a kid my friends and I were Three Stooges fans and we couldn't figure out why when you poked someone in the eye you wouldn't get that plunck of a violin string sound effect. If you still can't figure that out don't watch this movie. I am not sure if many will take this advice seriously in these days when children can graphically dismember the very real looking image of a human being in a video game. It's not for kids.  A movie well worth seeing and owning.   One more note.  One of the nice things about owning the CD is being able to slow down the movie to see the subliminal frames placed in the film. Subliminal messages in movies is just another of the complex twists in this hilariously intelligent movie. The collector's edition has an additional disc and is well worth the few extra dollars.
0141185066|5.0|This story is a foundation of \\"modern classic literature\\". It not only tells the story of an idividual family, but paints a picutre of an era as a whole, and more than that; speaks to the humanity in everyone.
B000002RXS|4.0|In response to the ridiculous comments written by a child, Mr. Silver does sing Escamillo.  I have seen him perform many times.   <br />In addition, if Gedda did say that he had heard it before because it was said, in fact it was published, before he ever said it.  So he was COPYING!!!! <br />All of this really has nothing to do with the recording anyway.  The recording is great even though Gedda's voice is boring and nasal and constricted.  The fact that Mr. Ireland said that her voice had a wobble in the bottom and beat in the top (whatever that means) should tell, even you, that he does not know what he is talking about.  The wobble was in the top.  Any idiot knows that.  Even in her last concert tour when her voice ws horrible she did not have a wobble in the bottom.  DUH!
0156027321|5.0|A Quick and dirty review... this is a helluva story.  <br /> <br />This book taunted me with it's amazing press and peculiar story line: a boy and a tiger in a lifeboat. As I began to read and learn of Pi (the boy) and his zoological upbringing and unflinching questioning of modern religious and spiritual thought, I knew that this would be no ordinary story.   <br /> <br />Athieists, agnostics and believers alike will be haunted by this tale of one boy's recollection of his journey across the Pacific from India to Manhood. Truly a wonderful book club selection and should make for some enriching conversation.  Enjoy! <br />The Book Club Snob
B00004VXF2|1.0|The greatest thing about this album is that it was meant to play FOREVER.  On the LP, the final groove on side-4 was an unbroken loop, allowing the turntable to play and play and play and play...<br /><br />It is not a Rock record.  It has no songs, no melodies and no words.  It is 100% pure feedback.  It is only meant to be listened to by rock critics and prententious \\"fans\\" of avant-garde music.  Actually, this is about as close to LaMonte Young as Lou ever got.  Or perhaps...it is the closest to John Cale that Lou ever got!!!<br /><br />This should NEVER have been issued on CD because it simply was never meant to be (all LP sides are the exact same length, not including the \\"never-ending\\" 4th side), so my suggestion to you is to get this thing on vinyl.
1573223085|3.0|There is no denying the points Pink makes in his opening chapters: <br />* Asia (China, India, etc.) provides labor at much cheaper rates than in the US, <br />* Computers do left-brain-type calculations and other data-crunching work faster than US (or any other) workers, <br />* It's difficult for advanced industrialized nations to compete with most cheap products and services of developing nations. <br /> <br />But the solution Pink suggests seems glib and insufficient: teach people in the US, etc., to do right-brain (right-hemisphere of the brain) creative work that the cheaper-rate countries can't do. <br /> <br />I think it's apparent that that is a glibly simplistic proposal. The average (\\"standard\\") I.Q. is just 100, and the majority of people in any society are not going to be good at creativity -- creativity, after all, is not the norm. Pink's concept is one that is not going to fit the majority in any country.  <br /> <br />But Pink seems cheerily unaware of that reality, presenting this giddy utopian idea as if it were a practical solution for the majority of US society (as one example) to transition into. <br /> <br />The book is a worthwhile read, but Pink's proposed new societal norm for the US seems somewhat silly as a realistic proposal.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|Veronica Mars is the best captivating teenage drama full of mystery,suspense, and excitement. Pure teenage entertainment, with humor,complicated relationships(-love interests)and true teenage social situtations.  <br /> Veronica Mars is an extreme addiction. While watching you will be addicted to the on-screen actors playing the characters in Neptune with all their mystery and drama.  <br /> Veronica Mars is determined to find her best friend Lilly Kane's killer and so will you. On the way you will be interested in who did what to different cases brought to Neptune's new outkast Veronica. She was shunned out of her \\"perfect\\" world after Lilly's death and her father's claim that the Kanes did it.  <br /> This is honestly the best drama a teenager can find.  <br />(Veronica Mars has so much in depth detail, outly ranged characters, great dialouge, great relationships and so many elements you just can't ignore it.) <br />
B0007DAZW8|4.0|This album may not be as easily digestable as the previous two, Homework and Discovery, but that does not make it any less of an excellent collection of songs. <br /> <br />Every ingredient loved by this group is there:  catchy melodies, beats and bass to loosen your bowels, and the house/disco staple of repetition.   <br /> <br />But there is also an experimental side to the group namely in the song \\"The Prime Time Of Your Life\\".  <br /> <br />For those looking for more \\"adventurous\\" stylized electronic music look elsewhere.  Because this music has got memorable riffs and hooks.  More importantly it is unconcerned with how many edits there are per vocal take and more concerned with groove and melodies. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GADZO|3.0|I appreciate Steve Vai for his guitar capabilities but I find his songwriting ability questionable. I think one of the things I enjoy most about his friend Joe is just that, the songs even without words speak very clearly. I know I am not alone in saying how his tunes just get in your brain, soul and you just can't seem to shake em'. I find myself humming his tunes and for the life of me I just can't do that with a majority of Steve's offerings. They just aren't memorable enough. I have favorites from past Vai CD's and enjoy them very much but this new album has left me very discouraged. I didn't want to write a poor review because I am a fan but saying the new CD is great because it's Vai and new material is not something I can do. It has been a few years and it should be much better. To be weird, out there or whatever the label he has been given is not enough to convince me he can touch my soul. It's the private listening in my car, with headphones or in my home on a pair of Legacy Whisper's that will send that chill down my spine. Then and only then for me anyway will I truly be sold and thrilled by any new material. I will be seeing Vai live in Vegas and I know that seeing his enthusiastic playing will make me smile. I only wish his new recording would inspire me to smile as well. A true master in my opinion should have released something more inspiring. Honestly there are some new releases by lesser known artists that are much better and without naming names the distance between Vai and these artists is getting very narrow.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I love, love, love this album!  Mariah's sound is so different from the way she used to be, but I think that's for the better.  I can not stop listening to this cd.  Favorite tracks: It's Like That, We Belong Together, Stay The Night
B000002UJQ|5.0|this is my first and probobly last review i'll ever write. i just felt i had to write a review for Radiohead's- Ok Computer. this album basically changed the way i saw music. before i heard this album all i was into was punk and metal. after listening to this i've opened up my ears to nearly everything, wether i liked it or not i give almost everything a chance now, because iv'e realized that you should expand your musical taste and try and appreciate everything. <br /> <br />so obviously, this is my favorite album ever. it's kinda hard to get into at first, if you don't like it at first just listen to it a few more times cause you'll eventually love it. most people that don't like this album have either never heard it before, and just want to say it sucks because it's by a mainstreem band and all this stupid crap, or they havn't heard it more than once. <br /> <br />anyways. thom york is a genious. every track on here is awesome <br /> <br />i'm rambling on so i'm just gonna wrap this up. try this album out. listen to it,love it, be happy. <br />
B0007XT87G|5.0|I admit, I'm not a veteran Porcupine Tree fan; I have only ever heard \\"In Absentia,\\" and a few tracks from earlier albums.  However, I think that gives me an advantage, perhaps, over some of the other reviewers, insofar as it allows me to judge this album on its own merits, rather than comparing it to everything else done by PT.  As its own entity, this CD is good enough to deserve a 4.5, and since I'm loathe to give any review fewer than 5/5 stars, because expressing a non-majority opinion in a review apparently renders that review unhelpful, I've gone ahead and given \\"Deadwing\\" the full 5.<br /><br />\\"Deadwing\\" - Rather difficult to classify this song.  It has a variety of different sounds, all of which I like, except the whispered vocals.  There is some really nice motivic development and good exploration of different emotional areas - 9.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Shallow\\" - Much less impressive initially than the last track, with a Creed-ish opening riff, but the acoustic moments are nice, and the return of the heavier idea is moderately elaborated.  Enjoyable, but nothing phenomenal - 8.0/10.<br /><br />\\"Lazarus\\" - I kind of forgot to listen to this song, and it did nothing to force me to do so.  I remember it sounding kind of Coldplay-esque - 7.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Halo\\" - Great video game, okay song.  Just not really into the minimalist approach taken in the intro and subsequently, or the washed-out sound used a lot of the rest of the time.  Does have some annoyingly catchy and pleasant moments, especially towards the end - 7.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" - Demonstrates brilliant control over all the elements of a song.  Does exactly what it should do, exactly when it should do it, every time.  Thoroughly enjoyable - 10.0/10.<br /><br />\\"Mellotron Scratch\\" - So calm and relaxing and simplistically beautiful.  Nothing complex or wowing about this, just great music - 9.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Open Car\\" - Intriguing opening figure, contrasted with another vanilla pop rock riff, and a more acoustic section, repeated and expanded.  The balance is a bit suspect - 8.0/10.<br /><br />\\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" - The start of this song sneaks right in as the last track ends, and it is rather beautiful.  I'm always a fan of time signatures other than 3/4 or 4/4, so the song scores some points on that count.  Beyond that, it's a solid song - 9.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" - Reminds me a bit of Pink Floyd at moments.  Another good, well-made rock song - 8.5/10.<br /><br />\\"Shesmovedon\\" - Flat out cool.  Great addition to the album - 9.0/10.re acoustic section, repeated and expanded.  The balance is a bit suspect - 8.0/10. <br />\\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" - The start of this song sneaks right in as the last track ends, and it is rather beautiful.

B00000K31Q|4.0|This movie was a great reference for students trying to understand Shakespeare's play, The Taming of the Shrew. However, there were some differences between the two. Probably the main differences revolve around the Kat and Patrick's relation ship. In the movie Patrick treats Kat very well the whole time. He tames her by being nice to her. In the play Petruchio tames her by giving her a dose of her own medicine. The movie really helps you figure out what is going on in the play. It helps to give you a sense of who all of the characters are. I would recommend watching this movie before and after you read the play. That way you will have a feel for the characters and when you are done with the play you can compare and contrast.
B000683VI4|5.0|Words cannot express this film's sheer brilliance.  So brilliant is it, in fact, that one cannot gaze upon it without being blinded by the presence of a deity in its frames.  Yes, our Lord himself has graced this motion picture with a divine blessing, so that it may reach out to the world and fill it with light.  The man--nay, the saint--who directed this picture creates such a vivid and personal story that one would feel familiar with every sequence of events.  And in fact, one rightfully should feel this--for in his unquestionable genius, the director draws from all other similar stories to come out prior to this miracle.  In order for all of God's people to be closer and more touched by his work, this divine messenger made sure to infuse his story with aspects of every other story of its kind.  Thus, God has sent down upon his people this film--truly the greatest story ever told.
B00070DK14|4.0|BAtB is a great blend of classic Tull and early 80's arcade keyboard rock.  Stunned it wasn't big in America. Contained in what I think is one of the best sleeves of all time (I own 2 pristine vinyl copies) BatB has it all: Rockers, ballads, flute, no flute, something for everyone.  The arrangements are more straightforward than previous classic Tull records.   <br /> <br />I do have one minor gripe however...There were tons of songs recorded in the '81 Maison Rouge sessions for BatB..8 are included as bonus tracks and 7 left off. Why? I have no idea these 7 tracks are just as good or better than the album tracks....no kidding! To have these remastered would have made this release INSANE! Ian A. could've taken advantage of cd technology and included these songs for a 2 cd set along with the 7 tracks released on the 20 and 25 Anniversary box sets of '82 Hamburg BatB Tour. Well I made my own cdr and call it BatB Part II. For those completists out there:  <br />Studio tracks are: <br />1. Crew Nights  <br />2. The Curse    <br />3. Commons Brawl  <br />4. No Step  <br />5. Drive on the Young Side of Life  <br />6. Lights Out (not the UFO song)  <br />1-6  from the Nightcap cd set.  <br /> <br />7. Motoreyes (from 20 Ann. Box.)  <br /> <br />Live tracks  <br />8. Sweet Dreams  <br />9. The Clasp  <br />10. Pibroch/Black Satin Dancer  <br />11. Fallen on Hard Times  <br />12. Aqualung  <br />13. Locomotive Breath  <br />8-13 from 20 Ann. Box Set  <br /> <br />14. Seal Driver (from 25 Ann. set).   <br /> <br />BatB will now always be a 2 cd set but if you're not into the extra stuff this is still a wonderful Jethro Tull remaster....arguably their best of the 80's.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Drawing on the huge popularity of 1950's science fiction and comics,  \\"Sky Captain\\" takes the viewer on an exciting journey complete with giant robots and a P-40 fighter that doubles as a submarine.    The movie is set in the time period between World war I and World War II.  Reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) gets wind of a world takeover scheme by a mad German sceintist named Totenkopf.  Soon, New York City is being attacked by giant flying robots and other flying machines who are trying to steal the city's power generators.  Desperate, Polly calls on ex-boyfriend Joseph \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan for help.  He arrives just in time in his P-40 fighter plane and helps drive the robots off.  However, Joe's buddy Dex (Giovanni Ribini) believes that he can track the origin of the robots using radio waves.  After several attempts, he manages to track their base of origin to Nepal. So, Joe, Polly, Dex, and Franky Cook (Angelina Jolie), another of Joe's ex girlfriends and commander of a squadron of flying British aircraft carriers, set off to foil Totenkopf's plan, while braving more encounters with the robots and other mechanical enemies.    The setting for the movie is something driectly out of a 1950's sci-fi film, complete with the giant, poldding robots, as well as a deviant scientist trying to take over the world.  The computer animation and special effects are very good.  I especially liked Jolie's force of flying aircraft carriers.  As for the story itself, I had a little problem following some parts of the movie, but overall, I thought the story was very well-conceived.  The acting by Jude Law and Giovanni Ribini is very good, but I thought Gwyneth Paltrow's character of Polly Perkins was not developed very well.  She tends to whine and complain a lot, especially about not having enough film in her camera to take as many pictures as she would like to.  I wish that Franky would have had a larger part in the movie; Angelina Jolie did an excellent job in her role.    I think that people who watch this movie will enjoy it.  The story is, for the most part, exciting and fun to watch, and the special effects are extremely well done.  I recommend this movie.  Watch and get a feel of what science fiction movies were like in the 1950's.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Wilson, Barbieri, Edwin, and Harrison have made another masterpiece with Deadwing. The tracks flow excellently and always keep you guessing. I like that. Highlights for me are ''Open Car'', ''Shallow'', ''Halo'', and ''Mellotron Scratch''. All the tracks are good though. I do believe that ''Glass Arm Shattering'' is a great closer. Nonetheless, PT proves once again that they are geniuses in music making! WAAYYY better than any mainstream material now.

0312979479|5.0|If you've read a lot of Whodunit mysteries, it may seem like you've seen this premise before:  Several unconnected people end up together in an unusual situation only to have them start dying off mysteriously.  How will they stay alive and find the killer?<br /><br />However, this is the original and probably the masterpiece of this type.  It sets the standard and is often imitated and rarely duplicated as well.<br /><br />If you haven't read an Agatha Christie novel before, this is a great one to start with.  It is a stand alone novel without any of her recurring characters and it also gives you a chance to get used to how she writes (about 200 pages per book with an even balance between character and story development).<br /><br />If you are very familiar with this genre, you may find it cliche but you also might enjoy reading the story that started those cliches.<br /><br />THE BASIC PLOT:  Ten people are on an island with no way off and no other people on the island.  One by one, they are killed off in a matter similar to a children's poem found in the house where they are staying.  What is the reason for these ten random people to come together in this place and why are they being murdered?  And can the killer be stopped before they are all dead?

0684833395|5.0|Amanda Daddona, Mercy High School, Middletown, CT <br /> <br />Joseph Heller's novel, Catch-22, is an amazing piece of literature.  Through his realistic characters and witty and humorous use of dialogue, Heller allows the reader to infer their own opinion about war and governemnt, and the effet that war has on individuals.  Through the use of humor and understatement, he paints a picture of what war does to men; their ambitions, thir fear, and the inevitahle death of whoever happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, which he describes as \\"a matter of circumstance.\\"  This novel portrays a host of characters, all believeable and true to life.  Yossarian has a rational an understandable fear of death, and he questions an institution whose word is absolute law.  Yossarian sees that good men die for antoher man's cause, and in turn question his own positon in the war and what he is doing there, fighting in a war he deson't believe in.  <br /> <br />The concept of Catch-22 showed the absolute power that the military had over the men, and also demonstrated how when soemthing is accepted and not questioned, it can have power over people.  Catch-22 did not exist, but because people believed it did, it had power and influence over them.   <br /> <br />In the novel, humor is used in such a way that what is written seems light and fivolous, but really holds a deeper and more horrifying meaning.  There were several instances of this:  the interrogatioin of Clevinger and the chaplain, Cathcart's obsession with missions and getting into the Saturday Evening Post, the very definition of Catch-22, Doc Daneeka's \\"death\\", and Milo's extreme capitalism.  <br /> <br />The effects of war are plainly seen as well:  Yossarion's progression from acceptance of his missions to falt denial to go up in a plane ever agian, his questioning of the war itself, the deaths of the men, Nately's girlfriend's insanity after she hears the devestating news, the ambitioin of the men of higher rank in the military, the chaplain's doubts and fears, and Milo's increasing empire, M&M Enterprises. <br /> <br />Despite all of the horrors, Heller presents us with a light of hope in the character Orr, Yossarian's comapanion who is more than he seems.  He manages to escape and this gives Yossarian the extra push to make his own decisioin about escaping the trap that Catch-22 has him in.   <br /> <br />Each character, as I said earlier, is realistic and believble, which makes the novel more meaningful and appealing to me.  There is a rainbow of personalitioes, from the quiet chaplain to outspoken Yossarian, the hypchondriac Doc Daneeka, the excessive capitalist Milo, the ambitious Cathcart, the fearful and awe-insiring Major____de Coverly, young and naive Nately, the prostitues, as well as many others.  All of these characters are real people facing real issues that are connected to and rooted in war.  There is a struggle for survival that these people must face, and they all face it in their own way.  Some are succesful, and some aren't.   <br /> <br />Heller presents, then, a novel of paradoxes, a novel about war and survival, hoplessness and hope, ambition and humility.  He describes the horor of war without actually stating it.  And though this book deals with serious issues, it is also very entertaining to read.  I laughed aloud numerous times and enjoyed reading every page.  And so, this gifted author leaves us with a novel I consider to be one of the greatest I have ever read.  I highly recommend this novel to anyone and eveyrone.

B00000K31Q|4.0|As I watched 10 Things I hate About You, I realized all the similarities between that and the play it is based on.  As the movie begins, the play itself unfolds.  Characters are easily identified; (Kat is Kate, Patrick as Patruchio etc.).  As the characters followed the play, the storyline did take a modern turn.  The father in the movie was much different than that of Batista in Taming, having more of a stricter personality toward his daughters.  But in Taming, Batista was much more outgoing and happy with the suitors.  As the general plot of the movie goes, it takes a modern turn and is set a high school.  Unlike the play, which is set in a town square (or in Padua).  The movie does an excellent job of portraying the Shakespearean masterpiece, and is a must watch movie for understanding the play.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert doesn't need another review. If it hasn't been said in the 258 reviews already posted when I wrote this, it probably isn't worth saying. I'm only writing this because I need to share my reaction with others who've experienced this astounding concert. <br /> <br />I ordered this on impulse a few weeks ago on the strength of its rating and, having watched it a few times, I can't get it out of my mind. Snippets of songs and images surface, then minutes go by while I re-live a few of the scenes. Then I forget it until it crops up again an hour later. My work is suffering. <br /> <br />There's a whole collection of things that make this concert work. The quality of the musicianship and the production, the prevailing strength of emotion that drives the performance, the brilliance of the music. For me, one of the great joys is the recurring surprise when I watch it, even now having watched it many times. There are so many great performers, so many superb solos and phrases, that I forget some by the next viewing. So it comes as a joy to see the way Sam Brown sneaks a smile during her number, or to witness Tom Scott take his blistering solo in the middle of her song. Hey, who played that great lick? Hey, there's Jim Keltner and Jim Horn. There's Klaus Voorman! I forgot he was there too. And so it goes. <br /> <br />I remember enough of my statistics lectures to know that the more people you survey, the more likely it is that their average opinion will drift towards the middle of the range. Here you have 258 opinions (259 now, including mine) and this DVD still rates the maximum 5 stars. How good is that? <br />
B0000CDLA7|2.0|This album is my least favorite of all DT- except \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" of course- Its just not very progressive- a lot of technical showing off- its just not DT- Labrie- I really hope you dont RAP in DT's next album! Its prob 2 1/2 stars- get it if you like DT- but I dont reccomend for a new listener- start with Scenes from a memory, or Images and Words.
B0007ACVHI|5.0|When I got this CD, my wife remarked, not without some justice,  <br />\\"Oooo! More Bach cello. Just what you needed.\\" Well...yeah. There are more first-rate classical musicians in the world today than Bach would have believed possible. And  more of them are being recorded than ever before and if that isn't just one of the neatest things about being alive today then I'm a Dutchman. And if getting even a mediocre recording of the cello suites at Naxos prices isn't one of the other neatest things then I'm Dutchman 2, The Sequel. And this, my friends is no mediocre recording. No, no and no. <br /> <br />In reading, as I do, the other reviews on the Amazon website, it appears to me that the most grievous sin in Bach cello performances is nasty old \\"rubato\\". An awful lot of folks get their knickers in disarray over it's appearance. My guess is they don't like surprises. I figure a man or woman puts in the years of dedication and dicipline it takes to master an instrument as difficult as the cello; puts in the time to learn a score...learn it so well that they don't even have to think about it but can just make music; well I figure that man or woman has earned his or her rubato. Be warned. Ms. Kliegel uses rubato. And, boy oh boy, does she make music. <br /> <br />I know, Casals blah blah, Fournier blah blah, Schiff blah, Rostropovich blah, Maisky bl...etc. I have them all and they are each uniquely splendid. And everybody knows it. As Dogberry says to his deputy, \\"Comparisons are odorous, Master Verges.\\" But if you must compare this performance, I guess you can hold it next to Gendron as she's using his Stradivarius. And ladies and gentlemen, the SOUND! <br /> <br />I bought this CD on spec, never having heard of Maria Kliegel, because it was cheaper than a movie ticket and a box of popcorn and because I want to encourage the recording of Bach. Having heard it, I would gladly have spent four times as much. I just wish they had some of those Media Player previews so you could hear some of it yourself rather than have to rely on the opinion of some stranger. (My wife says they don't come much stranger and she knows me intimately.)
0345363132|5.0|I love Penman's novels.  This one in particular is moving and entertaining.  I have read all her novels so far and am impatiently awaiting another.  She pulls you in and leaves you wondering how so many pages could possibly go so quickly.
0440211727|1.0|I read The Firm when it came out it in 1990. I thought it was boring. Since then I struggled through the Pelican Brief and The Runaway Jury. They were both boring and formulaic too. A friend told me A Time to Kill was different. In a way it is, it's worse. <br /> <br />The story is potentially interesting had it not been in the hands of an author with a limited vocabulary, no ear for dialogue and absolutely no talent for writing. As it is, it comes across as simplistic, racist, and downright dangerous. Grisham's view is that a father deserves to kill the rapists who kill his daughter - that is justice. Okay, in that case what's stopping the parents of Cobb and Willard from killing the parents or children of Hailey? An eye for an eye - or is the appropriate test for vigilantes to be judged on Grisham's simplistic terms?  <br /> <br />Grisham has so little confidence in his own theory about vengeance that he resorts to cheating to win his argument. Deputy Looney lies on oath and tells a story that he and Brigance have rehearsed. Yet he won't buy off the jury when given the opportunity, because we are meant to believe he has ethics. Yeah right. <br /> <br />There are a multitude of sins. First off Brigance wouldn't ever be counsel - he's a key witness for the prosecution since Hailey told him he would commit the crime. This is just one of the many flaws. The interaction in the courtroom is ludicrous. Before the end there would have been a mistrial based on Brigance's actions with costs ordered against him personally. As another post points out, the manner in which Hailey is treated by the Sheriff and the police force borders on farce. It's so unrealistic you wonder if this is a veiled comedy. Perhaps it is a comedy - in one scene the police  pass off another prisoner for Hailey and in front of the media allow him to run free. How realistic! <br /> <br />Sub plots come and go, such as Cat the drug dealing gun runner. Apparently the police are unable to connect him to the murders and he disappears. In the same way the juror who is threatened with murder (Grisham has turned this into a staple sub plot obviously) is forgotten about and the whole incident is wrapped up unconvincingly.  <br /> <br />For the Grisham novels I have read it is clear he cannot describe or flesh out characters at all - women in particular. Brigance's wife has \\"beautiful legs\\" (all Grisham's heroes have wives with great legs) and that is all. We know nothing else about her. In fact, the author's general treatment of women in his books, and this in particular, has me wondering if he is a misogynist. Brigance's treatment of his secretary Ethel is appalling, and for no reason. I can only think that Ethel was someone in Grisham's life and this was his way of getting back at her. Brigance repeatedly tells her he is \\"sick of her\\" in one scene and in another repeatedly tells her to \\"shut up\\". The scenes are genuninely disturbing - Brigance is a tyrannical bully. To ram home the point that Grisham has something against this woman, Ethel's husband is later attacked and killed. <br /> <br />Lastly, the book is just poorly written, pure and simple. I challenge any fan to name one memorable character, one memorable line of dialogue or one memorable description. There is a place for simple, page-turning thrillers, but this is inept. Avoid.
B0007XT87G|5.0|'Deadwing' is actually quite a shocking record, in terms of the new ground covered and the variation in quality of the tracks themselves. Wilson has pushed the heavier and more angular facets of the band, although actually quite a lot of the original Porky tree beauty and harmony remains. Following 'In Absentia' was a pretty ridiculouys task (I consider that record a flawless masterpiece) but 'Deadwing' certainly covers all the bases. Track for track it doesnt nearly match IA, or indeed 'Lightbulb Sun' but the high points here are very high indeed.<br /><br />It is fitting, then, that the first track,'Deadwing' itself, should be among the greatest the band have ever put down. It begins with an eerie cauldron of sound effects and samples, before exploding into life with spectacular effect. the vocal melodies here are well written and they fit with the (excellent and evocative) lyrics very well, which is welcome. As a whole the track is hard to describe: it turns on a few dynamic twists, a single crescendous harmony half way in, and an understated ambient middle. Adrien Belew contributes a weird solo wich perfectly complements the edgy and uncomfortable nature of the whole. It is a spectacular opener.<br /><br />'Shallow' the 'big dumb rock number' turns on a really cool riff and a memorable chorus, although it suffers from an increasing amount of repetition and the hook just cant compete with 'Blackest Eyes' for sheer PT scrumptiousness. 'Lazarus' a piano driven and moving ballad, is better, with picturesque (and somewhat English) lyrics and a sweeping, delicate middle eight. 'Halo' has a righteous hook (it hits in right on that word in fact, check it out!), a stunning mid section and overall has a very modern upbeat feel to it. 'Halo' best showcases the catchier direction the band can take without sacrificing their integrity.<br /><br />'Arriving Somewhere but Not Here' is the centrepiece, a well crafted and executed epic which recalls the PT of old more than anything here. The driving chorus is just wonderful, and the super heavy middle section is actually very welcome, especially when it is juxtaposed with a mellow, relaxed solo by Mike Akerfeldt. 'The Start of Something Beautiful' is another tour de force: the climax of the instrumental middle has to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />Overall 'Deadwing' has many beautiful moments, although 'Glass Arm Shattering' is a somewhat weak closing number, which pales next to 'Collapse the Light...' or 'Feel so Low'.<br /><br />As an experiment and an attempt to forge a new direction, 'Deadwing' has to be considered a success. It does more than enough to merit 5 stars, although I feel some quality control and perhaps a tightening of some of the lyrics wouldnt have gone amiss. These are small complaints though, as 'Deadwing' is a marvellously addictive and compelling record, which really benefits from repeat listens as many of the tracks are real growers. Any PT fan will of course be insane not to have this: for newcomers I would really recommend 'In Absentia' to begin (at least with this phase of the band), although 'Deadwing' is overall a bit heavier so if you are appraching the band from a metal perspective (which seems a bit unlikely, I know, unless you really dig Opeth or something) this might be a good bet. A great and rather different triumph for Porcupine Tree.iving chorus is just wonderful, and the super heavy middle section is actually very welcome, especially when it is juxtaposed with a mellow, relaxed solo by Mike Akerfeldt.

B00004Z459|4.0|Linkin Park's debut album, \\"Hybrid Theory\\", is a cool album. When I say \\"cool\\"; I not refering to a a hip, fun sound (which it also has), but rather the type of images the album brinfs to mind. The tone, the lyrics, the insturmentals; they all create mental images of cold locations and objects. The videos for \\"Crawling\\" and \\"Pts.Of.Athrty\\" only reinforce this feel. I mention this fact because I have never heard another album with a similar feel to it. There really is a unique sound to the album; making this one of the most original rock albums in years. Not P.O.D., Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, or any other recent rick debuts have captured a sound like this. But, ah, although it is generally rock; shades of hip-hop and techno are also mixed in to create a true hybrid (hence the title) of music. If the album has one weakness, it is the lack of standout tracks. Everything works as whole, but the individual parts are not strong as I would have liked While the two singles both began on the hard rock charts, they eventually worked their way up to the top of the mainsteam charts. They are:  - \\"Crawling\\" B+. This track is a true mix of light, spiritual techno and striking, hard rock; accomplishing both pretty well. The chorus and prechorus rock with thundering insturmentals and strak voices, yet the other verses are so light and deep that they really penetrate into the soul. The song is both fun and chilling at the same time; a very interesting single.  - \\"In The End\\" A-. Just as much depth as \\"Crawling\\"; even if the impact isn't so strong. It's a refreshing jumble of hard rock and hip-hop that flows with perfect skill and ease. It's hard, but at the same time rather relaxing. Kind of a nice flip side to the \\"testosterone loaded rap-metal\\" of Limp Bizkit (also very good). I love this rock track.  Most of the other tracks don't have as much of a lasting impact as those two singles; yet they're still demonstrations of the groups talents and skills. If there are other really notablenon-singles, I definetly recomend \\"Points Of Authority\\" and \\"One Step Closer\\"; two hard rock tracks which show the group expressing their skill with complete confidence and ease. \\"One Step Closer\\", in particular, shows the groups tough and youthful energy. More standout tracks would have been very helpful; it's important for an album's parts to equal the whole as well. Still, in the end (no pun intended) we have a solid hard rock with a sound like nothing else. Some people may scoff at the mix of styles, but I find it refreshing because it gives the music a new sound.  Bottom Line: ***. I recomend the album for that \\"cool\\" feel alone; you really have to hear something that unique and original. This is one of the best rock debuts of the 2000s.
B0002IVN9W|1.0|This is perhaps the most over hyped cd this year. I have given it several shots, and not once does it get off the ground. Very repetitive, and boring. I heard comparisons to these guys and other bands that I listen to, let me tell you these guys separate themselves from the pack....they are just plain dull. Perhaps it was the trendy art cover, or the cool name...You got me, because I have no idea what the buzz about this band is. Thank heaven I was able to cash in and sell it, right here to one of the 5 star reviewers.
B00005JNVS|5.0|Benny Hill. Road Runner. Tex Avery. Hee Haw. The honor roll of highbrow comedy? No. But the most obvious possible inspirations for Stephen Chow's great new flick, Kung Fu Hustle, you betcha.<br /><br />I love this film. But I may have laughed so much it was dangerous. As I gasped for air, no doubt turning purple and falling over several times during this masterpiece, I kept trying to get myself to calm down a little. I truly want you to go see this great film, a.s.a.p., but remember, it is so insanely funny it may be hazardous to your health. (Possible treatment for this condition: Breath deeply, count thirty and think of the last Adam Sandler film you saw. Yeah, that would do it.)<br /><br />Litmuswise, a few points. You must accept and smile at women who wear curlers 24/7, who beat up on their skinny husbands, and who smack the sundry citizen upside the head with a house shoe, to like this film. You have to think crushing bones and kicking people square in the jaw is, at least in theory, the very nucleus of great comic genius. And the sight of people running down the road at 80 miles an hour, Benny Hill style (but with CGI, natch) has to double you over in helpless paroxysms of laughter AT LEAST the first time it happens. If any of these pertain to you, then you very well may get the brilliance of this film.<br /><br />Now, it's not all crude, rude and socially unacceptable. I don't want to give the game away, but the scene where Sing selects an opponent to square off with Mano y Mano from among the townsfolk is purest Keaton, as is the scene of his attempted assassination of Landlady. Astonishing, out of the box, cerebral visual gag-making at it's finest. Bravo!<br /><br />Ten stars of ten. Someone said that the tiny things in this film work better than the blowout set pieces. I'm not sure I agree-- and we could quibble all day about which things in this film are small and which big-- but I like this comment simply because it may prompt people to take a closer look at the great SMALL things in this film.<br /><br />But overall, and this can't be overemphasized, I think the whole thing works like a Swiss watch. Scene for scene, there isn't anything I would remove as flab or as a misfire. Chow makes good. REAL good. We are very lucky, indeed,  to have him making films like this in our time.closer look at the great SMALL things in this film.  <br /> <br />But overall, and this can't be overemphasized, I think the whole thing works like a Swiss watch.

B00006879E|1.0|If there is a CD to stay away from, this is it. This is nothing other than, another label investing too much on a horrible band. The band isn't making it, so we will shove it down your throats on every radio station, give it a grammy, put them in arenas, then the public will be brainwashed to think this is a good product.  <br /> <br />Folks, let me hit the alarm...wake up, this is 100% boring. It happened last summer too, they shoved evanescense(don't ask me to spell it), down our throats with the video playing every 5 minutes, making us think this was a good band, Maroon 5 is no different. Cool name but horrible band. If you like counting the dots on the ceiling for extended periods of time, then step right up, this could be the best cd you have ever heard. <br /> <br />Lastly, dump it now while you can....If you wait even a couple of months, it will be piled up with the other 200,000 chambawamba cd's for a buck, and I mean all 200,000 for a buck...Don't know who they are?...case and point.
0345440803|2.0|I liked the Baby Whisperer book, even though I did not agree with her on everything.  This book seemed like a book put out in a hurry without the detailed know how of her first book.   <br /> <br />I am certain her techniques work well with passive toddlers.  If you have a demanding toddler and juggling a demanding life, you will likely find this book frustrating.  Much of her advice when tried on a demanding child will get you no where.  She does have some good tips, but overall I did not get as much substance as I did fromt he first book.
B00008CLOA|5.0|I love Pink Floyd. This album is one of there best. But ther are so many other Pink albums out there that rock just as much as darkside...if not more.A lot people who say \\"greatest album ever\\" know only this album and mabey the wall. Has it ever occured to you people to wonder how Pink Floyd went from sounding like they did on Darkside to a totally differnt sound on the wall? The answer is in all the albums stuck between.  <br /> <br />Heres a list of albums that you definetly HAVE to have. <br /> <br />1.PIPER AT THE GATES OF DAWN- the ORIGINAL floyd sound, very psychedelic with the genius Syd Barrett. Look him up, and you'll get one hell of an education about Pink Floyd. 1967 <br /> <br />2.ATOM HEART MOTHER- The floyd finding their feet after losing an unforgettable friend, Syd.  1970 <br /> <br />3.MEDDLE- Pink Floyd perfecting the sound they were searching for.    1971 <br /> <br />4.WISH YOU WERE HERE- This is probably there 3rd most well known album. Whole album is dedicated to Syd Barrett. A must have. <br />          -1975 <br /> <br />5.ANIMALS- This is the key album where Roger Waters became pink floyd. Roger took control and became a much differnt person from this album on. -1977 <br /> <br />6.THE FINAL CUT- This is more of a Roger Water's solo album than pink floyd...but still good. Its all about Rogers father dying in WW2, and dealing with it. -1983 <br /> <br />If you buy these album...you will become a more experienced Floyd Fan. After these are bought, buy these.... <br /> <br />A saucerful of secrets-1968 <br />More-1969 <br />Ummagumma-1969 <br />Obscured by clouds-1972 <br />The Division Bell-1992 <br /> <br />Syd Solo Albums- <br /> <br />Madcap Laughs-1969 <br />Barrett-1970 <br /> <br />
B0000AUHPG|5.0|WOW!!!<br /><br />I truly enjoyed watching this movie from start to finish. Never got bored. Matter of fact I was thrilled to see the way it was directed, I loved the closeups. The action sequence. The setup. Characters. Soundtrack just right Ennio Is a genius.<br /><br />It goes without saying that \\"The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly\\" is the best piece Sergio ever made when it comes to Spaghetti Westerns, but, nevertheless, the movie in my opinion would be the runner up.

B0002OERI0|1.0|first of all. i used to think greenday was awesome. until i relised they aren;t doing it for the music. <br /> <br />they get payed millions of dollars to play instraments they arent even good at. the reason people like them is because they listen to classics with talent change a few chords and put lyrics saying they hate poser sell-outs and that the government is bad. then they get some famous butician to dress them up to make them look like a \\"punk\\". i personally put these dumasses under the line them up and shoot them category. <br /> the people actually saying this is good probably never even seen a real punk preformance before. and are even worse then greenday itself. <br />
0441172717|5.0|Dune, by Frank Herbert, is the most fascinating book I have ever read besides The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien.  <br /> Dune is about a Royal Family of the Atriedes lineage. The Atriedes House are rivals with the evil House Harkonnen. The Atriedes receive the desert planet of Arrakis, also known as Dune, from the Harkonnens because the Harkonnens want to be in favor with the emporer. After the Atriedes move to Arrakis from their safe homeworld of Caladan, this doesn't come with out cost though. This is when the story starts to get action packed. At this point in the story things start to get complicated. <br /> Something about \\"Dune\\" is that it has so much detail. Every thing in the world has it's own name in the \\"Dune\\" universe and is so detailed. However, this  means that it takes a while to get into the story and understand everything. New characters are introduced continuously, and the reader thinks \\"Where did you come from?\\". Also, many plot twists add to the confusion. These things make the book harder to understand the first time around, but they make sense looking back at it when it is finished. Dune overall is completely satisfying as a science fiction novel. It's tough to get at times, but hang in there; it is totally worth the read.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Not only is it a great feat to accomplish overcomng the hardships that she has gone through, it is the best album she's ever put out. <br /> <br />THIS ALBUM SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS THE BEST! *Yes over Faith's new album, which is also good.

B0007GAERG|4.0|When I first heard Mariah was on the verge of releasing this album, I felt a little nervous. While I simply adore her and think that she has one of the best voices around today, I was expecting to be disappointed with the outcome of the album. Then I pressed play: I have to say I was more than impressed I was astonished. Mariah had been able to turn herself around and  <br />emancipate herself from her last few disappointing albums....the voice is back. While she has managed to adapt to the sounds and images of today, she manages to hold onto her roots, which is very impressing, considering the fact that not many people can migrate from decade to decade while still holding on to their fanbase while adding to it simultaneously. Here is my breakdown of the album:  <br /> <br />1. It's Like That: Great first single however, Jermaine Dupri is a little to prevalent in the song. Very catchy up tempo beat, and Mariah looks hot in the video! 5/5  <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together: One of the most beautiful songs she has ever written. Chilling to the bone her voice is sort of haunting in this one. Very glad that it is a single. I can only imagine the remixes. 10/5  <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off: Not one of my favorites of the album, although it has a good beat. 2/5  <br /> <br />4. Mine Again: Very beautiful ballad. Reminds me of Vision of Love in a strange way. Still, Mariah flies solo in this one, so it's a very beautiful song. 4/5  <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin': Snoop and Mimi reunite!!! I loved Crybaby, and their chemistry is great in this song as well. Very well put together. Sort of has a 70's vibe to it. 5/5  <br /> <br />6. Stay the Night: Very catchy lyrics. The song gets stuck in your head, but that's not a bad thing. I love the melody on this one. 4/5  <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number: For some reason I haven't been able to take a liking to this song. I can't put my finger on it. Not one of my favorites on the album. Maybe it's JD again :(. 2/5  <br /> <br />8. Oneand Only: I didn't really care for this song either.It's a slower song, but it doesn't excite me. Maybe it's because she's rapping in this one. 2/5  <br /> <br />9. Circles: I enjoy this one. It has an \\"Underneath the Stars\\" feel to it. Very catchy and it flows very nicely. Mariah's voice shines nicely in this one. 4/5  <br /> <br />10. Your Girl: One of my favorite songs on the album. It carries a 70'sesque vibe with it very charming and catchy. I blast this one in my car frequently :) 8/5  <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew: Starts off like \\"Yours\\", but sounds very-gospel like. Very nice ballad. 3/5  <br /> <br />12 To the Floor: I have a feeling that this will be the next single. It's very catchy and up beat. An excellent club song in my opinion with a great potential for some awesome remixes. 4/5  <br /> <br />13 Joy Ride: Yet another one of Mariah's beautiful ballads. Her voice carries the song so beautifully. I get goosebumps. 4/5  <br /> <br />14. Fly Like A Bird. Mariah's signature gospel ballad. Very empowering and beautiful song. I like this one a lot. Especially the message it evokes. 5/5  <br /> <br /> <br />With that said, this album is a substantial improvement over her last few works. I think Mariah realized what worked for her as well as her fans, and she went with it. Her voice truly shines in songs she sings herself, but her collaborations have something to be said for themselves as well. This is a terrific album if you are a die-hard MC fan. You will not be disappointed. I am accepting her emancipation with \\"Open Arms.\\" :)
B0001611DI|4.0|This is a very gory zombie flick with some really good special effects and superior acting for a film of this kind.  What really puts this one out in front of the many other zombie flicks is the superb direction and outstanding camera work.  Romero gives the script a real sense of credibility. My only complaint is that at over 2 hours, I thought it could have used a little trimming.     Sure NOTLD will always be the top of the heap but this fantastic Romero effort ranks a close second in providing a realistic and stylish look at the world of the living dead...
0679745203|1.0|Ok, to be fair, the author won a Booker Prize for this book.  There must be some attributes that I don't see.  A very talented author friend complimented the style - very matter of fact...which it is and which the author has mastered.  As for the plot - there isn't much of one.  Four people come together in a ruined villa in Italy near the end of WWII.  They each are haunted by their experiences of the war and they somehow find solice in each other's company.  A chapter here and there I found very interesting - I thought perhaps the story was picking up.  It quickly fell off into dullness again.  I just don't know how to critique this book beyond my personal opinion that it was a very dull, slow-moving story with brief glimpses of interest and intrigue followed by more dull droning.  I truly skimmed the last 100 pages with little interest.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I used to listen to Mariah a lot in the late '90s, and I loved her disco remixes. I even thought it was very unfortunate the critics bashed her and only a small percentage of fans supported her for her debut semi-autobiographical film Glitter, because she gave her best shot at it, and I actually enjoyed the movie and the songs. After several years of being low profile in the music scene, The Emancipation of Mimi will definitely put her back at the top of game! It's obvious that she's put in a lot work for the songs in the Album, and it's very up-to-date musically.<br /><br />I just loved the cover of this Album, because her hair and the waterry looking gold dress makes her look like a cyber Goddess, so much more tasteful than the cover of Rainbow. As I open the jacket of album, it has 5 definitions of Emancipation: (1) To free from restraint, control, and oppression, or the power of another. (2) to free form any controlling influence. (3) Give equal rights to: of women and minorities. (4) to free somebody from restrictions or conventions. (5) to release fromm care, responsibility and control. I really loved the name of this album and the definitions are introspective and personal and I am sure a lot of her fans can relate to some of them.<br /><br />There is just three photos used, and there is mini poster of the cover photo with all the songs printed on the other side. She looks stunningly sexy and gorgeous!<br /><br />Most of the songs are solos, and there is four songs featuring guess singers including Snoop Dogg(Say Something), Jermaine Dupri(Get Your number), Twista( One and Only), and Nelly(To The Floor). Most of the songs are catching and sultry tunes that are very danceable, and I am sure the remixes will dominate the club scene soon. Her songs are consist of mostly R and B, Rap, and several ballads. I miss her singing songs like My All and I Still Believe. Here, she offered I Wish I Knew, Joy Ride, and Fly Like A Bird for the ballad lovers. Other songs will definitely make you get into the groove, and move those hips!<br /><br />Having neglected listening to her in recent years, I am glad to have picked this album. I am also glad the Diva is back and better than ever!gs will definitely make you get into the groove, and move those hips! <br /> <br />Having neglected listening to her in recent years, I am glad to have picked this album. I am also glad the Diva is back and better than ever!  <br /> <br />

6302038308|3.0|Evil Dead II: Dead by Dawn (Sam Raimi, 1987)<br /><br />Dead By Dawn is one of those films that makes you ask the question \\"remake or sequel?\\" over and over again while you're watching it. Raimi has changed the rules a bit from the first film in this one, but kept Ash, leading to the viewer's almost constant confusion.<br /><br />In this episode, Ash and his girlfriend Linda (Denise Bixler) head up to the cabin that everyone (except, it seems, Ash) remembers from the original film. Ash discovers the book and the tape player, which again, everyone (except, it seems, Ash) will remember, and does exactly what he shouldn't do. With the expected consequences.<br /><br />Intercut with this are scenes of Annie (Sarah Berry, who would later surface in the lovely CHUD II), the daughter of the guy reading the passages aloud on the tape, who has a vapid boyfriend, a need to get to the cabin, and the other pages of the book, which (conveniently) contain the spell to send the evil back where it came from. Of course, we end up with everyone at the cabin, waiting to become zombie food.<br /><br />Dead By Dawn is by far the weakest of the three Evil Dead movies, but it's got its own charm; it's kind of The Evil Dead Meet the Three Stooges. It alternates between awful and hysterical. And it didn't have to be awful; it was immediately obvious from the first half-hour of The Evil Dead that Sam Raimi knew a camera lens from a plate of spaghetti, but either a good deal of the comedy here falls flat, or Raimi did portions of this film as a rush job (a quick skim of the list of goofs at IMDB gives the latter impression). It's also, obviously, meant as (perhaps its primary reason for being was) setup for Army of Darkness, a far superior film, and it has a great deal of archival value based on that. But as a standalone film, it's not all that great. ** ½
B000000WF0|4.0|I bought this CD because I wanted to hear the song \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\".  That song is memorable.  However, there are some songs on their CD that are just as good to listen to.  I had to give myself some time to actually listen with the whole CD; well, the last two I haven't listened to yet.  But the songs are good.  It's too bad that they broke up just when they were reaching to their peak of fame.
006441034X|4.0|Diana Wynne Jones, Howl's Moving Castle (Greenwillow, 1986)<br /><br />I admit it-- I have fallen completely under the spell of Diana Wynne Jones. Howl's Moving Castle is a delight of a fantasy novel, taking things that should be predictable and making them not so (as in, you're saying \\"I should have known that was coming\\" at least ten times as you read it).<br /><br />Sophie Hatter, the eldest of the Hatter sisters, is convinced that she's destined for failure because, well, she's the eldest. Her father dies suddenly, and her not-so-wicked stepmother inherits the business, giving Sophie an apprenticeship and sending her two sisters off to apprenticeships with other artisans (a baker and a witch) in order to make ends meet. Sophie manages to offend the Witch of the Waste, a rather all-around nasty sort, and gets cursed. In order to get the curse lifted, she makes a desperate attempt to throw in her lot with the wizard Howl, whose moving castle (you knew that was coming, right?) putters around the outskirts of Market Chipping, the town in which Sophie lives, despite the widespread rumors that Howl like to eat girls' souls...<br /><br />This is great stuff. Young adult fantasy that, like all good young adult material, is sure to hold the interest of adults as well. Jones' writing style is (for want of a better term) sprightly, and keeps the pages turning, and the characters are quite well-formed. (If there is a place where the book dips, it's that Jones does a bit more telling of the characters' emotions than showing, though she does offset the effect by couching it oftentimes in amusing dramatic monologues).<br /><br />If you haven't yet become a fan of Diana Wynne Jones, this is a fine place to start, especially with the recent film adaptation (by no less a personage than Hayao Miyazaki) getting ready for release in the western market. ****
B000002GQL|5.0|A fitting end to the band's \\"classic seven,\\" \\"Seventh Sojourn\\" is a superb album with only one sub-par song, the ponderous \\"When You're a Free Man.\\"  Otherwise, it is full of gems, from Lodge's kinetic rocker \\"I'm Just a Singer (in a Rock and Roll Band),\\" which is one of his best, to Hayward's moving ballad \\"New Horizons,\\" to Thomas' little ditty \\"For my Lady.\\"  \\"You and Me\\" and \\"Land of Make Believe\\" are both wonderful songs, and sound like they should be forever linked together.  Pinder's pensive opener \\"Lost in Lost World\\" sets the desolate mood of the album as a whole.  Lodge's \\"Isn't Life Strange\\" has a memorable chorus, which manages to be both  uplifting and heartrending.    For me, the Moody Blues reign as a great band ended after \\"Seventh Sojourn.\\"  The Moodies comeback album, \\"Octave,\\" was a tremendous let-down and just plain boring.  Although \\"Long Distance Voyager,\\" \\"The Other Side of Life,\\" and \\"Present\\" have their (all too occasional) moments, the band would sorely miss the departure of Mike Pinder and his mellotron.  Further, Ray Thomas' role in the band diminished, as did the song-writing abilities of Hayward and Lodge.  But, to paraphrase Bogart in \\"Casablanca,\\" we'll always have the classic seven!
1591396190|5.0|INSEAD Professors Kim and Mauborgne have written extensively about Blue Ocean Strategy / Value Innovation over the past few years in the Harvard Business Review, Wall Street Journal and other publications. With \\"Blue Ocean Strategy,\\" they put their work into book form for the first time, and with very impressive results.<br /><br />In an era of globalization, rapid technological development and the commoditization of products, companies and countries need to find new ways to compete. In direct contrast to what most business school strategy professors teach, Kim and Mauborgne show that businesses cannot remain profitable through traditional \\"military-style\\" or \\"Red Ocean\\" strategy, working within existing markets to undercut competitors' prices or exploit ever-shrinking niches. Rather, they need to develop new markets, creating their own \\"Blue Oceans.\\" Kim and Mauborgne provide examples of Blue Ocean successes (Southwest Airlines, Cirque de Soleil, Yellow Tail) and a methodology companies can use to develop \\"Blue Oceans.\\"<br /><br />What I find most interesting is that profit-generating innovation tends to come not through technological development but through the development of new markets (Starbucks, Yellow-Tail and and Cirque de Soleil are not high-tech companies).<br /><br />A very thought-provoking and timely work that I highly recommend.
B0007P3582|5.0|Critics said it couldn't be done.  O its done and done with gansta sytle.  50 cent's first premire cd blew away all the rap competition and put his respect threw the roof with known masters of the art.  Founded by some of the best 50 cents mix of mellow beats and intense lyrics allows this rookie rap alstar confidence and composure superior to all.  Skipping from one track to the next this musical masterpeice just keeps getting better and better.  From one rap lover to another this cd is a must for a solid collection of strong rap music.

B0007Y4USW|5.0|Marey Carey's \\"THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI\\" is an excellent collection of songs.  Listening to this record, you are reminded why you liked Mariah in the first place: that voice.  Truly one of the best tones and ranges in pop music, Mariah can sing low and high without any problems in between.  The lyrics of most of these songs contain wishes of love to return and going to the club, having a good time.  There are a few \\"filler\\" songs on this record.  I'm not a big fan of the song with Snoop Dogg.  I thought the song on \\"Rainbow\\" was better, even though the lyrics on the previous song were a little jagged.  However, she more than makes up for these songs with \\"Mine Again,\\" \\"Circles,\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird.\\"  Definitely, if you are a fan of music, pick up Ms. Carey's.  She's back......and is sounding better than ever.
B0000AYJXR|1.0|I really am not a sports buff so this movie isin't for me allthough I do enjoy cartoons with sports as a theme. But for all of you folks who enjoy basketball or any other sport for that matter I'm not stoping you from watching this movie so go ahead and have a good time!    I am also not happy about the special featueres on the 2 disc special edition DVD. In 'Invasion of the Bunny Snatchers' all the scenes with Yosemiti Sam are editied out and I wonder why. Are all youngsteres going to copy a pint sized cowboy shooting guns and smoking ETC? Also there is the special 'Bugs VS Daffy Battle of the music video stars' Where the music and the sounds are so high that one can hardly hear what Bugs or Daffy were saying.
B000001FS3|5.0|This band isn't overrated, it isn't boring, and so what if its mainstream. It seemes that having a good rock cd means you have to be extremely alternative or today's standards, have a bunch of screaming wannabe- anarchist. A lot of Rock people don't like this album because like their other albums they sing with meaning, which new music seems to lack.  <br />     If you listen to this cd you will know that there are other songs besides the first three tracks (yet the first three are the best). There is Bullet The Blue Sky which is a cool, loud but medium-paced song. It talks about America, but it is kind of hard to tell if they're hazing us, praisin g us, or both. I like the part where Bono starts talking about a guy slapping twenty dollar bills down. <br />     In God's Country is also a very good song.Not as flashy as the first, phenominal tracks, it is worth listening.Also, One Tree Hill is yet another good song. These songs play like poetry  because Bono's Lyrics writing was at its best here.A reason for U2's success during the 80's was that they were skilled at making such inspirational lyrics. <br />     The Mothers of The Dissapeared is a great ending song with an obvious political message. <br />     [The First Three tracks- Where The Streets Have No Name, I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, and With or Without You were not mentioned earlier because Iwant people to know there are more songs]WTSHNN is a wonderful opening track with a symphony backing U2 up. The other two songs are love songs (no, not  extremely slow acostic guitar songs). <br />     If you have an open-mind buy this cd. If you like punk rock don't bother. If you like Jimi, maybe, U2 used him playing the star spangled banner in Rattle and Hum. He is also another one of my favorite.If you think U2's quality is that of Britney Spears, then that's just weird.
0316168815|2.0|This book was probably a catharsis for the author to write but it wasn't a story that worked for me.  I bought it because of the media hype and actually did find it to be very well written.  The topic of death and what the victim was thinking and observing while in heaven sounded very interesting.  However, as I was reading the story, the sadness was so overwhelming it was hard to shake.  I simply hurt too much.  It wasn't until literally the last handful of pages that any resolution was achieved.  Sorry to be one of the rare nay-sayers for this book, but I won't be recommending it.
B000002P5W|5.0|This album is an absolute classic. Although it has a different tone from the \\"are you experienced\\" album, it is just as good, if not better. The whole album is very listenable, a short and sweet 38 min. (i think).The album is packed with heck load of good songs. Everyone will love (heh, heh, Axis:Bold As LOVE) the song 'Castles Made of Sand\\", a very emotional poem-like song about how life is like. It talks about a cheating man, an indian who's dreams of being an indian chief were crushed, and a depressed handicap person whose meaning of life was restored when she saw a \\"golden wing ship pass her way\\" from a cliff.People will also like the rockin' songs like \\"you Got Me Floatin' (very catchy- love Jimi's singing in this one) and \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\". The classic \\"if 6 was 9\\" is here and contains the famous Jimi quote \\"i'm gonna wave my freak flag high.\\" The intro is a wierd sci-fi thing that makes you go \\"huh?\\" but by the end \\"Bold As Love\\", it will have blown you away.It is just evil to skip songs on your first listen of this cd.Also reccomend: Are You Experienced?

0140177396|3.0|Of Mice and Men is a very compelling story that illustrates the bond between two individuals.  The story starts with George and Lenny working on a farm in a town called 'weed'.  George is a very intelligent man and Lenny is a mentally challenged giant.  One day while at work, Lenny sees a woman with a red dress on and goes up to talk to her.  He gets into trouble when he goes up to her because he does something he should not but does not realize that he is doing anything wrong.  He and George then have to run to another farm because they do not want to get caught for what Lenny has done.  They need to keep working because their ultimate goal is to own a ranch of their own where Lenny can raise rabbits and they can both live off the 'fatta the lan.'  They get to the next ranch the next day and meet the people around there.  There is a very nice man, 'Slim', and poor black man and old man, and the worst character of the book, a mean, cocky man, Curley.  They work at the farm for a few weeks until Lenny gets in trouble again with an incident similar to the first.  The story ends shortly after this and is ended in a very well way.  This book is one of the greatest books I have read, not to mention it only being 107 pages long.  Steinbeck is a great author and has produced many great books including 'The Grapes of Wrath,' another great novel of his.  I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who is looking to be able to read a story in just a short couple of hours.  This is the shortest book that I've ever read but also the most touching and realistic book that I've read.
B0001AP12G|5.0|There are very few producers who make a mark as a rapper in the game but Kanye is an exception the man is pure genius.  Songs like \\"Jesus Walks\\" and \\"Through the Wire\\" leave you feeling like there's no-one better.  This album will definately go down in history as one of the best EVER!!
B0007GAERG|2.0|I listened to all the hype about this album and, against my first instinct after seeing her interview on Oprah, bought it this morning anyway.  It was such a disappointment.  I miss the Mariah of \\"Someday\\", \\"Vision\\", \\"Can't Let Go\\", \\"I Don't Wanna Cry\\", \\"Can't Live\\"...  I know that's all so 90's.  But that was when she was really good and really special.  Now, she sounds like everyone else doing her style of music on the Top 40.  That is not the Mariah Carey that I used to like.  I'm not sure why artists try that whole reinvention thing.  They disappear for awhile and come back reinvented.  And their music is never as good.  Her vocal quality is still as good.  But the composition of the songs was completely unappealing to me.  I'm selling it used to recupe some of my money.  What a bummer!

0670033375|5.0|First, the book does a great job of presenting the \\"big picture\\" of the environment. We all know trees are good, but why? Deforestation  plays a recurring theme in the demise of civilizations, and through example and theory, Diamond presents both regional and global challenges posed by different environmental concerns.<br /><br />Second, the book is very readable and entertaining. His analysis of different societies, and their ability (or lack thereof) to respond to environmental issues is striking.<br /><br />Finally, Diamond is very persuasive. If reading this book doesn't make you end up moving a few steps \\"to the left\\", you either didn't read it carefully, or you are already knowledgable in all environmental concerns.<br /><br />In all, this was the most important non-fiction book I have read in the last year.
0201721481|5.0|It's too bad that Amazon has listed reviews here which apply to earlier editions of the book.  This 4th edition is a very different book than the 3rd or previous editions.  (Any review you see here prior to February 2005, when this edition was printed, doesn't apply to this book.)  The front cover of this book says that more than 450,000 programmers have learned C++ from previous editions.  I wasn't one of them, though I bought and started to read 2 previous editions in the attempt to be.  I already new C very well and the approach taken in those editions bogged me down in too much detail that I already knew.<br /><br />This 4th edition is a tremendous improvement over the others.  The material has been completely reorganized and updated and is much more effectively presented.  The text is sprinkled with highlighted tips, notes, warnings, and best practices that not only helpful in learning the material but in applying it well.  Each chapter is summarized at the end and has a glossary of  important terms and concepts.  Exercises at the end of each section make this book a good candidate for classroom use as well as individual study.  They even knocked 300 pages off the length of the 3rd edition!<br /><br />If you want to learn C++ thoroughly and well using just one book, this is the book to buy.
B00006IR5S|5.0|Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is an awesome soundtrack. The orchestra is conducted wonderfully by William Ross, and the notes written by John Williams are rich and haunting.  <br />The new themes in this soundtrack are stunning.

0385484518|5.0|One of the reasons that this book is so widely read is that it confronts our fear of suffering and dying with wit and a good dash of boldness.<br />In Western society today we hide from the reality of dying. Hardly anyone dies at home lovingly surrounded by family. We use technology to wage a battle against death.We are scared of illness,pain and eventual oblivion.<br />Mitch Albom had got so caught up in the frenzy of modern life that he hardly stopped to cherish the moment.Sometimes when we are in this fast paced zone something happens to jog us back to the the essentials of life--living each moment fully and with joy. So Mitch sees a story on the news about his old teacher. Suddenly the memories return. This was a man who had shaped his thinking,his view of life. He was a beloved teacher--one whom he had faithfully promised to keep in touch with.<br />So began the series of visits lovingly chronicled as Tuesdays with Morrie. Mitch tried to share Tuesdays with his old teacher and take one final course with him.We are introduced to Morrie's personal aphorisms--these profoundly felt, succinct comments--form the centerpiece of this engaging and touching book.<br />Morrie,suffering from ALS virtually disintegrates physically during the course of the book.In agonizing detail, we learn how the human body becomes a flabby mass of flesh through this wasting disease.Morrie rises above the physical with his unwavering love of life and friends.<br />Morrie leaves life with grace,love and a sense of humor.Right to the end we sense his enormous charisma. He was a dynamic teacher even in death.Through Mitch he lets us know that the human spirit trumps even the most undignified of diseases.<br />I too am a retired teacher and I treasured the time spent in inspiring the young. Old teachers fade way and become dim memories in the minds of their students. Morrie had the gift of reaching across time and sending a message to a beloved student to come for one last class on finding joy and purpose in life.<br />My friend and author of 'Wisdom from the Heart' Radha Singh has written also about living from the heart and dying with a sense of fullfillment.We both value this book for its uplifting message.<br />Every book that celebrates the joy of living beyond fear and about overcoming physical challenges makes humankind richer in spirit.My friend and author of 'Wisdom from the Heart' Radha Singh has written also about living from the heart and dying with a sense of fullfillment.We both value this book for its uplifting message.

B00005V1WO|3.0|The only reason I would not give this movie more stars is because it is somewhat low budget and has alot of gross out situations thrown in  for no real reason.I saw this movie  for the first time only a few years ago,I remmeber when it came out and I heard from people who saw it back in th 80,s that they were realy turned off by it and that it was a gross nasty shocking movie.I must say I never took the time to see it until I happened to come across Another film about the same thing HAUNTED SUMMER.I liked that little movie and became very interested in this situation about the Byrons and the shelleys getting together for Ghost story telling so I wanted more.I found GOTHIC On VHS finaly in a video store ,I was actualy dissapointed by GOTHIC at first because I had expected something realy much more shocking because by 21's century standards it is not so shocking now.However it is a fun film to whatch .I prefer haunted house stories and psycological horror to alot of the computer generated crap made now that isnt scary anyway.As this film says imagination is what creates the best monsters and ghosts.The historical background of this account helps make it more interesting ,it is simply a speculation loosly based on what may or may not have happened that summer in Villa Diodati, Switzerland. I believe that the actors are good except for the fact that the real Historical figures may have been slightly younger than this crew ,Gabrielle burn as Byron is so horribly out of shape and flabby he  would have been a total turn off to the ladies and the Historical Byron was always very cadaverously thin,the best mistake though is the actress who plays Mary Shelley is Kind of Hot  as the realy Mary was very plain looking atleast in her portraits.This is a fun film to whatch just to kick back with or it could make a nice backdrop when looking for your own inspiration if your into Horror writing or any creative venture[I dont however recommend most of the pethetic decadent behavior depicted by the characters in the GOTHIC of course]Contrast this film with EMMA with Gwyneth Paltrow set about the same time period.epicted by the characters in the GOTHIC of course]Contrast this film with EMMA with Gwyneth Paltrow set about the same time period.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|Never listened to Roxy Music, but from my frame of reference this sounds like Bowie meets Lou Reed in a not real interesting kind of way.  Decent production values and musicianship but kind of watered down and not really my kinda thing...   <br /> <br />I have no idea why they are recommending this based on my high ratings of Dinosaur Jr., Pixies, Fugazi, and Archers of Loaf albums...  Seems like this will produce alot of unhappy buyers.
0385510454|2.0|The Broker, while not terrible, is far from Grisham's best work.  What starts with an interesting premise (man on the run dropped in a totally new environment) devolves into an impromptu Italian language and geography lesson.  Too much time is spent describing the Italian culture and surroundings.  The (charitably-called) literary device of typing out an Italian phrase followed by its English translation becomes grating extremely quickly.  In this case, the plot suffers at the expense of the setting.  Characters are introduced, given elaborate back-stories, and then discarded (some without ever speaking).   Loose ends that are presumably meant to make us curious are disclosed at the end with no real timing or fanfare.  The ending just seems to happen: no building tension or real difficulty befalls the protagonist.  It turns from a whodunit to a whocares.  While a decent beach read, The Broker is not an example of what Grisham can do as much as what he can get away with.

B0007GAERG|5.0|IT'S LIKE THAT - This is the first single that was released off the album. It's a mid-tempo song that celebrates the return of Mariah. \\"Cause it's my night / No Stress no fights / I'm leaving it all behind / no tears no time to cry / just making the most of life.\\" After listen to the CD, you definitely get the sense that it is Mariah's time to shine once again.  <br /> <br />WE BELONG TOGETHER - This is Mariah's second single and it's really the champion of the entire CD. This is the type of song that Mariah's was known best for throughout the 90's. It's a signature ballad done in her enviable middle register. This will surely go down as one of her best songs ever. The chorus really grabs you on this song. \\" When you left I lost a part of me / It's still so hard to believe / Come back baby please cause / We belong together / Who else am I gonna lean on / When times get rough / Who's gonna talk to me on the phone / till the sun comes up / Who's gonna take your place / There ain't nobody better / Oh baby baby / We belong together.\\" <br /> <br />SHAKE IT OFF - This is one of the songs on the album that really has grown on me. It's good, but it's different that the others on the rest of the CD. It's a slightly different style for Mariah. But it's been rumored as the third single. It reminds me a little of Usher. I love the line \\"I gotta shake you off / Just like a Calgon commercial.\\" <br /> <br />MINE AGAIN - Loyal Mariah followers will surely sink their teeth into this song. Mariah really shows off her range on this ballad. You'll understand why her name gets mentioned alongside Whitney Houston after hearing this song. It's another sharp song for her. For all those complaining that she'll never recapture the glory of the 90's, this song might change your mind. \\"Maybe you could be mine again / Maybe we could make that dream for real / Like way back when / When love was yours and mine / Maybe we could bring it back to life.\\"  <br /> <br />SAY SOMETHIN' - This song has also been rumored as the third single. It's a collaboration with Snoop Dogg. It's kind of jazzy in feel and tone. I wasn't immediately drawn to this one at fist, but I've warmed up to it the more I've heard it in connection with the others. There's a certain laid back and calmness about it. It's very soothing. <br /> <br />STAY THE NIGHT - One of the best cuts on the CD produced by the extremely talented Kanye West. And West proves again that he's not just limited to Hip-Hop. Given a great voice, he really shines. This song is done mostly in Mariah's upper register which another impressive element. It's a fun song. <br /> <br />GET YOUR NUMBER - This is a track that features one of her most frequent collaborators, Jermaine Dupri. No matter what song they do together, it always seems like they're having a great time and this song is no exception to the rule.  <br /> <br />ONE AND ONLY - This is a collaboration with Twista. I love his rap verses on this track. He really adds to this song. I think everyone can relate to this song on some level. Isn't everyone looking for that one special person that they can call their one and only. <br /> <br />CIRCLES - \\"Oh boy my world has changed / And I don't think I can make it without you / Nothing's the same / You got me running around / In circles over you / (Running around in circles over you). This is another very relatable track. Whether is a crush or deep true love, I think everyone experiences this at some point. It's the point where your mind is just so completely wrapped around a particular person that you can't see anything else. <br /> <br />YOUR GIRL - I wish this song was a whole lot longer. I think it probably had the potential of being a better song because the music is good. It just leaves you wanting a little more.  <br /> <br />I WISH YOU KNEW - Another standout. Classic Mariah ballad vocals. This is one of my favorites. This song is about wishing you could express your true feelings for someone, but being unableto. \\"And How I wish you only knew / What I feel inside for you / You probably haven't got a clue / But I wish you knew / How I love you baby.\\" Her voice is beautiful on this. <br /> <br />TO THE FLOOR - A collaboration with Nelly. The one thing that stands out to me on this song is how well Mariah's voice and Nelly's voice actually blend together. Nelly is doing more singing and it's actually works well here.  <br /> <br />JOY RIDE - The ballads kind of take an interesting journey throughout this album, going from the angst of \\"We Belong Together\\" to the love redemption of this song. There is a complete arc because this song is about how great love can be once you find it. \\"And our love goes round and round / Way up high, A Joy Ride / We can touch the stars above / We found love / And our love is heaven sent / From the day we first met / We've got something they can't touch / We found love.\\" <br /> <br />FLY LIKE A BIRD - This is the stunning and moving Gospel closer that people will be talking about. Lyrically, this might be the best song. Asking the Lord to carry you higher certainly can't hurt you. This song will really set your mind free. A great tribute to the God that has blessed her with so much talent.  <br />

Save your money and have the  <br />confidence to work things out for yourself. <br />
B00000I924|5.0|With \\"Who Else\\", Jeff Beck demonstrates what techno is missing: his guitar playing. Beck is one of music's most innovative, creative, aggressive, incisive, and melodic guitarists.  On this CD, Beck's innovative guitar work meshes with various techno beats and effects.  On \\"What Mama Said\\", \\"Psycho Sam\\", \\"Space For The Poppa\\", and \\"Declan\\", Beck plays with enough heat to vaporize all shredders and Nu-Metalers. Jeff Beck has demonstrated throughout his career that there is nothing that he won't try to play, and almost nothing that he can't play well.
B0007WZUMO|5.0|I have been a long time NIN DIE HARD fan.  I own all of Trent's CD's and believe me, they got me through some tough times growing up. <br /> <br />I noticed today that Trent allows people to listen to the entire CD on nin.com- even before the CD is offically launched, which is a big risk for any artist to do.  He took a risk and without a doubt, it's going to pay off big time. <br /> <br />I'm not sure what I was expecting when I first listened to all of the tracks.  I listened to them all first expecting something totally different.  My first reaction was not the greatest.  I did feel a little let down.  I listened again this time with an open mind, not allowing his other songs/ CD's come into my mind. <br /> <br />The second time around was incredible.  The third time was powerful.  The fourth time, which is playing right now as I write this is mind-blowing.   <br /> <br />The best way I can describe With_Teeth is thinking of it like sex.  The first time leaves you wondering what the big deal is all about.  The second time gets a little better and by the third, fourth and beyond, you can't get enough.... You're at it all day long! <br /> <br />With_Teeth will give all NIN fans an orgazmic ride- if they are willing to give it a shot with an open mind.  Don't expect anything and it will provide you with everything that you have been waiting for. <br /> <br />NIN will be launching another CD soon.  (which Trent has told fans that a new CD is in the works and \\"...will be released in a timely fashion\\", Trent states on his site.)  I have a feeling that the next CD will be \\"THE ONE\\" that we have all been waiting for.  With_Teeth is just a taste....   <br /> <br />I can't wait for the concert next month!!!!
0156027321|5.0|First, I've read a few reviews that did not like this book, but I haven't read one negative review yet that seems to have understood it. Several people have commented that the early religious part of the book was better than the later part, and others complained that the religious part was not connected to the rest. They completely misunderstood the book. The entire work is a whole, not a series of stories.<br /><br />This book is one of the most intricately and cleverly constructed books I've read since The Great Gatsby, and in some ways is more intricate. With Gatsby, the intricacy was in the plot and the characters, with Pi the intricacy goes into the metaphor the book creates. It IS a book which proves the existence of God, even though the proof is as \\"ontological\\" as that of Anselm of Bec, and even if one considers the God it proves to be a metaphorical God.<br /><br />The entire book is a clever tale of an intriguing, innocent boy on a spiritual journey. That journey is interupted by a tragic shipwreck and a horrifying ordeal of survival. Pi, a kind-hearted vegetarian, is forced to live off the animals of the sea, while sharing his small raft with a viscious tiger whom he has to please, until he eventually  is saved (Not a spoiler--you know this from the beginning of the book).<br /><br />The tale itself is intriguing and excitingly told, but there are jarring moments that defy reality. The only reason these jarring moments work is because Jann Martel creates a writer's trust in the early stages of the book-- a trust built on his impeccable dexterity with language. A careful reader will even catch the hints throughout the book which justify these moments.<br /><br />By the end of the tale, all fits perfectly into a whole that is not only a meaningful spiritual journey (even for an atheist like myself) and an ordeal of survival, but also a metaphor--perhaps one could call it an allegory-- for... Well, read it, and decide for yourself.<br /><br />I, too, read the book as a straightforward story until I reached the end, and a whole new story opened up. I reread the book, searching for clues, trying to understand what Martel was saying. I could reread it several more times and learn more each time, I have no doubt. The book haunted me for months as I worked on the subtleties, on the metaphors, and each time I grasped one point, another seemed to be lying just beyond, slippery but waiting for the attempt to grab it, too.<br /><br />I'm not claiming this is a book to change your life or alter your spiritual views, but it is a book that--if you understand it--will tickle those spiritual views, even if you aren't aware you have any. Ignore anyone who tells you this is a shallow book, or a simple book--they missed it. And if you aren't in the mood to be challenged, you may as well skip it, as well, until you are in the mood. This is not a simple book, and it is more than a story about a boy and a tiger in a lifeboat.

B00079HZUM|4.0|I have always been a sucker for period costume dramas, and while \\"Stage Beauty\\" is not \\"Shakespeare In Love,\\" it's not too shabby either. Billy Crudup's performance is absolutely fantabulous!! He plays Edward \\"Ned\\" Knyaston, the renowned and beautiful 17th century English actor, trained to portray dramas' leading ladies.' Of course, the film is flawed, frequently overblown, much too busy, and often, not credible - but Crudup's acting, is really worth the price of the rental - along with the gorgeous wardrobe, a few outstanding comic moments, and the Method acting lesson near the film's conclusion.<br /><br />During the Restoration, King Charles II actually made headlines when he broke with history and declared it legal for women to play female characters onstage. But, what then happened to all the talented, professional actors who had heretofore dedicated themselves to playing heroines? Such a one is Ned Knyaston, he of the face that could launch a thousand ships. And thus, our plot. Ned's dresser, Maria, (Clare Danes), clearly worships the actor and fancies herself an actress. She also fancies herself in love. And, when she is given a shot at acting, she gets Desdemona down pat - as a male trained to play a female would play the part. In other words, she mimics Ned perfectly. Her \\"in love\\" fantasy is a problem too. Ned prefers men.<br /><br />The film is at its best when Knyaston, after his denouement, is left alone to face his own arrogance, and confront the loss of his career, which has been his life and his identity. As a young boy, he was taken off the streets, trained to act and to supress everything male in order to portray a female. Unfortunately, we, the audience, are led to believe that even though his sexual identity, and preference, are firmly established as homosexual, ultimately that's all up for grabs. My principal issue with the movie is that it leads one to believe that homosexuality is a \\"problem\\" which can be solved, or cured, by a beautiful leading lady. Not. Nor is one's sexuality a decision most have control over. Crudup does lend credibility and complexity to his part, however. He can be flirtatiously feminine and naughty, and extremely masculine. I just wish they had tabled the love story, which is not necessary to the plot, and I think cheapens it.<br /><br />Clare Danes who plays an actress who cannot act, works well with what she has been given, script-wise. She is extremely talented but there is little chemistry, of the romantic kind, between her and Crudup.  And this is clearly Crudup's movie. Ben Chaplin is excellent as the fickle Duke of Buckingham, filled with the ennui of the rich and famous. On the other hand, I so did not like the buffoonish depiction of King Charles II, (Rupert Everett). Historically, the portrayal of the king is off, off, off!!! He was neither deranged nor a flake, and while he had many famous mistresses, he was not one to be led around by whimsical women. Charles II was, actually, quite royal and  a popular monarch, although wig-bedecked, as befitted the period's fashion. And the King's Nell Gwynn was an acclaimed actress long before she met the merry monarch. I also doubt she spoke with a Cockney accent. Hugh Bonneville is wonderful as Samuel Pepys, another historical figure, who documented the goings-on of the times. The lecherous Sir Charles Sedley, (Richard Griffiths), is as grotesque as anything I have ever seen on screen, including the creatures who people \\"The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy.\\"<br /><br />If you can relax and focus on the good performances, local and period color, and ignore what jars, if anything - this is a movie to see and enjoy. I certainly did. Otherwise, see \\"Shakespeare In Love Again,\\" although I warn you, Billy Crudup is not to be missed!<br /><br />JANAleading lady. Not.

0553212621|5.0|Constance Chatterley, a beautiful and passionate woman, is deeply unhappy in her marriage to Sir Clifford Chatterley who became an invalid after having been injured in the First World War. His physical condition is mirrored in Constance's emotional paralysis. When she meets the gamekeeper Mellors, she finds refuge in his arms and feels regenerated. Together they shield themselves from the chaos of the outer world and move to the sanctum of the inner world of fulfilment. <br />The character of Constance is an interesting one because there is a certain complexity in her: she is both in touch with nature, yet educated; sensitive, yet wise; female in her sensitivity, yet almost male in her strength and attitude. She is a woman with a social position who is drawn to an outsider of a lower class. The structure of the novel is also interesting because it shows three stages in Constance's relationship with her husband and Mellors. In the first phase, she denies her husband, responding to a failed marriage, she finds refuge with Mellors. Then begins the second stage when Constance regenerates in the peaceful world of her lover's hut. Finally in the third stage, she escapes the world of Wragby Hall as she leaves for a holiday to Venice. There she takes the resolution never to return to Clifford's world. This resolution is taken all the more easily by Constance because being away from Wragby Hall she can reconsider her commitment to Mellors while their relationship is gradually exposed as a scandal which really prevents her from returning to her husband. Then the novel's central struggle shifts from that between a Lady and a gamekeeper to that between Constance's and Mellor's commitment to each other and the forces hostile to their relationship. <br />Constance's transformations occur in an set of tensions and an artistic dualism: tenderness against apathy, nature against culture, wood against stone, flesh against intellect, frankness against manipulation or fertility againststerility. These tensions strongly mark the first phase of the novel where Wragby Hall symbolises sterility and spiritual and emotional apathy, will and intellectual control; the hut symbolises the free play of the instinct and sensual pleasure, the haven of tenderness. The two worlds cannot interact: Clifford intrudes into nature with his mechanical wheelchair as much as Mellors is an intruder and outsider inside Wragby Hall. Perhaps the most striking opposition is that between silence and talk. As Constance and Mellors retreat into the sheltered world of the hut, the author insists on the stillness and the silence of the place, focuses on the internal and emotional feelings since both characters are fugitives from \\"the outer world of chaos.\\" That's why enclosures are so present in the novel: the hut, the clearing, the cottage, an enclosed yard, a bedroom, as many shelters from psychological suffering. Mellors is \\"afraid of society\\" whereas Constance recoils from the \\"insanity of the whole civilised species.\\" They both linger in pure silence, even anonymity since they hardly ever call each other by name. <br />D.H. Lawrence's critics have deplored the numerous love making scenes in which Constance and Mellors induldge and which are described in a surprisingly open language, considering the epoch in which the novel was published. But these scenes show how Constance is \\"reborn\\", how sex is the act that most completely unites a man and a woman and its power of renewal is attuned to day, season or year - it is in this novel the most regenerative experience possible. There is indeed strong hope that John Thomas will be reunited with lady Jane in the future! In this sense, \\"Lady Chatterley's Lover\\" ranks among the 20th century most extraordinary achievements.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|I've never written a review before, but I felt the need after watching this movie.  I absolutely adored the first installation and found the whole Pride and Prejudice thing cute.  I was told that the second book, The Edge of Reason, was not as good, but still good for laughs.  Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was laugh-out-loud funny with wonderful characters.  I really felt the ties between Bridget and her friends, as well as Bridget and her parents.  I really enjoyed \\"seeing\\" into the whacky lives of her friends who were written quite well.  You really got a sense that they were individual people.  I also loved the whole Austen's Persuasion thing with Rebecca and Benwick.  Being a bit slow, I didn't catch on until the party with the accident, but when I got there I was delighted.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie cut all of this out.  The crazy story with her mom and the African dude..GONE.  Everything about her friends and their lives...GONE.  The whole Austen's Persuasion thing...GONE.  And Rebecca's scheming ways..GONE AND TRANSFORMED!  The Thai thing was there, but the sadness of it, the desparation of it, Bridget's time of reflection...GONE.  Its like the movie makers robbed the story of everything that made it \\"real\\".  All we were left with was a bit of fluff. Granted, Colin was looking yummy in the fluff, but still, it was just souless, meaningless fluff.  I was so disappointed.
B0006IIKS0|3.0|Some Kind of Monster is worth watching just for all the unintentional humor. Seeing these guys go through therapy with a guy who looks like Mr Rogers is absolutely ridiculous. The movie does drag on a bit, especially in that there really is no urgency to it, yet it's more than two hours long. These dudes are clearly uninspired and no longer capable of creating honest music, so while they are running around in some sort of crisis, I sat there saying \\"Who cares if they make this album or not?\\" But it's definitely interesting to see a bunch of aging metalheads try and make aggresive music between taking their daughters to ballet lessons. I just wish there was more Dave Mustaine in the movie. <br />Oh and Kirk is hysterical. The pink shirts, the wimpy voice, the balding... it's just too funny. He can still shred though, I'll give him that.
B00005JNQ8|3.0|Going into The Interpreter I was hoping for a truly great, well written, edgy, nail biting suspense thriller that kept my interest all the way to the end.  So MANY thrillers look great in the previews but then fall flat when you watch them.  I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed! <br /> <br />Kidman, I must say, was as sublime as always.  She does the mysterious, haunted, beautiful female thing soooo well.  In this role she plays a United Nations Interpreter who translates into an obscure African tribal dialect with which she is familiar because she grew up in the (fictional) country which speaks it.  Her performance is serious, gritty, and believable.   <br /> <br />Penn plays a role that is unlike anything he has done before.  He's a mess, and he does messy remarkably well!  He's the FBI agent tasked with determining if the threat which Kidman surfaced is legitimate while also trying to overcome the recent death of his wife.  It was refreshing to see Penn let his hair down, so to speak, and not be afraid to look ugly, old, and tired on camera.  His performance is worthy of a nomination, I think. <br /> <br />So why 3 stars, and not 4 or 5?  As gripping as this movie was, it still wasn't the timeless classic I was hoping for.  It's a FANTASTIC show with superb acting and great directing, but it didn't captivate me the way, say, The Fugitive or The Sixth Sense did.  It doesn't quit get under your skin and make you dream about it the night after watching it.  Does that make sense?  I give it an A.  Not an A+ <br /> <br />In a nut shell - watch it.  You'll be glad you did.  It's every bit the serious and grinding suspense thriller you're hoping for.
1400032717|4.0|I must say this is one of the strangest books I have ever read, yet it still had that 'can't put it down' quality about it. It's a novel written from the point of view of a 15 year old English boy named Christopher, who has high functioning autism. Basically he's a genius at maths and science who sees everything in a black and white kind of way and has poor social skills and a range of 'behavioural problems' which he himself categorizes. Haddon expertly manages to take us inside the head of this boy and lets us see the world and it's challenges through his eyes. Things which to us might seem simple or mundane, like catching a train, are a great challenge and adventure in the story. We also get to see a glimpse of the difficulties that parents with a child like this would have, and the stress it puts on their lives and relationship, but it is through the detached vision of Christopher that we see it.<br /><br />The writing style of this book is simple, in keeping with the autistic point of view from which it is told, and the narrative flows rapidly and builds suspense well. From the quirky but logical mind of Christipher we are presented with a range of drawings and pictures, lists, and mathematical problems which further add to the unusual nature of this book. It delves into a range of scientific, literary and historical anecdotes which also contribute to the character. The chapters are numbered in a prime sequence which is very fitting.<br /><br />This is a very easy book to read in just one sitting, like I did, or else the chapters are so short and well compartmentalised that you could easily read it on and off over a few days also. The problem with the latter approach is fighting the temptation to read \\"just one more\\" chapter. Anyway I strongly recommend this book to anyone who's interested in something a little bit different from the usual fare. This truly is a novel novel. Also it would be suited to anyone from about age 12 up so teachers might consider perhaps suggesting it to their students also.haps suggesting it to their students also.
B0007XT7V8|5.0|Wow, before there were even vocals on the first track I was hooked.    From then on it has been one of 2 cds that I play in my car.    Update:  In comparison to the first album, you will either love this, or hate what they have become.  I saw them live a year back and i reciently looked on their webpage, their look has changed.  Before they had a real southern rocker look, now they look like every other rock band.
0753506483|4.0|Richard Branson has long been one of my heroes - everything he does is so cool. Ever since we visited England in the late 90s I've admired him for having a hand in so many diverse, yet cool things. While there we went to Virgin Cinemas and drank Virgin Cola, and browsed the Virgin Music in the Virgin Megastore, and caught the Virgin trains. From then on I admired him as the ultimate male hero - a rich guy who was involved in music, planes, trains, movies, cola, cars, phones, hot air balloons and other cool stuff. Virgin has to be the world's most diverse brand.<br /><br />As for the book, it's an easy read and a great story. Lots of drama and intrigue from the swinging 60s right through the corporate 80s and 90s and beyond. I'm sure business types will get a lot of lessons from it about leadership and entrepreneurship, but for me it was just a great story about vision, taking risks, having fun, and maintaining your integrity in an often cut-throat world. Well worth a read if you haven't already.
B000002WUD|5.0|When I was born Elvis Presley was just another fresh high school graduate driving a truck.  So this whole \\"Elvis thing\\" passed me by.  I do remember liking \\"Return To Sender\\" as a child in the early 1960's and I liked his movies in a goofy sort of way.  But even watching his \\"comeback\\" special on NBC during its premiere broadcast in 1968, I still couldn't see what all the fuss was about.  As the 1970's progressed reactions to Elvis generally fell into two groups:  there were those who adored him and there were those who laughed at him.  Images of an increasingly corpulent and sweating Elvis provided living evidence to those who believed Elvis ceased to matter long ago.  As John Lennon remarked, as far as he was concerned Elvis died when he entered the army.<br /><br />Indeed, there is one school of thought that holds that the true mother lode of Elvis' greatness is to be found on his early Sun recordings.  Many hold to this stance so strongly that they view Elvis' signing to RCA as a commercial sellout that ruined his genius.  They do not deny that Elvis had several great singles; but on balance they see him as a cheap, used up failure after 1956.<br /><br />Needless to say, this is an extreme view that I believe is unfairly harsh.  (Playing by the same rules, one could just as easily say that John Lennon \\"died\\" when he left the Beatles.)  Still, with the advent of the British invasion in 1964 and the explosion of new musical directions, Elvis no longer set the tone of American music.  Instead, much of the tone was set for him.<br /><br />It is easy to think of several important singles Elvis released in the 1960's:  \\"Stuck On You\\", \\"It's Now Or Never\\", \\"Can't Help Falling In Love\\", \\"Viva Las Vegas\\", \\"Guitar Man\\", \\"U.S. Male\\" and my personal favorite \\"Suspicious Minds\\".  Yet with the single exception of \\"Burning Love\\", it is difficult to remember much of 1970's Elvis.  One is more inclined to think that by this time Elvis had been reduced to Vegas appearances and concert shows in modest markets.  Thus you are tempted to think a box set devoted to this period would be an exercise in over kill.  But time changes everything.<br /><br />It has been nearly thirty years since Presley's death and since that time a lot of dust has settled to where we can begin to get some perspective.  I will never meet Elvis.  I will never see him in concert.  It is unlikely I will ever meet anyone who knew him personally.  I am not interested in going to Memphis to visit Graceland.  I will not stand among the faithful on the anniversary of his death to pass by his grave.  But I have come to recognize what a breathtaking singer Elvis was.  Elvis has been a presence throughout my life and I have just realized in the past few years the truth that was right in front of me.<br /><br />And this is the delight of this box set.  Even in his last years (when he died he was only 42!), Elvis' voice was still rich and strong.  Contrary to popular perception, Elvis maintained an aggressive recording schedule throughout the 1970's up until the day of his death.  Twenty-seven singles and twenty albums (minus various re-issues and greatest hits packages) were released.<br /><br />As the liner notes makes clear, at this point Elvis had nothing to prove to anyone.  He could do what he wanted, go where he wanted and sing whatever song he cared to sing.  Thus the wide library of material found on these five discs.  At once blues, then country, rock, pop, and then gospel.  There is rarely a jarring note to jolt the listener away from the sense that Presley had succeeded in making all these different styles and songs his own.  Presley had the gift to make you believe that each song came from a real place in his soul.<br /><br />This gets to an interesting paradox about Elvis.  Elvis was not a \\"confessional\\" singer of the kind popular in the 1970's.  The songs of John Lennon or Joni Mitchell (just to name two) served as a kind of diary of their personal lives often timeschronicling the comings and goings of real identifiable lovers.  Parading the details of his personal life out on the open stage would have been unthinkable to Presley.  Yet at the same time, who can listen to \\"Suspicious Minds\\", \\"Kentucky Rain\\" and \\"You Gave Me A Mountain\\" and not sense that Elvis was really singing about his divorce from Priscilla and the loss of his only daughter, Lisa Marie.  Sure, the details may not match; but the emotion underneath does.<br /><br />Elvis sang and when he sang he gave a small glimce of himself to whoever cared to listen.  That he could unerringly somehow tap into that one place in his soul that it came out so beautiful will remain one of the mysteries for the ages.  All of the his singles and their B-sides are collected here along with a generous selection of album and concert cuts-plus a number of unreleased tracks.  As one who has been fairly immune to the \\"Elvis Cult\\" all his life, I have to say I was stunned at how much I enjoyed these CDs.<br /><br />Elvis was a complex man and one can only wonder what he really made of all the adulation that came his way.  It is tragic that there were no Betty Ford Centers for celebrities like Elvis in 1977.  If there had been, maybe he would still be with us today.  Unfortunately, it took the deaths of people of Elvis' magnitude for such centers to be established.  The shame and sordidness of Presley's passing also obscured his real accomplishments and made him the subject of bad jokes and tabloid fodder for years.  Perhaps it is only now his gift can be appreciated for what it was.<br /><br />As this box set proves, Presley's voice was a joy.lives often times chronicling the comings and goings of real identifiable lovers.

It is tragic that there were no Betty Ford Centers for celebrities like Elvis in 1977.  If there had been, maybe he would still be with us today.  Unfortunately, it took the deaths of people of Elvis' magnitude for such centers to be established.  The shame and sordidness of Presley's passing also obscured his real accomplishments and made him the subject of bad jokes and tabloid fodder for years.  Perhaps it is only now his gift can be appreciated for what it was. <br /> <br />As this box set proves, Presley's voice was a joy. <br />
B000641ZA4|5.0|esta es una maravillosa coleccin de videos de Genesis post-PGabriel, con sonido DTS e imgen impecable, trae una buena seleccin de la poca de Trick of a Tail con Hackett incluido. Deja ver que el grupo si bien se \\"comercializ\\" con la salida de Peter Gabriel, no por eso dejo de ser una muy buena banda, en los videos adems sobresale la capacidad histrinica de Collins, incluso hay uno muy bueno con Benny Hill. Va recomendado a todos los fans del progresivo. <br />
B00028HBKM|4.0|The Passion of the Christ is a film that caused tons of controversy before it was even released, but when it comes right down to it, it is just a good movie.  The Passion follows the last hours of Jesus' life from him being arrested to his trial all the way through his punishment and crucifixion.  Director Mel Gibson wanted to make a movie that realistically showed what Jesus went through in his final hours, and he definitely accomplished what he set out to do.  Passion is pretty accurate in telling the story of Jesus' crucifixion although not much background is given to the story.  Much of the controversy was caused by cries of anti-Semitism, which I disagree with, and the extreme levels of violence.  This is a very graphic movie from beginning to end.  What sets it apart from most movie violence is that it is all realistic.  The movie follows the Roman soldiers scourging Jesus as well as a horrific crucifixion scene.  All of these scenes are hard to watch, and I think that is what Gibson wanted to do when he made this movie.  His goal was to show what horrible things Jesus Christ went through in his last hours, and I don't think he could have made it any more believable. <br /> <br />  Judging the movie as a film is much easier than examining the controversy behind it.  This is a beautifully shot movie with incredible cinematography from Caleb Deschanel.  Passion brings you into ancient Jerusalem at the time of Jesus' life.  Equally as good is the score by composer John Debney.  Debney turns in an excellent middle eastern/arabic theme soundtrack that is perfect for the movie.  It is very moving, but it does not overpower the rest of the movie. <br /> <br />  James Caviezel is incredible as Jesus.  Unlike previous actors who have played Jesus, Caviezel actually looks somewhat like what Jesus would have looked like, or at least more so than Max van Sydow.  The whole movie is spoken in ancient Aramaic and Latin with Caviezel leading the way.  He gives an incredibleperformance.  Monica Belluci and Maia Morgenstern are excellent as Mary Magdalen and Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Some of the more notable supporting cast includes Hristo Jivkov as the apostle John, Mattia Sbragia as the high pries Caiphas, Francesco de Vito as the apostle Peter, Hristo Shopov as Pontius Pilate, Fabio Sartor as the Roman centurion Abenader, and Rosalinda Celentano as Satan.  The DVD offers a beautiful looking widescreen presentation, but no other extras.  I understand why Gibson chose not to put any extras on the DVD, but it would have been interesting to see a making of documentary or something along those lines.  For a powerful, moving, and sometimes hard to watch film about Jesus Christ's final hours, check out The Passion of the Christ.

B00005JNVS|5.0|I have been a fan of Stephen Chow for more than ten years and I have to give him props. If you think he is funny in this movie you'll be surprised at how much more hiliarious he usually is because this is considered one of his more dramatic roles! Fans should check out \\"God of cookery\\" which can easily translate to western audiences. \\"Royal Tramp\\" and the sequel are classics and my personal favorites although I would recommend those for adventurous viewers.     There absolutely is a plot to this movie for the reviewer that said there is not.    Spoiler ~     The conflict between Sing choosing the gang or helping the people. Finding out that when he was young he tried to be good and was humiliated which is why he so desperately wants to join the gang because he thinks that good people don't get anywhere.     An example of the heart in this movie is the scene where Sing finally sees the girl in front of the candy store and instead of the usual Hollywood, run into each others arms and make out scene, the camera pans around them in a circular motion and by the time the circle is complete they have reverted back into children and walk hand in hand into the store.     Props also to Yeun Wo Ping for the choreography, the acting is really good and the soundtrack is well put together. This movie has a very stylish look with vivid colors and surprisingly good CGI. The subtitles are also very well translated.    I am happy that Stephen Chow is finally getting the recognition that he deserves because he is truly a comedic genius. And now a great director, writer and producer as well.     Keep up the good work Stephen!
6300263673|5.0|I just saw this again for the umpteenth time, and it just gets better. I enjoy this film for the acting, but moreso for the music. This movie will hit all of your emotions, and you will laugh, cry or both. A classic, and must see! One of, if not the best film of 1987.
B00027LCRG|5.0|At first I was hesistant to to say that HOURS was his best work.  I was headstrong in thinking that Heathen was better.  But when I heard those songs on there man I was like WOW this guy is really amazing!  He's so deep and passionate about his words..The way I measured it was by how many good, consistent songs each album has.  As much I hated to admit it, Hours had it beat.  Songs like Thursday's Child,Changes, Dreamers, etc... just blows away any song on Heathen.
B00000HZH7|5.0|This album is one of the best death metal record's ever made, the guitars are like razor cutting into your ears, it's awesome, The Exorcist and Death Meatal are my favorites songs in this production, All Hail Possessed!
B000007VCM|5.0|The Cult's Love album was the soundtrack to my senior year in high school and my first year of college. Unlike alot of other albums that were important in my youth, I still find this one as relevant and enjoyable as I did in 1986.(Out of the over 600 cd's I own, I probably have played this one the most) Most people my age (37) know and love the albums bell cow, \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\", but Love offers so muxh more. <br />Love was the Cult's second full release. Dreamtime showed a glimpse as to the direction the Cult were heading with its spiritualistic, gothic, psychedelic, swampy soundscapes, but it never achieved the fullness of their second release. The mid 80's were full of teflon bands making disposable music that in the end left you less than filled up.And then you had the Cult, who were making music to LISTEN to. What a fresh approach in 1985-86. <br />The first song that turned me on to the Cult is the albums opener, \\"Nirvana\\". (I remember my best friends big brother had it cranked) A song that stands the test of time ( was still in their live set before their second split). Great lyrics that either reminded me of people I knew or lyrics that made me think. \\"I float through day and night life, well most of the time; till I hung up my blues on a nail in your wall\\" Classic Cult. \\"Big Neon Glitter\\" could have fit comfortably on Dreamtime. It opens with a chiming riff, 3 note bass line and a bass drum before going in to its psychedelic blues on growing city life. \\"sex on the hip at the crack of a whip, oh yeah\\" The third track, \\"Love\\", truly showed that the Cult were shaking off the goth-post punk label and headed into full on blues rock, with searing lead guitar lines from Duffy that punctuate verses throughout. The fourth track \\"Brother Wolf, Sister Moon\\" gains back the goth title that the Cult so successfuly shed on \\"Love\\". I find that this is many peoples least favorite track, but I dig it for its atmospheric sound and the passionate lyrics. A dirge type mumber with another impassioned vocal. \\"embrace the wind with both arms, stop the clouds dead in the sky, hang your head no more, and beg no more, brother wolf and sister moon, your time has come\\" The storm in the background add an epic feel to it. \\"Rain\\" is the other \\"hit\\" off of the album. A great rocking tune with a great atmosphere to it. Also for the first time, backing vocals from the other members that fit the track nicely. A dance club and fan favorite. <br />Side two opens with the wah wah scream and feedback that introduce \\"The Phoenix\\". This, up to that point in time was the heaviest Cult tune recorded with more great lyrics. \\"Hollow Man\\" is another Dreamtime era like number with a goth feel, that works well sandwiched between \\"Phoenix\\" and the 3rd side two track \\"Revolution\\". Released as a single, the down tempo song is perhaps the only cut on the album that I think sounds a little dated today. It is my least favorite cut on the album. \\"She Sells Sanctuary\\" is the next track and in my opinion is the best song recorded in the 80's. It is timeless and is a cross genre song that all types like, from metal heads to punks, goths and new wavers. It is just that good. The closer is the sister to the side one goth track, \\"Black Angel\\". A slow mumber with a heavy feel to it. A fitting close to a timeless album.
0316172324|4.0|I bought this book after seeing an interesting piece on CBS Sunday Morning. It is highly accessable read that delves into the nature of \\"first impressions\\" and \\"gut instincts\\". It leaves you with much to think about.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to admit, I watched from the beginning.  I started because I heard about it from a friend who watched Buffy.  Honestly, I loved it from the first five minutes.  And some have commented on the theme song.. I loved that too!  Never have I seen such an original, funny, interesting and compelling show on TV.  And now we have the movie to look forward to.. <br /> <br />Although you don't need to see the show to understand the movie, you should still buy the DVD set for the background and then go see Serenity on 9/30/05!  You will not regret it!
B0006399FS|4.0|Why the hell is this cd getting 3 stars. This cd to many i know is average or below average. I heartly disagree for the reasons below: <br /> <br />1. This cd is a cd that U2 wanted to make and it has many personal moments that many people dont understand or can't understand cause they haven't been there. Songs like Sometimes you can't make it on your own or All because of you <br /> <br />2. This is a much mellower cd than most of there past releases and isn't as much focused lyrically on poltics but more on the Joshua's Tree's level of finding yourself and spirtuality. Songs like Yahweh with there constant references to god like \\"This city should be shining on a hill.\\" and Miracle Drug's lyric of \\"Love has no sense of space and time.\\" <br /> <br />3. Lastly this cd has U2 going back to a sound that although we have heard before who cares its there sound they can do whatever they want with it and they put enough emotion into each song that to me it doesnt feel rehashed. <br /> <br />Now i reliaze im only giving this a 4 star rating and i would give it a 4.5 if i could. I guess im not giving it a 5 because iv'e grown tired of Vertigo and im not a super huge fan of When a man loves a Woman. I feel though that this cd should be given its rightful chance because i think in the next 10 years it will go down as a U2 underappericated masterpiece
B000805796|5.0|I think that if America does not wake up and take notice of this new release we truly are missing something special over here. This CD is well written, produced and performed,  I see others have gone into great detail describing this release so I will not repeat that here in my review.   <br /> <br />I am very pleased with this CD after only two plays through and expect it will become considered a classic in my personal collection after several more rotations in my CD player.   <br /> <br />If you are not familiar with Melanie's solo work since her Spice Girls days or have been in the past and not cared for it, give her another try, I think you'll be pleasantly surprised by how this CD will bring great beats and melodies to your ears...   <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|FIREFLY gets cancelled after 14 episodes, but CHARMED goes on and on and on...     <br /> <br />Justice?  Not so much. <br /> <br />A lot of people have been saying this is the best science fiction ever seen on TV... and I won't argue with that. <br /> <br />But to those of you who have been brought in by the high customer ratings, let me emphaize something: FIREFLY is one of the best dramas ever to make it to network TV.  One of the best humor/action-adventure shows.  And without doubt, it contains some of the finest, most intriguing, most heart-rending characters on video -- even by Joss Whedon (BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, ANGEL) standards. <br /> <br />It's almost impossible to oversell this series -- I've handed this to the most blase acquaintances, saying it's the best thing on TV in the last 5 years.  And after they've watched it, they either agree with me, or say \\"Nah... the best in 10 years.\\" <br /> <br />So there's room for argument. :-)
B0007GAERG|5.0|I strongly suggest this album to anyone who loves good r&b/ hip-hop songs. Mariah definitely outdid herself this time. I haven't stopped listening to her cd since I first got it. I definitely give it five stars. I would have given it more, but five it the highest. I hope she keeps giving us these dance hits and ballads.
B00030590I|5.0|\\"Hero\\" contains some of the most breathtaking sequences I have ever seen. I watched it because someone else had rented it and I figured \\"what have I got to lose?\\" What a suprise. And I'm being very serious when I say that I hate films about martial arts as a general rule. \\"Hero\\" has both action and story. It action sequences are awe-inspiring. I LOVED it from beginning to end.
B00001QEE7|5.0|This is no doubt a beautiful and classic disney film.   <br /> <br />My advice:  Wait for the 2-disc \\"Platinum Edition\\" to be released.  It will contain the extra bonus features that the \\"Limited Issue\\" lacks.  Also, if you wait you can probably find it for about 20 dollars, which is much better than buying it second hand right now for a ridiculous price.  You will get more for your money if you wait!  Also, you should know that Disney has decided to speed up their releases with the Platinum series (from 1 every year to 2 each year).  So, Little Mermaid will be out in October of 2006.  So, if you can wait a year and a half to get the better version, I would recommend it! Especially if you're into extras and bonus features (because the limited issue has NONE!) <br /> <br />So, if anyone is interested, Cinderella is the next Platinum DVD to come out in October of 2005, followed by Lady and the Tramp in March of 2006, and then (finally!) The Little Mermaid in October of 2006 <br /> <br />(For 2007, the March release will be The Jungle Book and then 101 Dalmations in October) <br /> <br />For more information... UltimateDisney.com is a great website! <br /> <br />I hope you found this advice helpful, as my wish is for everyone to be able to enjoy this gorgeous Disney film!
068987474X|5.0|I had seen this book in stores before and wasn't really interested. Then I saw Greg on Oprah and went out and bought it on the spot. Oh my gosh...why didn't I find this book years ago!? I would have saved so much time and energy. Some people say, \\"You know which guys are into you and which aren't.\\" And that may be true. But you won't admit it. We've all made excuses. Greg gives some tough love, but he makes it clear it's because he loves women and doesn't see why they would stay with guys who are just not interested. I really like when Liz writes \\"This is Why It's Hard\\" at the end of each chapter. The chapter on why men disappear was great, and Liz's response was great. This book is fantastic, I'm buying it for all my girlfriends and it is my bible. Seriously.
B0002IVN9W|2.0|Every year there seems to be some indie darling that makes the jump from unknown to media spotlight. Usually we can thank pitchforkmedia.com for their continual assault of creating madness and hype in a band that is nothing more then a regurgitated bore of some band that came 20 years before.  <br /> <br />Here we have the arcade fire, 2004's strangely quirky band with odd songs and crazy melodies. I am gonna be completely honest. I wanted to like this album. God knows it would have made my life much easier, since every one I know fawned all over it and this bands life show. But unfortunately, I don't and for that I have been ostracized by fat geeky kids with black horned rim glasses, wearing small vintage t-shirts, and a messenger bag. <br /> <br />The album is diverse, its not cookie cutter and it has uniqueness that you wont find in a lot of other bands. But will you enjoy listening to the record, only if you are an XXY male or have down syndrome, since the members have these physical attributes.
B000002JAX|4.0|her voice is just like billie holiday. It's scary. This is a unique album.
B0002858YS|2.0|Do you like listening to music that was made in the 80s. Do you want to be uber hip, have a trendy hair cut, and impress all your friends with your nostalgic love of an early simpler time. Do you feel that you some how missed out by never being able to see Duran Duran during their hayday. Are you 15 and need that special record to really please the girl of your dreams.     Then look no further then this overhyped, no talent 80s revival rip off artist, the killers. Knowing that some dork Mormon( Brandon Flowers) from Vegas who loved Moz so much decided to make form a band based solely off of the fictional band from a New Order video is bad enough. Having to listen to this trite crap is worse.     (...)
B0007KTAU4|5.0|I am a fan of Vanessa Paradis. I was recommended to listen to Carla. I knew she was a model ( so what?) but wow I must admit this girl can sing and I love the arrangements of the songs. Beautiful!
B0008ISM40|5.0|First off let me start by saying fans, and just casual listeners alike will either like the album, or hate the album. I have heard so many reviews and it seems thats the way its going. Really positive feedback, loved it/great album, or Reznors career is done. Thats usually what i hear. But in my opinion he is right back where he left us off at. Not saying this album is the same as past or even The Fragile for that matter. But saying that this is fresh, but still NINish. This album is great. All 13 tracks are great, full of emotions. <br /> <br />1. All the Love In The World - Great Song, the beat is perfect, and can get enough of the lyrics. <br />2. You Know What You Are - Very, fast paced song. When i heard the beginning I thought it sounded like March of The Pigs. <br />3. The Collector - Good Song for album. Lyrics are shouted at times, mixes well with song. <br />4. That Hand That Feeds - The 1st single of WT, people either love it or hate it, took me maybe 2 or 3 times, than i was hooked. <br />5. Love is Not Enough - Great Song, starts off little slow, than picks up at the Chorus. <br />6. Everyday is Exactly the Same - One of the best on the album. Amazing lyrics, just a great song.  <br />7. With Teeth - This is definatly a different song by NIN. Good for WT tho', goes with the total mood of the album. <br />8. Only - This is also a great song. Its different, talking the lyrics, the lyrics are great. Kind of hippy song, almost a foot tapper. The great line after, the chorus 'Yes I did' is classic. <br />9. Getting Smaller - Good Song, more heavy, than anything. Another good lyrical song. <br />10. Sunspots - Another best on the album. Beat is upety, like reviewer \\"D. R. Jeanclerc\\" this is kind of reminding of 'The Only Time' off PHM. <br />11. The Line Begins to Blur - Another classic off WT. Great lyrics. Music in background of chorus is haunting. <br />12. Beside You In Time - It kills me when i hear people say this song is repetitive. Thats the point, its a very, very good part of the song. Great. <br />13. Right Where It Belongs - Classic Track. Haunting lyrics. Makes you think.  <br /> <br />Overall very well worth buying the album. Don't listen to the people that come on hear and give it one star, when in reality all they heard was The Hand that Feeds, and dont like it, and cant realize, that people get older, their mind changes, along with the art. Trent Reznor is not dead, nor is NIN, the music listeners seem to be though.
B000050488|5.0|Based on these 18 songs, Blur isn't just the best pop band of the '90s, with greater range and depth than their peers, they rank among the best pop bands of all time. Hit singles including &quot;On Your Own&quot;, &quot;Beetlebum&quot;, &quot;M.O.R&quot; and the single in my opinion and most likely everyone's is one of the best &quot;Song 2&quot;. They go beyond there time. Overall this is a fantastic cd, and is a must have to anyone! I highly recommend it!
B0002S947K|5.0|I heard a 30 second clip of \\"Trouble\\" a few months ago, and I went out and bought the album directly. Ray LaMontagne has an amazing voice, full of an intense calm, that mixes beautifully with backround. He's someone I hope flourishes in years to come.
B000003TAL|5.0|Listening to Daydream Nation does something to you internally your not sure what it is but it does something to you that is beyond explanation. Each time you can hear something diffrent its like you listen to it for the first time evrey time.  The Sonic Youth unleashed a guitar frenzey by combining Velvets White Light White Heat  with the simplicity of the Ramones 3 chord wonders.  The Trilogy is an album within itself just stunning form part A-Z you just get blown away by Thurston and Lee's guitars.  Teenage Riot maybey one of the greatest songs in Rock history it captures evreything Rock music is about The End of 'Cross the Breeze is mesmerising with the infectious riff.  This is tied with V.U and Nico for the most influential album ever due to the experimentation with noise and tunings its beautiful.  If you truly love music you will buy Daydream Nation

B00005PJ8O|5.0|\\"Patton\\" is an epic saga of one of the greatest generals of all time, a total American, and an imperfect but nonetheless great man.  George C. Scott as General George S. Patton is one of the greatest and best casting decisions of all time.  Scott becomes the general, and the role will forever define Scott, just as Scott's portrayal of General Patton will forever define the General in the minds of most Americans.<br /><br />This is a wonderful movie about a flawed but great man.  Like many or most American generals, Patton waited the better part of his career for a terrible war to occur, which would call forth all of the years of training and preparation, but mostly waiting, that go into the career of a professional soldier who happens to serve a basically peace-loving country.  Patton believed that he was born to lead great armies in a desperate battle, and this he did.  The film's depiction of Patton when he took over the Vth Corps in North Africa shortly after it took a shellacking from Rommel at Kassarine Pass was absolutely masterful.  Patton took a despirited, green American army there, and shortly, in his words, turned them into \\"razors ... fanatics!\\"  The American Expeditionary Force in North Africa never lost another battle after the brush at Kassarine, and Patton was established in the American mind as a great war general.<br /><br />The infamous \\"slapping incident\\" was portrayed painfully but, in the end, according to most historians, accurately.  Patton here is shown to have exercised misjudgment, but even here the discerning viewer will see that this was a misguided attempt by the general to inspirit a flagging soldier.  Scott handled this particular scene perfectly, as indeed he did the entire three hour film.<br /><br />Perhaps my favorite part of the film is when Patton leads the Third Army's relief of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne.  The British and other allied forces were paralyzed--Patton, having anticipated the possibility of a surprise German winter attack, wheeled several divisions 90 degrees, disengaged from the front, and attacked the advancing Germans in force, which broke the back of the German spearhead and won the Battle of the Bulge for the Americans.  The scene in this film where Scott/Patton \\"orders\\" an Army Chaplain to \\"pray to the Almighty for good weather...I want a good weather prayer...\\" is one wonderful scene, juxtaposed against horrendous scenes of combat as the Americans, tired but battle-hardened, advanced.<br /><br />Patton's difficulties with the press are well done in this film, and one wonders, with today's media the way it is, whether a great general like Patton could survive in our politicized times.  Lord help us when the day comes, as it will, when America needs another Patton.<br /><br />Scott's portrayal of Patton is one of the greatest character roles ever, and this is a great war film and character study of a great American general.<br /><br />The musical score by Jerry Goldsmith is a classic, and is one of those scores that greatly adds to the viewing experience of the film.  The DVD is an excellent reproduction of the film, and the sound is recreated/remastered into pretty good Dolby 5.1, which sounded great on my home theater system, if not quite as awesome as some modern films.  This is a great film and the DVD is a great value.eral divisions 90 degrees, disengaged from the front, and attacked the advancing Germans in force, which broke the back of the German spearhead and won the Battle of the Bulge for the Americans.

B00000253N|5.0|in my opinion, dylan managed to create the 2 greatest albums ever recorded - the first being HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED [released in 1965] and the second being BLOOD ON THE TRACKS [released in 1974]. i'd say that most dylan fans would point you to one of these two albums if you asked them for his best [some, but not as many, would point you to BRINGING IT ALL BACK HOME or BLONDE ON BLONDE - which are both amazing albums]. i personally prefer HIGHWAY 61 REVISITED to BLOOD ON THE TRACKS, but i wouldn't say that it's necessarily better; i just like the style of writing and music more [usually].  <br /> <br />why then do i believe that this is dylan's 1a album and one of the 2 best albums ever created? that takes a track by track break down.  <br /> <br />'tangled up in blue' is arguably dylan's best song. it's certainly his greatest narrative. it's all at one time straight forward and swirling w/ complexities. the stripped production, which is apparent throughout the album, is completely fitting for the stories dylan tells - just like the revolutionary folk rock on HIGHWAY 61 was perfectly fitting for the surreal lyrics presented on that album. <br />'simple twist of fate' is probably dylan's second best narrative. the tempo slows here, and the listener starts to realize that dylan isn't goint to let him get out of this album w/out sharing some of dylan's pain. 'but i was born too late/ blame it on a simple twist of fate'.  <br />'you're a big girl now' has some of the most beautiful guitar playing you'll hear. having said that, the brilliant writing and the pain just continues:  <br /> <br />'Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence, <br />He's singin' his song for me at his own expense. <br />And I'm just like that bird, oh, oh, <br />Singin' just for you.'  <br /> <br />'idiot wind' is one of dylan's two angriest songs. i know that it gets compared to 'like a rolling stone', and for good reason, but dylan hasn't been this angry since 'masters of war', and he'd never get this angry, on record, again. stanzas 3 & 4 [which make up verse 2] are two of dylan's best crafted stanzas.  <br />'you're going to make me lonesome when you go' is one of two songs on the album where dylan seems to be trying to crack a smile about the pain he's feeling. you can seriously hear himself forcing a smile out for the songs [the other being 'buckets of rain']. it sounds like dylan is trying to talk about the divorce as a hypothetical situation that hasn't happened yet. for this reason, it's a dark horse nominee for saddest song on the album.  <br />'meet me in the morning' has dylan putting his blues to blues. easily one of his best blues songs.  <br />'lily, rosemary, and the jack of hearts' is the only song that doesn't seem biographical in some form or another. the story is a trip - a brilliant trip. while this song is the most separate - it's one of the  4 or 5 most indispensable.  <br />'if you see her, say hello' would be the obvious choice for most depressing song on the album, which is quite an accomplishment. these lines say it all:  <br /> <br />'Say for me that I'm all right though things get kind of slow <br />She might think that I've forgotten her, don't tell her it isn't so.'  <br /> <br />'shelter from the storm' is one of only two songs on the album that i can listen to no matter what my mood is or how i feel. it's the most surreal song on the album. also one of the four most famous songs on the album ['tangled up in blue', simple twist of fate', 'idiot wind', and 'shelter from the storm'].  <br />'buckets of rain' - dylan trying to smile at the end of the day. this is the other song that i can listen to no matte my mood. what's most impressive about this song is how dylan manages to sum up one of the two greatest album ever recorded in one last verse:  <br /> <br />'Life is sad <br />Life is a bust <br />All ya can do is do what you must. <br />You do what you must do and ya do it well, <br />I'll do it for you, honey baby, <br />Can't you tell?'  <br /> <br />i will exit on that note. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
B000002IOJ|5.0|I remeber having this tape in high school as well. The riff to \\"Time is Coming\\" has been in my head for the past 15 years now! If you know the song, you know what riff i'm taking about. All around a great example of great trash metal from the late 80s.
B0000AMRJC|2.0|People must be warned.  They need to be told the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth when it comes to reviews and purchasing items, especially when they are so undeserving of merit. Now, I am well aware that I am in the minority when saying this, but I must tell others so that they know that this movie is the MOST OVER-RATED AND HYPED UP film of all time!  This movie is so long and close to 3 hours, and I can't for the life of me see what everyone likes in it.  Why are people so fascinated?  What's there to be fascinated about?!  I just don't get it.  I will never begin to ever get it. Now, there were a few scenes that were interesting like when Tony Montana got mad at his friend for marrying his sister and when he went home to his mother and sister only to have his mother reject him for his ruthless, low-class, and wayward ways.  But, seriously, that's all there is to it. Nothing but endless and unnecessary cursing and swearing. Nothing good comes out of the mouths of anyone, just all vulgar and foul language. And, yet, somehow, this is suppose to be engaging and appealing? Pathetic. It's the truth with the saying that violence and sex sells......yes, indeed, it does, as evidence by this movie.  I know people will get mad for me saying this, but I am just here to let other potential buyers know that this movie is very much over-rated, so don't doubt me just because I am in the minority.
B00063MBU8|5.0|This is pure hardcore punk people. This is the type of stuff that your parents can't listen to because it's too xtreme for them to handle. Not only is this hardcore anti-mainstream punk rock, it also has some of the greatest instrument work evar. I think only Kurt Cobain and Avril Lavigne can play guitar better than these guys. People bring names of unknown posers like John Petrucci, Jason Becker, Michael Romeo and Al di Meola, but fact is they suck because I've never heard of them (because they don't play their songs on TRL. That means they are a load of ass). The bass player is equally amazing, showing losers like Victor Wooten, Tony Levin, John Myung etc how to actually play the bass. And the drumming!! this guy is brilliant, and I don't mean like the so-called \\"brilliant drumming\\" of poser losers  like Donati or Portnoy or Cobham or any of those losers. I mean REAL talent. And where do you find talent? MTV and TRL of course!! this rocks almost as much as Ashlee Simpson
B00076ZZ9I|3.0|Unfortunately, This is the best version of 'Back in Black' ever released. The DVD side of this disc is nothing more than a PCM stereo version of the album and a 23 minute documentary (not 30 minutes as advertised). There is also a discography but it is easily bested by many of those on-line like [...] So much more could have been done with this package, photos, lyrics, a digital version of the paper booklet that comes with the disc. Mind you, this is a review of the package. The music, as everyone knows, is some of the best rock ever written.<br /><br />Don't shell out your hard earned dollars for a sub par product. Keep downloading until the music studios get a clue an offer a product that is both loaded with high quality content and offered at a fair price. Consumers deserve value.
0783107986|5.0|When I was recently recuperating from surgery at home, this series was the first that came to mind as more of a study than a diversion. From the narrative to interviews, it is unforgettable. Mr. Olivier's understated delivery was even at release of this series, imitated (early Dan Akroyd on Saturday Night Live), and such lines as in the \\"Stalingrad\\" episode where he quotes Hitler \\"...we've got it really...\\" at a very late stage of this battle, are simply definitive. It is clear that a great deal of pain-staking effort went into this series, and is like a favorite movie (though hardly a movie); it can be viewed repeatedly, almost poetic.

B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" is the most beautiful movie I have ever watched. I love every second of it and wished that it would go on forever. It's really just about two people talking and talking and talking and you can never believe how powerful talking really can be. Or when two people connect with each other. Even though separated by an ocean and not meeting for nearly a decade. This movie awakened me to the lyricism of life and made me feel a lot more human after each viewing. Highly recommended!
B000002UAC|5.0|Even early Fabs beats almost everyone else. The cover versions are better than the originals. Not A Second Time was the song that brought them to the attention of the \\"serious\\" music critics in the U.K. Apparently it follows perfectly a classical harmonic sequence, the name of which escapes me. Anyway it is one of the greatest of all Beatle songs, and deserves five stars all on its own.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of those rare shows that captivates you within the first couple of minutes.  <br />I admit that I'm a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. When I heard Joss Whedon was doing a new show, I knew I had to watch it. Within the first five minutes, I knew I was seeing something truly magical. <br />Firefly was a gift. The dialogue is clever and witty, which is typical of Joss Whedon's shows. The characters are beautifully portrayed, human in their flaws, but still so loveable. <br />I suggest everyone try watching it. I've yet to meet someone who watched it who hasn't loved it.
0553382179|5.0|I came across Flylady's website about a month ago, which has been a life saver. I decided to purchase her book. What a wonderful book that can make a true difference in the disorganizeds life. Marla Cilley, or The Flylady pointed out something I never thought about before living in my chaos and piles, it is related to how we feel about ourselves.She makes it a priority that we don't even begin our days and routines, until we are up dressed and shoes on. What a difference that has made!!Then we start with shining our sinks. The pride and accomplishment of getting \\"something\\" done. A sense of accomplishment puts a smile on your face. She has these great exercises for getting rid of unneeded items and throwing out garbage and making it a fun exercise!!You find yourself wanting to get your stuff organized,clean and getting through and doing it!! this book is worth it!

B0000DD7LB|5.0|I am a fan of Britney's music and have been for some time. I really like the songs, but I think she kinda went a little too far. Listening to her first album \\"...Baby One More Time\\" and then \\"In The Zone\\", it's like you're entering a different universe! Now don't get me wrong, I still really like Britney's music, but some songs have kind of \\"mature\\" lyrics, such as I Got That (Boom Boom), and others. I would just like to say that I'm still a fan, though.
0156711427|3.0|The book \\"A Passage to India\\" was based on two English women by the names of Adela Quested, Mrs. Moore Who traveled across lands from England to India.  The two women wanted to see the \\"real\\" India, during their visit, instead of the cultural institutions back at home. In the novel Ronny, Mrs. Moore son was to be married to Adela Quested. A lot took place during the visit. Miss Adela and Ronny had a slight fall out a little after the beginning of the story.  They had agreed to not get married. Shortly after they had agreed to not get married, they had gotten into a car crash, and I guess that the shock or excitement of the moment had changed their minds. Aziz, a young Muslim doctor in India, was accused of sexually assaulting the young Miss Adela Quested in the caves of Marabar. Miss Adela went back to Chandrapore in India to tell what supposedly happen in the caves.  What really went down was that in the caves Adela had finally realized that she didn't love Ronny, so she tried to bust a move on Aziz.  She messes up by in sulting Aziz by asking how many wives does he have.  Aziz had gotten up set and left Adela in that section of the cave. That's how things had gotten twisted.  Miss Adela then went to the court with that lie and had gotten Aziz arrested.  That little lie had gotten out of control because it then turns to a civil case like England vs. India.  Latter on Ronny sent his mother Mrs. Moore home to England because she knew that Adela was lieing, on the trip back to home Mrs. Moore had passed, but before she did she realizes that there is no \\"real India\\", but rather a complex multitude of different Indias. Miss Adela Quested then confessed in court, Aziz was released, Ronny left her, and Miss Adela Quested was exiled from England and was to never return.

B0007O38F8|1.0|This crappy pop-rap fad has gone on long enough. I hate to use someone else's line, but if I hear any more of this no-talent dreck, I'll stick a stiletto in my ears. \\"FidddEEEEEEEE@EE\\"'s songs have about as much merit as an episode of America's Funniest Home Videos.    But that's okay. This fad is on its way out. Then we'll make room for the next stupid fad for dumb pre-teens to eat up, and 50 Cent here will go down in the same category as Wimp Bizkit, Feminem, Kid Rap, Vanilla Ice, Gerardo, et cetera.    Led Zeppelin. Sublime. The Beatles. The Rolling Stones. Pink Floyd. Green Day. Slayer. Pantera. Nirvana. These bands, or at least their music, has stood the test of time (there are also many more, but they are great examples). People are still discovering their early albums, at least a decade later, and getting into them. That won't be the case with \\"fiddy\\" here, along with the rest of his brain-dead pop-rap ilk (i.e. Nelly, Chingy, et cetera). It's disposable garbage, and the whole genre's 15 minutes of fame are almost up.    I will give him this, though: his moniker describes how much his music is worth (if that).
0920668372|5.0|My two year old daughter loves this book so much that she has destroyed two copies of it already.  I would love for it to be in a boardbook made for use by a toddler.  It is a sweet portrayal of parental love which makes a lot more sense to me as a Mother than it did when my mother gave me a copy as a teenager.  For those of you who are creeped out by this, well you are taking this work of fiction a teeny bit too literally.
068484267X|5.0|Yes....it's about an Irish childhood, according to Mr. McCourt the worst childhood you could ever have in those years.<br />I am just one of the millions that have read this book, making me one of McCourt's fan. <br />Why I like this book?. Firt of all, I am no Irish (I'm an asian) ; I had no idea how bad growing up in Europe would be like in those days. I've seen movies and all ...but with this book, I can actually not only picture his life, but feeling the hardship he and his family went through. He showed me very clearly life in Ireland was at the time...and at the same time, showed me how beautiful Ireland is too !.<br />It made me realize, no matter what you are, where you come from, who you are, what your belief is,..the concept of life is the same everywhere. He made me looked back on my own childhood and really value it. <br />I have also read the sequel &quot;'Tis&quot;...and I can't wait for the next one &quot;The Teacher Man&quot;..will be released in November this year!.<br />To me, he is a very one of a kind writer. I definitely agree when one of his professors told him he's got a 'rich past(childhood)'. I also like his way of writing...it's almost like he's speaking his mind right out to me when I'm reading it.<br />Frank McCourt is definitely one of my favourites.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album is probably the biggest surprise of the year because nobody expected it to do as well as it has, not even Mariah. But it's doing well because it's really a great album. The more I play it, the more confident I am that this is her best work. I never expected to find myself so fond of another Mariah album. Everyone that worked on the project deserves a lot of praise and credit. I'm sure this wasn't an easy task, but the result is quite admirable. Mariah did it again. Score one for 2005.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|I bought this CD for my granddaughter - who is a miracle, as are all of my grandchildren.  Celine's first song, Miracle, is so moving.  The rest of her songs are wonderfully done.  This is definitely one of her finest works - perhaps because it comes from her heart.

But Dexter is not just any serial killer; he's one with a conscience, killing only people \\"deserving of dying.\\"  Dexter's sense of humor is engaging and you just can't help liking the guy.  I was thoroughly engrossed in this book, laughed out loud in parts, and found myself rooting for Dexter to accomplish everything he set out to do, no matter what it was.  I highly recommend this astonishing debut novel.

B00005JNQ8|5.0|\\"The Interpreter\\", directed by Sydney Pollack, is a very smart political thriller.  Critics have called it an \\"old fashioned\\" movie and that it is an \\"old school\\" political thriller in the vein of a \\"Manchurian Candidate\\".  This is meant as a compliment and high praise.  Being called old fashioned may not seem like a positive thing these days, but when talking about \\"The Interpreter\\" the critics are saying that this is a well crafted, well written, well acted film which pays attention to building a believable story where the tension builds and builds.  It all means something and has a point, rather than the flashy style without substance that many of today's films seem to be using.<br /><br />Sylvia Broone (Nicole Kidman) is an interpreter for the United Nations.  She is a white African from the fictional nation of Motobo.  Having to return to the UN late one night to retrieve a bag she left in her booth, she overhears a conversation in the language of Motobo.  Before she believes she is spotted, she hears a whispered discussion talking about an assassination.  She doesn't at first know who the plot is against, but later realizes that the plotters are talking about assassinating the leader of her native Motobo.  When she reports the threat to her superiors, the United States Secret Service is brought in to protect the leader of Motobo when he arrives at the UN.  The agent in charge of this investigation is Tobin Keller (Sean Penn), a man dealing with his own pain even as Sylvia seeks to hide her past for reasons she won't reveal.<br /><br />It builds.  Little by little Sydney Pollack gives the viewer a deeper glimpse into the world of Sylvia Broone and who she is.  Keller is suspicious of anything he doesn't understand and Broone does appear to be hiding something.  Little by little we find out more of what is going on in this movie and the tension grows and grows.  Younger filmmakers can learn something from Sydney Pollack.  He doesn't play all of his cards right away but gives enough that the audience remains engaged.  Nothing in this movie is clear cut, and nothing is the way we initially perceive it to be.  Pollack keeps us guessing long enough through the movie, but without insulting our intelligence by throwing swerve after swerve.  Sure, there is a twist or two, but that much has to be expected.<br /><br />It must be noted that this is the first film which was given permission to actually film within the United Nations Headquarters, and the UN itself feels like a character.  Even Alfred Hitchcock was denied permission to film there.  Pollack is respectful of the mission and the work of the UN while still expressing reservations about the shortcomings and shortsightedness of the organization.<br /><br />\\"The Interpreter\\" is a very good movie, and a very smart movie.  In a week where the other big movie is the remake of \\"The Amityville Horror\\", \\"The Interpreter\\" is a welcome breath of fresh air in what has otherwise been a fairly dull season for movies.<br /><br />Grade: A-<br /><br />-Joe Sherryright away but gives enough that the audience remains engaged.

B0006M4SO6|5.0|How often can one accurately say this of a musical recording?  This record is, indeed, a fearless piece of work.  Metheny darned well understands that there are many people who won't easily connect with THE WAY UP.  If crafting an individual tune is analogous to writing a piece of fine short fiction, then THE WAY UP might appropriately be compared to writing a major (yes, literary) novel.  It's interesting that THE WAY UP is getting the best mainstream newspaper and magazine reviews of Metheny's career.  Maybe those folks who don't easily take to the record should ask themselves why it's garnering such intriguing accolades.  Don't be shocked when THE WAY UP wins a number of Grammy Awards and makes numerous reviewers' top-ten lists for 2005.  And, yes, this record does grow on many people with each listen.  I'm one of those folks.     Davis Miller,  author of THE TAO OF MUHAMMAD ALI:  A FATHERS AND SONS MEMOIR
B0000ADY9I|4.0|There is nothing new about this package other than new photos and 'Midnight Rider'. 'Midnight Rider' is interesting but Gregg Allman can't seem to hit that high note required: 'One More...\\". <br />Sound quality is the same as the single disc released earlier. The Fillmore Concerts has the best sound period, rich and detailed. This set sounds muddy and compressed when the band is playing full blast. A fresh 24 bit remastering may have improved things, maybe not. This was an analog recording and we can assume that this Deluxe Edition is AAD, where The Fillmore Concerts is ADD. I agree with other reviwers, they should have released other unreleased versions instead of a simple retread.
B00000JLWW|5.0|\\"They wouldn't let Jack Johnson on the US Titanic   (Fare thee well Titanic goin' down)   They said, boy get back to your hole, dis ship she don't haul no coal   (Down to the bottom of the sea)\\"    The feminist power of this movie is that its greatness cannot be acknowledged and the *bien-pensant* dismisses it as Hollywood: but it is great Hollywood.    Much less than Sep 11,we haven't dealt with Titanic and the way the lower clawsses were trapped like rats. In fact, upon the release of Titanic, Chicago radio station WFMT, the last hope of the bien pensant, refused a number of phone in requests to play the above song about Jack Johnson's inability to get a ride on the doomed ship.    Because the song was by a white boy naming and narrating what was being done to his brother, it transgressed the unwritten rule as does the very thought that we might maintain social class boundaries up to the gates of hell.    The best films are always chick flicks.      UPDATE 5-17-2005    Wow, another Nolan Ryan: another perfect game: 0 of 4. The Jack Johnson and Titanic nexus still hath power to offend I see.    I am sure that the type of reader who like the reviewer above who \\"predicted\\" that old canoe was goin' down an hour into the film, and concluded from his lack of moron suspense that the scriptwriters were the morons: the type of reader who jest loved it when Leornard diCaprio died (bearing within himself that destructiveness which is constitutive of society): the type of reader whose critique of Cameron's acceptance speech was informed by the sour resentment of the born loser PUNCHED OUT at my phrase \\"the feminist power\\".    \\"The feminist power\\" is lame. Nonetheless, Jim Cameron laughed his way to the bank because so many chicks dragged their boyfriends to this thing, and after the film, on Grand Avenue in Chicago, a lady sung to me the song she'd learned in Bible school about how it were a shame how that ship went down to de bottom of the sea.    Yeah, I wondered too why Kate Winslet didn't get hypothermia in the bowels of the sinking ship but I figure her extra layer of Rubeneque avoirdupois and love's heat made he oblivious to the water temperature. That, and the fact that the water in the ship was heated by the dying boilers and electrical cables.    The film offends because it was popular without being a shootemup and Billy Zane (who first emerged as Sam Neill's and Nicole Kidman's dark American foil in Dead Calm, an enjoyable example of an anti-American Australian film) may have been uncomfortable for the Yuppie a-hole segment of the audience. It offends because it teaches us what a waste it is to live a life in First Class.
0345457684|5.0|I'm a long time fan of sci-fi from Asimov, Ellison, Poul Anderson and Greg Benford to Neal Stephenson and China Mieville and Alastair Reynolds and I want to thank the reader out there who introduced me to Richard Morgan. Here, we have a writer who reaches to the essence to the human condition and spares us all the soft talk and excuses and just lays it all out with fury and great prose.  In Morgan, I have found a writer who has reached way beyond the mainstream of forceful writing and pay Morgan the highest respect by making the comparison to Harlan Ellison who has never been at a loss for the hard edge. <br /> <br />Many good synopsis' have already been writen but in these books you get to contemplate the concept \\"I am not my body, I have a body...\\" Poul Anderson has written on this topic with a number of his books like the \\"Harvest of Stars\\" series <br /> <br />I've read both of the Kovacks series books - Altered Carbon and Broken Angels and have ordered the third due out this fall. It's been some time since I've been left so energized after reading a book. Your going to lose all kinds of sleep and that's a price well worth paying.
B000056NX4|5.0|For those seeking new, fresh, and challenging ways to experience the possibilities of our \\"Jesus,\\" this stands out as a FIVE STAR event.   There were two specific variances that make this my absolute favorite, even over the earlier version I saw on stage and in film.  The close-up photography stands in contrast to the earlier version which was groundbreaking in its own time.  This allows viewers to experience Jesus and His followers in a dramatic new way.  We see the joy, sadness, confusion, and fear of those last days.  And, we also see a tortured Judas who eventually gives way to the dark side.  I love the portrayal of a man who was a dear friend of Jesus but a real rascal and betrayer of our Saviour.  This film is a must for all who can leave their rigid, ultraconservative agendas in the closet. So, go for it!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Ever since this film was released I've observed people arguing about its value.  Frankly, none of it mattered to me that much.  I was curious to see what the fuss was about, but not really that motivated to actually go and see \\"Lost\\" in the theater or even rent it for that matter.<br /><br />Now, after seeing this film, I am fascinated by not just the movie, but also all these negative reviews!<br /><br />Most movies give you two hours which are a super hyper-condensed version of reality.  In many cases this creates an absurd pacing.  Humans and events just don't evolve that quickly.  But audiences, particularly here in the US, demand immediate emotional satisfaction.  The boy always gets the girl, the Americans always win the battle, the bad guy always loses, etc. etc.  This kind of plot and pacing is not just unrealistic, it's absolutely monotonous.  So many movies in the US are just the same thing over and over and over.<br /><br />And then a movie like \\"Lost in Translation\\" comes along.  Coppola slows the pacing so that it's more realistic. She refuses to pander to the expectations of an American audience.  She wants to show us what it actually feels like to be an observer in another country that you don't understand.  To add to the realism and surrealism she throws in multiple characters who are also having the same experience.  All of this is the context surrounding an unconsummated love between a younger woman and an older man.<br /><br />I'm more saddened than amazed at the hostility towards this film.  To understand \\"Lost\\" you need to empathize with the characters.  You need to know that uneasy sense of alienation when you're in another country and don't a have a clue about what's going on around you.  More importantly, you need to know what it's like to be committed to someone else and meet another person you would really really like to get to know under different circumstances.<br /><br />Most Americans don't even have passports.  More and more, Americanson all sides of the political spectrum demand news and media that conform to their point of view.  Empathy has become a rare commodity.  All of this, it seems, results in a lot of people just not getting a movie like \\"Lost.\\"  Something is wrong with American audiences - something wrong with their psyches, their expectations and their sense of humanity - if they feel they have to hate this movie.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Ok, first off, you can't come into this album, or any other Radiohead album for that matter, with the expectation that it will be anything other than Radiohead.  They have been called prog, punk, pop, or just plain rock'n'roll... but this is not the case.  Radiohead is not Dreamtheater, nor are they the Sex Pistols, nor the Beach Boys.  More importantly they do not try to be.  Radiohead is unique.  Other reviewers have called Thom Yorke's singing as \\"whiny,\\" I won't argue with that, but it fits the music.  They have complained about computer-generated sounds that dont constitute music, again those sounds are there, but they only add depth.  But also, look at the title of the Album  \\"OK Computer,\\" Radiohead is not Jim Croce.   <br /> <br />That Said: <br /> <br />In \\"Ok Computer,\\" Radiohead has created an incredibly complex concept album bemoaning life in the information age.  This album is an emotional roller coaster... just listen to Exit Music (for a film).  You will listen to this album and you will not like it.  I know very few people that could grasp it with just one listening.  Enjoyment of this music takes effort.  If you enjoy sitting down and truley listening to what an artist has worked meticulously to create, this album is for you.  Lastly, as you listen to this music, imagine what sort of feelings and emotions produced it.  Radiohead is not \\"I hate my girlfriend\\" music, it is much, much deeper than that.
B0008JFMEC|4.0|i think you should have a selection of movies and ask the customer which regional psp they are getting then it will work i have 2 PSP's one american and one japanise so if i buy the any rejion UMD DVD it will work but most of i will recomend u guys definetly!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0007OE15Y|5.0|The title of this album reflects on what the music does. You sit there paralyzed in awe of how great it is. The best thing about this cd is the Bonus Tracks. Their cover of Like A Drug, was pretty good, and the new Infinity stands on its own. But the One bonus track that stands out the most has to be hands down Precious and Grace. It's amazing like no other. Mark's Vocals are amazing on this song both on cd and on stage. If you are a QOTSA fan you will understand.
0061015725|3.0|Being a science fiction fan I found this book to be rather good. I found the subject of the book to be very interesting. Nanotechnology isn't the most widely written or read about subject in most people's everyday readings for entertainment. I found it to be a nice change in scenery from what I have been reading. <br /> <br />In the book jack a scientist that loses his job becomes a stay-at-home dad, and leaves his wife to be the only one bringing in the dough. After thinking something might be going on with his wife Julia. Who is doing more late nights at work working in the lab. So he takes action. In doing so he puts himself in a very dangerous situation. Although everyone else that is in the lab is in the very same danger as he is. This is about the time when the nanobots have \\"escaped\\" or have been \\"released\\" and are now out to get Jack and everyone else. So now everyone is running for their lives trying to find a way to get out of lab and stay alive. While this is all going on Jack finds out that his wife is being unfaithful which adds more to the tension of the story.  <br /> <br />Though I thought there were some flaws to the plot of the story. Well the plot itself is a little plain, although straight to the point. The character development does leave something to be desired I must say. Even with those few flaws in my mind the book was still entertaining and I did enjoy it. I would recommend this book to any sci-fi lover.  <br />
B0007XT87G|5.0|Everytime I put in \\"In Absentia\\", \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" and now Porcupine Tree's latest release, \\"Deadwing\\" I cannot help but feel a certain pity for people who don't \\"get\\" this band. Their music simply tugs at my emotions in a way that I can't explain. I still nearly cry when I hear the first few minutes of Trains (from \\"In Absentia\\"). In short, this is moving music (when I thought that kind of music was truely dead these days). Everyone should experience this. Please give them a chance, for your own good!<br /><br />In their newest effort, Porcupine Tree once again raises the bar for others to follow in terms of production and song writing. You can hear musical influences from Pink Floyd, Yes, Tool, and I swear there is even a bit of Slayer (in \\"Arriving ...\\"). The production quality is amazing. Each song sounds like it was worked on for months.<br /><br />In short, buy this album (and their last effort \\"In Absentia\\"). You will not regret the purchase.
B00013RC9I|5.0|Maybe you've never heard anything by Air before. Perhaps you are an Air veteran and long time fan. Either way, Air's new release Talkie Walkie is one of the most incredible albums ever made. Air bridges electronic music with hypnotic and deeply melodic vocal parts to create something that is unique, sweet, and spiritually uplifting. Upon hearing Talkie Walkie I rushed to devour another one of their albums: 10,000 Hz Legend. Although different from one another, these are both brilliant pieces of work worthy of collection and repeated listenings, from morning until laying your head down at night.
B00005JNQ8|3.0|Movies serve many purposes.  For example, they might edify so that we never repeat past mistakes (Schindler's List, Hotel Rwanda); they might just serve to make us laugh (Dumb and Dumber, Planes, Trains, and Automobiles); or they might drop us into a suspenseful world with sketchy characters and hidden pasts (The Deep End, Chinatown).  The Interpreter fits neatly into that last category, aiming to keep the audience on its collective toes as it asks a new question with each one it answers.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman is certainly credible as Silvia, the title character, of both British and South African descent.  She makes an allegation that cannot be substantiated, while her motives may be suspect.  We in the audience see things as much from Sean Penn's perspective (Keller) as hers.  Penn, always a good actor, plays a sleepless secret service agent whose job is to get to the bottom of her tip and protect her if she is in danger.  Perhaps this is just because of his illustrious career as a portrayor of countless gangsters, thugs, and jerks, but Penn does not strike the audience as perfectly suited to his role.  He always seems more at home on the other side of the law, as the sleazy lawyer-turned-wiseguy David Kleinfeld in Carlito's Way, or the brooding, dangerous Jimmy in Mystic River.<br /><br />As the action progresses, we ask the same questions Keller does: who is this woman?  Is she religious?  Single?  Have any children?  Any enemies?  As it turns out, she isn't totally straight with him in the beginning, and in fact continues to omit important details about her past.  Kidman pulls this off without being exasperating in her evasions, and provides a compelling character for the action to follow.<br /><br />If you've ever wondered what the inside of the UN is like, The Intepreter will show you: it is shot entirely on-location (the movie was shot on weekends to avoid interfering with actual UN proceedings).  The Interpreter provides adequate action and suspense for a popcorn movie with brains, but will not bowl anyone over as especially memorable or unusual.ense for a popcorn movie with brains, but will not bowl anyone over as especially memorable or unusual.
0385504209|4.0|Brown manages to turn beautiful artwork into something different.  He suggests that there are hidden messages and unsolved mysteries behind the works of Leonardo Da Vinci.<br /><br />  Dan Brown's book, The Da Vinci Code, is deserving of a four-star rating, because he begins the book with quite a few suspenseful moments, and keeps the reader's attention.  He also raises many interesting questions about Da Vinci and the Bible.  There have been several newspaper articles, reviews, and even television shows, such as Dateline, that have discussed this book.<br /><br />  The story is very interesting.  Robert Langdon, a notable symbolist, and Sophie Neveu, a cryptologist are trying to solve the murder of a much respected curator at the Louvre.  Before the curator died, he left random clues to a secret that only he knew, a secret that he did not want to die with him.  Now, Robert and Sophie must race against time and the police, while solving the puzzle.  If they are too late the secret will fall into the wrong hands.<br /><br />  The book starts out well, but throughout the course of the story Brown tends to get carried away and seems to lose the interest of the reader with several confusing plot twists.  The end is also very boring.  With the way the story is built up, one would expect a more climatic ending.<br /><br />  This book remains a best seller almost two years after it was published.  Brown raises some controversial questions regarding the Catholic Church and the Bible.  Steven Spielberg is going to direct the movie and it will be interesting to see how it is portrayed on the big screen.
B00005JNVS|3.0|Kung Fu Hustle **1/2<br /><br />Cast: Stephen Chow, Yuen Wah, Yuen Qui, Leung Siu Lung, Shengyi Huang<br /><br />Director: Stephen Chow<br /><br />Running Length: 1:35<br /><br />MPAA Classification: PG-13<br /><br />In Shanghai, in the 1930s, everything is controlled by the Axe Gang.  Well, everything except the slums.  There is no profit in the slums.  Sing (Chow) wants to take advantage of this, and when he arrives at Pigsty Alley playing the role of an Axe Gang member, his performance is so bad that nobody believes him.  Then some real members of the gang arrive, and Sing is in trouble.  To add to that, there are some kung fu masters hiding in Pigsty Alley, and they are not too thrilled with the gang making an appearance in their little town.<br /><br />I can honsetly say I have never seen a movie quite like \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\".  It is a strange hybrid of a kung fu movie, a slapstick comedy, and even a little Road Runner/Looney Toones.  It is really funny at times, but the humor is a bit uneven.  The biggest drawback to this film is the subtitles.  I prefer this to dubbing, but I think that some of the humor is lost, having to read them.<br /><br />Apparently Stephen Chow is second in popularity in China only to Jackie Chan.  He has yet to really make a name for himself here in America, but there definately is potential.  He writes, directs, stars, and produces this movie, so this movie is definately his.  If you are looking for something a little different to see, \\"Kung Fu Hustle\\" just may be the movie for you.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Such a strong, bold voice from such a quiet appearance.  I have been following Josh Groban since his first appearance on Good Morning America.  He gave me chills then and is still doing that now.  This is such a beautiful CD and I cannot get enough of \\"You Raise Me Up.\\"  I cannot really call this classical music although it truly is.  You get lost in the music and almost miss the fact that many of these songs are in latin.  Amazing CD as is the first.  I look forward to many many more.

0316666343|4.0|This book was very interesting. It took the reader into two different aspects of the narrator (Susie Salmon)'s life. She told how her life was on earth, and described her after-life in heaven. I really liked how though Susie would never grow up, throughout the book, the reader watched her family and friends grow to become adults. The book was somewhat confusing in certain parts, but for the most part, I really enjoied it. I would definately recommend it.

0060589280|3.0|For years The Alchemist has been gathering dust on my bookshelf, and on a whim one day I decided to buy and immediately read Eleven Minutes. First, off, it is difficult to give a fully informed opinion of Coehlo's writing style. The translation and editing was deplorable. I found too many grammatical mistakes and literal translations to count. Therefore, I couldn't determine if the tone of the novel was truly the author's or an error in translation. Whatever the case, this review is based on the English translation by Margaret Jull Costa.  <br /> <br />Eleven minutes is yet another modern day fairytale smothered over a thin slice of preachy philosophy. Honestly, two transcendental orgasmically instigated enlightening moments are annoying (the first physical, the second spiritual). The day to day renderings of Maria's life were convincing enough that I almost felt like most of the book was ghostwritten by the real \\"Maria\\". It is in effect, a fairytale. As all fairytales are, they are simple. Barely is there a lesson. Maria goes on a journey, meets various characters (the librarian, the artist, the sado masochistic John) and throughtout the journey she morphs from pariah and prostitute to sacred mother and wife (in spirit). The few accounts of sexual liasons are not in the least bit shocking, even if they were intended to be. They just were, what they were... eleven minutes of sex. Its a lovely story, if you can get beyond the author's protracted philosophical ramblings.

B000002UAU|5.0|What more can be said of this classic that has not already been said: groundbreaking, revolutionary and utterly enjoyable from start to finish.  The concept of album rock really got its start with this record, since every track is excellent.   <br /> <br />Speaking as an American who LOVES this album, I find the comments made by a certain Heretic to be indicative of what is wrong with this country- absolute intolerance of those whose opinions differ from their own.  The last time I checked, Amazon was a site on the World Wide Web that ANYONE can look at and comment upon.  Not to mention, your taste in music absolutely SUCKS.       <br />

0385512058|1.0|A close friend recommended this and after reading it I didn't know if it was a book on networking or Keith Ferrazzi's address book.  I would almost like to go back and count how many names were mentioned.  The book brings to question, who not how?  It seems to me if you're always asking someone else to perform on your behalf, you infact have no skill to offer.  Ferrazzi seems to feel very strong about building relationships, not business contacts, which is respectable, but then it appears that he uses those relationships as resources in order to generate more income for his private consulting company, Ferrazzi Greenlight.  Some people might call that \\"using your friends.\\"
B0000AMRJC|5.0|A few years ago (in the late 1990s), Universal released a preliminary version of Scarface on DVD. That version was a disaster. Only a limited number of discs were released, the digital picture quality was horrible (looking no better than VHS picture quality), and the only extra included was a theatrical trailer. <br /> <br />On the 20th anniversary of Scarface, Universal re-released Scarface and this time they got it right. Scarface is quite possible the biggest and greatest cult classic of all time, as the movie did mediocre at the box office in 1983, but its legendary status grows bigger with each passing year.  <br /> <br />The Scarface DVD has an absolutely beautiful and vibrant, crystal-clear picture quality which enhances the film's excellent cinematography. The sun-drenched beaches of Miami and the tropical flavor of the scenery really stand out on the DVD. The soundtrack, having been digitally remastered, is also outstanding. Be sure to connect your TV to a surround-sound system for a really great Scarface experience.  <br /> <br />Scarface actually comes with two discs. Disc 1 contains the film. The second disc contains the extras, such as a documentary on the making of the movie, cast commentary and behind-the-scenes interviews, and director's commentary regarding the re-making of Scarface. You may not be aware of it, but Scarface was originally released in the 1930s. The original featured Al Capone, not Tony Montana, and the drug in question was alcohol instead of cocaine. <br /> <br />There is no under-estimating the influence and significance of the 1983 Scarface in terms of American popular culture. Hip hop music often pays homage to Scarface, and even the Grand Theft Auto video game series has been highly influenced in its content and soundtrack from this classic. Scarface is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.
1400034779|4.0|I like this book because it is simply written, has interesting characters, and an uncomplicated plot. The setting, Botswana, and the use of a lady detective, are what make the story stand out. The reader gets a feel for what it is like to live in Botswana.

B00005JNRB|4.0|Caveat: I have not read Clive Cussler's book on which this film is based. Even so, it is clear that this screenplay is only a very loose adaptation of  the book and that Dirk Pitts role in this film is an extreme caricature of his roles in the Cussler series in which he is the main protagonist.. The fact that I was familiar with NUMA and Pitts from Cussler's other works but couldn't compare this film to the novel in all likelihood increased my enjoyment of the movie.   <br /> <br />Matthew McConaughey is cast as Dirk Pitts, intrepid NUMA (National Underwater and Marine Agency) explorer who is completing a mission off the African coast when he is contacted by a trader with a rare Confederate coin. It rekindles Dirk's quest for the legendary ironclad warship that supposedly somehow mysteriously disappeared over a century ago. Despite the reluctance of his (retired but with title intact) Admiral wonderfully played by William Macy, Dirk wheedles the use of the crew's powerboat to explore the Niger River in search of any traces of the lost ship. Those accompanying him include his sidekick Al Giordano (Steve Zahn) and Penelope Cruz, cast as the dedicated bush Doctor Rojas from the WHO (World Health Organization) who is trying to track down the cause of what appears to be a few cases which appear to indicate the potential for an outbreak of some unknown plague. They quickly arrive upriver in Mali, currently in the throes of a violent civil war. With this backdrop to establish the storyline, the pace accelerates and the audience's fun begins. Mystery, death, disease, drama, intrigue, war, pollution, several humorous interludes and even a touch of romance - the producer and director decided to touch all the bases. It is probably a little long, but it's so much fun and there are so few slow moments in the last ninety minutes that no one in the audience when I saw it seemed to get restless. WARNING: don't get to the theater late (very difficult in NYC with all the ads and previews), the first few minutes provide the crucial backstory for the rest of the film. <br /> <br />This is the type of extreme action/adventure film that appeals to moviegoers who just want to be entertained with an interesting even if totally implausible storyline and lots of over the top action sequences. While it might be labeled a thriller, I hesitate to do so even though the main characters almost continually find themselves in unbelievably tense and dangerous situations. The reason is that this is the type of movie that was popularized by the INDIANA JONES series (which it much more resembles than JAMES BOND); the action is stylized, the story is high drama but totally unrealistic, and the theatergoers never share the tension of the participants because we know that the good guys will remain alive (with minimal collateral damage) and the bad guys will get their due in grand fashion - we just don't know how it will all work out in view of the overwhelming odds against the eventual heroes. However, there is neither enough realism for us to be drawn into the action as vicarious participants or enough uncertainty about the broad outlines of the outcome to qualify for my definition of a thriller. <br /> <br />So my four star rating is a reflection of the fact that this film fulfills the goal of its creators and producers - lighthearted entertainment. It reminds us that movies can be enjoyable and provoke laughter without gory violence (although there are plenty of dead bodies). While I don't think that it quite deserves a full four stars on my usual rating scale, it sure was too much fun to downgrade more than minimally below that level. If you want to see a moving drama, memorable character studies, outstanding performances, relevance to the real world or a potential classic, then skip SAHARA - if you're willing to suspend belief and travel through the desert of Mali for a while with Dirk and his friends, you'll have a great time. <br /> <br />Tucker Andersen <br />

B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium (2002)is an underrated film that thankfully is getting more recognition on DVD.  Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, the premise is deceptively simple: after World War Four, society has had enough.  Human emotions are blamed for all violence, and the name of this new totalitarian society is Libria, run by the faceless Tetragrammaton.  Citizens dutifully inject themselves twice a day with a drug that supresses all feelings, even senses of touch and taste.  The movie is a fantastic futuristic action thriller that also touched my heart and provoked endless thought.  The reasoning behind eliminating human feelings makes some sense.  The other side of love is hate, and passion is often responsible for murder.  Why do people numb themselves with alcohol and drugs, even committ suicide?  Because feeling is sometimes too painful to bear.  We have all been let down, hurt by someone we love.  But that is a sacrifice we make, to feel love and friendship.<br /><br />Christian Bale is the center of the story.  A magnetic and mesmerizing actor who moves with the athletic grace of a tiger, he plays Cleric John Preston.  As a top enforcer against \\"sense offenders,\\" Preston even executes another cleric (Sean Bean - Boromir in the Lord of the Rings) who has succumbed to Yeat's poetry.  \\"Tread lightly on my dreams.\\"  Bean gives quite a touching performance.  Preston has two young children, but his wife was incinerated for sense offenses.  Of course, Preston feels nothing.  There is a resistance, of course, underground people who are not injecting and \\"feeling.\\"  They cling to cheesy knick-knacks and tacky art, anything to evoke emotion.  These scenes of confiscated snow-globes and faded paintings are very sad.  Even sadder is a scene where companion animals are exterminated because they serve no purpose except love.  I cried at this scene.<br /><br />The sets and acting are very good.  Taye Diggs plays a villian here - how odd to see that engaging, bright smile become sinister!  He is also very good in combat scenes.  Angus MacFayden (Robert the Bruce in Braveheart) plays Preston's supervisor. Emily Watson (Punch-Drunk Love) plays Mary O'Brien, a woman arrested for sense offense and sentenced to incineration. The movie is very violent, with lots of bloody executions and tons of gunfire.  But the hand-to-hand martial arts combat scenes are breathtaking.  The DVD contains a nice featurette entitled \\"Finding Equilibrium.\\"  The featurette contains interviews with Bale, Diggs, Wimmer, and Watson, although Watson is so soft-spoken you really can't hear what she is saying!also very good in combat scenes.

B00000DQXA|5.0|In the 1950s Frank Sinatra worked with two great arrangers, Nelson Riddle and Gordon Jenkins. \\"Only the Lonely\\" was supposed to be recorded with Jenkins, who had arranged Sinatra's previous collection of ballads, \\"Where Are You.\\" But Jenkins was busy on something else and Sinatra ended up using Riddle. The result was this 1958 album that is arguably his greatest collection of saloon songs. Certainly \\"Only the Lonely\\" is the bleakest of the bunch, with a dozen brooding songs of desperation and despair. Sinatra was great at a lot of different types of singing, but for me he was clearly at his best in this genre of self-pity.<br /><br />It is totally fitting, therefore, that \\"Only the Lonely\\" has his best saloon song, \\"One for My Baby (And One More for the Road),\\" by Harold Arlen and Johnny Mercer. The unforgettable opening line establishes the melancholy mood (\\"It's quarter to three, There's no one in the place except you and me\\") as Sinatra sings to the bartender his tale of woe. Someone described this song as being the one that Humphrey Bogart would have been singing if \\"Casablanca\\" had been made into a musical the way Sintara was in \\"High Society,\\" the musical based on \\"The Philadelphia Story,\\" while he drowns his sorrows. The other great torch song on the album is \\"Angle Eyes,\\" with superb vocals offset by subdued orchestration. The title song, specifically written for Sinatra, starts off the album and establishes the perfect mood, and \\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry\\" completes the quartet of four classic songs on this album.<br /><br />The remastered CD offers up two more songs from this period, \\"Sleep Warm\\" and \\"Where or When,\\" but this was already an essential Sinatra album without those additions and I have to offer a minor complaint that with the addition of that pair of tracks the album does not end as it should, with \\"One For My Baby.\\"  It might not be his greatest album, but it absolutely has to be on the first hand you use when you start naming what should be on that list. \\"Only the Lonely\\" is the ultimate late night Sinatra album, to be listened to with the lights down low as you wallow in the depths of despair.what should be on that list. \\"Only the Lonely\\" is the ultimate late night Sinatra album, to be listened to with the lights down low as you wallow in the depths of despair.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I finally got around to watching this one over the weekend, and quite frankly, I enjoyed it immensely.  I was left with a profound hollowness in my gut when the film ended -- which is precisely the effect any worthwhile Greek tragedy should have.  I realize that most of this movie's loudest critics highlight its rather pronounced divergence from Homer's classic Greek epic, The Iliad, and they're correct.  However, I would remind viewers that this movie's credits include an appropriate disclaimer -- it is \\"inspired by\\" the Iliad, rather than \\"based on\\" it.  Those two words open up a broad range of artistic license, of which the producers obviously availed themselves.  Nevertheless, the main story line of the battle of Troy is readily identifiable.<br /><br />The story is not complicated.  Just when Sparta and Troy are trying to cement a peace treaty to end years of war between them, young Paris, a prince of Troy (an uninspired performance by Orlando Bloom), takes a shine to Helen, queen of Sparta and wife of its king, Menelaus.  When Helen chooses to return to Troy with Paris and his brother, the legendary Trojan general Hector (Eric Bana), Menelaus seeks the aid of his brother, Greek king Agamemnon, to get her back.  Agamemnon sees a golden opportunity to unite the strength of all the Greek kingdoms under his banner and to do the one thing which has always eluded him -- the capture of Troy.  Trojan king Priam (masterfully played by Peter O'Toole) accepts the risk of war and chooses to stand behind his sons, trusting in his gods and the walls of Troy to protect them.<br /><br />Helen's face does, indeed, launch a thousand ships, bearing to the shores of Troy the largest Greek army ever fielded.  The Greeks quickly find, however, that the Trojan walls are just as impregnable as they have always been, and that Hector's leadership is brilliant.  Agamemnon is forced to turn to his unpredictable and uncontrollable ally, the mighty warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt) and his band of Myrmidons.  Achilles brings a heroic dynamism and leadership to every battle, and literally makes the difference between victory and defeat for the giant Greek army.  In the many (very well done) battle scenes, Achilles reminds the viewer of a Cuisinart as he whirls and dances with deadly speed and precision among his enemies.<br /><br />But Achilles is a tormented man.  He is portrayed as the ultimate warrior, a veritable killing machine whose only code is death.  Legend has it that, as an infant, Achilles was dangled by his ankle and dipped into the River Styx, thereby becoming invulnerable to death.  Brad Pitt, in my opinion, did a fine acting job in this role, bringing depth and dimension to this complex character.  On the one hand, he is a cold ruthless killer, but on the other, he demonstrates a deep love, and grief, toward his young cousin Patroclus, and a strange tenderness and protectiveness toward Briseis, the young priestess he captures in an early battle.  He also shows an intense honor in his dealings with Priam and Hector, and even spares the life of a Trojan soldier who states simply, \\"Please, I have a son.\\"  Frankly, this is probably the best role I have seen from Brad Pitt so far.<br /><br />The legends go on to tell of the Trojan Horse, and of Achilles' heel -- the one part of his body that wasn't dipped in the Styx.  Those legends play out forcefully and credibly on the screen, and leave the viewer struck by a deep sense of tragedy and loss as the story closes.  The entire film is one of heroism, nobility and action as the legends are brought vividly to life.  The settings and the battles are realistic and gritty, and the special effects are well done.  Maybe it's not true to Homer's original story, but if you can get past that I think you'll find that this is a wonderful tale in its own right.Achilles brings a heroic dynamism and leadership to every battle, and literally makes the difference between victory and defeat for the giant Greek army.

B0006399FS|5.0|Ok I have just read the reviews for this album and I think some of you have a problem with moving on from the 80's.  <br />Yes U2 did good stuff in the 80's and yes they wern't afraid to move the boundries of what was acceptible in the music industry but COME ON!!!!  <br />  This is a good Album and very well put togeather, stop comparing Joshua tree to this album, U2 have moved on to newer sounds, why don't you!?! <br />  If they made another album like joshua tree you would complain because it's not original...GET OVER IT!!! <br />  Anyway, I will now get off my soap box... <br />as you can tell I love this album and think that U2 are the best they have ever been.  <br /> <br />   <br />
0440178002|5.0|Shogun was first published in 1975 and is a HUGE tome, well researched, detailing the situations in feudal Japan of the late 1500s. The characters involved are thinly disguised historical figures, and the main character is based on a real Englishman - Will Adams. I am a HUGE huge fan of Shogun. Those who have only seen the mini-series really need to read the book. It goes into all sorts of layers and sub-layers that aren't even touched on in the mini-series version.<br /><br />Your basic story is of a Dutch pilot, who becomes known as Anjin, who crash-lands in Japan with his crew. The crew is immediately locked up, but Anjin is brought out to talk with the local samurai. The Portuguese priests are very upset at the thought of English ships reaching their rich treasure-trove of trade. Soon there are political battles between the priests who get great wealth by negotiating with the Japanese, and Anjin who provides the Japanese with a fresh view of world politics.<br /><br />Along the way, Anjin falls in love with Mariko, who is the wife of one of the archers. The lead Shogun - Toronaga - encourages this romance as a way to keep Anjin under control. Toronaga is in his own battles for control with an arch-rival. So there are many different conflicts going on. The Japanese are fighting amongst themselves for control of the island. They need the Portuguese priests, but don't want to be taken advantage of by them. They want the knowledge that Anjin has - but don't want to risk yet another complex control situation with England.<br /><br />Anjin begins by seeing the Japanese as a heathen, backwards group of people. But as time goes on, he becomes one of them, appreciating the value of a soak in the bathtub, enjoying the healthy food, appreciating the music and manners and artistry of the culture.<br /><br />Where other top selling books are usually about sex, violence and drugs, Shogun wraps all of those things in an incredible amount of historical research. Yes, there's some sex. The book loves to highlight the geisha and openness of naked bodies that are found in Japan. There's violence - the samurai are shown as accepting death readily and chop off the head of a villager who does not show respect. People are tortured. I suppose there are no drugs in the story :) But none of these things are put in for a tittilation factor, to bludgeon you over the head. They are all provided in context, to help show visibly the difference between Anjin's view of morality and life and death and the views of the Japanese he now lives with.<br /><br />The beauty of this book is in the little touches. So many books are written with little care for three dimensional characters and realistic environments. James poured incredible amounts of time and effort into travelling to locations to get the actual details right. He went to the Vatican to make sure he got the details of the church's influence correct. When you read this book, you get an incredibly gripping tale. But not only that, when you are done, you really do know a lot more about an important culture, about why they were the way they were and how people lived and died back then. I think that's an amazing achievement, to have combined historical fact with a well written story involving people you grow to care a great deal about.<br /><br />Highly recommended.me sex.

B00005JKNF|5.0|Perusing the reviews for \\"Gosford Park\\" I wasn't surprised to see several complaints of boredom. It might sound stupid, but anyone who found this film boring is not Robert Altman's intended audience. Gosford Park is a masterpiece of subtlety and exquisite attention to detail; it requires patience and focus on the part of the viewer. The entertainment is there on the screen; it's up to the individual to discover it.    \\"Gosford Park\\" succeeds in bringing together two completely different worlds that rarely, if ever, collide. The languid upstairs sphere hovers just above the much more crowded and lively below stairs universe. To watch the ballet dance between the two is to watch genius at work.
0451528018|5.0|Sherlock Holmes had already been officially killed off by 1902 - but the public was so loud in wanting to hear more stories about him that Sir Doyle relented and wrote a new story. He set it in a real house this time, based on a real legend. This Holmes tale has been voted by many groups as the best of all Holmes stories. Indeed, there are at least 30 different versions of dramatizations of the story.<br /><br />What is interesting is that the story isn't a typical puzzle where Holmes works through the clues one by one while you watch. Instead, we get some brief time with Holmes and Watson at the beginning, as they interact with a Doctor. Then Watson goes off with the Doctor and Sir Henry Baskerville, recently come over from Canada. It turns out Henry is now owner of a manor in the Baskervilles. The family has been under a curse involving a large hound. In fact the reason the home is now his is that his relation was apparently slain by such a hound.<br /><br />So Watson goes along Sir Henry to keep an eye on things, while Holmes sits home. The entire story is told from Watson's point of view, only of Watson's observations. Instead of watching Holmes work, we get more of a \\"storytelling\\" sense here. We hear about the melancholy gloom of the home. We hear often of the quiet loneliness of the moors, with the fog rolling in. It is very much a story of atmosphere, of haunting cries in the night and mysterious faces in the dark.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending, the key to the puzzle is withheld from the audience meaning we aren't allowed to \\"solve\\" the case with Watson or Holmes. This is disappointing - I enjoy mystery stories where I feel I have a chance of reading the clues properly. Also, the key instigator is quite intelligent - but the end aim of these machinations seems rather suspect. In fact, in the story Watson asks Holmes just what the apparent plan was, and Holmes himself says he doesn't quite know. Which is also a bit frustrating.<br /><br />It is rather refreshing to have a top selling book that doesn't involve sex or drugs, although there is of course violence here. There are at least two murders in the course of the story. But the focus is on the fact of the murder and the seeking of justice - not on gory details of the actual scenes.<br /><br />At only 100 or so pages, this is well recommended to anyone who enjoys a good story!ther refreshing to have a top selling book that doesn't involve sex or drugs, although there is of course violence here.

0142000655|5.0|This book was one of the most passionate books I have ever read. John Steinbeck tells a moving tale of two brothers and how their lives are changed by the people around them. Initially sounding like the biblical story of Cain and Abel, Steinbeck puts a new twist on the traditional story, compelling you to see the characters and your own life from a different perspective. It's amazing to witness your emotions and sympathies shift as the story progresses and it's thought provoking to see Steinbeck's distinction between good and evil. After you finish this book, you will find yourself going over and over the symbolism in the story, how the plots twists, and the insight into the sources of good and evil. This book ranks at the top of \\"My Most Favorite Books of All Time\\" list and will spend little time on my bookshelf as I re-read and re-read this book, gaining something new each time.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I've been a PT fan for some time. In Absentia is entrenched in my all-time Top 25. I've eagerly anticipated Deadwing.    First listen - meh.  Second listen - a bit disappointed.  Third listen - decided this was a weak effort ...     Eleventh listen - I find myself fiendishly searching for certain melodies ... rewind, fast forward, rewind ... there it is found it ... ah momentary sweet juices, I'm fixed.  Fifteenth listen - confirmed Deadwing as a weirdly strange, subtely hard and smooth, penetratingly lush and addictive masterpiece.    Glass Arm Shattering - sublime, epic, ethereal, swooping, swishing, engulfing, drowning ... swimmingly beautiful. Wawaweewow.
B0000025T6|4.0|This is my favorite Springsteen albums - heck, it's one of my favorite albums.  You'll never hear these songs on the radio - they're too good, or too depressing or too Midwest Gothic.  It starts out with a song about a guy headed for the electric chair and things pretty much go down from there. <br /> <br />The album sounds like it could have been put together during the dust bowl years when farms failed and gangsters pulled three state crime spree until stopped by John Law.  Things have not changed so very much.   <br /> <br />For a guy from the Jersey coast Springsteen evokes the openness of the Midwest pretty well.  If you like this album and want to check out some more tales of life in the middle look into James McMurtry (Where'd You Hide the Body is his best) <br />
B00070DK14|5.0|This was one of my favorites back when it came out and I still find it to be one of the better later releases.<br /><br />I got mine for the remaster and the 8 previously \\"unreleased\\" bonus tracks that have already been released before.<br /><br />How are these unreleased when I have them all??<br /><br />either way<br /><br />it is a great album and the bonus tracks just add to its luster.<br /><br />I'd put it on the level of \\"Crest Of A Knave\\" which is a huge compliment considering where they went right after this album.<br /><br />a general statement on all the recent remasters -<br /><br />I have found that the recent remasters have a good bit of high end to them. Maybe my stereo is out of touch with the new millenium standards. They obviously sound more open than the original cd releases, but the originals have that analog warmth to them that I am used to. Like I said maybe I'm out of date here.
B0002OERI0|5.0|WOW! Green Day outdid themselves with this one! I love \\"American Idiot\\" especially and the whole album is so amazing! No flaws here! Just awesomeness (yes, I know that it isn't a word)!
B0000E1ALR|4.0|I hate to recommend a 3-disc collection solely for the inclusion of one song (I actually prefer the Greatest Hits cd because it is more consistent) but \\"Trapped\\" is that good.  It's a fantastic live recording and the arrangement, dynamics and Bruce's vocals are spine-tingling.  I still wonder why \\"One step up\\" and \\"I'm on Fire\\" are left off in favor of songs that never got any airplay or MTV rotation at all but that's just my opinion.  \\"41 shots\\" is pretty darn good, as well.
B000087EY0|2.0|This DVD was a real disappointment.  It seems like it was thrown together at the last minute.  The story, and even the songs, are nothing but a montage of still pictures.  The only good thing about this DVD might have been that you can learn foreign languages from it.  The story and a couple songs in German, Italian, Castilian Spanish, and French are included.  However, even that isn't perfect.  I can speak German, and I noticed that a lot of words in the German story and songs were spelled wrong, or even in some cases, words were stuck together because someone forgot to hit the spacebar.  For a $14.00 DVD, they didn't even bother to spell-check.  Which is a real shame, because this DVD could've been a great tool to practice a foreign language.
B00005JNTV|5.0|After recently going on my film-noir craze(Roaring Twenties baby) which was brought on by Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, I was deffinalty amazed after seeing this. I saw the trailer in Scoresse's Aviator and about wept tears of joy at it. The film begins just a tiny bit slow(and Madsen's acting is HORRIBLE) but it's been about a month since I saw it and cannot stop talkking about it. After I saw it I immediality ordered two posters form it. It's film where you fall in love with a character more than the whole story behind it. Deffinalty a good flick.
B00079HZUM|5.0|I was not expecting much from this movie and was pleasantly surprised by it. At times a period drama, at times a farce, at times a romantic movie, it kept on taking me deeper and deeper into the characters and into the story. Granted the history within it might not be that accurate, but as the director of the picture says in the DVD features, historical accuracy was not what was aimed for here. The history of men in theater playing female roles just provided a perfect backdrop for exploring a vast range of emotions and feelings, digging a little into the subtlety and complexity of human nature.<br /><br />I loved both leads here and the cast in general. I was very taken aback to find out that the male lead was American as he sounded impeccable in his British accent. I was also taken aback to discover I have already seen and loved this actor in two other movies: Waking Dead and Almost Famous, two movies I also enjoyed very much, in part because of this very talented male actor. He is very versatile and radiates on screen.<br /><br />As far as the story goes, I loved how it evolved but was particularly taken by the ending: the rehearsal and final staging of the play with the male lead playing Othello was fantastic and gave me goose bumps.<br /><br />Also very mellow soothing music, nice sets, great costumes accentuating the \\"farce\\" moments of the picture and a delightful performance of Rupert Everett as the King. I wouldn't have cast him in this role, but I would have been wrong, as he is indeed quite perfect for it.<br /><br />An all round positive and moving experience.
B000069AUI|3.0|Parachutes was a fantastic album, swiftly transitioning between angst and hapiness as dark changes to light. Every song had a mellow, almost haunting undertone, and a fresh new sound was brought onto the pop scene. <br />ROBTTH takes a different approach, relying more on U2 style anthems than ultramellow ballads. The problem is though, this album just isn't solid. <br /> <br />Politik: This is definitely different than anything on the parachutes, with the pounding, angry drum beat. Coldplay shows that they have a new direction, but this song is hard to get into. 7/10 <br /> <br />In My Place: This is a good song, but the lyrics are stupid and childish at times. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />God Put a Smile on my Face: This isn't a very good song. Seems pointless and out of place. 5.5/10 <br /> <br />The Scientist: This is the strongest song on the album, and one of Coldplay's best songs. Simple yet powerful piano piece. 9/10 <br /> <br />Clocks: This is a very good song, though I don't agree with many that its their best song. Very expressive. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Daylight: Odd, dissonant song. The lyrics are somewhat ridiculous, but this song is solid. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Green Eyes: Boring and tedious, but has some bright spots. 6/10 <br /> <br />Warning Sign: Excellent song, one of the better on the album. 8/10 <br /> <br />A Whisper: This song is okay, though the album is pretty weak from here on. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />A Rush of Blood to the Head: Ditto. 6.5/10 <br /> <br />Amsterdam: This song is decent, but doesn't leave a very lasting impression. 7/10
0449227421|3.0|This was my first Kellerman read and I really liked it.  Since Genetics and the idea of cloning really interests me, this book caught my eye.  The characters were very real and it was an easy read.  Although it was not my favorite book on the subject of cloning, it was an interesting read.
068987474X|3.0|This book is great for those women who never seem to get the hint, but overall, I think it makes too many generalizations about men. The book assumes that all men are confident enough to ask or not-ask out all the women they want. The men are also bold enough to call all the shots in the relationship and the courtship phase. Being a woman, I believe this type of logic when I read it, but since reading it, I have seen more and more examples to the contrary. I have had several close male friends over the years, and they obsess about when to call a woman, when to ask her out, and all other aspects of the dating rituals. If you doubt this, there are many movies out about insecure men, written by insecure men. Granted, women are attracted to confidence, but it doesn't seem as cut and dry as Greg implies.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This album should qualify without thought or hesitation. If not, I'd have to wonder what the criteria was exactly. Great singing, great production, great songwriting, great music? If so, then this album deserves to be put at the head of the class. Mariah has chosen to save some of her most inspired work for release 15 years into her career. By the time you're done listening to the album, you'll be in awe of her vocal mastery yet again. I'm impressed because by all standards, this album stands out above so many others. This CD is the perfect example of why she's sold millions of records around the world. Mariah makes it look easy. While some of her peers struggle to put together a comprehensive record, Mariah schools the youngsters on how to do it right. Hopefully, they're all at home taking notes and studying this classic along with many of her other recordings. Perhaps, they will learn something. We can hope, can't we? No question that Mariah's voice is as crystal clear and sharp as it always has been. I would never guess her age, but the experience is obviously and is applied deftly throughout the album. I'll tell you definitively, the one-star reviewers are wrong on this one. Don't know where they came from or what their agenda is, but this is a phenomenal record. When the words timeless and classic were invented, Mariah Carey was the obvious definition. If you love Mariah and are willing to tune into a more modern version, then I wouldn't hesitate to pick this CD up. Step out of the 90's and into 2005, you won't regret it. Everything you loved about her the first time comes through even clearer and is more obvious this time around.
0596007124|5.0|Simply put, this book is amazing. Now, I've gone through my fair share of tech books on various subjects and not once has a book grabbed my attention quite like this one has. <br /> <br />This book is a very fun and easy read, yet I have never absorbed so much information from any other tech book like I did with this one. It takes learning back to the old-school. It's almost like getting in touch with your inner-child. I was reminded of how learning was back in elementary school. It sounds bad, but really it's the best way to grasp such a complex subject. The pages are riddled with elementary school-esque drawings and humor is peppered throughout this book so heavily that you can't help but turn to the next page and keep on reading. <br /> <br />Now, don't you think that this book is a complete breeze. Yes, it is an easy read, but you will still have to study this book to really absorb the information. There are some practice exercises that can seem a bit daunting at times, but once you do figure it out you will get the \\"I am THE man! (or woman)\\" feeling. You will get a rush of understanding that only the best books can provide. <br /> <br />The design of this book truly is genius. I wish there were more books like this out there. I have never learned so much - so easily. I give this book my highest recommendation EVER! yes... EVER!
B00008EY9G|4.0|Well, when i saw this film, I had not heard of it before, I just though it looked good from reading the back.  Afterwards, it left me with a strange feeling. The film was one of the best films I have ever seen.  Not in the way its directed or edited but in the plot.  The way you are presented with ten different characters in the beginning and then by the end of the fim you are left with two.  Throughout the film you see their demise, but you do not know that they are all personalities belonging to one man.  The man they belong to does not look like any one of them at all.  I thought it was a very original idea for a film and although it is supposed to be a horror film, it was an enjoyable watch as it made me think and really concenrate on the content of the film.
B000002UA9|5.0|This was the Beatles first real chart album and its full of the raw early stuff...a must for any one who wants to get to know the Beatles fab & Raw Stuff...yeh yeh
B00005B36H|5.0|I got this cd because I really liked the song \\"parabol\\" and the rest of the cd is awesome.  Tool returns to form on a cd that is a blend of the best aspects of their first two cds.  Occasionally the lyrics are a little irritating, but the songs are good and well played, and very enjoyable.  Some of the stuff near the end of the cd is a little out of focus, but still kicks butt.  A highly enjoyable piece of work, not as complicated or predictable as Aenima, but more challenging and strange than Undertow.  it is brooding, but at the same time it rocks in heavy thrash style (not FAST, but good all the same)  I definitely recommend it, especially with the awesome cover.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|<br />This is one of the best CDs I have purchased in the last 10 years.  I recently learned of Michael Buble by hearing him on a Jane Moheit track (her CD is pretty good too) and I was so impressed that I went out and purchased Buble's new CD right away.  It was surprisingly even better than I had expected.  I am looking forward to purchasing ALL of his other CDs.  In the tradition laid out by Sinatra, Dean Martin, and Harry Connick Jr, BUBLE' has cut out his place in music history and did some amazing adaptations of some classic songs.  I recommend this CD to anyone in love, anyone who wants to have a better day, to anyone who has a heart and a taste for good music.  You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />ONELUV
B000000993|5.0|Tool is very much a 90's band; they suit that style very well.  I don't think they will ever come back because Maynard is thoroughly into A Perfect Circle, but this band left behind some great music.  Unless you are a teen you probably won't like it; I think this is the kind of music most people grow out of.  Tool is very much related to prog rock with an alternative edge, and they have strange philosophies and embrace songs that deal with sort of complicated and occasionally ridiculous ideas.  They are all good players, maynard is a famous singer, and the band is just unusual and rocks.  this is a good cd to start with if you are just starting to listen to their music; if you like this cd, get all the others.  The other cd's are stranger, but well worth it.
B0000CAXIC|3.0|the songs that made it to MTV and the radio for once really are better than the album cuts. \\"Everlong\\" is powerful, probably one of the best alternative rock songs ever and it's really sexy (\\"gotta promise not to stop when I say 'when' . . .\\"). \\"My Hero\\" is really cool and, to a lesser extent, so is \\"Monkey Wrench.\\" The rest of the album doesn't turn me on much. Usually bands I like have album cuts even better than the radio hits, but that's unfortunately not the case here. Sorry die-hards, but that's my honest opinion.
B00000GAIW|5.0|if you have an inkling to get into prog rock or more thoughtful, complicated music, you need to check out Aqualung.  Its an intense, slightly creepy, and very well arranged album that deviates from more popular rock songs in that it has flute solos (and they are good, too!)  An awesome band, and this is their best album.  If you like this get their other cd's, like THick as a Brick, which is just as solid as this album.  This album is highly regarded in many critical circles and is a classic album.  It is a very enjoyable listen.
B000000WHX|5.0|This is very cool, laid back groove soul/occasional dub raggae with sweet singing, smooth rapping, some killer bass lines and samples. Unfortunately they go in for some typically meat-headed rap brags in a few places (\\"My AK rig goes boom boom!\\") but no matter. Personally, I love Massive's MEZZANINE and the early solo albums \\"Tricky Kid\\" went on to make much more. MEZZANINE is thicker, darker and more sensuous and I think the songs are even better overall. I just LOVE that \\"trip-hop\\" style and it's much deeper on MEZZANINE. It's deeper, baby! Apparently, a lot of people on this forum have a problem with this particular point of view. Screw 'em!
B00000099Y|5.0|mellow in places, rocks out in places.  BUt what this cd is is always strange and unpredictable.  It is quite likely that you will never hear a weirder or more truly disturbing cd than Tool's Aenima.  This is the least straightforward cd ever made in the popular music scene (I can't speak for college radio or underground) and it is incomprehensible at times, boring at times, and thrilling at times.  There are a good number of tracks that have a strange sound that really hurts your ears as it builds, then it goes into a normal song.  Many songs are haunting and depressing.  However, if you expect something like the Cure's Disintigration or something, you are in for a major surprise.  I would suggest you get Undertow before this cd, its much more accessible.  but do check this music out; it is quite disturbing and frankly, too stale in bits for most people.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I agree with the 1200+ fans of the show who reviewed DVD's here. Fox had a gem and like most TV execs, they play to the droll masses who think The Bachelor is riveting TV. I can only hope that the movie will either make them think twice about future TV episodes or at least continuing the story in the cinema.<br /><br />But what I wanted to make you all aware of with this DVD... the COMMENTARY! I watched the entire series (incl. the 3 never-shown episodes (woohoo)) and then the extra stuff... and I was so sad that it was over, I turned on the director's commentary track and watched them all again. I loved hearing the tiny little nuances that I noticed were deliberate... Or that the cast really did love it and CHERISHED the time they had on the set because that does come thru on the show.... Or that the ship was built in its entirety so that you could literally walk thru it as if it was real... or that the lighting and set designers were just as immersed in the unique vision of Joss Whedon... and all the funny little asides that happen on set. I really enjoyed the perspectives of the actors and director.<br /><br />Watch the whole set thru, then turn on the commentary. At the very least, you get to see the shows again... like you need an excuse... LOL
B000009RC2|5.0|I had never payed much attention to fusion jazz, but when I gave this cd a listen I realized that I should check this kind of stuff out much more.  It is intense and powerfully arranged, and is one of the few cd's I have that starts out strong and IMPROVES over time.  Its an exciting cd of instrumental rock, with a bit of a jazz edge (though I would say this is more firmly rooted in rock).  The guitar and the music in general is exciting and unusual, a major trademark of Mclaughlin and his orchestra.   If you are at all curious, do not hesitate to check this cd out.  Its a thrilling piece of work (though the unusual spiritual type messages this band is known for are a little over the top, they don't drag down the music at all, simply because there is no singing).
0790729652|4.0|Nicholson was good as the Joker (real name: Jack Napier). I love when he moves slickly around to do his killing. However, he truly lacked the incredible, maniacal laugh of Cesar Romero's tv Joker. The film is serious but not to the point where it still isn't somewhat fun. Tracey Walter (who often plays heavies in rather small film parts) is on hand as the Joker's main thug, a very underrated touch.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I would like to say that I like this movie but I hate it. When I paid to see this movie I thought it would be Dracula in the year 2000 or something but I was blown away at how different it turned out to be. it appears that you no longer need a stake to kill a vampire or the fact that they can see themselves in mirrors (bedroom looking at laptop scene). Dont they hide in the shadows trying to seduce women for bloodsucking anymore?<br /><br />  But on the other hand this movie did have some good wholesome action in it that I can enjoy the special effects are pretty cool to. if you like action and a forrbiden love story in between this is the movie for you.<br /><br />  But overall if you are the hardcore old style vampire fan (like myself) then this flick is deadweight to your movie collection
B00004VVNB|4.0|As other reviewers have written, Logan's Run and it's (at the time) award winning special effects was quickly eclipsed by Star Wars.<br /><br />Never the less, it is a decent and enjoyable Sci-fi flick.  If you can get past the camp look and feel of the fashion, you will enjoy the story.<br /><br />Other reviewers have summed up the plot nicely, and they have also made the comparisons to Nolan's novel.  So I will try to point out some of the interesting tid-bits in the commentaries:<br /><br />John Voight was first considered for the part of Logan.<br /><br />Lindsay Wagner was originally considered for the part of Jessica.<br /><br />William Devane was originally considered for the part of Francis.<br /><br />A retired James Cagney was considered for the part of the old man - later played by Peter Ustinoff.
B00004RF83|5.0|Sometimes the old movies pack more of a punch than todays movies. Seven Days in May is one such movie. It is a tense intellegnt thriller about a fictional attempted coup in the US. The script was written by Rod Serling and it crackles with witty lines. The plot is full of twists while maintaining an \\"edge of your seat\\" pace and all the while  the movie comes across as a quite believable scenario. Some of the performances are magnificent and it is a movie you will enjoy seeing over and over. <br />
B0000A118M|5.0|After hearing so many people and musicians that I respected rave about this record, I bought A LOVE SUPREME many years ago as my first jazz purchase.  At once, I could not have made a more daunting, or rewarding first step.  Coltrane's masterpiece is not an easy one to digest, especially for a novice, but I hung in there and ultimatly picked up on the tidal wave of emotion that pours out of Coltrane;s horn, as well as Elvin Jone's drumkit, Jimmy Garrison's bass and McCoy Tyner's piano.  His exploration of  personal faith may seem to be a very private exercise, but obviously has struck a universal chord.  This certainly set the bar high for future explorations, but also prepared me to enjoy many other of Coltrane's works as well as recordings by Miles Davis, Charles Mingus, Duke Ellington, Thelonious Monk and other past and present masters.
1567184855|5.0|I had specific beliefs about reincarnation before I read this book but there were missing pieces to the puzzle.  This book astonished me in that all my beliefs were brought together and the jigsaw was complete.  I am still amazed years later and re-read this book often.  I have given it as a gift many times to people who I thought were ready for a life-changing, mind-blowing, unforgettable once in a lifetime experience.  I can honestly say this is the most influential book I have ever read. It changed my life.
B00006IR5S|5.0|Easily one of John Williams's best film franchises, he continues his Harry Potter repertoire in the score from the second film. It's obvious Williams knows exactly what he's doing when writing for sequels, it swells and decrescendos at all the right spots, stays interesting and enchanting, and contains some of the most haunting and stunning score pieces in recent film history. The Chamber of Secrets track is dramatic and intense, illustrating the themes presented in the film's climax, Dobby the House Elf is a brilliant piece of musical complexity, and Fawkes the Phoenix is perhaps the most stunningly beautiful piece in the entire Harry Potter score saga. If you haven't already, purchase this CD. It's a brilliant addition to any Harry Potter or John Williams fan. You will not be disappointed.
B0007TKH66|3.0|Firstly, I can say I enjoyed this first season but I quickly lost interest. Why? I'll admit it, Captain Archer just didn't work for me. His character was just so ill at ease and generally stiff it never really won me over. Characters I LOVED though were Trip Tucker and Dr. Phlox, they just had a warmness and geniune feel, they seemed real. Most of the other characters didn't work for me, T'pal was hit and miss, though she had some bright spots.    I would like to see the other Seasons to see how much the show improved like many here say but when the STAR of the show puts you off somewhat, I have a feeling I'll never fully love this series, even though I do respect it and feel it was a decent look at Star Trek.    Lastly, I can say this price point is ridiculous. The original series is justified because it's almost like my religion plus older television just has more replay value for some reason, not so with this. I *might* pay 50, but not 100, no way. Why are Starsky and Hutch $45 with the same run time? Why is my Millennium sets also about $45 with similar minutes and Enterprise is double the price?? Go ahead, I'm listening.
B00005OWIU|5.0|John Williams, easily one of today's top scorewriters, continues to impress with his work on the Harry Potter franchise. The score to the first film is incredible from start to finish, and shows he knows just what he's doing when scoring a film. From the frantic intensity of the regimental drums during The Chess Game to the soaring melodies of Harry's Wondrous World, this soundtrack captures the magic and feel of not only the film it belongs with, but the book it was inspired by. This is easily some of Williams's best work to date, and Hedwig's Theme will linger as one of the most memorable film themes of all time.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|The only song that is good on this album is Stream of COnsciousness- and coincidence- no Labrie singing? LOW POINT OF DT's career- Petrucci's worst- least innovative solos- just 32nd notes up and down, up and down- BLAH!!!! 1 good song- ST just looking to make a quick buck here- IF YOUR NEW TO DT- BUY IMAGES IN WORDS- OR SCENES FORM A MEMORY! NOT THIS!
B00020HEG6|5.0|John Williams saved the day when he signed on to add to his presigious repertoire and score the incredibly popular Harry Potter films thus far. The first two soundtracks captured exactly what the story required, the exact charm, magic and mischeif drawn from J.K. Rowling's brilliant books, from dark and ominous to light and enchanting, and the third time around is no exception. Williams seems to have expanded his Harry Potter style a little, adding some Tchaikovsky-esque brilliance with Aunt Marge's Waltz and some frantic jazziness with The Knight Bus, all of which prove to be welcome changes and additions as Harry Potter's story becomes ever more complicated and teenage angst begins to take hold. Still, the true magic of Harry Potter remains, as it starts with the timeless and enduring theme at the outset, and continues to add themes throughout, notably the cousin to Hedwig's Theme, Double Trouble, sung by the Hogwarts Choir and their toads...  Timpanis exclamatorily announce the arrival of one of the film's most incredible themes, Buckbeak's Flight, and Window to the Past is one of Williams's most poignant and moving pieces to date; it almost seems Lily and James Potter finally have a theme. Also, in Harry's third year, Quidditch has become increasingly more intense, and appropriately Williams has responded superbly, while The Patronus Light is an ethereal piece of choral and orchestral work. Saving Buckbeak and Forward to Time Past expertly weave execution dirge beats and ticking clocks to truly tell the story the film so excellently weaves, while Mischief Managed is an extended medley of several of the film's themes that run over the credits. Here's hoping that Williams will continue to add his genius to the rest of the Harry Potter franchise.

He and his partner have been asked to help in the apprehension of an escaped patient, seemingly escaped out of thin air.  They are met with lukewarm assistance, and Teddy may have other motives for being there.<br /><br />Dennis Lehane keeps you guessing with multiple plot twists in a novel that had me saying \\"no way\\" until the end.  This was the first book Ive read by Lehane and it far exceeded my expectations. So much so, that I will be reading the rest of this authors work quite soon.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is the Best album I have ever heard.Every single song on this CD is Great. This CD is truly a classic if you dont own it you need to buy it right now. It consists of classic songs like \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\". This is a must own album.
B0008ISM40|4.0|Nine Inch Nails is one of those bands I listened to in my teens that I can't really get into anymore, save for those odd moments when I'm in the mood for the Downward Spiral.  I conferred with friends that were into NIN as much as I was and found that we all pretty much reached the consensus that we were bored with NIN. <br /> <br />The first time I listened to this album, I'd have to say that I was bored, still.  But, then I noticed I really felt like listening to it again, and again, and I must say now that it's a decent album.  Nothing amazing, but it smacks of being more stoic (if you could call an album that) than its predecessors. <br /> <br />It doesn't try to be anything extravagant or over the top in the slightest, and I have to say the only track that I skip over is the title track. <br /> <br />Highlights include 'Only', 'Getting Smaller', and 'the Collector'. <br /> <br />As mentioned by other reviewers, it retains a Pretty Hate Machine feel, especially when you consider the lyric-spinning of 'Down in it' in 'Only'.  That song itself is a very strong track in that it almost has a playful take on NIN's woe-is-me attitude.  Not only that, but a great sing-along if you like to karaoke with odd vocal rhythms. <br /> <br />All in all, not a pretentious album in the least, and I say this as someone expecting a miserable failure of an album.
B000002UA9|5.0|The beatles recorded ten songs on thier debut album in just Twelve hours! For productivity, this is one of the best rock albums of its time. All filled with classic songs. Of course, it's not as good as Post-Rubber Soul Beatles, but this was thier \\"She Loves you, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah\\" Period. Essential.
B00000JCOV|5.0|Despite what everyone else has been saying in their reviews for this album, for those of us who like GOOD MUSIC, regardless of what it's classified as, this album is a must have. Their sound is unique in a way that is undescribable, and isn't so over-the-top heavy that you have to shut it off after a few songs to avoid a headache. It seems that most of the people who write reviews about this album are under 15 years of age, we need to get more fans to review this finely artistic piece of work that is Slipknot. Get the album, it will be well worth it for years and years to come.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith's Debut album was a statement of faith in the power of rock & roll. Horses made Patti the Queen of Punk Music. this is a great classic album.
B000063147|1.0|Im a huge a7x fan but this album is pure crap. waking the fallen is a much better album.i just cant find a song i like on this album and its like cancer to the ears. dont listen to the a7x fanboys that post there reviews here. if you wanna listen to something good listen to waking the fallen or there new cd, but stay away from this piece of crap it gives a7x a bad name.
B000001DTM|5.0|While not their Absolute best album, this album is a classic still and one of the best records of the 90s. It contains one of the best Rock songs of all time \\"One\\" Which is one of U2's Masterpieces.
B00074CBMY|5.0|Every couple of months I treat myself to about a half-dozen or so CDs.  I bought this one in my last batch, the only problem with is I played it first and I can't get past it.  It's been on continuous rotation, especially the second song \\"I (Who Have Nothing).\\"  I never particularly cared for this song, it's too schlocky for the tastes of a screaming electric blues fan.  But Mr. Cocker takes this song, bounces it off of his adenoids, and zeros it straight into my Heart and Soul.  I equate Joe's voice to life itself.  If you've managed to get the remnants of your s**t together, life is rough but beautiful, appealing but hard to describe, in tune but not for the faint of heart, soul finding after a long hard search, and blue to the brink of tears while you thrust your fist in the air and shout \\"Yeah, gimme more.\\"  Great job Joe, nice to see that us middle-aged old farts can still get down.  Maybe someday I'll have my fill of this album and get around to listening to my other new CDs.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is easiely one of the top 5 debut albums ever made, and it's surly the biggest selling debut album of the 80s. Songs like \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" are timeless songs in the rock cannon. Definitly Recomended for Hard rock fans.

B00004SZWD|5.0|This is one of the best Double albums in history, so many musical styles, funk, Jazz, Balladry. Recomended for everyone.
B00005NGZX|5.0|If youre not familiar with the more modern approach to hardcore, this album could easily disguise itself as noise and screaming.  But give it more than one listen and i promise you will immediately begin to appreciate the intricacies within this album.  Jacob has perhaps the greatest scream in the history of great screams.  And the drumwork is amongst the greatest ever.   <br /> <br />How a band can change tempos on a dime the way they do blows my mind.  The lead in from track 6 to track 7 is the most intense musical moment ever recorded.  I got to see Converge open up for Hatebreed and it was perhaps my most favorite and memorable show ive ever seen.  Hatebreed sounded like a bunch of girls in comparison.  Seeing these guys live truly made me appreciate how talented they are.  They are incredibly animated too, as I was almost hit in the head a couple of times with the bass stock. <br /> <br />Anyway, i own over 600 records from johnny cash, to slayer, to radiohead, to marvin gaye, and this record truly is amongst the greatest.
B0000A118M|5.0|This album kept Jazz alive. Coltrane soars with nothing but happiness, gratitude and Joy and you can't help but be stunned by this musical masterpiece.
0312995423|3.0|Digital Fortress, by Dan Brown was a fairly good book.  The book trys to keep you guessing as to whom the real culprit behind the outrageous scheem is.  Key word would be TRYING.  The book's \\"bad guy\\" was blatantly obvious throughout the story. <br /> <br />This book could have easily been at the top of it's game, had it's plot been more realistic, the characters given more development.  Most of the plot is based on sheer coincidences. Too many coincidences to make it at all believeable.  Albeit, the time line was a bit off the wall.  An obsurd number of things -that if normal people were to do, would take several days- happened in one long, very drawn out day. <br /> <br />Even though, this story drags it's feet and screams out the name of the real foe, it intices you to keep reading 'til the end, just to see if your right.
B000002I25|4.0|This is a great debut, one of the best debuts in the 60s. This is not thier best however. They would go on to produce more impressive albums but this was a fine introduction.
B000063DGC|5.0|This album is undoubtedly the best \\"tribute\\" album ever, and maybe even the best live album. Randy Rhoads was one of the greatest guitar players ever, and if you want proof of that, listen to this album, especially \\"Suicide Solution\\". This was the last album to feature him, as he was killed in a plane crash in 1982. No horrible tribute songs here, just a great live performance from the great guitarist himself (of course with Ozzy and the rest of the band). This is 5 stars, no question.
B0000669JL|5.0|This album shows the genius of Bob Marley. This album sold in million and showed the world the universal soul he brought to Jamaican rhythm and Spirituality. A classic.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I don't hand out five-star ratings lightly, and for a documentary to boot! Yes, this film won an Oscar for documentaries, but awards don't mean as much to me as they once did. In fact, I watched this film in a bit of a vacuum, before learning of its award-winning status. And it was simply a compelling narrative on multiple levels. <br /> <br />Robert McNamara came into the public eye as one of, if not the youngest assistant professors at Harvard and played an integral part in the intelligence leading to America's fire-bombing of Tokyo in World War II. After the war, he became the first non-Ford family member to become president of the automobile giant, only to be snatched up almost immediately by JFK to serve as his Secretary of Defense. That position put him in the inner sanctum for America's cold war era, through the Vietnam war. <br /> <br />This documentary is essentially an extended interview with the 85-year-old McNamara, intercut with film clips and taped conversations from the news stories ranging across his career. One would expect McNamara to use the platform as a justification for his positions and actions throughout the last six decades, but in fact, he's alarmingly candid about his errors in judgment and where he believes America's foreign policy (then and now) has been flawed. The film is arranged around Eleven Lessons that McNamara has gleaned from his experiences. <br /> <br />I'm not a big documentary fan, and my history background isn't extensive enough to make cohesive judgments on his interpretations of events, but the simple wealth of memories McNamara includes in the interviews and his wonderful articulation of the back stories makes this film one not to be missed. It's a brilliantly compiled and compelling narrative.
B000058983|5.0|This masterpiece gets my vote for most overlooked masterpiece released in popular music. Love's third record is his crowning achievment and one of the best rock albums of the 60s.
B0002IVN9W|3.0|With the raves this album has received, it seemed like a 'no miss' purchase. What grabs so many reviewers is totally lost on me. The drum machine-sounding rhythm is endless while artsy vocals quiver throughout songs that ultimately became repetitive. It wasn't the 'no brainer' acquisition that I read it into being. Its worth doing a little more research on this one if you're sitting on the fence.
B000002UAC|3.0|I know Many of you wil say, 3 stars? Dont get me wrong, this is a great early album, but there are too many covers, it would've been nice for Lennon and McCartney to write all originals instead or re-writing other artists songs. A good early album but nothing to gloat about.
B0006GQMC8|4.0|The movie DEATH HUNT turns history on its head, but in doing so it manages to deliver an entertaining movie that details the determination of two men in a manhunt across the Canadian tundra.<br />Directed by James Bond veteran Peter Hunt, who after working as an editor on the first few 007 pictures was promoted to director of the fan favorite ON HER MAJESTY'S SECRET SERVICE and went on to direct such classics as GOLD and SHOUT AT THE DEVIL.<br />The movie DEATH HUNT provides Hunt the opportunity to reteam with his SHOUT AT THE DEVIL star Lee Marvin. Marvin plays a world-weary Canadian Mountie who is obligated (I use that word because Marvin's character seems to feel some sympathy for his quarry) to bring in a trapper (played by a quiet brooding Charles Bronsan) who is being harassed by some local thugs.<br />The execution of this story is excellent, the acting first-rate and the shots of the Yukon breathtaking. Where this movie does falter is in purporting to tell history by tying in the story of the Mad Trapper of Rat River into the fabric of the story - and in doing so unraveling all the history books tell us about the real incident.<br />Just type in `Mad Trapper of Rat River\\" on an Internet search engine to learn all you want to know about the 1931 incident, but everything we know about the real incident tells us that Albert Johnson was the guilty party. But here Johnson is portrayed as an innocent man whose pursuers use the charge of his being the mad trapper as an excuse to mobolize the law enforcement resources of the Yukon to catch him.<br />Given that nobody to this day really knows the identity of Johnson, the filmmakers invent a rather fanciful past for him. The character Marvin plays - Millen - was also shot and killed by Johnson in a shootout midway through the chase, but in the movie DEATH HUNT Marvin's character is in the chase to the very end.<br />Still, taken as a piece of fiction the movie DEATH HUNT is resounding stuff. I saw it on television some years ago and was hoping it would one day be released on DVD. Hunt is an expert at building suspense and a master at drama - and DEATH HUNT have both those elements in plentiful supply.<br />In addition to Marvin and Bronsan the movie also features an impressive supporting cast with young heartthrob of the late 1970s/1980s Andrew Stevens as a young, eager Mountie and Carl Weathers (of Apollo Creed in the Rocky movies fame) as another weary Mountie. Add to the mix Ed Lauter and Angie Dickinsoin and the pedigree of this feature is obvious.<br />So, the overall verdict? This is an entertaining action adventure with plenty of suspense and drama. Just don't expect an accurate history lesson.<br />Sadly this is a largely bare-bones DVD release with only the theatrical trailer and a print of the original poster to complement it.s hoping it would one day be released on DVD.

B0002OERI0|5.0|When I first heard of the return of Green Day for the first time since International Superhits, and the first real album since Dookie,I was amazed. This CD comes with instant hits like Boulevard of Broken Dreams[Top 10 on MTV's TRL and ITunes, Holiday[Top 10 on MTV's TRL AND Itunes, and my personal favorite, Jesus of Suburbia. The CD is packed with great songs. I also have to stop a few rumors about the present Green Day. First off, people say that Green Day is in it\\"just for the money\\" now. They're not. First of all this album is Green Day telling the public about our government. They're strongly against Bush and that is the theme in American Idiot[notice the title]. And also if you've seen a Green Day concert[as have I] you'll notice that they really love what they do. And if your town gets involved with the tour, I strongly recommend seeing it. But anyway, other rumors say that Green Day isn't as good as the \\"old\\" Green Day. Yea if you want to compare American Idiot to International Superhits! you could say that. Obviousely superhits is the greatist hits of their first 10 albums while American Idiot is just a new album! And believe me it even matches up to Superhits. If your a Punk, Alternative, or just a Rock fan, this is a must have. Green Day is the modern band of our time.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|It seems like every couple of months there's a new film hyped as an epic--but they rarely live up to the billing. Such is the case with \\"Troy,\\" which is based on Homer's story \\"The Illiad.\\"<br />Most incarnations of this story have been devoted to the love affair between Trojan Prince Paris (Orlando Bloom, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\") and Spartan Queen Helen (Diana Kruger, \\"Michael Valiant\\"), which sparked the decade-long war between the Trojans and Greeks. But screenwriter David Benioff (\\"The 25th Hour\\") focuses this saga on the warrior Achilles (Brad Pitt, \\"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind\\").<br />Casting Pitt in the role of Achilles seemed odd for a number of reasons, not the least of which is Pitt's boy-next-door looks. He could have just as easily been cast as Trojan general Hector--played magnificently by Eric Bana (\\"Hulk\\")--as in the role of the brooding, glory-hunting Achilles.<br />Maybe Warner Bros. figured the best way to attract women to a film that has enough bloodshed to make Quentin Tarantino jealous would be to cast Pitt parading around barely clothed. (I've seen so much of Brad Pitt now that I felt like I should apologize to his (then) wife, Jennifer Aniston.)<br />But Pitt is an incredible actor and he easily pulls off making Achilles a multidimensional character.<br />Some noticeable changes were made to Homer's version of the story, such as who killed whom and at what point in the story, but the dramatic intensity of the film greatly benefits from these changes.<br />The opening battle scene with the Greeks storming the Trojan beach seemed like a swords and spears version of Stephen Spielberg's opening to \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" while other battle scenes recalled Mel Gibson's \\"Braveheart.\\"<br />Unlike those war-theme epics, however, director Wolfgang Petersen (\\"The Perfect Storm\\") had the luxury of a main event battle that would make boxing promoter Don King envious, with Achilles squaring off against Hector.<br />Other principal characters of \\"The Illiad\\" are peripheral faces in Petersen's \\"Troy\\" as he builds to this clash of titans.

B00006FDCJ|5.0|This is Eastwood's best film, a purely adult western epic. It is a gritty portrayal of the real west of the 1880's. Eastwood plays an aging reformed notoriously violent and alcoholic outlaw who has reformed due to the love and care of a \\"good woman\\" who has long since died. Widowed with children and down on his luck, Eastwood is tempted to ride again one more time for a money stake to help his family escape his failing economic situation. The story intially takes place in a fledging frontier twon called Big Whiskey, Wyoming. The film starts abruptly and violently as a cowboy defaces a prostitute, termed \\"whore\\". He and his less guilty and innocent partner are pardoned by sheriff \\"Litle Bill\\" who, in ironic contrast to once bad guy Eastwood, has a violent, spontaneous sadistic temper. The whores are taken back by the injustice and they place a bounty on the heads of the cowboys and that sets the stage for Eastwood's rentry into one last violent run with the aide of his longtime and also reformed colleague played by Morgan freeman. The two reformers killed and robbed many years ago and are rusty mechanical and with the business of committing violence that is slowly evident. Sparking Eastwood back to this mission is the young punk nephew, played by very well by Jaimz Woolvett, of an old friend who seeks out the legendary killer William Muney (Eastwood) to assist in killing the cowboys and collecting the bounty. And there is the seeds of your story, a reformed rusty old gunman with his veteran partner catching up to a young hot headed kid headed for a collision with Sheriff Little Bill (Gene Hackman). The ironic twist is that good guy Hackman can break into an abusive violent rage that Eastwood gave up in his past along with, perhaps the fuel that opened him to violence, alcohol.<br /><br />The other irony is the introduction of a writer who folows, with limited loyalty, one legendary western folk heroe after another, writing stories that he later finds could be contrived or gross exagerations, which the writer even allows may be exagerated even when the real truth is known. Like many a true alcoholic, Eastwood can barely remember his past (reformed alcoholic comic actor Sid Ceasar wrote in his biography that he suffered blackout and couldn't remember his own best skits) but everyone else can as his past ; however incredible, was fact not fiction. This film is a sensitive portrayal of the wst and two different men, Eastwood and Hackman, ironically trying to live peaceful lives that collide violently due to circumstances. This is not an action film, although there is plenty at the end, but an adult look at life and death where killing is not easy, simple and without remorse and people simply don't die suddenly and disappear like in a Rambo movie.<br /><br />The climax builds into over the last 30 minutes and the action suddenly accelerates as Eastwood is forced to take on a vengeance role, transforming to his past, as he contemplates his direct confrantation with Hackman, two men now with the equal potential for extraordinary violence. Some people miss the point of this film, thus it is worth watching at least twice. Individuals don't always react heroically to confrontation, as Hackman's Little Bill character points out during the early part of the film, and when confronted with a truely violent and notorious outlaw, you will see different reactions unfold, that although a movie, they are not too surprising.<br /><br />The dialogue is vintage Eastwood, a lot said in a few words, and those lines are memorable such as when the kids says \\"I guess he had it coming\\", Eastwood responds, \\"We all have it coming kid\\".<br /><br />Richard Harris is also excellent as \\"English Bob\\" and his encounter with Hackman early in the film helps reveal the true character of Little Bill, his good and efficient side and the uncontrollable temper that can erupt.<br /><br />The DVD has wide screen and regular TV viewing.gross exagerations, which the writer even allows may be exagerated even when the real truth is known.

B00005JN0T|4.0|Your first and only command is this:  see \\"I, Robot.\\" That is all.<br /><br />Will Smith (\\"Bad Boys II\\") stars in the role of a lifetime as Detective Spooner, an experienced homicide detective investigating the apparent suicide of Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell of HBO's \\"Six Feet Under\\"). Lanning's suicide is all the more disturbing since he was on the brink of integrating a more advanced form of robot, the NS5, into the modern world for the company CRS (the Microsoft of robots).<br /><br />CRS owner Lawrence Robertson (Bruce Greenwood, \\"Hollywood Homicide\\") doesn't want Lanning's death messing up his company's biggest payday, so he is leery of Spooner snooping around and spoiling his big moment.<br /><br />Spooner doesn't share the general populace's good will toward robots--which have taken on menial roles such as trash men, deliverymen and dog walkers--and likens them to ticking time bombs. Forming a loose alliance with Dr. Susan Calvin (Bridget Moynahan, \\"The Recruit\\"), Spooner becomes convinced that Lanning's death was the handiwork of an evolved robot, Sonny (voice by Alan Tudyk, \\"Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story\\").<br /><br />\\"I, Robot\\" is less an all-out action film as it is a mystery with some riveting action scenes tossed in from time to time to get across how pivotal the stakes are for Spooner.<br /><br />Smith is excellent as he fully establishes a unique character, doing it so naturally that he never appears to be acting.<br /><br />Recent films based on the short stories of sci-fi writers Philip K. Dick and Isaac Asimov have ranged from pretty good (\\"Minority Report\\") to \\"it was a better concept than movie\\" (\\"Imposter\\"). \\"I, Robot,\\" based on some of Asimov's short stories but changed for a high-energy summer audience, is the type of sci-fi thriller film that Ben Affleck, John Woo and Uma Thurman were attempting with last year's box-office bomb, \\"Paycheck,\\" based on a Dick novel.<br /><br />\\"I, Robot\\" is the genre's most cinematic edge-of-your seat thrill ride thanks to the sharp screenplay by Akiva Goldsman (\\"A Beautiful Mind\\") and Jeff Vintar (\\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within\\").

B000002UAU|5.0|Okay, so it isn't The Greatest Album Of All Time. But it was the first to be decreed as such and hath been declared thus by an awful lot of peopleth.  And they've probably been around a hell of a lot longer than you, so start paying attentioneth.
B00005JKO9|5.0|This is one of the best films that I have ever seen.  It shows you how much we owe to the people of the past who gave their hearts, souls and lives to help create a level of peace, freedom and prosperity for all of us. I hope this film will inspire us to follow this tradition. <br /> <br />I will have to heartily disagree with Albert Lee.  Although he is helpful in the sense that whatever he rates a film you can be sure the exact opposite is true.  As you can see he has given this film only one star. High praise indeed.  <br />
B000001Y16|5.0|I stopped listening to hip-hop in the late early 90s except for a few acts like PE, NWA, ATCQ and other more college fare. I never gave 2pac a chance. I always thought he was a pretty boy acting like a gangster. I started listening to hip-hop again recently and all signs pointed to Biggie, Nas, Eminem, Jay-Z and 2pac. By far, I think 2pac is the greatest artist hip-hop as produced so far. He doesn't have the best flow, that crown undeniably goes to B-i-g P-o-p-p-a, he's not the best lyricist, I give that one to either Eminem or Nas, he's not slickest, Jay-z is the hustla, but DAMN this guy has some serious heart. <br /> <br />2pac not only paints vivid pictures, he pours out his soul, he creates from his gut and like all great art its beautiful, terrifying and defies category. His art transcends the genre of hip-hop and becomes something to listen to with awe. What a brave man to share so much to the world. To share not only his intellect and courage, but also the vileness and tragedy that is the human condition. Looking around at pop culture and politics these days with its plasticity its no wonder there was no place for a man, no a soldier, who was never fake at the cost of being attacked from all corners of this sometimes hypocritical country. This guy had some major balls. In the pantheon of great songwriters in the 20th century he's up there with Bob Dylan and Lou Reed. <br /> <br />Again other rappers might be better than him at certain technical aspects of rapping but 2pac's overall vision in the genre just puts him on whole other level. Rappers might be gangsta or fun storytellers or have incredible flow or great lyricist but 2pac  takes all those things and distills them into a personal vision of the world that is not only astute but holds its own against other great social thinkers of our time. His ability to make things so personal makes most of his songs universal. <br /> <br />Listen to 'Krazy'. Wow. A masterpiece. I've been listening to this song for months. It is amazing.
0446677450|4.0|I think this book is a great guide, it makes you think, it makes you aspire.  An yes maybe all of us are not destined to get rich but there are some of us that are and this book gives you an insight of how to get there.  I have been an employee all my adult life and have changes jobs several time, each time with a nice salary increase and yes each time paying more and more taxes, I am considered the middle class, hard working, good employee, educated to the max, but in reality if we continue to live that way we will never accomplish much we will still sit and admire the Trump's of the world and wonder how they got where they are.  This book gives a look into that world and that it is possible to get there or at lease give you kids a fighting chance to get there instead of doing what we all do, work for the shareholders of the company we work for and in the end what do we get in return, some of us gets laid off, some loose their retirement and more.  This book is simply lending a hand on how to think for ourselves and take care of what we have and not just go from employer to employer trying to achieve wealth because it will not likely happen.  Now many of you keep stressing of Robert saying to forget a good education, it is really sad if that is all you take away from this book.  If my memory serves me he did say that he had no issues with education, what he had issues with is what they prepare us for, to get a \\"GOOD JOB\\".  This book is a must read and it is not a manual or a get rich scheme it is merely a guide to awaken ones mind.
B000002UA2|5.0|I've been listening to Floyd for about 20 years and this is by far, my favorite of all their albums.  If you have not heard this album, you do not know Pink Floyd well.  DSoTM and The Wall are both great albums, but this album is a personal album that hits home.  The album has excellent flow, which means you can listen to it from beginning to end every time.  The music is so rich that even though you haven't seen the movie, a movie of your own experiences will conjure in your mind.  I've seen the movie and it isn't so great. The scenery is nice, but this sound track is something else.  Some of the songs have a lot of energy in them though they aren't hard or fast.  Others are dreamy and mellow.  There's a good mix of up and down that balances itself out in the end.
B000002J29|5.0|UNBELIEVABLE...SHOULD BE IN EVERY SERIOUS MUSIC FAN'S COLLECTION. THEY IMPROVE ON ALL THEIR SONGS. I HAVE TWO FINAL WORDS TO SAY...SUPPER'S READY!!!!!!!!
B0002UXBD6|5.0|American Idiot is a wonderful CD, especially Holiday, Wake Me Up When Septermber Ends, and She's a Rebel.  But the band live is even better. <br /> <br />However, unlike Keller said, Green Day is not British.  They are from California, which makes them American.  Good Riddance (Time of Your Life) is not the only hit (besides the ones on Idiot) that got air-play.  There is also an album between Nimrod (which Good Riddance is on) and American Idiot.  Next time you review, make sure you have the information correct.
0783814372|5.0|I'd been reading this book over the course of 2 weeks and when it suddenly just abrubtly ended I as almost shocked. The entire book I'd known exactly what would happen to her but it was still horrible. Reading this I discovered exactly what Anne was really like. Over the course of her two years in hiding Anne matures from a spoiled superficial girl to a philosophical one who really thinks about things.<br /><br />The humdrum and sometimes amusing or terrifying activities and experiences of the people living in the \\"Secret Annex\\" became very familiar to me and having all those people who I'd grown so used to brutally killed off, with their deaths described in 2 pages was quite horrifying.<br /><br />Anne Frank was very headstrong and opinionated. I'm sure if she had lived she could have been the excellent writer that she always aspired to be. This book was incredibly moving and really made it clearer than ever how disgustingly pointless and horrible the Holocaust really was.<br /><br />This is probably one of the most truthful books I will ever read and I highly recommend it.
B000002H97|5.0|We were so use to thrash and then BAM suddenly Metallica makes this. Wow. This is far more perfectionized then MOP,RTL,KEA,AJFA. NO this is different. There is no flaw in this album. In my view, if it wasnt for this album Metallica wouldnt be were they are today.  <br /> <br />Along with St.Anger, The black Album is highly underrated. This album will go of to be remembered as one of the best in Rock history. <br /> <br />Enter Sandman, Sad but true, THe unforgiven, wherever i may roam, nothing else matters, Of wolf and Man, Dont thread on Me are the high points of the album. Metallica is the best band today, yesterday, and tommorrow.
0609610570|4.0|From the beginner to the seasoned CEO, this book gives insight necessary to step up your game. There is a thin line between micro-managing and absolute execution. Bossidy and Charan help to make that line a little more clear. Delegating and following up has never been more clearly defined in respect to task completion on any level. This book serves as a guide to developing people in a culture of execution. I would have liked to have seen more information on the RIGHT things to do in situations where Bossidy and Charan pointed out what made a CEO not be successful. It could have become even more of a HOW TO book. It serves its purpose and I think that for the beginning manager, he/she should probably read \\"Who moved my Cheese?\\" in tandem with this book.
0395645662|5.0|This book is spectacular in every way. Its meant to give you a different view in life and our culture. Jonas is such a loved character.  <br /> <br />Though when you ask a fan of this book what is so great about it, i bet you anything they'll say, \\"The Ending.\\" WOW. Leaves you hanging.  <br /> <br />Read this book. I recomend the Messenger as well. Hail Lois Lowry
B00062ZE3U|5.0|Do not let this sweeping emotional journey fool you into thinking that Within Temptation is a boring salad eating band. These metal rockers not only put Evanescence to shame but the level of production and musicianship is astounding with all the glorious choral accents and beautifully orchestrated metal manna to fill up all lovers of rock and classical music in one tasty meal. So accessible are they that I'm stunned they are not feeding the America's. This band with the right exposure would top all the charts and gives a whole lot of everything anybody searching for fresh food to feed their musical needs could want.<br /><br />To those who say that this is a sell out? THANK YOU WITHIN TEMPTATION for selling out because I am now your biggest fan. This CD has not left my player since the day I received it in the mail and I'm still not tired of listening to it. The combination of classical and metal are perfect and the songwriting and production brings one word to mind. GENIUS!
B000001Y5X|5.0|This is the first from MM.  This is so f in' awesome.  Snake Eyes and Sissies is enough to buy it.  Get Your Gunn is on here.  Lunchbox is on here.  Hell, Dope Hat is on here!!!! This is a must have for EVERYONE.  I think MM should of stayed with this line-up.  Twiggy is here.  Marilyn is here. Daisy is here. Madonna is here.  Sara is here.  I think its somewhat is some aspects better then the rest of the albums even though I said in other reviews that \\"something\\" else was.  This isn't best overall, but its truely without a doubt the album that started EVERYTHING and a masterpiece.  Pick it up!!!!
B000000W5P|5.0|Some Girls may not be the best Stones album ever but it has a spirit which was utterly in tune with the times.  It rocked.  It had amusing lyrics.  It was, and is, a wonderful album.<br />Miss You is disco equal or better than anything of this oevre at the time.  This song showcases Jaggers supreme vocal skills and dark humour better than most Stones songs, particularly the whats the matter with you boy? section.  Cool.  The title track is sexist for sure but highly amusing nonetheless.  In 1978 there was feminism but this type of lyric could be appreciated for what it was, without inviting tedious debate about whether it was politically correct or not.  At least Jagger is even handed in his derision!  And lines about English girls being always on the phone strike a chord.  Although being married to a beautiful Hungarian girl, I know this is not an especially English issue.<br />Lies is a great hard hitting rocker with Mick Jagger again in fine form on vocals.  Just My Imagination is an inspired choice of cover.  The line .may be married and raise a famileetwo boys for you.how abouttwo girls for me? is Timeless.<br />Faraway Eyes is a brilliant pastiche of a country and western ballad.  The lyric here is rich with splendid humour.  Respectable is a great rocker with a thoroughly irreverent lyric about taking heroin with the President and such like.  Hilarious.  Before They Make Me Run is a fine Keith Richards song, more close to the bone than it might first appear with its jaunty beat and chugging guitars and the vocal rather lost in the mix.<br />Then the final two numbers take this already superb album to a new level.  Beast Of Burden is about the best song form the Stones from the late 1970s.  I got confirmed at the time and was secretly hoping to be given this album as a confirmation present.  Instead I got from my parents The Oxford Dictionary Of Saints.  Which was probably a more apprppriate choice.  Butthis album remains immeasurably closer to my heart.  Irreverent?  Yes.  But no less brilliant for that.  Five Stars.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This move has it all.  It is sweet, kind, funny and interesting.  I especially like the way they handled Buddy's inability to do anything right at the North Pole.  No matter what buddy did he was encouraged, loved and treated with kindness and respect.  <br /> <br />This movie provides a wonderful lesson for children and adults alike.  No matter how often you fail, keep trying.  No matter how often those around you fail, keep encouraging them to keep trying.   <br /> <br />So, give up on Scrooge and spend some time with Buddy.
0684833395|5.0|My title should say it all, this is an amazing book. If you have not read it, make sure that you do. Heller's use of irony and parrallelism is incredible. I cannot say enough good things about this book...just read it.
0375758992|1.0|I read this book for a library book club I belong to.  I can sum it up simply and easily.  Two white racist alcoholics raise two daughters to be white racist alcholics in Africa. <br /> <br />
B000002UJQ|5.0|This album is one of the best albums ever recorded. Period. It scared the hell out of me to see that it was a t a 4.5 star rating: a rating under that of the bends. Don't get me wrong, The bends is a great album; even a five star album. I can only hope that the reason for OK Computer's lower standing in reviews is due to its over exposure. Its status as one of the best albums of all time draws in simpletons who simply cannot get it and cannot appreciate the artistic value of the album. Every track is brilliantly crafted and there is not a moment of wasted breath on this album. Period.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I probably don't have to say this is a very weird movie, but the movie defies description on so many levels that I didn't know any other way to segue into my review. What can you say about a movie whose themes range from teenage angst, mental illness and the perhaps fragile split between reality and fantasy, to science fiction themes like time travel, to the existence of capricious violence and random evil in the world (such as when the jet engine slams into the house), to the more mundane relationships between the characters in the movie. The film effortlessly and seamlessly combines these disparate and bizarre elements into a single whole, resulting in a very unusual and rivetting film that as I said, almost defies description. I suspect it will become a cult classic of the genre although this is one movie that will be hard to beat and really belongs in a class by itself.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Gosh..what happened to the old Mariah who used to sing. Whoever said she has turned into a glorified dog whistle is correct. There is one gem here...\\"We Belong Together.\\" Otherwise, the album is desperate to prove Mariah has street cred.
B000022TSW|5.0|I recently watched the film again after five years, and it held up so well I thought I'd write a brief review.<br /><br />One thing that I find funny about the South Park phenomenon is how many intelligent and educated people think it's hilarious. I went to see it with several fellow scientists and engineers and they were convulsed with laughter throughout the entire film (including me). I don't know if this is a because South Park counts as a guilty pleasure for otherwise well-behaved and cerebral people, a reaction to the excessive PC-correctness of the current popular culture, or the incongruousness of the vulgarity and profanity combined with so many over-the-top, wacky, and outrageous themes, but whatever it is, South Park is very funny, and I thought the movie was the funniest thing yet. I mean, just the Saddam/Satan relationship was enough so that I had to use my asthma inhaler because I was laughing so much. I hope Trey and Matt made a ton of money from the money so they can do another great movie like this one.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|When I first heard about this it sounded like some sort of cheap teen horror slasher movie and I really wasn't interested.  Eventually it became evident that it was quit a popular movie among the more cultured people in my local society, so I became a little more interested in it and finally bought it at the local Best Buy for about $10, which was an excellent price condidering The Matrix is still about $10 and it's about 2 years older than Donnie.  I watched this movie for the first time with my family and was sort of nervous because I wasn't aware of the subject matter to come, but I was pleasantly surprised that everyone including me liked the movie, although my parents were somewhat confused with the meaning of it, I just liked it.  For the calibur of film that this is it's excellent.  By calibur I mean that it wasn't originally made for a large theatre release on a huge budget.  There isn't really anything I can say to you about the movie that gives it away other than the fact that it is extremely funny, creepy, and unsettling all at the same time.  The performances by the cast are true to life.  The film is supposed to take place in 1988, and I guess that the budget and time sort of crippled the feel of it, but when I looked closer I saw a little more 80's soul in it.  The DVD is great also, the commentary with Richard Kelly and Jake G. (will not attempt to spell) is very informative.  I learned several things that would be impossible to figure out by just watching it that make a little more sense now that I know them.  The deleted scenes range from very well done to very pointless (Donnie's rightfully deleted death shot).  The Mad World music video is only good because of the song, the actual video is prety much clips of the movie.  One thing I find odd is the website gallery.  It's just screenshots from [...] and they're very unclear so I don't see the justification in it being on the DVD.  Same thing with the production photos.  While the production art pics are pretty cool to look at, the production photos are pretty much screenshots from the movie, some so dark you can't even tell what they are.  Overall this DVD is pretty cool, and the movie is necessary for film buffs and film regulars alike.  Highly recommended.

Hilarious and inventive. Marvelous prose. By the way, I saw the movie some years back and was very confused by it - not so with the novel.
B000001ELP|3.0|WIth KISS in personal turmoil, (Music From) The Elder was a vision of creativity never-before explored by the band.   <br />After Peter Criss opted not to record with the band for 1980's UNMASKED (Anton Fig played drums for the record), and Eric Carr had taken over behind the kit for the Aussie '80 tour, KISS tried something new in the following studio record. <br />Unfortunately, this record has not been recieved well by the mainstream of KISS fans.  The more die-hard fans see it as a masterpiece.  But even the members of KISS dislike the record. <br />Personally, I think the record is very good.  But, once again, this record shows the ongoing struggles of KISS as a unit.  Ace Frehley recorded his guitar parts alone at his home studio, and Allen Shwarsburg (Simmons' Solo Album drummer) filled in on drums for the song \\"I\\".  <br />In the words of Paul Stanley:  \\"The Elder is not a bad album, it's just a bad KISS album.\\" <br />I think it's a very good KISS album.
B0007QJ1N4|4.0|First, I'd like to clarify that I've given this album 4 Stars based on Queens Of The Stone Age's entire body of work. \\"Lullabies To Paralyze\\" isn't quite a 3 but nowhere near a 4. I'd prefer to think of this album as a 3.25 with certain songs of 5 Star quality but overall, a hit or miss release. In the grand scheme of things, this is an average release by a superb band.<br /><br />Please don't kid yourself into thinking this album is anywhere near as good as the self-titled or \\"Songs For The Deaf\\". If you like this album, great. You don't need me to tell you what to listen to but for my money, I think Queens Of The Stone Age could have come up with something more cohesive than this considering the amount of time spent putting this album together. Also, it is clear to me that Nick Olivieri's departure will have a much more negative effect on this band in years to come than most people will admit.<br /><br />The album starts out well enough. After \\"This Lullaby\\", the album gets started nicely with \\"Medication\\" and \\"Everybody Know That You're Insane\\", both songs having the rockin' punk-y quality that QOTSA incorporates at times. \\"Tangled Up In Plaid\\" is decent but it shows hints of what's to come. \\"Burn The Witch\\" is a neat, quirky number featuring Billy Gibbons and this marks the first gap between quality songs and easily-forgetable ones. \\"In My Head\\" could have been left off due to it's inclusion on Desert Sessions Vol. 9 & 10. \\"Little Sister\\" is a cool song for a radio hit but again, not anywhere near top shelf.<br /><br />The highlight of the album; in my opinion, is \\"Someone's In The Wolf\\". This particular song contains all of the elements of oddity and heavy that I love about QOTSA and shows that QOTSA can still write great music. Beyond this track, nothing really stands out as being exempliary or exciting. The entire album is one big roller coaster ride that ends up being an overall ho-hum ride.<br /><br />Believe me, I really wanted to love this album, despite my initial apprehension with the absence of Nick Olivieri. I love Queens Of The Stone Age enough to keep this CD in my carrying case in hopes that I eventually find something on this release that clicks but so far, nothing is grabbing me. I really would hate to see such a great band fall into obscurity over a mediocre release such as this one. Please....give Nick a call....now.my initial apprehension with the absence of Nick Olivieri.

B0007XT87G|5.0|After many listens, this CD has taken hold of me. In Absentia grabbed me right away but this one took some time. Usually when a CD grabs me right away, I get bored with it after awhile. When one takes me some time to appreciate, I tend to listen to it forever. I agree with the reviewers who call this a masterpiece. There are few artists out there today who are willing to make music like this and few listeners who are willing to take the time to appreciate it. I've been a music fan since the 70s and used to eagerly await new Yes and Pink Floyd releases. This one stands up to any album produced by the legends from the 70s. Deadwing and Arriving Somewhere But Not Here are the two standout tracks for me - especially the latter. The organ in the background is genius - in fact, every note of every instrument is put together so tightly that 12 minutes seems to go by very fast. I could keep going on, but I'll close by saying \\"Buy this CD - now!\\" We should all support artists like this. Also - go see the concert! I'll be in Somerville, MA for sure.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|My daughter  (age 13) and I just saw Wicked in Toronto and I was blown away, she liked it too. This play was filled with humor and emotion and I have a new perspective of the wizard of oz now; who'd a thought you could feel bad for the wicked witch of the west? We bought the CD and my daughter has listened to it over and over. I am glad I bought it, so I can occasionally listen to it and gleefully remember this wonderful play. I plan on bringing my son (age 6) to see this play in NY, as he was fascinated with my re-telling of the play.  I recommend this cd and the play it is a must see for any OZ lover! It is much cheaper on the net compared to at the theater as well!
B0000025JT|3.0|I'm probably one of the few people reviewing this album who isn't a huge Streisand fan.  She is very talented, but I have found much of her recorded music a little campy and over the top.  I imagine she is probably great in concert.  And I do think \\"Stoney End\\" is a very, very good album.  \\"Streisand Superman\\" which I recently heard for the first time really didn't do much for me.   <br /> <br />This is good pop/rock from the 80's which has aged very well.  I am a former Bee Gees hater (I now kind of like their stuff in small doses) but I have to say that Barry Gibb does a very nice job of production, bringing the best out in Miss Streisand's voice.   <br /> <br />The last couple of songs don't really do it for me.  The finale, \\"Make Me A Memory\\" goes through too many tempo changes for me.  It sounds like a mini-musical.   <br /> <br />So, anyway, good pop/rock from her diva-ness, which even a very fairweather fan like myself can enjoy from time to time.   <br /> <br />P.S.  One minor point.  If I was Barry Gibb, I might have insisted that my name be put on the front cover.  I mean he's in all those cuddly photos with Le Streisand.  Whatever!  I better stop before I get people really mad!   Talk amongst your selves!  I'll give you a topic -  People like me who write crazy reviews!  Peace to all my fellow music lovers!
B000022TSY|2.0|I can't help, but ask that question. I really wasn't that impressed with this movie. I feel that it really didn't explain what the 60's were all about. I feel that what it did was tell everyone \\"Party, and you'll be alright.\\" It just didn't gel together enough for me as I feel that the 60's may have been just a complete waste of time. I know one scene that really gripped me was when the main characters go to this hippie commune, and we see a guy who's is obviously stoned out of his mind holding a little baby who's crying, and while it makes the guy disturbed he doesn't do anything about it; Let's face it to me what the father of that baby was wanting was to have someone take that baby away from him so he can get back to the free sex, and the drugs. You see I feel that the movie would've sold me better if it was more geared towards the values the people were trying to hold to back then. I know that the decade was about equality, and world peace, and how everybody wanted them so bad, but the movie looks more on the selfish side of the hippies. With the main characters scoring alot of money from a drug buy, and the carefree style of just traveling along the country without a care in the world. The only character I feel was worth something was played by Jack Nicholson. A lawyer who seemed so dissilousioned with the way things were that he joins Hopper and Fonda for awhile on the trip. I know that during this decade everyone was wondering what's going on? Was the way our parents raised us, and the values they tried to instill in us wrong? This is understandable considering everybody was starting to think more broader. I can't say if it was because of the drugs, or not that caused everyone to start challenging the values of thier parents, but that's where the movie should've been centered. I just can't help, but feel that Fonda's character was right \\"We Blew It.\\" I know that's what happened with this movie here. A somewhat decent soundtrack, but it's not the masterpiece that everyone feels that it is. I know that this is tough stuff, but I've kept silent about it for 16 years, and it was time to release my feelings on this movie. I feel that it revealed to me that this hippie culture is one of self-indulgence, and escaping responsibilities. It's not about peace, or love. Now there is no resolution as the former hippies have gone on to represent the people they hated, and they've developed a callous attitude that the people they hated had, so what are we to believe? Are we to accept this on blind faith? Well some people may say yes as once again the movie left me feeling with one of the songs from the Blind Faith album \\"Do What You Like\\".
B00005A46T|5.0|Hi, i'm a person! ok, i've been listening to SliPknoT for about um.... i dont know how long, a little less than 4 months or so? but i have all three of their CDs and they all suck!!!! naw naw, i'm kidding, they are the best. and all the haters should know they shouldnt just be judging a band they dont like just because it's not something they like to listen to, you have to realize people have feelings and that your insults are very unnecessary. if you dont like the band then what the hell is the point in writing a wasteful review?? anyway, i know how you feel, i used to hate SliPKnoT, yes, it's true. but i grew and as a i did my taste in music changed and now i'm rambling... well, SliPKnoT's kewl but ok. here's my review on the songs!!!!!! WOW!!! <br /> <br />1. (515) - 4/5 - this isnt necessarily a song but it is a great introduction to the CD, though kind of odd, it's basically bits and pieces of creepy vocals that had been done by Corey. <br /> <br />2. People = S*** - 4/5 - wow, this song is totalllllly kewl, i love it. nothing really else to say actually... i just like it, and the chorus is very well done. <br /> <br />3. Disasterpiece - 3.5/5 - this song is good but i really dont like the chorus. (i think it;s the chorus) it's just really annoying and i dont bother with this song much but the bridge is great where i think all the members say a word and Corey comes in with a couple words followed with \\"I'm not supposed to be here... I'm not supposed to be.\\" and oh my f***ing god, at the beginning Corey actually says \\"I want to slit your throaght and f*** the wound--\\" WHAT - THE - HELL?!?! <br /> <br />4. My Plague - 4.5/5 - oh my god this song has got to be one of my favourites. it's just awsome and the verses are done exceptionally well. <br /> <br />5. Everything Ends - 3.5/5 - well, like Disasterpiece, i dont bother with this song much. i dont like the begginning where Corey says the chorus, i dont like how he sounds, it's... odd. ya... ok. <br /> <br />6. The Heretic Anthem - 4/5 - Hell yeah! go satan! ok, this song is very kewl to me, but it definately wont appeal to the christians... i think... well, i'm atheist so make your own opinion. <br /> <br />7. Gently - 3/5 - i havent really listened to this song fully but i like the beginning and um... dont remember. <br /> <br />8. Left Behind - 5/5!! - WOW!!! i love this song!!! i love the chorus and i cant help but always scream out the lyrics cuz it's just so good of a song! <br /> <br />9. The Shape - 3.5/5 - again, this song is good but it's not one i listen to much. <br /> <br />10. I Am Hated - 4.5/5 - this is the first SliPKnoT song i have ever listened to (on a game called Amplitude) and i used to hate it. but now it's one of the best songs by SliPKnoT in my opinion. The bridge: \\"Everybody sucks and i can prove it, everybody dies--\\" and blah blah blah is done exceptionally well the verses are good but the best part has got to be the chorus. <br /> <br />11. Skin Ticket - 4.5/5 - wow, i have no idea why i like this song so much but it's just so fun to listen to. it's creepy though, but it's worth the listen. much worth it. <br /> <br />12. New Abortion - 4/5 - this song is good, i like the chorus, but i really had no clue what Corey was saying in the chorus until i read the lyrics book. heh... <br /> <br />13. Metabolic - 4.5 - this song is GREAT! i love the part after i think the beginning verse with the guitar solo that goes into the chorus just because it's perfect to headbang to. (though i go at the tempo of the guitar so it hurts my head...) <br /> <br />14. Iowa - 2.5/5 - another song i am yet to listen to but i dont think i like it that much... <br /> <br />Well, there be my review, foo! hey, i rhymed. well, if you have comments or um... comments you can email me i guess at 'HaryuNoHanekata@aol.com'. (oh wait, does it already say my email address? i;m so lost...) well, toodlez!
0446310786|5.0|As if anyone needs to be told how brilliant this story is. I just had to put a word of honour in.  <br />  With a brilliantly dramatic, funny and at times creepy plot, Harper Lee gave the world one of the most fantastic books ever written. <br />  And its no wonder that with over 30, 000, 000 million copies of this book sold worldwide that she never wrote another novel!
B00009ZYC1|5.0|Man, I feel like Rip Van Winkle after watching \\"Shrek.\\" Let me explain. I rarely watch animated shows, let alone animated movies, so I was totally unaware of how much they've changed in the last ten or fifteen years. The only reason I popped \\"Shrek\\" into the DVD player was because I stumbled over a website that said this film earned a place in the list of all time top ten grossing movies. I couldn't believe that claim, considering it's an animated feature, so curiosity forced my hand. All I can say after seeing this DreamWorks production is WOW! When did they start using CGI for animated features? Moreover, when did they start using CGI to such great effect? I'm not totally ignorant, by the way. I'm aware that some animated films look like what I saw in \\"Shrek\\" since I've seen advertisements and stills from movies like \\"Toy Story,\\" but I had no idea of the depth involved in every frame of the movie. Most of the films I've seen with heavy CGI usually contain one or two scenes where the effects look simply awful or fail because the script puts the plot and characters on the backburner so as to make room for the computerized images. Not so in this movie: everything we see is a computer-generated effect and the characters stand front and center.<br /><br />Shrek is, of course, a large green ogre with huge teeth and cone shaped ears voiced by the incomparable Mike Myers. When we first meet up with this lovable rogue he's hanging up no trespassing signs on the outskirts of his beloved swamp. Shrek likes his privacy because...well, he's an ogre and ogres need their privacy. Why would anyone want to hang around with an ogre anyway? They're ugly, crass, and mean. If the movie is any indication, they also like to bath in muck and offal. Fun. Nonetheless, Shrek soon discovers that faraway events threaten his self-imposed exile. The diminutive and evil Lord Farquaad (voiced by John Lithgow), in his evil way, issued an edict ordering the deportation of all the fairytale creatures from his domain. What a jerk! He sends the seven dwarfs, Pinocchio, a gingerbread man, and assorted other lovable creatures out into the cold, heartless world. The only place left to these poor wretches is, predictably, Shrek's swamp. The ogre opens his front door to find literally hundreds of talking animals, beasties big and small, and assorted magical creations slumming about the swamp. Enraged, Shrek embarks on a mission to Lord Farquaad's palace with the aim of obtaining the deed to his property. He takes along with him the talking Donkey (voiced by Eddie Murphy) as his sole companion.<br /><br />Farquaad isn't one to cave into demands lightly, however, as Shrek and Donkey soon discover. The evil nobleman wishes to acquire a princess as his bride, and he promises to deliver the deed into Shrek's hands if the ogre will procure this woman for him. The woman in question is Fiona (Cameron Diaz), a beautiful young lady imprisoned in an imposing castle watched over by a fire-breathing dragon. Shrek and Donkey accept their mission and soon liberate Fiona from her prison, but things don't go quite right from this point forward. Shrek grows fond of the imaginative Fiona, and she of him, but their physical forms seem to prohibit any possible romantic union. After all, how can an ogre ever hope to marry a human princess? Well, in the fairytale world people aren't always as they seem. Fiona harbors an intriguing secret that would astound Shrek if he knew the truth, but Farquaad enters the picture before the ogre learns what's going on. Will Fiona marry the evil Farquaad and live unhappily ever after? Will Shrek muster up the courage necessary to rescue his beloved from the evil lord? Most importantly, will the ogre take Fiona with him back to the swamp so the two can share his cherished privacy? You ought to know the answers to these questions before the film even starts, but seeing how everything turns out is the fun part.<br /><br />\\"Shrek\\" is quite possibly the most enjoyable animated feature, television or movie, that I've ever seen. The secret to its success is difficult to summarize adequately in a mere paragraph. First, the voiceovers are wonderfully full of energy and emotion. Moreover, the animators made sure to craft the main characters so that they look like their actor counterparts, i.e. Shrek looks like Mike Myers, Donkey resembles Eddie Murphy, and so on. Second, the CGI effects are incredibly detailed, so much so that it's almost frighteningly realistic. Third, \\"Shrek\\" is contemporary while staying true to the old fairytale form. From the music by Smashmouth to the pop culture references to the multifaceted dialogue, modern audiences ought to find much to appreciate here. Speaking of the dialogue, I couldn't believe some of the stuff that came out of these characters' mouths. The part where Shrek points out Lord Farquaad's huge castle and says, \\"You think he's trying to compensate for something?\\" is absolutely hilarious. I couldn't believe he said it in what is essentially a cartoon. The movie's loaded with great double entendres that little kids won't likely understand but will keep adults engaged.<br /><br />I'm not even going to get into the extras on the disc except to say there's some great stuff here that takes hours to watch. My favorite supplements included a look at Myers, Diaz, Lithgow, and Murphy doing the voiceover work and the behind the scenes stuff describing how the animators performed their computerized magic. I can't believe I waited this long to watch such a fantastic film. Sadly, the sequel isn't as good due in large part to an overemphasis on the pop references and adult humor.most enjoyable animated feature, television or movie, that I've ever seen.

B0006284JQ|1.0|It is a sad, sad, sad day when this no talent manufactured product has a greatest hits cd.  Greatest hits albums are usually preserved for artists who have consistently put out great music, have been around for awhile, and have contributed something to music as a whole.  Spears has done none of the above.  She is one of the main problems of what is wrong with the American music scene today.  Image/Sex/Publicity/etc.. first, music second.  People are more concerned about who she dating rather than what she is doing musically and that alone is pathetic.  I wonder when her 15 minutes are going to be up???  On a side note, Britney Spears is actually trailer trash who tries to hide her southern accent...just thought I'd throw that in as I can't think of a better closing.
B00005JNQ8|1.0|I liked it better last year when it was called The Manchurian Candidate...and even that wasn't so hot <br /> <br />Everyone seemed to like Kidman in this, I thought she was trying too hard.  I recently saw Cold Mountain and hated her in that too. <br /> <br />Maybe it was just her stupid character.  \\"I grew up in Africa, my parents were killed by landmines; I work for the UN because I believe in the power of words over violence\\" etc.etc...good lord... <br /> <br />But she's not the problem, Penn's not the problem.  The problem is there is no plot. <br /> <br />What happens?  Nothing! <br /> <br />Why are critics calling this a \\"smart political thriller?\\" <br /> <br />Essentially all it really is is a blue-eyed blonde-haired woman being hunted...and then not hunted...and then maybe hunted again by some black men with guns. <br /> <br />The U.N., the African leaders, the terrorism, the poetry...it's all just a superfluous nonsense shell covering the cookie-cutter creamy turd centre. <br /> <br />There's going to be an assassination.  Who is behind it?  Does Kidman have something to do with it? <br /> <br />Who cares? <br /> <br />And that's without mentioning the completely ridiculous romantic aspect... <br /> <br />It fails on all levels.  Action?  None.  Romance?  None.  Comedy?  None.  Drama?  None.  Thrills?  None. <br /> <br />There is nothing... <br /> <br />An awful film <br /> <br />Actually there were 2 cool lines in the movie, here they are: <br /> <br />\\"Vengeance is just a lazy form of grief\\" <br /> <br />and <br /> <br />\\"The smallest whisper can be heard over the largest army when it speaks the truth.\\" <br /> <br />There, I saved you 10 bucks...

B00004T9UF|5.0|My god, this album is perfect in lyrical form. It is insane how many rhymes he can get in a single line of his song sometimes. I can't even count them all. Not only are there complicated rhymes outside and within each line, but they all follow a set pattern. Some syllables follow something like Shakespear's iambic pentameter, except the syllable changes are to the beat of the music. <br /> <br />The first lyrics of song 13 (Drug ballad), and 17 (Under the influence) are the most complicated rap lyrics I have ever heard. <br /> <br />
0812550706|4.0|In Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game, the use of many symbolic elements helps contribute to the success of the novel.  The novel uses many motifs which help contribute to both its theme and its plot.  For instance, the use of games contributes to both theme and plot.  Games are used as symbols to illustrate the novel's theme of distortion of reality.  Card's use of symbolism creates an enjoyable read for anybody willing to interpret literature.  Ender himself is also symbolism of all that is basically good.  The use of symbolism in a novel helps to contribute to the experience of reading it.  Anyone who reads any novel with a sense of openness and eagerness to read it will enjoy being forced to think a little for him or herself. The symbols of this novel keep the reader thinking and keep the reader focused on the symbols themselves and what correlation or purpose they may have as related to the plot.  Personally, I really enjoyed this novel, and I thought Card's employment of symbolism helped me enjoy it.  I enjoyed not being forced to think about one specific outcome or meaning, but instead being allowed to imagine any possible outcome, and interpret as I wanted to.  Those who have read the book know that the climax of the novel does not take place until the later chapters, where it is finally made clear what kind of game Ender is really playing.  But before then, readers are able to predict any outcome based on the interpretations of the symbols by their own minds.
B00005OAIE|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST ALBUM IN MY COLLECTION! 3 years later I still can't take it out of my CD player. I still feel like Mayer is music's best kept secret. He has everything that an artist should have, an amazing voice, an ear for melody, he plays instruments, incredible songwriter, relatable, dynamic performer. Room for Squares is THE PERFECT ALBUM. It is a timeless that keeps you singing even if you don't know how. I can't choose my favorite song because I fell in love with all of them! I hope that he continues to stick around, the industry wont be the same without him.
0312995423|2.0|The premise behind Digital Fortress is interesting - a world where a single agency has the potential to spy on any form of digital communication and one man's quest to destroy that capability - albeit from beyond the grave. In theory this has perfect resonance with today's world of cyberspace. And its starts well, with a cast of  believable characters. But those same characters soon develop flaws that leaves the reader disappointed. The female crypotgrapher for instance quickly degenerates into an emotional wreck and becomes someone with whom the reader has difficulty in maintaining sympathy. The head of the team is misguided in the extreme and yet his resorting to murder doesn't quite work.  <br />The IT side of the story doesn't do it for me either. While the  virus idea is interesting, it is both too complex and unbelievable for the reader to feel that it is rooted in a reality with which they can identify. The net result is that the central theme fails to hold the reader's attention sufficiently to make it a page turner.  <br />Having said that, Brown's fascination with codes is extraordinarily well explored and the final few pages produced a neat twist that brought a rare smile. <br />
B00000J6AG|5.0|Might be my favorite album of all time... so much so that I went out to hunt for the original pressing that had Southside w/o Gwen. Finally got it. The album is amazing.
0767834739|5.0|I will make this brief.  <br /> <br />First, things I liked: <br />-This one is closer to the games than the first one, there are scenes that are taken straight from the games with some minor modifications. <br />-The animation blends better with the video here than in the first movie. <br />-Very decent cutting. After watching the deleted scenes, I noticed they were enjoyable but would have made the movie feel more campy. <br />-Loved the camera angles. <br />-The soundtrack's commercial songs seem a bit more polished than the first one's. <br />-Leads. I don't know who looks better but both Sienna and Milla light up the screen with their beauty. Took some realism away form the movie, but in all honesty I can't complain. <br />-Deleted scenes. I can understand why they cut them, and thankfully they are on the DVD. Jill's character really becomes my favorite after watching those deleted scenes. <br />-Outtakes. Not at Jackie Chan level, but amusing still. <br /> <br />Things I didn't like: <br />-The games' zombie rules seem to have been altered in this movie. It made sense in the first one because the corpses were fresh, here it doesn't make sense in some cases. <br />-The musical score is not as hauntingly addictive as the first movie's. <br />-To people who haven't played the games, Jill might seem as a character lacking more background info. <br />-There are some plot holes, but that happens in the games as well so I am used to it. You might not be. <br /> <br />Recommended if you like the RE games 1-3. Recommended if you need an action fix with bullets, explosions, beautiful women, horror, and an unusual plot.
6305090564|5.0|There is something unfailingly wonderful about this cheerful, bloody, kick-ass little movie...i usually like my horror straight, with no humor or goofy sidekicks, but this movie is the exception...and it all works. Famke (sp.?) looks great in a red dress, Treat Williams (what a Jack Kerouac look-alike, why no <br />movie bio all these years?) and Kevin Anderson are perfect, and the special F/X are horrifically effective...all the tentacles you'll ever need! Plus, who is the slimiest, the Anthony Heald character or the monster? Hell, I even love the ominous sound of the title. This vastly underappreciated gem deserves a wider audience...do yourself a favor and grab yourself a copy of the DVD...I just did.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|So, this album's freakin' great. Halford's singing about hilarious stuff and the first track is called Judas is Rising- how over-the-top and triumphant is that for his return? The second track rocks, the third track rocks, the fourth. . .every track is awesome. Angel, the ballad, goodness- who'd have thought Halford could do something that great? But to tell the God-honest truth, I wasn't totally sold on the album until the last two tacks. Eulogy- great, but Lochness?- thirteen and a half minutes of cream-your-jeans-ecstasy. If you don't like Lochness, you don't have a sense of humor- probably the most epic thing I've heard. . .maybe ever. The album sounds great, the solos are cool, the drums are aggressive, Halford's back on top, and the band doesn't delve into the new metal territory as was a big threat in my eyes. Get over it, and buy the album. From the cover art to songs about sea monsters, Judas Priest knows what the hell they are doing with this release, and if you're not on board, I don't think Priest really gives a damn. All I can say is I haven't had this much fun listening to an album in some time.
076790382X|3.0|Even though selecting and reading this book were part of my class activity, I generally liked and enjoyed getting to know Bill Bryson's perspectives on American culture by reading this book. This book is a collection of his counter cultural experiences when he came back to the United States after living in England for 20 years. It is very fortunate for him that he had lived in a country using his native language. If he hadn't, his cultural shock might have been even more intensified than he described in this book.  <br /> <br />As a foreigner living in this country, I agree with him on some parts of his opinions, especially about the complicated tax system, incomprehensible insurance policies, delicate efforts on gardening, boring highway travel, or sophisticated ordering process in restaurants. But I felt the most sympathetic about his concern about his aging and memory loss, and his love for his fully grown son, which are probably beyond a cultural category. However, some chapters of this book contain outdated thoughts and old information, which may be based on the fact that this book is a collection of the newspaper columns and makes me bored and uninterested. Moreover, Bill Bryson sometimes seemed to be hurry to fulfill his assignment of posting his article on the newspaper in time, because some chapters are nothing but redundancies of his confession of inaptitude for technology or mechanics, which are also dreary.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, I am very pleased to find this interesting person with an eccentric sense of humour making me smile, political uprightness insinuated between the lines, and preference of walking on foot instead of using cars. I appreciate his sarcastic but accurate reflection and objective attitude on his own country where he was born, which possibly give the American a chance to think about their own culture in a different way.  <br />

Whoever produced this album seemed to have jumped from She's so High and There's no other Way straight to cuts from Parklife carelessly omitting anything done in 1993. A travesty! Chemical World surely has to be somewhere in the top 18 best songs blur have done?<br /><br />Other than this rather large snafu, we have an excellent album; I'm glad to see On Your Own made it in but Coffee & TV? Come on.

[A+] <br /> <br />JOHN CENA defeated THE BIG SHOW to Win the United States Championship: I knew this match would be early on the card, but I'm unsure how wise it was to choose it as the opener. Bret vs Owen, this wasn't!!! It was 9 minutes of predominantly slow-paced action that The Big Show dominated for the most part, until the final few moments. Good finish which didn't hurt either wrestler's credibility, as Cena got the win with his knucks. Decent enough bout, but not quite the special opening to WrestleMania 20 that I was expecting. Match Rating...6 <br /> <br />ROB VAN DAM / BOOKER T defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ, LA RESISTANCE & MARK JINDRAK / GARRISON CADE in a Fatal Fourway Tag Match to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: I stand corrected regarding my choice of openers last week, as this bout didn't do anything more than the U.S Title bout. At 7 minutes, this was far too sort in both length & excitement. At the very least, we should have seen the tables come out from under the ring!!! Like the opener, it was decent enough, but just a little too ho-hum for my liking. What's worse, is that none of the teams really came out of the match with their reputations enhanced. Match Rating...6 <br /> <br />CHRISTIAN defeated CHRIS JERICHO: Very good 15 minute match, despite a clearly botched top-rope move during it. Excellently paced, and a good combination of the 2 wrestlers' spots, plus a few different moves. It was also an effective mixture of mat & high-flying wrestling, which should leave these 2 in a good position to break through toward a main event standing. The match did lack a little in psychology, but nothing in intensity. The ending was well booked, if a little predictable. While the aftermath (including the Trish Stratus heel turn) was also well done. A good job, all around. Match Rating...8 <br /> <br />RANDY ORTON, RIC FLAIR & BATISTA defeated MICK FOLEY & THE ROCK in a Handicap Match: Excellent decision to have this bout placed here on the card, as it got the MSG crowd seriously pumped up. And what a very good match it was too. Extremely entertaining, and the 17 minutes that it lasted for, seemed to fly by. Everyone did their job well, with Flair being the usual barrel of laughs. If there can be such a thing, this was the most organized of disorganized messes that I've ever seen. Very well booked & performed, this actually was a lot better than what I thought it would be. I guess charisma does go a long way in professional wrestling. Match Rating...8 <br /> <br />WWE HALL OF FAME SEGMENT: This lasted 8 minutes, which was longer than 4 of the matches, so it deserves to be included in the overall 'PPV Rating'. Very nicely put together mixture of live action, and taped footage from the ceremony the night before. Bobby \\"The Brain\\" Heenan's words were very emotional, while the whole segment was put together with excellent thought behind it. I liked the way it achieved it's purpose, without overshadowing any of the current happenings. Good stuff. Segment Rating...7 <br /> <br />TORRIE WILSON & SABLE defeated STACY KEIBLER & JACKIE GAYDA: Well, the evening gown match didn't last too long, as everyone stripped down to their underwear before the match could start. We ended up having a normal tag match, and it's arguable which way was the correct to go. I don't think it really mattered at the end of the day. Nothing we haven't seen before, but I guess it's been a while. Kudos to the WWE for keeping it so short (3 or 5 minutes, depending on at what point you consider the match to have started). Entertaining enough, so it did it's job to pass. Match Rating...5 <br /> <br />CHAVO GUERRERO defeated 9 OTHER CRUISERWEIGHTS in a Cruiserweight Open to Retain the WWE Cruiserweight Championship: For those interested, this ended up being a gauntlet match, where Chavo (as the champion) was automatically given the #10 spot. Ok, whose idea was this!?!?!? What on Earth were they thinking when they decided to have 8 pinfalls in 11 minutes? What the hell were they thinking not using arguably 2 of the most talented cruiserweights on the entire roster (Akio & Paul London)? I suppose the writing was on the wall when Ultimo Dragon almost slipped on his a$$ during his entrance!!! It was actually Billy Kidman, of all people, who brought the most excitement to this match. That shooting star press to the outside gave me nightmares of Brock Lesnar last year. When it came down to Rey vs Chavo so early on, I was expecting about 10 minutes of action similar to their 'No Way Out' bout. I almost threw something at my tv, when Chavo pinned Rey (again) uncleanly approximately 2 minutes later. Not exactly terrible, but we were owed something special from the cruiserweights tonight, and these guys could have got it done if they were allowed to. Match Rating...6 <br /> <br />BILL GOLDBERG defeated BROCK LESNAR with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the Special Referee: Boy, this was a difficult match to get into. In fact, I never got into it at all. In my opinion, the start was poorly booked. A slow intense test of strength would have been fine in normal circumstances, but this was anything but normal circumstances. Surely, the WWE would have known that the crowd were going to react in that way towards both wrestlers!?!?!? They should have got the action started immediately & at least tried to make the fans concentrate on the actual bout. But they went the slow& methodical route, and pretty much continued it for the 13 minute duration of the match. Goldberg won cleanly, and Austin stunned both of them afterwards. I never thought I would say this, but I think I would have preferred the rumored 'No Contest' finish!!! Match Rating...5 <br /> <br />RIKISHI / SCOTTY 2 HOTTY defeated CHARLIE HAAS / SHELTON BENJAMIN, BRADSHAW / FAAROOQ & DOUG / DANNY BASHAM to Retain the WWE Tag-Team Championships: Can I simply write \\"See comments on the Raw Tag Title match\\" & leave it at that...??? Seriously, it was almost a carbon copy. It also lasted 7 minutes. It also had the face champs retain the titles. And it was also decent, but nothing special. Could have, and should have, been much better. Match Rating...6 <br /> <br />VICTORIA defeated MOLLY HOLLY in a 'Hair vs Title' Match to retain the WWE Women's Title: I can't believe that the WWE only gave this bout 5 minutes. It was a near 5 hour show, for goodness sake!!! I felt like I had been transported back to 1990, when short matches such as this were normal on big pay-per-views. The worst thing was that the pace of this bout suggested that it was at least going to last 10 minutes. If the match was only going to go 5 minutes, then why didn't we see a fast-paced & spot-oriented match!?!?!? Very disappointing & hard to rate. Bring on Eddie & Kurt to get this ppv back on track. Oh, and by the way, Molly was surprisingly shaved completely bald after the match. Match Rating...5 <br /> <br />EDDIE GUERRERO defeated KURT ANGLE to Retain the WWE Championship: Not the main event & nowhere near 30 minutes in length (it ended up being 22). This was unfortunately not the match of the year contender that I was expecting. The MSG crowd behaved very strangely here. They were fairly quiet & there was only one \\"Eddie\\" chant throughout the whole match!!! In fact, they were behind Kurt, if anything. Now, I don't want any of you guys complaining if Eddie gets depushed because of this!!! The match itself wastechnically very good, but it had far too few exciting (or memorable) moments. The ending was very cleverly booked though, with Eddie undoing his boot laces, to slip out of the anklelock. I suppose we often have to look past pre-match expectations, and when all was said & done, this was still a very good match. Match Rating...8 <br /> <br />THE UNDERTAKER defeated KANE: Apart from the ever-annoying voice of Paul Bearer, my first impression of the returning dead-man was that he looked like Desperado. He should have rode in on a horse!!! The match itself was pretty much as predicted. Kudos to the WWE for keeping it fairly short at 8 minutes in length. And I suppose everything that should have happened during that time, did. But overall, there was an uneasy mix of everything about The Undertaker. The look, the characteristics, and especially the wrestling style. It just didn't quite gel. While the match was far from a total disgrace, I do worry about the upcoming months when it pertains to the dead man. Match Rating...6 <br /> <br />CHRIS BENOIT defeated TRIPLE H & SHAWN MICHAELS in a Triple Threat Match to Win the World HeavyWeight Title: Excellent & memorable match where all 3 combatants brought close to their best. Right from the beginning of the bout, Chris Benoit looked his intense & crisp self, while HBK & Triple H stepped it up a notch or two from their 2004 performances thus far (they were a lot more effective here, than at The Royal Rumble). At 25 minutes in length, this wasn't the most perfectly paced match. Nor was it a technical masterpiece (which I would have preferred that they tried for in the first 8-10 minutes). But I suppose that is the inherent problem with Triple Threat matches. What it undoubtedly was though, was exciting, entertaining & memorable. A superb finish capped it all off very well. Great stuff!!! Match Rating...9 <br /> <br />PPV RATING (85/130) = 65 <br /> <br />Looking at the key, I have basically given 'WrestleMania 20' a 'B' grade &said that it was a 'good event that was worth the money'. Overall, I only just agree with that comment & grade. But then again, it only just fell into that rating range. Honestly, I was a little disappointed with the pay-per-view. But not for the reason that others are. Many other people are disappointed because there were no huge surprises, turns or special appearances. That didn't bother me, because I wasn't really expecting any. Remember that the WWE did not promise these, so why should we have necessarily expected them?  <br /> <br />No, I was disappointed because the WWE didn't seem to prioritize wrestling (or entertainment) quality in their 12 matches. When all was said & done, only 4 matches rated above 6 out of 10. That's basically saying that the other 8 matches were pretty much decent television matches, and nothing more. That's not a great WrestleMania strike rate, in my opinion. Furthermore, the Women's, Cruiserweight & both Tag-Team divisions, came out of this pay-per-view looking worse than what they came in. That's an opportunity missed by the WWE to advance these divisions.  <br /> <br />As it turned out, I had no problem with the increased length of the pay-per-view. But in retrospect, 2 of the matches (probably one of the tag-team matches & the women's title bout) should have been taken off the card, and quality should have been favored over quantity. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXB2|5.0|David Lean's epic \\"Lawrence of Arabia\\" is one of the best epics filmed for multiple reasons: acting, photography, screenplay, music, direction, the list is endless. Filmed over 2 years is Morrocco and Jordan this brought together a spectacular cast to the tale of Col. T. E. Lawrence. Right from the moment in the start in the desert when the haunting music of Maurice Jarre shows the sunrise, one is mesmerised. It is difficult to produce such movies now. This is a cinematic masterpiece that defies imagination. Most important is the screenplay by Robert Bolt. <br /> <br />Initially Lawrence thinks he can accomplish anything, however, he comes to realize the limits of his abilities. When he helps capture Damascus, Gen. Allenby realizes that he has no further use for him. He says \\"You are promoted Colonel now\\".  <br /> <br />Lawrence says \\"Why?\\". <br /> <br />Prince Faisal says \\"Take the honor Colonel, be a little kind. Young men make wars and the virtues of war are the virtues of youth, courage and hope for the future. Then old men make the peace and the vices of peace are the vices of old men, mistrust and caution. It must be so.\\" <br /> <br />After Lawrence leaves and they start bargaining, at one point Prince Faisal says \\"Lawrence is a sword with two edges, we are both equally glad to be rid of him, are we not.\\" Gen. Allenby says, \\"I thought that I was a hard man Sir.\\" To this, Prince Faisal replies, \\"You are merely a general, I must be a king.\\" <br /> <br />Col. Brighton leaves in disgust over this. I do not think of any movie that has such a meaningful repartee. The passion and triumph shown in the movie is outstanding as are the bad parts. I would recommend this movie to any one interested in special movies, learning art of movies. It is not rated the AFI #5 for no reason. Peter O'Toole was outstanding in his first role. A classic in every sense of the word. <br /> <br />
B0002O06N0|5.0|Certain music rocks.   This whole album rocks.....If you like the feel of blues, with a funky hard driven beat and guitar riffs that just make you groove no matter where you are..THEN this is the album for you (and the band).. <br /> <br />           I have all their albums (3), but in my opinion this one is the best.  It just is so much gritty fun.  To many bands forget about soul, about rythmn... they think Rocking is this overdone guitar act that gets old so fast.  To many Bands just dont understand how importnat it is to ROCK REALLY F^%$#in hard, yet keep them dancing and having fun at the same time (not an easy task)...This band seems to get that..THANK THE LORD..We need more of them...In case you wondering what other music I like.....Clapton, Buddy Guy, GOmez, Galactic, John Butler Trio....

B0007CNXUK|5.0|I never liked Johnny Depp much until Pirates of the Caribbean. I don't know why, but his portrayal in that movie cracked me up. He picks his movies carefully, and in the past, he just seemed strange. Kind of like an actor-version of Tim Burton. Now I am beginning to see that he is evolving as an actor, and as he evolves, he becomes better and better.  <br /> <br />As someone who existed on myths and fairytales when growing up, because the reality of life being a deaf child in a hearing school (and so constantly tortured...), I was not enamored of Peter Pan as done by Disney. It was insipid stuff, especially for a child with high reading skills at an early age. I much prefered even the musical with Mary Martin, and that thing was quite old by the time I started seeing it regularly on television.  <br /> <br />As I grew older, I read a lot more especially in college about Barry. He was not a successful man. He was lonely, and estranged from everyone. Who knows what type of psychological trauma he experienced. But I also read about him and the 'Lost Boys,' and there is no comparison between this man and his relationship with this family and a certain more modern person who will remain unnamed here. Barry learned to care for not just the boys, but this family (the father did not appreciate his presence in the family like the mother did not)... <br /> <br />To an extent Barry was right. None of us want to grow up, because growing up means a lot of hurting...Barry was trying to explain that from the view of a child. I would rather have stayed home with my family who cared about me than going out into the real world, in which deafness is considered a 'horrific' difference. The feelings evoked by my favorite fairytales, whether in book format or movie format, were very much raised in this movie. <br /> <br />the acting is beautiful, by all concerned. Even my husband was solemn at the end of the movie and admitted it was sweetly done. Depp continues to delight and surprise me, though I am aprehensive about his next foray with Burton into Willy Wonka, but I'll hold off judging him again, until I see his work. <br /> <br />this is a beautiful movie... <br /> <br />Karen Sadler
B000683VI4|4.0|This movie, while slightly bathostic, will soon be a classic in the world of tearjerkers. The plot has already been covered, so I won't get into that. However, this movie has a haunting quality that stays with you the day after. I spent the entire two hours between tear spells. The only problem is in the anachronism (ex., manufactured brown beer bottles in the 1940s) and occasionally frankly fake Southern accents. However, if you can get past that, this is a very enjoyable movie for anyone.
079213690X|5.0|This movie stirred moe emotionaly in a way no movie besides Saving Private Ryan did. It is so powerful and awesome. It is Mel Gibsons best work, \\"right above the Patriot\\" and should be watched by those strong enough to handle it.
068987474X|4.0|As a sensitive man I appreciate that my male friends sometimes have trouble communicating with their girlfriends.  This book does a great job of providing insight into the minds of men whether they be from 1800 or today.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|i thought this movie was terrific fun.  i was on the edge of my seat the whole time.  to me movies are for entertainment.  period.  to have a good time.  maybe other types of movies are more thought provoking and that's fine when one is in the mood for that.  but for a good action movie with a lot of adrenaline running you really can't beat this one.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Just when I thought Mariah was going to pull a mariah again, she comes up with a record that is truly a comeback for her.<br /><br />Emancipation of Mimi is a very balanced record, not so much going for the newer cutting edge hiphop sound but also includes the types of tracks that made us Mariah fans fall in love with her music - the ballads that showcase her amazing voice. Not sappy ones but very nice, old school beat ballads and slow jams.<br /><br />Another thing, the melodies are very well done. I just listened to it once and I already loved it. Its not the kind of record that takes you a couple of listens to love. Just one is enough to know that this one is a classic. I never expected this since I've been buying her albums and I am always a bit disapointed with her futile attempts to sound young and hip. This album is the return of the voice, really.<br /><br />And with a number 1 debut, its a big hit, unlike charmbracelet which only debut in an okay number 3 and glitter which ultimately flopped like hell.<br /><br />Listen to this CD. Its amazing.
B0007OCG4W|5.0|I give out 5 star ratings very rarely... in fact I checked, I give it to only about 1 out of every 20 movies. I almost gave this one 4 because of Julia Roberts, who is clearly out of her league here - but I realized casting her was a stroke of genius. Because of her limited ability, hers is the character we get to know the least and feel the least for - but thats exactly the point, her character is an empty shell. Anyone who has been through the situations depicted here (havent we all???) will find this film refreshingly real and touching. Closer is not Hollywood, its not meant to entertain or thrill, its a slice of life only. But as such, it is brilliant and revealing. The dialogue is excellent (did anyone else realize that only the 4 leads have speaking parts?), Nicholls does such a good job of juxtaposing the storylines as they unfold, and the actors are all very very good. This is a MODERN film, expect to see and hear things you haven't before. 5 stars, this is a great one.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|Yes, many people are bashing this movie but I think they are all wrong. That is why there is a sequel since it was a good flick, right?<br /><br />This movie is a very good adaptation from a game, since I also love the games. Angelina was a good Lara Croft not just in the physical aspect but also in the attitude. She is as confident as the one in the games.<br /><br />The movie also circles in a great plot line. The plot is very well served and not draggy, unlike other movies. It doesn't aim to much to inform people a lot about the Illuminati but supplies what the viewers need, not over or under that. The whole plot makes sense in a not so draggy way.<br /><br />The adventure aspect is also well done. The exotic locations were mesmerizing as well as the action sequences. The stunts were very realistic, unlike the ones in movies like Charlie's Angels were people leap like animals. Here, Lara is very human but athletic, doing stunts that are actually possible to do and done very nice cinematically.<br /><br />The movie overall is very enjoyable. its a fun action flick. It may lack depth or may fail to satisfy one but its an action flick. Let go and enjoy.
B000002NFM|5.0|Anyone who experienced the music scene of the Nineties can surely remember The Prodigy as one of the most vivid acts of that decade. After releasing critically-acclaimed albums in the early 1990's such as \\"Music For The Jilted Generation,\\" the British group went global with 1997's \\"Fat Of The Land.\\" The hype and build-up for this album was absolutely incredible, having been preceded the year previously with two massive dance anthems which both hit No.1 in the UK and set new records.<br /><br />The Fat Of The Land arrived in July 1997 like a tidal wave as a staggering 320,000 copies were sold in the UK in its first week (this would be around 1,600,000 if it had sold the same ratio in the US because America's population is five times that of the UK). This figure does pale somewhat in comparison to Oasis' \\"Be Here Now\\" which sold 700,000 in 72 hours in the UK alone a month later, but the statistics are still extraordinary; the music scene in the 1990's was like nothing seen since the 1960's, because here was a new generation, open, free, expressing themselves, and buying music in droves. The Prodigy were a part of that most definitely.<br /><br />The Fat Of The Land boasts ten tracks of fast-paced, hyper, adrenaline-fuelled anthems; a mish mash of Techno, Heavy Metal, Dance and Electronica. Critics were not quite sure what to make of this album, because it was unlike anything that preceded it. Definitely ground-breaking, but not quite a perfect album.<br /><br />It opens with the deliberately controversial \\"Smack My Bitch Up.\\" This song had women's rights groups up in arms, and rightly so. The lyrical content is not something I agree with, but the song itself is a masterpiece of hard-hitting techno-driven beats, and the female vocal section in the middle is incredible. The video is also very interesting, with a twist that makes you think about your preconceived notion of men as being evil and greedy pigs. \\"Breathe\\" became the band's second UK No.1 in November 1996. This is an amazing song with a hardcore beat and a very heavy chorus. The beats are raw and rough, almost steely with a whip-like rhythm section that scars itself along the intro. \\"Diesel Power\\" is a great song that has a foot-stomping beat that crashes through your headphones. With industrial beats crashing all over the bass, this is a very memorable song due to the hip-hop raps. \\"Funky S**t\\" is another great song that just blows me away every time I hear it. A lot of people don't seem to like this song, but I really like the way the deep bass is mixed with the static beats that pulsate along, all the way through.<br /><br />\\"Serial Thriller\\" is an amazing song with very industrial beats that sound like sirens at a power plant. This is quite a heavy song that reminds me more of hardcore rock bands than anything, and the vocals are quite brilliant. \\"Mindfields\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album, but it's also probably the most electronic song on the album. The beats are rather fuzzy and scattered here which gives this effect. \\"Narayan\\" is the longest song on the album at just over nine minutes. The song is very different to anything else on the album because it has a clear and bright beat that just flows through your brain. The song actually features an ancient Hindu prayer towards the end, which is so unusual; to see this hardcore techno-rock song mixed with such a religious statement. Towards the end, the song becomes all mixed up until you can hardly pick it apart, before the beat rises to a climax, and then...<br /><br />Ah, then comes the real star of the album. It is of course \\"Firestarter,\\" and it is without a doubt one of the most popular songs in the UK of all time. This song stormed to No.1 in the UK in early 1996 and put the band at the forefront of the British music scene. This song scared grannies, infuriated protective parents, and made millions of teenagers all over the country go crazy with joy! The video to this song has to be seen to bebelieve, a true classic' the song is dirty, gritty and so anthemic. \\"Climbatize\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, but it doesn't seem to get much recognition. I'm not sure why this is, maybe because it's an instrumental track, but this shouldn't distract from how brilliant it is. The song opens gently with a distant beat that grows heavier and louder until a full rhythm section is dancing and darting its way all over the set. Imagine watching the sun rise as you listen to this, it's amazing. The album closes with \\"Fuel My Fire,\\" which is a cover version of the L7 original. This song is very heavy and dark and reminds more of the Sex Pistols.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />And there you have it, an album that was intended for the dance floor, but completely transcends the genre. The music on this album will always be remembered for being completely original and unique, like nothing before it and, because it also now sounds slightly dated, like nothing in the future. Keith Flint would take a further seven years to release the follow-up to this album. Maybe he just couldn't get it right, who knows. This album isn't perfect, and it's certainly not my favourite of 1997; Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" and Bjork's \\"Homogenic\\" run circles around it. It is, still, a great album and one that I feel is worthy of a place on any music lover's shelf, if not for the nostalgia.rty, gritty and so anthemic. \\"Climbatize\\" is one of my favourite songs on the album, but it doesn't seem to get much recognition.

0451191153|5.0|This reviewer needs to reread the book and try not to skip those long speeches which, like it or not, contain the real kernels of the philosophy.  <br />This reviewer says that Rand would approve of child molestation because it is 'selfish'. No. It is not at all selfish acording to the Randian definition of selfishness. She never advocated self-indulgence or sexual promiscuity or sexual deviance of any kind. Selfishness is more akin to self-reverence and self-esteem - literally 'holding yourself in high esteem'. The violation of another's rights ( certainly a child's rights) would make a person unable to claim one's own rights. This is fundamental. <br />This reviewer rants about capitalism and communism 'requiring an elitist undemocratic government'?? What? <br />This reviewer says that 'the things necessary for success'..'just happen randomly to some people but not others.'What? I am not a leaf in the wind. My attitude counts. Rand believed that a man is the product of his decisions and advocated that those decisions be rational and self-interested for the benefit of himself and for the benefit of those around him. Someone who is debilitated, delusional and foolish is certainly no help to himself, his community, his family or the world for that matter. The book portrays the rewards of 'correct thought' and the disadvantages(should I say horrors?) of wrong thought. <br />The reviewer then rants about the non-existence of right and wrong and that all things are relative. He needs to read other books. Ayn Rand believed that man can discover the right thing to do using the power of his own reasoning mind. This reviewer goes on and on about minority rights which is a non-sequitor for this discussion. <br />This reviwer talks about a supposed contradiction in Objectivist thought because 'it is OK to have collective national defense and collective law enforcement.'Of course she does - she isn't an anarchist. Governments exist among men to protect the rights of men. The Constitution then protects the people from it's own government.The Fountainhead really isn't about this though- Atlas Shrugged is really more about the Objectivist's relationship to society.  <br />Granted, the philosphy of Ayn Rand has some deficencies but none of them are articulated by this reviewer. The Fountainhead is an inspiration. Read it and reread it. <br />I recommend 'The Virtue of Selfishness' and 'Capitalism;the Unknown Ideal'. Other non-fiction by her is also good, but some is hard to get through. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000009EAD|5.0|I love this band. I do NOT consider Iced Earth to be power metal. Disagree? Let's compare... Power metal has operas, keybpards, and cheesy lyrics. Does Iced Earth have any of those? I don't  think so! Now comprising of lead vocalist Matthew Barlow, rhythm guitarist/backing vocalist Jon Schaffer, drummer Mark \\"The Creeper\\" Prator, lead guitarist Larry Tarnowski, and bass guitarist James MacDonough, Iced Earth released their 1998 album Something Wicked This Way Comes. It ended up being their best selling album, and many fans consider this to be the best with Barlow. I say the title goes to Burnt Offerings, but SWTWC is a very close second. MANY of these sogns were solely written by Jon Scaffer, and he sure can write his ass off. The album begins with Burning Times, a fan favorite and a standard concert opener. It is one of my favorites. The next song, Melancholy (Holy Martyr), is a ballad. It is another favorite. Another great song here is My Own Saviour, I love the lyric \\"Life's a b****, life's a w****\\". I also love the instrumental 1776. It would go great as a concert opener. My favorite song here is Coming Curse, hands down the best of the Something Wicked Trilogy. I love all the songs here, but the above mentioned songs are my favorites. If you like metal, Iced Earth, and good music in general, you will like this album.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1 - Burning Times 5/5<br /><br />2 - Melancholy (Holy Martyr) 5/5<br /><br />3 - Disciples of the Lie 5/5<br /><br />4 - Watching Over Me 5/5<br /><br />5 - Stand Alone 5/5<br /><br />6 - Consequences 5/5<br /><br />7 - My Own Savior 5/5<br /><br />8 - Reaping Stone 5/5<br /><br />9 - 1776 5/5<br /><br />10 - Blessed Are You 4/5<br /><br />11 - Prophecy 5/5<br /><br />12 - Birth of the Wicked 5/5<br /><br />13 - The Coming Curse 5/5
0553573403|4.0|First, the bad stuff (cause I like to end with praise)<br /><br />1: Overly graphic depictions of sex + a seeming enjoyment for the incestuous relations of Middle Ages royalty:  It has absolutely nothing to do with any of the plotlines and it borders on grossing me out more than once.  He seems to be attacking the sacred cows of fantasy as a genre and how it is so vastly from what life in our own Medevial period was like, but really, due to his descriptions of such unsavory moments, it is more an attack on the reader.<br /><br />2. It is not really a fantasy novel other than the barest mentions of magic (which can be found in any other genre) and the fact the people wear armor, live in castles and swing swords.<br /><br />So you have to really come to terms with what this novel isn't before you can see what it is.  If you come to it with the preconceived idea that this is fantasy as the genre is so known, you will be shocked and perhaps even angered and assume(and to some extent, truthfully) that he is just out to give fantasy the finger.  But if you just can read it as a \\"novel\\" and not a fantasy novel, you can see what is good in it.<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1.  Multiple POVs, often between antagonists, blur the line of what is good and what it evil.  Even asking this question without editorial comment(Martin's style is \\"fly on the wall\\")tends to push this novel out of the domains of fantasy with its mythic overtones of objective Good and Evil.  It might alientate some readers, but I liked it(once I got used to it).<br /><br />2.  One of the things that I haven't liked about fantasy as a genre is it's near idolitration of the taboo on killing off main characters.  Seeing one of my favorites bite the dust was interesting, because it was then that I found out that I was rooting for him and that I cared.  Not having the power over life and death(other than with side characters) makes usually for wooden settings and scenarios.  And while that in and of itself is the genre, and some writers have written great pieces within its constraints, for the better part, it is what has cheapened the genre and made it on par with romance and cheeseball sci-fi.  Martin goes for it and takes people out.  Maybe with a little too much glee (again, I feel he has some hostility towards the reader but masks it with a move to mock the genre of fantasy).<br /><br />3. style and composition...at first I laughed cause his style got him out of the need to think up Chapter names...each one is one of the various players(which is itself unique in that some major players are not Chapter characters and are always seen third person, while others are given 1st person treatment in the individual chapters.  Again, it might alienate those more into traditional fantasy who saw a dude with long hair in armor on a horse in front of a castle on the cover.  But it is its own style and gives the events their unique flavor.  Also, his prose is well done.  I was often able to clearly picture his scene descriptions.  Though of course, not when it came to his obsession with capes and doublets.  I really don't like super obssession with fashion(another fantasy cliche that Martin, this time, was right in line with) but again, it did not become to distracting at times.  He can be cheesy sometimes, like all of us, and some of his use of modern swear venacular contradicted his other attempts to refashion the lexicon for the time period.<br /><br />But all in all, I quite liked it and was actually intrigued in some parts.  It's harder to read a bunch in one sitting though, it seemed.  But it's episodic style actually made it easy to just sit for one chapter at a time when I had only a few minutes to spare.  Once I got over the preconceived notions I had, and stopped bothering to reference it up against anything else, I just read it and it was good. Sure, some of the settings are bizarre and contradict the \\"realism\\" he shoots for, still...it does not detract from the overall mosaic Martin is attempting to create.  And it is a mosaic that he shoots for.  People are writing many of these reviews as if that was some sort of accident of weakness of skill.  That was what he wanted.  Not everyone will like it, but I did, and precisely in that even though it turned out not to be a fantasy novel much at all, it still found a way to take potshots at the sacred cows of over-the-counter fantasy garble.c that he shoots for.

B000002H33|1.0|I finally bought this album today after metallifans kept bragging about how good it was. Man.. what a disappointment!! These guys just don't know how to play their instruments and all songs are exactly the same. It's like they were totally out of ideas... I wonder how that happened? Maybe it had something to do with Dave Mustaine leaving the band... I don't know. <br />Anyway to conclude this review I would like say to people that are young and new to metal to skip this boring newbie metal.  If you want to listen to good thrash metal check out the metal gods of Megadeth and their groundbreaking album Rust In Peace... you won't be fooled like i was :/  <br /> <br />
014100018X|5.0|Chocolat by Joanne Harris is definitely a must read.  As a girl who loves novels like Pride and Prejudice and Wuthering Heights, I wasn't sure how much I would enjoy a more contemporary novel.  This being true, I have to admit that I could hardly put the book down.  Joanne Harris was able to grab my attention from the first sentence and she kept my full attention until the end.  The little unsuspected twist and turns in the novel help to keep the reader interested and always wanting to know what will happen to Vianne and little Anouk.  <br /> <br />It is a story of Vianne Roche and her daughter, who open a chocolate shop during lent in a devoutly catholic region.  It is a whimsical tale with talk of magic, sorcery, and river gypsies.  I loved that the author didn't rely solely on romance, as one is lead to believe by the movie.  Instead Harris turns to developing enticing and realistic characters.  It is easy to feel the characters' wants, from Vianne's want of belonging to Armande's want of a little fun.  You can even feel the over-zealous priest's want of order and piety.   The descriptions of all the chocolates and recipes are simply mouth watering.  Chocolat is a charming tale of small town life that really pulls at the heartstrings.  Read this book with some chocolates, a box of tissues and enjoy! <br />
1594200440|5.0|This is the kind of novel, that just by thinking about it years later, will bring a big smile to your face. Not only is it very funny, but it has such an engaging, wonderful hero, who happens to be an 84-year-old emigre to England. Nikolai has met a 36-year-old sexpot, visiting from Ukraine, who desperately wants Western luxuries and thinks this eccentric old engineer is her ticket out. She appeals to him to save her and her young \\"genius\\" son, who can only flourish at Oxford/Cambridge. Nikolai is enchanted with her \\"Botticelli breasts\\" and her attentions, and decides to save her by marrying her. This way she can stay in England and her son can go to Oxford/Cambridge, \\"nothing less.\\" <br />   Nikolai's two daughters, who haven't spoken to each other in years, are horrified, and decide to join ranks to defeat the gold digger. <br />   First-time novelist Marina Lewycka was born of Ukrainian parents in a refugee camp in Germany at the end of World War II, and grew up in England. She teaches at Sheffield Hallam University and is an expert on elder care. In Nikolai, she has managed to create one of the most original and endearing old coots in literature. It is just hilarious to read how this man operates, oblivious to the consternation he is causing. He is naive, wise, generous and befuddled, but he keeps marching on, living a fascinating life. <br /> Now besides the sexpot, Nikolai's energies are also concentrated on writing a history of tractors. From time to time Lewycka gives us an italized page from his opus and what really surprised me is how interesting these pages are. I was glad every time another page about tractors showed up in the novel. <br />   The novel is also an easy way to learn something about the recent history of Ukraine and what its people went through. My parents also fled Ukraine and the stories my father told were as harrowing and dramatic as those in this book. Lewycka writes truthfully, without sugar coating.  <br />We can understand why elder sister Vera, 10 years senior, became a lifelong pessimist, while sister Nadia, who grew up in England after the war, became an idealist. <br />   Most of the novels we read and movies we see we can barely remember a dozen years later. I can't imagine forgetting this book. So laugh a lot - and learn something.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album at times is dynamic and at others incredibly subtle. That's part of the John Legend magic. His voice alone shows great imagination and isn't one dimensional like a lot of male singers like R. Kelly!  <br />My favorite songs are: <br />ALL OF THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000777J2S|3.0|Um, can anyone say Vibrato, just a joke. But seriously he does kinda have his style down, although it trembles like the knees of a frightened child. Some songs are startlingly beautiful, and I would argue that in some instances it's his voice that makes it so. Although there is some very good songwriting here. Anyone who likes moody, haunting balads with somewhat intresting content, although not for everyone, enjoy.
0446310786|5.0|I just read this novel for the first time, and I wish I hadn't waited so long to have read it. I wish I hadn't lived so much of my life without it in my mind, informing how I look at others and what I think my place in the world is, because I think this book does change how one sees good and its role in the lives of those hurt by the cruelty of humanity.<br /><br />TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is the story of young Scout, who starts the book out remembering her life at the age of 6. Her brother, Jem, is 10, and their summer neighbor, Dill, is 7 (\\"I'm little but I'm old,\\" he says.) (Interestingly, the character of Dill is based on Truman Capote, whom Harper Lee knew as a child.) Their father, Atticus Finch is an attorney, and their mother, who died when Scout was 2, figures not at all in the story. The family has a black maid, Calpurnia. Various neighbors are also mentioned: Miss Rachel, Dill's aunt; Miss Maudie; Miss Stephanie; Mrs. Dubose; and, of course, the Radley family, in the spooky house the children had to pass on their way to school. The novel begins with Dill's first summer in Maycomb, the small Alabama town that is the setting for this novel. Dill, Jem and Scout fixate on getting \\"Boo\\" Radley to come out of his house. Boo is a mysterious man, about whom the neighbors trade stories and with whom the children like to scare themselves. Atticus takes a dim view of the children using Boo and his life for various entertainments and chides them whenever he finds them engaged in one of their attempts to catch a glimpse of him.<br /><br />The summer ends and Dill goes back to his family and the Finch children go to school, Scout for the first time. Her teacher discovers that Scout can read and tells her that her father's been teaching her all wrong and that she is not allowed to read at home any more with Atticus. Scout also gets in trouble the first day of school for standing up and explaining to the teacher why Walter Cunningham cannot accept a quarter from the teacher to go have lunch in town (he didn't bring lunch with him). Scout explains that Walter can't borrow a quarter because \\"he's a Cunningham.\\" When that is insufficient information for the teacher, Scout says, \\"The Cunninghams never took anything they can't pay back--no church baskets and no scrip stamps. They never took anything off of anybody, they get along on what they have. They don't have much, but they get along on it. ... You're shamin' him, Miss Caroline. Walter hasn't got a quarter at home to bring you, and you can't use any stovewood\\" (which is how they paid Atticus Finch for some legal work he had done for them). Miss Caroline smacks Scout's hand with a ruler; Scout tries to fight Walter in the schoolyard, and then Jem invites him home for lunch. Later Atticus promises Scout that even though she must attend school, he will still read with her every night. And so we get the tone of the father-daughter relationship, practical, loving, guidance and, more than anything, acceptance of Scout for who she is. Atticus also shows over the course of the novel the need to live up to the love his children have for him in his professional and personal life.<br /><br />Soon Atticus is engaged in a legal case that engenders criticism in the town. He has been appointed to defend a black man, Tom Robinson, who was accused of raping a white woman, Mayella Ewell. Atticus's \\"mistake\\" is that he actually means to defend the man. Scout and Jem hear criticism from their friends, but Atticus instructs them never to fight over it with other children, to hold their heads up high. He tells Scout that he could never tell her to do anything again if he walked away from this responsibility. The children watch the trial and the outcome, and the reader sees that like Boo Radley, Tom Robinson is one of the people hurt by the cold world and the evil that exists in humanity. Atticus strives to help his children understand and not be brought low by such cruelty like the hermit Boo and the convicted Tom.<br /><br />Even with the verdict going his way, the father of the alleged rape victim, Mr. Ewell, vows to get revenge on Atticus for making him and his daughter look foolish on the witness stand.<br /><br />I won't go into the climax of the book, but wanted to note that what I love about it is the love that is shown by Atticus in his behavior toward his children, his client and the people he lives with in the town. Even when Ewell spits in his face, he maintains his dignity and seems to believe that Ewell needed to make the threat to carry on his life in Maycomb. Atticus is a kind of Christ figure of the Maycomb community. The children's neighbor Miss Maudie says nearly as much to their aunt, \\"Whether Maycomb knows it or not, we're paying the highest tribute we can pay a man. We trust him to do right. It's that simple.\\" -- this even while others are vilifying him for the work he did for Tom Robinson.<br /><br />As Scout grows, her capacity to to understand grows, too, and her fascination with Boo Radley changes into a kind of longing to meet this man, who never goes outside and has no friends. She wants to meet him and say \\"hey\\" to him and ask him how his day is. Her capability to love and be kind is growing, and she wants to share it.<br /><br />The ending of the book is the apotheosis of Scout's growing capability to live, understand and treat others with dignity, and we also see the ongoing example of Atticus to do right, along with other townspeople who want to protect the weakest and smallest among them. It is truly one of the most moving chapters I've read in my life. (I tear up just thinking about it!)<br /><br />The novel itself is charmingly written, the voice is of an older Scout who maintains her independence and zeal for life, but who understands more than the 6-year-old Scout did at the beginning of the narrative. The story flows smoothly, and the plot is engaging.

B0007XT7V8|5.0|I'm a big rock fan, and I've noticed something.  Just because an artist has a hit single doesn't mean that the rest of the songs on their albums are just as good...in fact, they are last-minute incomplete puzzles, which is why mp3 downloading exists. <br /> <br />However, I read good reviews about this album, and I've always liked TOAD's music style, so I bought it on impulse.  I listened to every song, and I was not disappointed.  Great album if you like country and rock.  It is odd that a Canadian band would make a song called \\"Santa Monica\\" since that's in the Southwestern U.S, but I know that when they made this album, they put some deep thought into it.   <br /> <br />Just as an indirect gesture to show how much I think their album is worth hard-earned money, I deleted my TOAD mp3's from my computer.
B0002F6AH0|3.0|I purchased this DVD set because I wanted to see a good WWII documentary and this one was so highly rated. It is a good documentary, maybe a great one. But it has a troubling Anglo bias that ends up being a severe character flaw.  <br /> <br />Am I being phobic here, or is America's role in the European war severly under-represented in this film? Examples abound: We become intinmately familiar with British generals Montgomery, Alexander and Horrocks. Montgomery is shown in many situations including a long-ish speech excerpt before a civilian group. Horrocks (British 30 Corps commander) is given lengthy screen time to explain how Eisenhower missed a golden opportunity to end the European war in 1944 by not putting all the Allies' weight behind Monty in the North.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, only 4 American generals are mentioned in the whole European war part of this series: Eisenhower, who gets the bare minimum of screen time for a supreme commander, Bradley is in one scene for one second, Clark's failure in Italy is covered in copius detail, and Stilwell is shown as head of Allied forces in Burma. Notice any names missing? How the heck do you talk about the European war and not even use the word \\"Patton\\"? I dunno, but this film manages to do that. So Patton doesn't even get mentioned, but we are treated to several long interviews with Lord Avon (who the heck is that you may ask--I have no idea--I never heard of him either). Anyway, whoever he was, Lord Avon gets more screen time than all the US generals put together. <br /> <br />Sour grapes, you say. This guy is an Anglophobe. He is too sensitive and too proud of his American heritage. Well, check me on this: If you were making a documentary about WWII, would you give the predominately British war in Burma the same amount of screen time as the ENTIRE war with Japan? No? Well, that is the \\"balance\\" assumed by World at War. The skimpy coverage of the Japanese war does not even mention Guadalcanal and covers only one ofthe huge Pacific naval actions--the Marianas Turkey Shoot.  <br /> <br />Another whole reel is devoted to the U-boats and the British \\"Battle of the Atlantic\\". Never mind that the US submarine war in the Pacific, that sent nearly all Japanese ships, freighters and warships alike, to the bottom, was probably the single most successful application of naval power ever. That brilliant naval victory is not even mentioned.  <br /> <br />The only \\"Home Front\\" covered on the Home Front episode is England!  <br /> <br />The reel about the atomic bomb focuses on diplomacy, never even mentions the incredible scientific triumph that was the Manhattan project, and perversely squeezes in the implication that it was Truman's failed diplomacy with Russia that lost Poland to the Soviets! Paul Tibbets is made to seem like a mass murderer, dropping the bomb in the face of overwhelming evidence that Japan wanted to surrender. The footage of Tibbetts is deliberately drawn out to make it appear that he felt casual and matter-of-fact about dropping the first nuclear weapon. The Japanese diplomat Kase is shown saying that the atomic bomb was \\"unnecessary\\". Well, he's right about that--the whole doggone Pacific war was unnecessary starting with the Japanese invasion of Manchuria. <br /> <br />The funny thing about the anglo bias of this film, is that the Russians and their war are well covered. Stalin and his generals get big screen time. This is as it should be, given the overwhelming Russian role in the European war. So why is the USA's role almost deliberately downplayed? At one point, Sir Lawrence narrates to the effect that Churchill wanted one big British victory \\"before the Americans came to dominate the war effort\\". I guess my point is that American domination of the western allied war effort did eventually come. But you'd never know it from watching this film.
B00005JNTV|4.0|I loved watching this film. The style was unique and the special effects were pretty awesome. The story sort of comes full cicrle at the end, which in my opinion saved this film from the mere 1-start I would have given it.<br /><br />Amazon.com's editor, David Horiuchi, found the film to be \\"unquestionably the most faithful comic-book-based movie ever made.\\" I do agree with him and I also think that because it was so faitful to the comic books, it failed to grab the audience emotionally.<br /><br />You won't feel for the characters of this film, I tell ya this much. They're beautiful, stylish and deadly, but they are not relatable.<br /><br />This film has got to be seen on the big screen to fully appreciate its artistry. It's very entertaining to watch, even though it gets overly gory in some scenes.

0143034901|4.0|Zafon's love for the written word is never at doubt during the course of this fine novel.  Where it misses being a classic in my book, is that I had the feeling that the many rich characters that embody this narrative were the only inhabitants of Spain during much of the 20th century.  There were so many coincidences that I began to find them annoying.  The parallels lives of the protaginist Daniel and the mysterious novelist Julian Carax were too much for me as well.  I recently read \\"The Kite Runner\\" which I do consider a 5 star debut, and saw a lot of comments on this site that criticized the string of coincidences that occurred in that novel.  I disagreed with those opinions.  Wonder what those critics would have written about this novel. Nonetheless I enjoyed the read and would highly recommend this novel to others. I have a feeling Zafon has some great books to write in the future.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|a lot...then i bought this cd.  Let me prepare you for whats in store if you buy this album.  Every song on the album is great once it starts...i say once it starts because it takes most songs 2-3 minutes before we actually get to lyrics.  I would say probably half of the cd sounds like they paid some 11 year old to warp sounds and make noise.  The widow...is great until after the 3 minute mark when the last 4 minutes of the song is just noise.  I highly suggest borrowing from friend instead of buying.  Because i promise if you like music and not noise your going to want at leat 30 minutes of your life back.

0553278223|5.0|As the paranoia and fear of the early stages of the Cold War escalated and the prospect of global destruction in an atomic war crystallized into a terrifying possibility, a pioneering trip to a more placid Mars must have seemed welcoming. As early successes with the development of technology such as \\"Sputnik\\" made a an exploration of this magnitude a likely technological achievement within the next few decades, manned exploration and the colonization of Mars no doubt evolved into a sexy and exciting dream, indeed.<br /><br />Bradbury's series of loosely connected vignettes set against the backdrop of America's first landing on Mars, the false starts and failures of several expeditions and the spread of disease resulting in the elimination of a planet's entire population, actually constitute a scathing critique of what he saw as the worst failings of the social fabric of 1950s America - imperialism, bigotry and racial prejudice, xenophobia, guns, environmental pollution, waste, foreign policy, censorship, and the untrammeled growth of technology all wrapped up in the unfailing smug sense of superiority that the American way is the only way!<br /><br />\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is not a straightforward read. In the opening chapters, a light and fluffy approach borders on inane as the reader is left wondering precisely what is happening. It's only perseverance that will lead the reader to a more profound understanding and appreciation of Bradbury's intention. \\"Way in the Middle of the Air\\", for instance, is perhaps the most moving single piece of writing I have ever experienced - extraordinary in its simplicity and yet blistering in its condemnation of the treatment of blacks in the American south in the 50s. Finally, the reader will be rewarded with the warm, optimistic closing of \\"The Million Year Picnic\\". This is perhaps the only story in the entire collection in which I believe Bradbury really is talking about the future and the possible colonization of another planet. It is his simple suggestion that these efforts would be doomed to an extended and painful failure if Americans attempt to shape another planet into the mould of their US-centric terrestrial expectations. Only through adaptation and the re-formulation of society according to what the planet will allow, would such colonization be expected to prosper.<br /><br />Everyone who reads to the end of this story will wonder whether it should be considered as science fiction at all but nobody will harbour the smallest doubt that the term \\"Classic\\" is richly deserved.<br /><br />Paul Weisssimple suggestion that these efforts would be doomed to an extended and painful failure if Americans attempt to shape another planet into the mould of their US-centric terrestrial expectations.

630521610X|4.0|So this is the movie that every 90's teen thought was an awesome horror flick.  Make a teen horror film that not only makes fun of pervoius slasher flicks but at the same time is a slasher flick itself. MMMMMM. Great Idea.   <br /> <br />        With this film being the first of its kind in 90's teen horror films.  It hits the nail right on the head.  We get great camera angles the make the scenes a little more scary, along side great music to give the movie great teen horror tone. With great acting from all that are involved.  A great ending that is hard to just throw into the garbage, although its the kind of an ending that you kind of saw coming.  Wes Craven did a great job at reviving the teen horror genre with this movie. Thumbs up!

B000002MY3|5.0|i can't believe that this was the first ever album i ever bought with my own pennies! i bought this when i first came out (like! of course!)and i was still at primary school, ahh! <br />i loved it, and even now i still take out the battered and broken old album cover and play it and i still love it some more. <br />alanis taught me from an early age that i can be who i want to be and screw everyone else. <br />and if i make a few mistakes along the way, hell. every little helps. its just a lesson learned. <br />when i was a kid, i used to skip past some tracks, but now im a little older and a little wiser, i love the whole album and i can relate to nearly every song on the cd. <br /> <br />I'm not saying that i listen to this album ALL the time, but every now and then, i stick it on and have a listen and it once again reinforces the independant woman in me. <br /> <br />If you haven't got this album, get it. <br />when your stressed, stick on 'ironic' and smile and say f### it to the world. <br />it'll cheer you up.  <br />well it does me anyway.

014100018X|4.0|Chocolat is truly a treat for all of the senses.  The element that I appreciated most was the humor.  The sheer ridiculousness that chocolate could be responsible for the complete corruption of the soul was worthy of a giggle-fit.  To think that such a simple and innocent thing could ever be considered heinous is border-line hilarious in a world full of so much scandle.     <br /> <br />Harris breathes a life into her characters that adds to the sensory tale.  The strength, vivacity, and compassion in Vianne Rocher is something to be admired, yet Harris did not create a character so perfect that we cannot sympathize with her.  Vianne, like many of us, is searching for her true place.  <br /> <br />Vianne, in many ways, is just as lost as Reynaud is.  The parallels that are evident between the two main characters in conflict are fascinating.  This creates a conflict much deeper than the superficial conflict between Vianne and Reynaud.  In fact, much of the deep conflict is man vs. himself (or herself for that matter)  <br /> <br />If you are thinking that Chocolat is merely a \\"light read\\", then you may suprised.  Although the plot flows well, and the surface storyline and conflict are quickly grasp-able, do take the time to think deeply about this novel, and you may find some hidden sweets about yourself.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Upon first viewing of this film, I wasn't a huge believer.  I thought that Clive Owen deserved every accolade that was handed to him.  His performance was breathtaking and so full of life that his character was the one to watch for when each scene began.  He epitomized the level of good guy and bad guy all into one.  So, I was happy with his performance.  I was excited to see him playing well with others, but was this a great film?  At first, as I said before, I didn't think so, but then I thought about it.  This is one of those films that requires you to take a breath and think about the effects long after the final credits have finished rolling.  It takes your current relationship and places it right before your eyes.  This film will speak to anyone that has been in a relationship or is currently in one.  After watching it, you will think about your relationship and the horror will settle in.  This film will speak to you, it did me, and it really put into perspective the world of dating and relationships in this modern culture.  Nichols has crafted a masterpiece, and while it may not be appreciated as much now, it will remain in our society for a very long time.<br /><br />I have spoken briefly about the acting, but I would like to say that without a decent crew, this film could not have been as emotional as it was.  Julia Roberts turns in a performance that is very unlike her and will disappoint those who are die-hard fans, Natalie Portman proves that she is more than just Star Wars material, and Clive Owen ... Oh, Mr. Owen ... there could be nobody greater.  He controls this film and really takes his career into a new level.  I am not ashamed to say this, but I am a huge Clive Owen fan.  He does not disappoint in this film.  Then there is the snivelly Jude Law.  I must say, his performance in this film was the least impressive.  He somehow finds himself falling into very similar roles in each film that he picks up.  If you have seen Alfie, then you have seen a bit of him in Closer and vise versa.  He just isn't as great as he was when he first burst onto the cinematic scene.  Perhaps it is because he is wearing thin and cannot create fresh characters ... I dunno ... but whatever it is, he did not provide anything worth-wile to this film.<br /><br />So, with the acting strongly in place (sans Law), Nichols tips off the iceberg with some unprecedented cinematography that allows strong storytelling to take place.  One of the biggest elements to this film that captured my attention was Nichols ability to allow time to pass with the greatest of ease.  I thought at first that this film was going to happen within the course of a couple of days, but he builds a sense of a strong relationship by allowing it to pass over the course of several years.  You really get this feeling that these characters are together for a certain period of time and that development is occurring.  I never felt as if something suddenly happened, over the course of four years these acts of the heart take a form of their own through the watchful eye of Nichols.  It impressed me.  Also, Nichols' use of bold white coloring not only expressed the light of relationships, but also brought out the brilliance of each scene.  You became focused on certain elements, the purity of the heart, and so forth.  It was cinematic history in the making.<br /><br />Finally, I would like to say that this film was nothing of what I expected.  Natalie Portman's final scenes were riveting and really brought the rest of this film together.  Scenes in this film happened for a reason instead of just a chance to impress the audiences.  It was a delight to finally see a movie that came directly from the heart as well as shot to your heart.  It will invoke fear and make you appreciate the relationship that you have.  I have never experienced a film quite like this before and cannot wait to see what the brilliant mind of Mr. Mike Nichols will bring next to comment about our society andculture.  He does have his hand on the pulse of our lives, and Closer proves it.<br /><br />Overall, I was extremely impressed with this film.  I have always been impressed with the work of Mike Nichols' work ever since I first experienced The Graduate and this film was no different.  He has this amazing ability of building tension and love together in the same bundle.  I remember feeling similar emotions during Closer as I did while watching The Graduate.  It is this ability to pull at your heartstrings while still maintaining that sense of realism.  I could connect to some portion of this film, and I loved it.  I strongly recommend this film, but do not take your gut reaction as the first response.  Think about this film, think about yourselves, and then make your decision.  It is what I did and somehow this film still remains in my mind weeks after viewing it.  I am impressed.<br /><br />Grade: **** out of *****ety and culture.

B00005JKMQ|2.0|Ok Ali was one of the greatest of all times and Will smith is a good actor.  Excuse me but,I would like to remind that religous freak that this is a movie review, not an open forum for you to preach to other people how rightous your beliefs are.  It's a movie about sports don't take it so seriously. The problem is Ali is the exact same movie as when we were king's. The footage is similar the plot line is similar and instead of will smith it's real life footage of the champ himself.  If you haven't seen the documentary when we were kings, youre missing out. It actually one the oscar in 97 for best documentary and it is a far wuperior film than ali. Thanks
6305558167|5.0|Released in 1981, John Boorman's (Deliverance; Zardoz, Emerald Forest) rendition of the Arthurian myth, despite its flaws, is by far the best of all the movies made on this subject for a variety of reasons.  The film is of impeccable cinematography; the direction and editing is great; the theatrical cast is very strong; and, one could not have chosen a better soundtrack or incidental music for a film on this subject.      Whereas other films have tried unsuccessfully to either overly romanticize, secularize, or fantasize the Arthurian myths in the form of light drama or action (i.e. 'First Knight'; 'Merlin'; 'King Arthur'), John Boorman's excecution of Rospo Pallenberg's screenplay seeks to make the film a sequence of poweful symbolic settings reflecting various elements of the Arthurian myth and English history such as Excalibur and the Stone; The Lady of the Lake; Merlin; Guenevere's carnal betrayal; The Grail; and, Morgana and Mordred.  Through a brilliant script and outstanding scenes, Boorman presents a magnificent fusion of myth and English history so that the audience is never quite sure if it is just history or myth: it comes across as a strangely real yet distant dream.  Pallenberg and Boorman clearly set the story in the Dark Ages where the English peoples are victims of disunity and cultural clashes; images such as a priest using misseltoe to make the sign of the cross shows that Celtic druidism and Christianity are barely distinct; Merlin is portrayed more as a druid than as a pointed-hat magician; etc.  The cinematography is impeccable as much of it is shot in natural light (a method few directors have succeeded with other than Stanley Kubrik and Riddley Scott) and Boorman's choice of setting and background simply reinforces all of the thematic aspects of the story and scenes: Boorman often uses green light, misseltoe, dolmens, and obelisks to emphasize the Celtic elements of the myth.  In terms of soundtrack and incidental music, no better choice couldhave been made than Wagner's teutonic works from 'Der Ring' and 'Tristan and Isolde' as well as Carl Orff's 'Carmina Burana' for such a story and film.  The script is absolutely outstanding, almost epic in form, and executed by a brilliant cast of some of the finest theatrical actors many of whom are now quite famous such as Patrick Stewart, Hellen Mirren, Liam Neeson, and Gabriel Byrne.  By far the greatest performance in this film is by Nicol Williamson as Merlin: an outstanding performance by a seriously underrated theatrical actor whose performance of 'Hamlet' with Anthony Hopkins (unavailable in the U.S. unfortunately) is an equal match to those by Laurence Olivier and Richard Burton.  Equally memorable is Gabriel Byrne's (The Usual Suspects; Vanity Fair) performance as Uther Pendragon where, in one  of the scenes, he rapes Egraine in full plate while disguised by Merlin's spell as the Duke of Cornwall.  Watching Patrick Stewart in full plate covered in blood while hacking his castle's besiegers with a battle axe is a very vivid image as well: I'm just waiting for him to say 'Make it so Number One!'    There are of course some downsides to the film but they are rather minor when the work is taken as a whole.  The screenplay's attempt at incorporating so many elements of the Arthurian myth does cause some scenes to shift rather abruptly with little transition but not to the point where it's incomprehensible.  Some of the sound effects are somewhat cheesy; if one listens carefully one can hear the same sound effects for each battle in the film.  Some of the interior sets are rather cheap but the film is over 20 years old and was made on a limited budget.  Some of the effects are rather amusing such as having boas slithering around in 5th century England.  Again, these defects are rather minor and have no greater effect on this film as other trivial problems found with great films such as 'Spartacus' or 'Ben Hur' for example. Regardless of its defects, this is byfar one of Boorman's greatest productions along with 'Deliverance' and 'Zardoz': it is an epic. This is the best Arthurian rendition on film so far in almost every respect such as screenplay, direction, cinematography, acting, script, and musical score.  The film is worth watching for Nicol Williamson's performance as Merlin in and of itself.  I would recommend this movie to any one who either likes Arthurian movies and/or enjoys movies in the theatrical style as opposed to method acting.  This film is definitely Rated-R as it has quite a bit of nudity and a pretty graphic rape scene which may not be suitable for younger viewers.
0790729369|4.0|I loved this movie- the story of a typical housewife who does everything right and gets caught up in a wonderfully erotic romance.  Her dreary normal costumes hide her true passionate nature, and when the time comes to make her choice, she decides on the ultimate sacrifice- returning to monotony. <br /> <br />Her kids, as future selves, are reading her diary and want to remember her as the quiet monotonous mom they knew, not as THIS. <br /> <br />As I said, this movie was fantastic, my only complaint was that it was too concentrated on this mother being such a martyr- no one would really have missed her had she taken off her crown of thorns and joined Robert Kincaid at the end.  I understand that her sacrifice was difficult, but she as a character didn't really seem that necessary so the audience remains a little confused as to why she wouldn't give up her boring life.  Definitely worth it, though.
B000002HRE|2.0|The Load album either had good songs or bad songs on it. With this album, however, all of the songs are pretty mediocre and just okay. They put the best songs at the first and thank goodness for that, so now I don't have to constantly do skipping to get to the good songs like on \\"Load\\". The first 4 tracks are pretty good rockers, and if the album had kept this strength and momentum throughout the rest of it then this would have easily beaten out Load and have possibly matched up close with their Black album, although it would have had a different sound to it than the Black album of course. I don't mind the different sound though. It's nice to hear something different just as long as it's good. <br /> <br />The album starts out with \\"Fuel\\". I actually like this song. It's a fast rocker with some good riffs and melodies, equivilant in quality to the first track on Load called \\"Ain't my Bitch\\", which I also like. The second track, \\"The Memory Remains\\", can be a little annoying if you let it be. Metallica was trying something different and they pulled out an alright job. I have to give them credit for it. \\"Devil's Dance\\" is in the style of \\"The Thing That Should Not Be\\", so not a fast-paced song, but a good slow rocker. \\"The Unforgiven II\\" is the next best song to come up. It doesn't match up to the first \\"Unforgiven\\", but it still turns out to be a good song. Up to this point it's sounding like an alright album, but after that you discover the bad half of the album, or should I say the bad 2/3 of the album? It carries out a pretty consistent mediocre sound throughout the rest of it. There's nothing extremely horrible, but it just doesn't sound like Metallica anymore. It's bearable though. I was able to listen to this entire album in one sitting. That's something that I cannot do with \\"Load\\".
B0002U0UKS|3.0|this album has 26 tracks, many which are short and barely a \\"song\\" but merely a scene in the movie. the style is again uniquely hisaishi and one can't help but be reminded of his previous work, Spirited Away. very similar music but this has more of a european, carousel-like theme with darker tones. would think that his previous works were better. this is simply a rehashing without particular striking relevance to the movie.
B000683VI4|5.0|\\"The Notebook\\" is a film about feeling, about loving in totality, a point that is emphasized from the film's outset.  James Garner in narration explains to the audience at the film's beginning that he is an unremarkable person whose passing will not cause any stirs, but yet he is proud of his life because he loved as genuinely and thoroughly as it is possible for one man to commit himself to another person. <br /> <br />Garner then resides at a convalescent home.  He is bound and determined to make the life of Gena Rowlands as pleasant as possible, a dementia patient to whom he reads from a notebook containing a romantic story.   <br /> <br />The film takes place on two levels, the current one in which Garner and Rowlands are featured and that involving the subject matter concerning which he reads to her.  It is a potent love story set in a southern town beginning in 1940.  The lovers, played Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, come from opposite social strata.  Gosling is a mill worker from the poor rural section of town while McAdams comes from wealth and is ultimately accepted to attend prestigious Sarah Lawrence Academy in New York. <br /> <br />Eventually family pressure along with concern that he might be hurting McAdams prompts Gosling at one point to run away from the relationship.  McAdams believes he has ended it just prior to when she leaves home for college.  He actually sends her one letter a day for an entire year, but her mother suppresses them and ultimately, while working as a volunteer at a hospital during World War Two, she meets a young southerner from a prominent family who is recuperating from injuries and falls in love with her.  Eventually he proposes marriage and, just as she is ready for betrothal, Gosling reenters her life.   A choice must then be made between the comforts and expectations of marrying within her own class and following the passions she feels for Gosling. <br /> <br />Nick Cassavettes, son of the late director John, directs with sensitivity while his mother, Gena Rowlands, delivers a sensitive performance, as does Garner.  As the film develops it becomes apparent that there is much more to the association of Garner and Rowlands than the desire to please her in her dementia period.  At the same time his heart is becoming weaker and he does not appear to have much longer to live. <br /> <br />The two stories woven in Jeremy Levens's script, an adaptation from the novel by Nicholas Sparks, are ultimately joined by film's end.  The deep and abiding love displayed in the story culminates in a dramatic and meaningful way as two people who care deeply about each other refuse to be parted.
2070360024|5.0|I first read the novel in english, but I read it in french once I became fluent in that language. After the first sentence: \\"Aujourd'hui, Maman est morte,\\" you know that you are in the good hands of Albert Camus. The existential theme is just awsome, and it was all the better en franais! Surtout, je sait que je l'aimais.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|Mariah Carey/MC/Mimi shines on this outstanding album which deserves a Grammy. I have been listening non-stop to The Emancipation of Mimi since I received it and I am not tired of it! Her voice is amazing, the lyrics are catchy and the rhythms enticing. I must say I'm not a fan of many rap collabos but I am enjoying all the collabos on this album. Even the bleeps where the green verbs are on \\"One and only\\" have not thrown me off because the song is so emotionally expressive that I just enjoy it completely! MC is at her expressive best on this album, which is also a little bit tongue-in-cheek and funny! And her vocals are just...Wow! I love this album so much it will be another one of MC's album that I buy in duplicate, the first one since Daydream. All but one of the songs are about love, falling in love, being cheated on, being afraid to confess love etc but who cares whether you can relate?! I wish these songs spoke about my life but I'm glad at least some of them don't! I still love to sing them out loud though! Fly Like a Bird is the beautiful exception to all the love songs but you will start loving gospel if you didn't before with MC leading the way to higher heights! Get this album today, it is a keeper!
B0007XT87G|5.0|This is a great album from a group that has been putting out a variety of great albums for more than 10 years.  And the key word there is \\"variety\\".  Porcupine Tree keeps changing from album to album, but always with constantly inventive music and some lyrics worth listening to.  And all the members of Porcupine Band also find time to contribute to other groups or solo projects, which cover an amazing range of musical styles.    \\"Deadwing\\", the first song, is nearly 10 minutes long and yet it is not a standard song with verses and a chorus.  Musically there is a \\"verse part\\" and a \\"chorus part\\" (as well as one \\"instrumental solo\\" part), but lyrically the song doesn't repeat itself at all.  The music has the hard-edge that Porcupine Tree focused on for \\"In Absentia\\", but I prefer some of the lyrical twists in here [such as: ``And yes I'd have to say I like my priv-a-cy.  And did you know you're on closed-circuit TV?  Smile at me!''].  It uses two different voices for different parts of the song, which is an interesting effect.  The instrumental-solo part isn't just some long guitar solo, it's a mix of keyboards from Richard Barberi, with a section of guitar work, and some good pounding drum-work from Gavin Harrison.  It's a 10-minute song, and at the end you wish it was longer.    \\"Shallow\\" is a harder-rocking fast-paced heavy-crunch song.  It catches you with some strong guitar licks right with the first listen, while \\"Deadwing\\" takes a few listens to before you can take it all in.  In that sense I'd say it's a \\"shallower song\\", but it's also very enjoyable.  Again it has some good lyrical lines in it [``This city drains me -- Well maybe it's the smell of gasoline.  The millions pain me -- It's easier to talk to my PC.''].  This strikes me as a fun song.    So after two hard-edged songs, the group switches to a much calmer, prettier song with \\"Lazarus\\".  Anyone who was not familiar with this band might think this song is coming from a totally different band (exceptthat you can tell it's the same singer).  Long-time fans of this group are used to this kind of variety within an album.  The main instrument here is some very pretty piano playing, with relatively simple drum work keeping the beat.  The song ends with the sound of a train quietly rolling down the tracks.  While listening to this song, the words that keep coming to mind are \\"pretty\\" and \\"beautiful\\".    The fifth song is \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\".  Earlier in Porcupine Tree's career they were constantly compared to Pink Floyd, and this track shows why -- even though it doesn't sound like any particular Pink Floyd song.  This is one absolutely great progressive-rock style song.  It's a song to sit back and listen to in a dark room with the stereo turned up, simply because you want to soak in how good it sounds -- both musically and lyrically.  It's a 12 minute song that flows from one sound to another, and back again.  It has smooth quiet parts, and hard-rocking parts.  A Masterpiece.  Turn it up to 11.  Play it again Sam.    Well, this review was getting much too long, so I skipped over \\"Halo\\", even though it's also a good song.  \\"Mellowtron Scratch\\" is another great song, in more of a mellow vein.  \\"Open Car\\" starts out with a fast choppy beat (both musically and lyrically), but also has a very smooth sound to it in later parts.  \\"The Start of Something Beautiful\\" is yet another excellent song, with some smoother mellow parts, and some harsher-edged parts [such as: ``The more I show the way I feel, the less I find you give a damn.  ... You thought it was the start of something beautiful? Well think again!''].  The album (officially) ends with \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\", which is a slow-paced ending song.  So far I'd have to say it's the weakest song on the album, but the more I listen to it the more I like it.  Right now I'd give it a rating of 8/10.  Maybe it will continue grow on me as I listen to it more -- and I am certain I will be listening to this album many more times.    There's also a \\"hidden\\" song, which is a remake of \\"Shesmovedon\\" from their \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" album.  This version is different enough from the original to be interesting, and it seems to fit well with the rest of the album.  (but I'll also say that I generally hate the idea of \\"hidden\\" songs on a CD. It seems so stupid to me.  So you get five minutes of silence before you hear the song?  Is that really a \\"hidden\\" song, or is it just five minutes of annoying silence?).    [I see one other reviewer listed \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" as an 11-minute song.  It's really a 6-minute song followed by 5 minutes of silence to \\"hide\\" the remake of \\"Shesmovedon\\"...]    Also note that the import CD-single version of \\"Lazarus\\", includes two extra songs not included on this album.  If this is the first Porcupine Tree album you get, I'd recommend following it up with the 2-CD version of \\"Coma Divine (live in Rome)\\" or their more recent \\"Warszawa\\" album (which is also live).  Both of those provide you with a selection of songs from several of their other albums.    Right now the group has something they called a \\"micro-website\\" for this album at [...] which has some videos and song samples to give you a feel for the album and for the band.  Their main web site is at [...] and if you check the \\"discography\\" section there, you'll find lyrics for all their songs, including the ones on this album.
B00028HBKM|2.0|I finally saw this film after everyone has said all that can be said about it, so I'll be brief. Expecting the absolute worst from Mr. Mel \\"Sadist\\" Gibson, I have to say that this film is nowhere near as good as its idolatrous fan base would have you believe, but neither is it as repellent as its detractors claim. In short, it's just a movie, not a particularly good one, with absolutely no emotional content and nothing in it to either explain what's happening or to make you care. It looks terrific---Mel obviously has cash to spare for his film-director-as-God craziness. But that's about where the praise ends. The whole thing has a nasty tone; in Mel's version of the tale, anyone who had anything to do with Jesus suffers nothing but misery, and while I'm not a believer myself, my guess is that's not the moral of the story as Jesus would tell it. And when Jesus marches out of the tomb at the end, eyes a-blazin' and military music blasting away on the soundtrack, I forgot for a second whether I was watching a film about Jesus or whether I had accidentally stumbled on to \\"Braveheart Part II.\\" Mel Gibson is a wretched director, and the worst thing anyone can do with wretched directors is to take their work too seriously, for that gives them clout they don't deserve. All he's done here is turn a Biblical story into a horror movie, complete with creepy Satan babies and more shredded flesh than is on display in the entire \\"Friday the 13th\\" series. This stuff was camp 30 years ago, and it's just sad to see Gibson resorting to schlock effects in an attempt to make up for his movie's complete lack of narrative grounding. See this or don't see this, whichever is your preference. But religious or not, this film is not going to change your life.

0140187537|4.0|Having read many of Steinbeck's books and thoroughly enjoying them, I have been looking forward to reading \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\".  The initial tone Steinbeck sets in the book is odd.  The main character possesses none of the typical characteristics which mark a Steinbeck main character.  Ethan Hawley is hard to like at times because of the strange things he says and does.  But in reality, Ethan represents every man.  Often not likable, but real.<br /><br />Steinbeck paints vivid characters in this story as he does in his other works.  Ethan Hawley finds himself working as a clerk in the store his family once owned.  Despite a heritage of wealth, his family has fallen on hard times.  A fortune teller suggests this will soon change.  When the store's current owner is deported, Ethan regains in possession of the store.  The owner gave the store to Ethan at a cheap price because he is an honest man.  Despite an apparent influx of wealth on the horizon, Ethan's other problems linger.  His daughter merely wants him to be around.  His son's fortune of winning an essay contest evaporates when he was found to have plagiarized.  Danny, who is like a brother to him, may not have been rehabilitated from his alcoholism.  The fortune teller lusts for him. The whole town seems to have fallen into corruption.  His wife seems to be the last remaining sane person left.<br /><br />As one would expect from Steinbeck, this book does not have a happy ending.  The end is quite depressing, much like reality can be.  Steinbeck has a gift for painting reality.  While far from his masterwork, this story holds its ground.
B00005JNTV|5.0|I feel guilty for loving this film, but there you have it. \\"Sin City\\" is \\"Pulp Fiction\\" with even less redeeming moral value. If you're easily offended (pretty much by anything), stay far away. Otherwise, sit back and revel in this movie's noir-soaked atmosphere. <br /> <br />I've not read the Frank Miller graphic novels upon which this film is based, but I've seen the illustrations, and I have to say that \\"Sin City\\" triumphs in bringing the look of the comics to the screen. I'm not usually a fan of style over substance (I seem to be one of the few that thought last year's \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" a dismal failure), but I could have watched Frank Miller's and Robert Rodriguez's stunning monochrome compositions all day. Not since Dorothy opened the door of her house on to a Technicolor Munchkinland has black and white cinematography been juxtaposed to color more effectively. The CGI effects are flawless, and a terrific and audacious pulpy score pulses throughout the entire film. <br /> <br />Three equally bizarre stories are interlinked, again a la \\"Pulp Fiction,\\" and brought to life by a cast of not-quite-above the title stars: Mickey Rourke, Benicio Del Toro, Clive Owen, Nick Stahl, Rosario Dawson, Brittany Murphy, Elijah Wood (creepy as hell!), Michael Clark Duncan. The only box office actor is Bruce Willis, who plays a role that fits him like a glove, that of the melancholy hero past his prime who wants to prove he's got one more knockout punch in him before he's KO'd for good. <br /> <br />The only reason this film rises above cheap titillation is that everyone involved with it commits 100% to a common vision of what the film should be. There's something admirable about the way the filmmakers refuse to compromise their (admittedly) disgusting visions to appease the moral conservatives, or to get a lesser rating, or to make more money at the box office. \\"Sin City\\" is a movie for adults that appeals to the thirteen-year-old in all of us, and what fun it is. <br /> <br />Grade: A  <br /> <br />
B00005JMEW|5.0|there's not really much to say, only that  it is a  \\" must see\\".  Tarantino has reached his absolut peak whit this movie. Excellent performance,intelligent, sharp, wise, and much, much, more.... This goes for the second volume too. GO FOR IT!
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|I love this soundtrack, but there's a song in the movie I can't seem to find....anywhere and don't know who sings it.   <br />It is the part of the movie where Mark has just finished showing Juliet the wedding video and he walks out of his house and then turns around and turns around again.....but ends up walking away.  Anybody know what song this is or who it's by!? <br />I'd love for you to post the answer on the review section. <br /> <br />Thanks!
B00003CXCT|5.0|I have  seen so many complaints about the changes I had to speak out.  I love the newer versions and actually agree with how and why Mr. Lucas did what he did.  The sounds are wonderful, i have surround sound and it drives my neighbors crazy. The picture is much crisper and cleaner and just so easy to watch. The changes everyone complains about is so wasteful for such a great series.   <br /> <br />Of course its better to have a young Anakin at the end of Return of the Jedi then the older man.  Through out the whole first series they mentioned how Anakin essentially died when he became Darth Vador. Even Obi-wan tells Luke that Vador killed his dad. So why would he be there one with the Force as an old man? Sure Luke saved him as an old man but his true jedi self died when he was young so it makes so much sense for the change <br /> <br />The Greedo shot is the funniest arguement i heard so far.  in the original, Han Solo shots greedo(bounty hunter for Jabba). In the new version, Greddo shoots first but misses(at close point range) then Han shoots.  I agree with Lucas that kids as well as adults enjoy this movies and having Han(Our hero remember?) look like a murderer because he was in a bind is not a cool thing.  <br /> <br />There was also a inclusion of Naboo at the celebration in return of the Jedi which i loved.  Naboo played such an important role in parts 1,2,3 that it also deserves to be shown celebrating. <br /> <br />There are a few other changes but none should take away from the story. I do have the orignal tapes that i will keep just to have but i will always watch the new versions. I even got my wife hooked on the series.  its a must buy!! <br /> <br /> <br />p.s.  To all the fans that REALLY think they own a movie because they brought a ticket or some merchandise please relax.  It is HIS movie because we did not help fund it when he had his dream of a Star Wars. I really can't wait to see the complaints when he brings them out on 3-D in 2007
B00000I2PG|5.0|I have owned the original since it came out & it has always been one of my favorite CD's from first to last track.  But now they have remasered this masterpiece & the sound is STUNNING.  So if you have an old copy & a half way decent home or car stereo you owe it to yourself to upgrade to this sonically superier remaster.  And if you have never heard this classic CD borrow from a friend & then buy the remaster.  You will be hooked after one listen. Peace........

080012166X|5.0|I never thought I'd be scared by a movie, since I'm generally not scared by anything, but I have to admit this one kept me on the edge of my seat. As touted, the movie goes back to the original book for its inspiration (only it's even sicker) instead of flying off on tangents. The look is gorgeous, and for once artsy camerawork paid off. Gary Oldman, who plays Dracula, is simply terrific; you feel genuine sympathy for him, somehow. The guy who does Van Helsing is really cool as well. It's a great movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to the faint hearted because it's spectacularly gross, and I'm not talking about the fake blood, either. Still, it is way, way better than that Van Helsing movie that came out last year.  <br />What makeup jobs!
B00000K31V|1.0|I know half of the people who love Cronenberg will say \\"But all of that is part of the plan!\\" but seriously, this movie was poorly done.  The props looked like something made out of dental mold rubber using a budget of tens of dollars, and the plot simply plods along.  Willem Defoe and other named actors spice up the film a bit, but overall, not something I would watch again, even when desperate.
B0000A02TZ|3.0|(I'll assume most people reading these reviews know (and like) the film itself - this review pertains to the DVD) <br /> <br />Lousy sound mixing! The levels are ridiculously inconsistent - one minute I'm leaning close to the TV to make out the dialogue, and the next my poor neighbors are picking plaster out of their soup. This does not just occur, for instance, when a song beings - the sound level changes occasionally in the middle of a scene, a song, or a line. <br /> <br />I think the subject of the unstoppable previews has been adquately covered, but I'll emphasize anyway: May death come quickly to the person who made that decision! My Blockbuster rentals can have adverts - fine. If, however, I purchase a movie, I should be able to watch is as I bloody well please.

0316666343|4.0|The Lovely Bones, by Alice Sebold, is a brilliant piece of literature.  The novel is different from most novels-the narrator is a girl looking on her family from heaven.  The novel is well written and complex, yet easy to read and understand.  Many literary devices are found in Sebold's original novel-most specifically symbolism.  Many symbols in The Lovely Bones helps bring about a deeper meaning to the novel--meanings of loss, love, and remembrance.   <br />An obvious symbol found in the work is the charm bracelet.  Confiscated by Mr. Harvey and later recovered on a tombstone in Connecticut, the charm, evidence of murdered Susie Salmon, was returned to Susie's father.  The charm symbolizes the Salmon's loss.  One would believe that the charm would be a sign of hope for Mr. Salmon.  However, Mr. Salmon registers the charm only in loss-loss of his daughter and the destruction of his family.  Another symbol portrayed in the work is Lindsey Salmon.  Lindsey Salmon, Susie's sister, can be considered a symbol of love.  Lindsey fell in love with Samuel-a love that Susie always wanted to have.  There is irony in the fact that Lindsey lives the life that Susie had always wanted.  Finally, flowers in the novel symbolize remembrance.  The symbol of flowers is shown in many parts of the novel.  First, flowers are used at Susie's memorial in the cane field.  Daffodils, Susie's favorite flower, are held by many of the neighbors, remembering little Susie Salmon.  Also, as Mrs. Salmon is roaming Santa Monica, trying to forget her daughter, she enters a flower shop and asks for daffodils (a final remembrance of her daughter).  The shop, however, does not sell daffodils and Mrs. Salmon begins a life in hope to forget the past (which includes the death of Susie) and begin a new life. <br />Symbolism in The Lovely Bones is important to bring about a deeper meaning of the novel.  These symbols help bring about the bigger themes of the work-loss, love, and remembrance.  Through Sebold's symbols, one can better understand the complexity of death, and the strain of mourning of family and friends. <br />
B00063MBU8|3.0|I must admit, I am not the biggest fan of punk-pop, which is what this is. However, I must admit that, although Pierre's voice can get annoying if you listen to this too much, Simple Plan is one of the better punk-pop bands out there. And I'm sorry, but I have to comment on some of the other reviews: first of all, this is in no way, shape, or form anything remotely like hardcore punk rock. The whiney voice kinda throws that away pretty quickly. And if this is the stuff that's so hard your parents can't listen too it, then your parents need to get their brains checked because there's not much out there that is lighter than this stuff. Also, sorry to dissapoint you MTV and TRL fans, but most of the best music out there doesn't appear on those stations. MTV and TRL are mainly for mainstream, \\"pop\\" music that appeals to the widest number of people while not really containing anything of originality or true substance. I've recently discovered that, once you exit the realm of typical, pop culture music, there is a world of bands out there that blow pop bands like Simple Plan out of the water. Like I said, I'm a bit biased, but Simple Plan is just too mainstream popish for me to ever give them more than 3 stars.
B000051S3H|4.0|In this lovely adaptation of \\"Jane Eyre\\", George C. Scott and Susannah York make an excellent pairing, and both have strong and attractive features without the \\"Hollywood handsome\\" look, which fits in well with the story. There is some powerful chemistry between them, and Scott just might be the best Edward Rochester on film; he followed his Oscar winning role as \\"Patton\\" with this British TV drama, which received theatrical release in Europe, but was only seen on the small screen in the US.<br /><br />With tragedy upon tragedy, there is little joy and light to temper the plot, and even the love of Jane and Edward at its height is always overshadowed by the \\"mystery in the attic\\" of the dark and gloomy Thornfield castle. Of all the films in this genre, this is probably the saddest, but worth seeing for its often poetic language, and in the case of this production, the wonderful performances and fine direction by Delbert Mann. Supporting Scott and York in the cast are: Ian Bannen (St. John Rivers), Jack Hawkins (Mr. Brocklehurst), Nyree Dawn Porter (Blanche), and Jean Marsh as Mrs. Rochester.<br /><br />The atmospheric score by John Williams is one of his best, and the cinematography by Paul Beeson, of marvelous landscapes in Yorkshire is beautiful (some of the locations include Dawnholme Church, Brimham Rocks, and Ripley Castle).<br /><br />BUYER BEWARE: there are many versions of this film on the market, from cheap, grainy Extended Play VHS tapes to what I understand is a dreadful edit of it on DVD. Perhaps it is better to see it on the regular Standard Play VHS and steer clear of the rest; total running time is 110 minutes.
0780020693|5.0|May I confess something?  Fellini is one of my favorite directors-I really could live in a Fellini film and be quite happy. I love the people, the places. Ok, sometimes not-so-nice things happen, but that's true of anybody's life, no? If I could live in Amarcord, I would go there like a shot.<br /><br />Here's the confession-this is the Fellini film closest to my heart. I know we're supposed to like 8 1/2 better, or even La Dolce Vita, but Amarcord has all the bitter sweet quality of a memory told by a good friend and great storyteller, intimately, over a glass of red wine.<br /><br />Hear the one about the about the old, irascible Grampa? Gramps stepped out of the house and got lost in the fog...just steps away from the front gate. Frightened and disoriented, Gramps wonders if he is alive or if he has passed over into death. Suddenly, he stops and gives a rude gesture to death, and claims, \\"If this is death, I don't think much of it.\\"<br /><br />Hear the one about Uncle in the looney bin? Took him out for a ride in the country, and he peed his pants. Just forgot to unzip! Then, at the farm, he climbed a tree and threw rocks at people, staying up there all day, screaming, \\"I want a woman!\\" It took a miniature nun from the asylum to get him down.<br /><br />There are so many scenes of such distilled beauty, it is as if Fellini had boiled down the sauce until only the most precious elixir was left-that which was a distillation of his own life, most potent, most true.<br /><br />The town beauty, the town historian, the town idiot, the town \\"playboy\\" (loser) the mother, the father, the govenment, Mussolini, Fascism, the sea, the prostitute, the boys, the fantasies of the boys, the church, the snow, the rain, the fog. I love this film truly.<br /><br />The boys dancing in dreams in the fog. The empty grand hotel. Grandisca's wedding. The father biting the hat that had been pissed on. Tita and the cigarette shop lady. (Ohmigosh, you have to buy the film for that scene, alone!!!)<br /><br />My crazy beloved Fellini! Dear friends, you must have this film.at scene, alone!!!) <br /> <br />My crazy beloved Fellini! Dear friends, you must have this film.
B00000IMC5|5.0|An Adult, not rated, film <br /> <br />This is the second film in a \\"trilogy\\" (like Asimov's Foundation Trilogy was a Trilogy; i.e. more books and more films followed the trilogy) that stars Sylvia Kristel as Emmanuelle and spawned a large number of copy-cats (most of which go by the name Emanuelle).  This particular film is based on Emmanuelle Arsan's book \\"L'antivierge.\\"  This film has been alternately titled \\"Emmanuelle 2,\\" \\"Emmanuelle L'Antivierge,\\" and the US trailer says that this film is titled \\"Emmanuelle: The Joys of a Woman.\\" <br /> <br />The second film starts with an older longer-haired Emmanuelle setting sail on a passenger ship in the group sleeping quarters.  While lying in the cot that the ship has provided, Emmanuelle starts talking with one of the many women sleeping nearby (some of these woman seem to prefer sleeping barely clothed; some in hammocks, some in cots).  The blonde mentions how she can't sleep with all these other women nearby as she was attacked at school by some women.  Emmanuelle \\"comforts\\" her with some of the other women looking on. <br /> <br />When Emmanuelle arrives at her new Asian home, she finds an unexpected guest, a male pilot.  After finding that pilot, wife and husband try to make up for being apart for 2 months but husband has an appointment.  After the meeting, the husband and wife are able to make up for lost time.   <br /> <br />Emmanuelle goes out on the town shopping with the pilot, and ends up receiving an acupuncture massage in front of the pilot.  While receiving the massage, Emmanuelle nude massage, she fantasizes about her husband, while the pilot looks on with disgust. <br /> <br />There are numerous interesting scenes, besides the ones already mentioned, including: Emmanuelle visits a dance study and spots a machine with an erotic/bondage picture show inside (hand-drawn), and while watching is visited by the dance instructor;  Emmanuelle, her husband, and a young blonde friend visit a special massage parlorwhere all the customers are messaged by women, who start off using their hands, but who quickly use their naked bodies against their naked clients, front and back (a very interesting massage parlor (actually it is a place where people are cleaned using soap and asian women); Emmanuelle visits a nightclub filled with naked (some dressed or semi-dressed) women, and men having fun (most of the women are asian and most of the men are in uniforms); then their is the scene where Emmanuelle and her husband have fun with the blonde woman (Anna Marie) from the parlor.   <br /> <br />Emmanuelle is less naive in this film and takes pleasure everywhere she can find it. <br /> <br />Interesting music choice, I kept expecting to see that guy from the Incredible Hulk TV show to turn up, similar sounding music.  (4.45)
B0007XT87G|5.0|This new PT recording is one of their finest works yet.  Another classic to add to their fine catalog of albums. <br /> <br />The song Deadwing is a fine example of progressive rock with a King Crimson feel helped by Adrian Belews guitar work, but still pure SW in essence. <br /> <br />Shallow is the best choice for radio play and it is clear the song was influenced with that goal in mind. It deserves full radio playlist rotation.  <br /> <br />Lazarus is another example of SW's ability to turn a somber ballad into a beautiful peice of work. <br /> <br />With Halo the record really hits it stride.  This song is one of PT's finest (among many) and the background guitar wash and guitar synth work of Adrian Belew only further enhances the power of how both the lyrics and music form into a entrancing, thought provoking song. <br /> <br />From that point on the album simply goes from strength to strength.  In my opinion they have reverted to the pre In Absentia feel while retaining the power of that record.  It is more progressive than their first three records, but attains the dreamy, floating qualities of those albums and using the power progressive techniques of In Absentia to fuse a new PT sound that truly puts them on a level with the best progressive rock bands of all time. <br /> <br />Combine this with the recent Blackfield album and Stephen Wilson is carving out a solid spot as a fusion rock genius. <br /> <br />Jack Douglas
B0002NRRAG|1.0|Here's an idea, how about we try to imitate a legendary jazz icon, not have any original songs and capitalize on this and hope people nobody notices. That seems to be Madeline Peryoux plan. Unfortunately for her she picked Billie Holiday whose voice is so distinctive that I, who am not knowledgeable about Billie Holiday, can tell the difference. Not only that her singing irritates my ears which is weird because the few times I listened to Billie Holiday I enjoyed it, but Billie also had the ability to connect with the listeners, an ability Ms. Peryoux lacks. I suggest that instead of listening to a Billie Holiday imitator invest in the real thing.
0596007124|4.0|This book gives the same concepts as many other books. But, what makes this book stand out in the crowd is the presentation style. The concepts I learn from Head First series books stick in my mind forever. Must read for learning design patterns, without slipping into sleep :-)
B00005JKGO|5.0|Everybody wants to live the sweet life, but what is the sweet life? Poor Marcello is trying to figure that out in La Dolce Vita.<br /><br />There is a Buddhist story that goes like this: a man searches for enlightenment, but cannot find it. A wise priestess tells him, \\"When something good happens, good. When something bad happens, good. Give thanks for everything.\\" The man comes back after three years of trying to follow this lesson and says, \\"I still have not found enlightenment\\". The priestess said, \\"Give thanks for everything.\\" The man suddenly understood.<br /><br />Basically, you know, this is what Fellini's films are about. I mean, this is what Fellini is expressing in showing us the world he creates. Thanks for everything. Embrace this life in all its strange, stupid, useless, ridiculous and sublime beauty. His characters cannot do it...that's where the pathos comes in. But, as a filmmaker, Fellini does. Whatever subtext may exist, the basic core of post-realist Fellini filmmaking is this embrace.

B00005JNQ8|4.0|Words have a significant meaning when expressed with genuine honesty.  This is also the easiest way of communicating, as it quickly can convey the meaning of something important.  When communicating in a different language, skills are necessary to decipher the foreign language.  If the language skills are lacking, or not proficient, it could lead to misinterpretations, which could have dire consequence.  Thus, it is essential for an interpreter to be able to translate a language proficiently without errors in order to eliminate misunderstandings.  When Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman) works at the United Nations (UN) Headquarters in New York, she translates different languages and she is fully aware of the importance of clear and concise interpretation.<br /><br />The Interpreter opens in Matobo, a small African nation amidst brutal ethnic cleansing, where the audience witnesses the cruelty of weapons and hateful teachings.  This brutality provides some hints to what the story is about, yet it leaves the audience in complete darkness as it is not clear how these characters are related to the story, as it takes place in New York.  One evening after a failing metal detector Silvia returns to her working place, the UN Headquarters, to pick up a bag that she left behind.  As Silvia enters the room with her bag she accidentally hears a conversation in a foreign langauge, which she was not intended to hear.  What was said, remains a mystery to the audience, as subtitles are not provided, which enhances the suspense in the story.<br /><br />Eventually Silvia figures out the seriousness of the conversation that she overheard, as she reports it to the security of the UN Headquarters.  Consequently, the Secret Service arrives to the location in order to investigate the situation headed by Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) who personally is struggling with the loss of his wife.  When Tobin and Silvia meet for the first time there is tension, as Tobin finds her insincere, yet he cannot place his finger on what makes him feel this way.  Nonetheless, the audience learns while the story unfolds that this political thriller has a several layers colored by personal feelings and powerful political undercurrents sweeping through the UN and the Big Apple.  Cleverly, the director Sydney Pollack only discloses the crucial facts at the critical moment, yet it is also here where some of the weakness rest within the story.<br /><br />One of the more important notions conveyed through the film is the importance of forgiveness.  Initially, Silvia tells Tobin about a custom in Matobo where they do not utter the name of the dead until the mourning feel that they can move on.  She also tells him about the tradition where they throw a murderer into the river while the surviving victims can choose to save or let the murderer drown.  If the survivors decide to let the person drown they live and will continue to live in disharmony, as they have acquired their vengeance.  Yet, harmony can be salvaged by saving the murderer from drowning.  Another layer of the story that Pollack illustrates is the blindness of vengeful hatred and anger, which flushes away any kind of existing sympathy.  Tobin thoroughly describes in a scene what he would do to the murderer, as clouded thoughts prevent him from seeing nothing but retribution.  The film cleverly depicts the aftermath of anger while it balances with harmonious forgiveness through both Tobin and Sylvia who are mere pawns in the big political game at the UN Headquarters.<br /><br />The Interpreter offers an intelligent political thriller that does balance human emotions with politics through the main characters.  Being able to shoot the film on location, the UN Headquarters, helped developed a genuine atmosphere where the audience can feel the tension between the nations and the individuals in the film.  It also offers an opportunity for the audience to reflect over the seriousness of the matter in the backdrop of recent political events in the world, which also builds up more anticipation and suspense.  Yet, the true treasure of the film rests within the emotional aspect of the story, as it provides a honorable lesson of human existence.  Unfortunately, some of these aspects come across a little too strong, as it almost feels too blissful and overly righteous.t political events in the world, which also builds up more anticipation and suspense.

B0007CNXUK|5.0|As a kid I never really cared about Peter Pan.  The story was boring to me and I never gave it much thought at all.  I went to see this film because I love Johnny Depp and I must see all of his pictures.  Needless to say I was completely blown away. <br /> <br />\\"Finding Neverland\\" is one of those films that is all too rare in American cinema these days.  This movie tells one of the sweetest and most heartful stories I have ever heard.  I am sure certain liberties have been taken with the \\"trueness\\" of its tale, but regardless, this film and its story are a pure joy to watch.  The filmmakers struck pure gold.  The set design, direction, and atmosphere of the film are perfect.  They suck the audience into the story and set the tone perfectly.  And the acting.....This is by far my favorite Kate Winslet performance.  It's not her most fun role, or even her most challenging, but I believe it is her most caring and genuine.  The same can be said of Johnny Depp.  As the main \\"grown-ups\\" in this film about four boys, it was extremely important that the actors portraying the children's parent (Winslet) and best-friend (Depp) love children and be able to relate to them not as kids, but as people.  That's why I love this movie.  Johnny, Kate, and the entire story treat children as they deserve to be treated: as real, important, awesome people.  This movie is awesome because it respected, nourished, and loved everything that is brilliant about childhood, and the adult actors obviously respected and loved childhood an equal amount.   <br /> <br />This is a calming, beautiful, happy story that was snubbed out of its obvious best picture win because the Academy has no use for happy, loving, family films.  This is the kind of movie we need more of.  The kind that puts smiles on faces and calmness in our hearts.  Watch this movie and you'll see what I mean.
B0006399FS|5.0|Definitely not as innovative as their past works but much better than a lot of the noise out there today. After a decade in the 90's of not really knowing who U2 are, I'm somewhat glad that recently the band has become more vulnerable instead of hiding behind shades. This definitely shows up in the song-writing where Bono gives honest lyrics with an honest voice in this society where cynicism is getting quite boring (and conforming). Instead of conforming to the darkness and hiding behind the cynicism of this postmodern society, U2 blatantly does the opposite, rebelling against the expected. True rock n' roll form. And true to U2 form to have a sound just outside of what's \\"in\\" at the moment. Even Edge's melodic, cathedral-like guitars are ringing louder than ever as if to point a way out of our self-absorbed whinings. Technically, the sound doesn't break much new ground but perhaps we've been spoiled by the 80's U2 to the 90's U2 to the '00 U2 transitions. How many ways can a great band top itself? You'd be hard-pressed to find a band these days that can even create as original a sound as U2 has carved out for itself. Let alone being able to tweek it over two decades. I'm giving How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb five stars for it's refreshingly honest look on the landscape of rock and life while maintaining excellent lyrical and musical craftmanship.
B0006FFRVQ|1.0|Don't buy this. While you might be thinking \\"Hey- this is neat! I get a DVD and CD on one disc!\\", the reality is that you're really just getting a DVD. The CD side isn't really a CD and is unplayable on many CD players (like the one in your car or some disc changers) and on computers. The CD insert says: \\"The audio side of this disc does not conform to CD specifications and therefore not all DVD and CD players will play the audio side of this disc\\". Save a few dollars and buy the real CD version and avoid these unusable fake CDs.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|Metallica: Some Kind of Monster introduces Metallica through a documentary filmed between 2001 and 2003, as the remaining members were working on their record St. Anger.  Whether you are a fan or not the documentary offers a radiantly transparent view of one of the most celebrated heavy metal bands, as they share their personal struggles with the process of making the record.  It dives into the social group dynamic and it portrays the personal psychology of each member of the band.  The film also depicts former members and their experience within the band, which offers additional insight to the dynamic of the band.  The accumulation of information presented offers a truly genuine cinematic experience of Metallica's identity.<br /><br />A reporter asks James Hetfield to describe Metallica's career with one word, a question that James seems to struggle with for a long time.  The beginning of the documentary seems to provide the beginning on the search for this word as the bass player, Jason Newstead, announces that he is leaving Metallica, as he does not feel that the band offers him a chance to fully develop his artistic qualities.  This is the beginning on a long uphill and narrow path, which they have to follow in order to save the band. For this purpose, they hire a therapist and performance coach, Phil Towle, to help them recover from the backlashes that the group dynamic generates.  Phil facilitates group meetings much like a marriage counselor, as he tries to save the band's future.  Through these meetings, the remaining members Lars Ulrich, James Hetfield, Kirk Hammett, and producer Bob Rock get to vent their concerns that lie close to their hearts.<br /><br />In a sense, the ordeal with Phil creates awkwardness, as there is a general preconceived notion of Metallica's identity.  Metallica has shaped their stage identity over decades of performances where they have displayed an overtly tough, rock-n-roll, and \\"I-do-not-care\\" attitude.  These weathered and hardnosed rock artists seeing a counselor does not fit in with the profile they have worked hard on to create around them.  Yet, it is in this awkwardness where the audience will discover the true identity of the individuals in Metallica.  A humane and compassionate side emerges, as the viewers are allowed into their personal lives where they can view their hobbies, hear their thoughts, and see how they behave while trying to create songs together.<br /><br />One of the most intriguing portions of the film is the brief moment of genius that delivers thoughts and ideas for the songs.  Together with the ideas and the relentless hard work, Metallica puts in their work in order to find a way to perfect their creations such as Sweet Amber, Some Kind of Monster, and Frantic.  Through the thousands of hours that Metallica endured in their recording studios where they tweaked and changed the sound and words of their songs and tunes the audience gets to see the source of their material.  Creativity pours out from their experiences and repressed feelings, which delivers a caged and furious monster.  This monster screams to get out, and on the record St. Anger, the audience can hear Metallica's rage of this monster free itself.  Despite the seemingly hostile material Metallica does a brilliant job of exorcising their own demons, as they visit the San Quentin Prison to express their feelings through their lyrics and tunes.<br /><br />Ultimately, Metallica: Some Kind of Monster provides a genuine story of how a personal struggle can affect a group of people.  The film does not depict the greatness, or the inadequacies of Metallica.  It simply depicts a small group of men trying to find a solution to a problem, instead of being a part of the problem.  This notion elevates the cinematic experience far above average cinema, as it truly offers some valuable lessons to ponder.  The product of the pain and suffering that the band went through gave them a chance to reunite and once again create an outstanding record offering much more than just mere words and head banging. Yet, one words seems to echo through the documentary, and it is the word anger, maybe this was the word that James was contemplating.again create an outstanding record offering much more than just mere words and head banging. Yet, one words seems to echo through the documentary, and it is the word anger, maybe this was the word that James was contemplating.
B00005JNVS|4.0|i saw this movie in theaters last night. it was very good since the special effects were nice. and i kept laughing from beginning to end.
0385510454|2.0|Frommer's guide to Italy may be more interesting. <br />Definitely not his best work. <br />It was light, quick reading though, and with the dark, rainy day on 04/23/05 in Boston, I breezed thru the book in a few hours. <br />I gave it 2 stars coz I finally know that I should not order capuccino after 10:30 AM! Hah!
B00000IFP6|5.0|Just got this set and haven't listened to all of it. But what I've heard is excellent: great sound, precise, interesting tempi. And this morning I listened to the Eroica. This is a piece I've heard for 40 years, but Zinman's treatment of the slow movement was just breathtaking. For the first time I really felt it as a funeral march. It brought tears to my eyes and made the hair on the back of my head stand up. This is a very powerful, very distinctive, reading of Beehtoven.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|Ok. I really hate when people do this, but I have to say that this movie is NOT what it's cracked up to be. I love the music to the movie and was excited to see it, but my excitment wore off quickly. The movie starts with a black and white prologue which I thought fit very well. I've seen the play version, and because they can't do that onstage, I thought that this was a good effect for the movie. As the movie travels back in time to where our story begins, the theatre morphs into a beautifully colored theatre. It was a good choice. They used the computer graphics well here. The plot begins to move along and we are then introduced to Christine. I thought that she was a pretty girl and seemed to fit the role. Then, she began to sing. What came out though, was not at all what I expected. The entire time I was cringing because she was desperatly trying to hit those notes which  she doesnt seem able to hit very well. Because this is an opera, I was expecting an opera. That is not how she sang. She had a pretty voice but it she wasnt strong enough to play an opera singer. Her voice was trained for more of modern genre of singing. When the Phantom comes in to her world and takes her to his cave, I was excited. My favorite song was coming up. Again, disapointed. His voice was extremely too modern for this type of music. It is an OPERA. The actress playing Meg had the best voice in the film. I suggest they should have put a curly wig on her and made her Christine. One last problem with the film is that they overly produced this film. Everything they shot was trying to so pretty and beautiful, but didnt concentrate on any other part of the film. When riding in the boat to the Phantom's cave, it was so bright and colorful and didnt match with what the mood was. This part is very entrancing and needed to be more mysterious and dark. What just thought was hilarious, is how when Christine crosses over into the Phantom's world, she turns into a whore. All of the sudden she has ALOT more make-up on, her boobs are pushed to her chin, and she was showing a lot of leg. To me, this movie created an ok atmosphere for some parts, but for the rest were way too modern. If you are looking for a very modern overly produced, overly hyped movie, then this is for you. Maybe the fact that I had seen it before is the reason I discovered all of these flaws. But I was very little...maybe 7 when I first saw it, so I'm not going to blame it on that. You can think what you want, but I've said my peace. Not at all what I expected. Don't expect too much.

B00028HBKM|1.0|This is an appalling film.  I really can't think of a single good thing to say about it.  Aspects of it made me feel sick.  Other apects just left me bewildered.  Why, for instance, is the whole thing shot in Aramaic, while all the actors are white Europeans?  If Gibson was going for realism, to the point of forcing the actors to speak a totally different language, why cast a white Christ when the true Jesus of Nazareth was Middle Eastern?  Getting to more serious points, this film has no emotional depth, no complexity, indeed no real feeling at all.  Jesus, who lived and suffered as a man, with all the complex temptations that human flesh is heir too, is reduced to a Hollywood action hero whose suffering consists of painful scenes of scourging and little else.  The latent, and sometimes not so latent, anti-semitism is coupled with a computer-generated devil that reduced the entire audience where I was to fits of giggles.  Perhaps American audiences are less intellectually demanding about their films but I have to say I came away from this feeling insulted.  If you want to see a moving portrayal of the Christ story find a copy of The Gospel According to Saint Matthew which won the praise of everyone from the Vatican to the Marxist-Christian freedom-fighters in Latin America.  The only people who can possibly enjoy the passion are the Bush-voting American Fundamentalists whose understanding of Chrisitianity is as subtle as their awareness of the world outside their own 'backyards'
B00003CXZ4|5.0|A wonderful film that I almost turned off halfway. I'm glad I didn't, because I really didn't see the \\"ending\\" of the film coming (it's absolutely not the \\"end\\" of the story by any means). It was satisfyingly surprising and made me re-think the entire film. If you start getting antsy, just hang tight, things will reveal themselves by the movie's end.  <br />As you probably know by now, the film jumps backwards in 15 minute increments to something that happened before the scene we were just shown. Things you thought were \\"truth\\" now become questionable and I must add that things that were questionable sometimes are more so as a result of these \\"flashbacks\\". <br /> <br />(Spoiler below) <br />From the mix of untrustworthy characters (including a fabulous acting feat by both Carrie Ann-Moss as the woman we're not sure if we want to trust, and Joe Pantoliano as the man we don't know if we can trust) - I was left wondering if the main character really knew what he was doing and if really it was *he* who was the one manipulating people. There are no ready answers to this question, however. <br />Mind blowingly awesome. A must see.
B000001EL3|3.0|As one reviewer in the seventies said, \\"The only album whose title tells you what to do with it.\\" Now I think that's a bit harsh but... Kiss have always scorred a fairly high mark on the cheesometer but when they are raw and energetic such as on the Alive album they are a fun and rocking listen. Unfortunately for producer they chose Bob Ezrin of Alice Cooper fame, Blue Oyster Cult and later the producer/ruiner of Pink Floyds epic showtune monstrosity The Wall. Bob might have worked for Alice but not Floyd and his over the top production style is completely unsuited for Kiss. He proves his unworthyness by tarting Destroyer up with tons of reverb, choirs and strings?!?!  Now on the plus side this was the best sounding guitar Kiss got in the studio to date. On the down side this is the album that brought us the goddawful ballad and hit \\"Beth.\\" Oh what a stinking pile of non-rocking poop that song is. Come on Peter, Kiss were about partying every day, and screwing as many groupies as humanly possible. Nobody wants to hear a sentimental and cloying love song to your wife. What the hell does that have to do with Kiss or rock and roll?<br /><br />At it's worst moments of over-produced hell Destroyer comes off as pretentious and silly. For example the ridiculous song Great Expectations has this huge chorus and strings while the lyrics are about what Gene Simmons is going to do to a female fan.  It reminds me of the scene in Spinal Tap when Nigel Tufnel plays a beautiful piano piece and when asked the title says \\"Lick My Love Pump\\".  Its like watching a Las Vegas porno version of Mozart's Don Giovanni. The cheesometer is pegging the red!  Were Kiss that unselfconsciously pompous or were they masters of high camp?  Sometimes it seems as though Bob Ezrin is poking fun at Kiss, their fans and rock and roll pretentions when he aggrandizes simple rock songs with layers of chorus, strings, etc.  If Kiss ditched the stings and scraped off the other Ezrin provided gloop, told Peter to keep his \\"love\\" songs for his solo album and kept the good guitar sound, this would get a higher rating.  As it is though it borders on seventies rock parody.er to keep his \\"love\\" songs for his solo album and kept the good guitar sound, this would get a higher rating.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|A HUGE fan of Buffy, I was a little skeptical of this series. The premise sounded dumb, and I wasn't sure I would like it. Then, I remembered how ridicuous Buffy sounded at first... so I gave it a chance. I was not disappointed. This show contains just the right mixture of comedy and drama to make an excellent series that was cancelled way before its time. Luckily, Universal saw the potential and picked it up. The trailer looks awesome, and Sept. 30 cannot come soon enough.
B000002H2H|5.0|Every song on this CD is phenominal.  Don't pay attention to the ones ripping on Escape and Trapped Under Ice.  If anything, Fade To Black is the weakest (except for the bridge).  And to that little f*cknut who said ride the lightning is cheesy cause mustaine wrote some lyrics, if you ask me, i think that makes it one of the best songs off the album.  Dave is a WAY better songwriter than James.  James always writes about depression, death, same sh*t.  But i could really give a sh*t what they say, i just like the music.  If you are questioning this album, its worth your money, trust me.
140004281X|3.0|These stories are gorgeous, beautiful pieces with a lot of charm and bittersweet flavors. However, not one of the characters seemed someone I would identify with or care too much about. They all seemed to be controlled and as cold as their northern settings. I understand why readers would admire Munro's writing style and even enjoy these stories, which are all very carefully written with a certain wry fatalistic viewpoint. Munro's truly skilled and talented, but I like to feel a bit more for the characters I read about. I can't tell if the stories didn't live up to the hype, or if they just weren't for me. Because certainly there isn't a lot to criticize with Munro's prose. She's an astute observer and wonderful writer; these particular stories just didn't grab me as I hoped they would.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|How sad, how sad.  With such rich material to mine, the filmmakers come up with such predictable drek... <br /> <br />Mr Depp is completely mis-cast. Mumbles his way through the entire film trying to impress us how good his Edinburgh accent is. It's like watching  Meryl Streep. Neither one of them hold up well as the years go by. This, like so many of hers, sadly, is the performance of an automaton, not a flesh and blood human. <br /> <br />Kate W fares much better - as does the remarkable Ms Christie. All else fails. The children are sweet, and notable in fact, but cartoon characters in the end. <br /> <br />The film suffers greatest at the hands of its 'director' - or directors/producers. All the imagination that could have been summoned up by the VIEWER is hammered home by completely unnecessary special effects and 'dream' sequences. <br /> <br />Terribly disappointing. This is rendered worse than a formula TV movie where Patty Duke gets cancer and is 'helped over'. <br /> <br />The music swells. The tears comes to the children. Mr Depp demurs. <br /> <br />But emptiness ABOUNDS, here. Precisely what Mr barrie would have abhorred.

0375701427|4.0|I do not intend to sound pedantic and I will only offer it as it's important to make a point, but then I happened to read this book after reading a novella by Balzac (namely _The Duchess of Langeais_). It's strange that I simply loved all three parts of the \\"late Zuckermann\\" trilogy, as Roth's opulent, lush prose (of course taken from Proust's, but with Roth's own slant) never fails to entice me. But then it's strange that Balzac, when writing about Restoration France, never fails to expose _all_ sides of a given issue, as all of his characters, even the very minor one, never fail to have the best reasons -according to each one's lights- to think and act in a given manner. The result is that, even when Balzac is writing a very short story, you never fail to discern the movement of a whole society behind the tale. Roth, writing about 1960s USA, cannot rise himself to that degree of proficiency. He remains stranded unto this most American temptation, the drive to moralize, and cannot accept all of his characters as they are, therefore the fact that, when trying to offer 1960s history in a nutshell, as it reflects itself onto the life of a family, he cannot offer but a one-sided picture, that of his main character the likeable and failed Seymour \\"Swede\\" Levov,while Levov's antagonists - his wife Dawn, his psycopathic daughter Merry, cannot raise themselves beyond caricature.It's strange that the best part of the trilogy _\\"The Human Stain\\"_, is that where the chief character is the one from which Roth is most removed, as Roth's empathy seems to develop in a detrimental way as far as devopment of the \\"bad\\" characters is concerned. To put it short, Roth somehow failed, but his failure remains, nonethless, an impressive one.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Having not purchased the last two Green Day CDs, I wasn't sure what to expect.  I just knew I had to buy it the first time I heard \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\".  What a mature and veteran rock/punk sounding song.  I cracked open the plastic and gave it a spin.  I really wasn't prepared for what I was about to hear... <br /> <br />What a superb CD!  They not only brilliantly captured the current political issues with their lyrics, but have risen to the next musical level with the quality of song/chord structure.  This is an extremely strong album, with much variety and should see a minimum of three nominations at the next Grammy's, including \\"Album of the Year\\"...and that's not a stretch! <br /> <br />My favorites are \\"Boulevard\\", \\"Holiday\\" and \\"American Idiot\\".  The remaining songs are very good, but these are the ones I enjoy listening too.  Also, you get a few more songs than normal.  Many of the CDs today contain about 10-12 songs, this gives you about 17 (including the sub-songs), if my math is correct. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  Buy this CD!  If nothing else for the sharp political lyrics and masterful song work.  You won't be disappointed!
B00007LTIL|5.0|\\"American Beauty\\" is a testament to what the Grateful Dead were capable of if they put their minds to making great music.<br /><br />The Garcia-Hunter songwriting team hits its stride with this album.  Over about a three-year period from 1969-72, those two fellows wrote most of (not \\"all\\" as I'd written previously) the songs on this album, \\"Workingman's Dead\\" (which includes \\"Uncle John's Band,\\" \\"Casey Jones,\\" and \\"Cumberland Blues\\") the non-covers on the live \\"Grateful Dead\\" (i.e. \\"Bertha,\\" \\"Wharf Rat\\") and \\"Europe '72 (i.e. \\"He's Gone,\\" \\"Tennessee Jed,\\" \\"Ramble On Rose,\\" \\"Brown-eyed Woman.\\"), songs for Jerry Garcia's first solo album (\\"Sugaree,\\" \\"The Wheel,\\" \\"Bird Song\\" \\"The Deal\\" among others) and \\"Wake of the Flood\\" (\\"Here Comes Sunshine,\\" \\"Mississippi Half Step Toodle-ooo\\"). That's quite an output!  After that, they slowed down considerably, and the band made itself a lengthy career performing sets all over the world for 20 more years, sets that largely consisted of songs from this period.<br /><br />This album is the best of them all, because the Dead put their heart into making this recording.  It is a close, intimate record, with only one real rock song, lots of acoustic guitar, Garcia's magnificent pedal steel, and David Grisman mandolin, and harmony singing that is fully the equal of CSNY, the Band or Simon & Garfunkel on songs like \\"Attics of My Life\\" and \\"Brokedown Palace.\\"  Phil Lesh is brilliant on this album; he is the glue that gives this album its subtle swing and sonic thickness.<br /><br />We can't ask our favorite artists to always be peaking.  Not every album can be \\"Pet Sounds\\" or \\"Sticky Fingers,\\" not even if their creators are geniuses.  So it goes--the Dead never equalled \\"American Beauty,\\" and it's hard to understand why not. But at least we have this, and it's a musical miracle that will always sound fresh.
014100018X|5.0|\\"I know everyone's favorite\\" Vianne would tell her customers as she handed them boxes of chocolate and just like Vianne I know that Chocolat is going to be one of the best books you will ever read.   <br /> <br />Joanne Harris does an excellent job of depicting the magical world versus reality.  She emphasizes the influence that Vianne's magical powers have on the townspeople of Lansquenet.  By opening up a chocolate shop in this small Christian town during the season of Lent, Vianne creates controversy between herself and the \\"divine\\" priest, Francis Reynaud.  Throughout the story Reynaud's crusade to oust Vianne from the town reaches a climax when during his fast he is tempted to eat the chocolate.  His hypocritical actions throughout the book develop the theme of the the hypocritical self-proclaimed righteous believers vs. the true Catholics who demonstrate their faith in both words and actions. <br /> <br />The journal style and the carefree approach Joanne used to write Chocolat brought me back to my childhood.  I would recommend Chocolat to readers of all ages, but I would suggest to buy a bag of chocolate before you begin reading this book!
B000002UJQ|5.0|Let me say to everyone that this is one of the best albums of the 90's. This is the album that made me become extremely open-minded about music. Right at the start of this album you may think, wow what junk. Put if you take a few listens and pay attention this a beautifully crafted cd. Karma Police is a perfect example. Upon hearing this song I wanted to throw this cd out the window, but for some reason this song stuck in my head..and so did all of the other songs. Anyone who calls the cd overrated or horrible needs to get their head checked.
0743455967|5.0|I admit it, I was never a fan of Stephen King. I'm more into gentle fiction, not scary stuff.  But, this book had me from the first sentence. When I finishing my third book and beginning my fourth and already behind deadling, I bought this book for encouragement. Loved it. Then gave it away to someone else who must not have known what a gift I was giving them, and now, I miss it so much, I'm buying it again.  It's that good!  And I stand as out there on the sidelines as someone who loves the book just for what it is, not for anything the author has written previously.  If you are a published author, or a wannabe or just someone who wants to see the inside track of one author...this book is for you.
B000003TA4|1.0|Thats what I begin to tell myself everyday why? why did my English teacher have to make my class review \\"landmark\\" albums of the 90's. And why was I stuck with Nirvana's Nevermind? The ironic thing is Nirvan's nevermind is not even close to a landmark album at all. Nirvana has to be one of the most overrated bands of all time. With Kurt Cobain's shrilled voice and wretched guitar skills it makes me wonder. Kurt Cobain can only play 3 cord guitar riffs which I can learn to master in under 15 minutes. Im not going to be on of those jerks and say \\"I'm happy Kurt is dead\\" because thats wrong, he is a human being and did not deserve to die. But that still doesnt give me sympathy to call this a good album. Most of the songs sound the same, and with the wretched guitar riffs it makes you wonder how stupid rolling stone is by putting Kurt Cobain 5th all time greatest guitarists.
B00005JMX6|1.0|The humor is pratically identical to that of the American Pie series. The story line is pretty much the same, except the pornagraphy plot is more prominent. The stars are all perfect looking and cant act. This is just more of the same from all the previous teen romance/comedies. And I dont see what the big deal is with Elisha Cuthbert. I know about 10 girls from one of my class who are just as pretty as she is. But thats America cinema's just working its magic. Put a young and sexy and talentless girl in a movie where shes getting her brains ****** out or nude or drunk(or all three which is usually the case) and the next thing you know shes the biggest star in the world. Same concept applied to Shannon Elizabeth in American Pie and to Paris Hilton after her home sex video went on sale. Seriously, we as movie lovers appreciate a film maker's artistic vision and all that, but the banality of this movie and other teen flicks is just giving me a reason to switch headache medicine.  Do you think for once we can go back to making films where the people watching can think with their head and not with their (...)?
B0000029GA|5.0|That's just one of they many genuis rhymes of lyically gifted Nasir Jones a.k.a Nas. This IS the best rap album of the 90's. With amazing prodcution from DJ Premier, Nas puts down such sick rhymes upon the heavily addictive beats. What makes Nas such a good rapper is his amazing ability to adapt to a beat and tear it up. Not only are the beats addictive but he has such a talent for making lyrics that he is THE best mainstream rapper.
0441172717|5.0|One of the best scifi books ever written.  The imagination and the planning that had to go into these books is just simpley amazing.  Even though I don't agree with all of Frank Herbert's politics, the books are still amazing.  I would recomend this book to anyone who likes sci fi even though the reading is a bit tough, and i might take a few chapters to understand still a great book, well worth you money.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|I started out not wanting to like this album, after hearing \\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" on the radio several times. I found the vocals on that particular track kind of annoying. Vocalist/Guitarist Win Butler seems to be at times yelping. The hype surrounding the band last fall also had me wary, but then I heard several other tracks that made me change my mind and really like this album as a whole. The three songs that did it for me are \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\", \\"Wake Up\\" and \\"Rebellion\\".     \\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" is a powerful song with a sense of urgency, guitar chords mashing, xylophones(?), and even hand claps, as Butler warns us \\"And there's something wrong in the heart of man, you take it from your heart and put it in your hand!\\"    \\"Wake Up\\" has a soaring chorus as it relates a story of adults  trying to harden the hearts of children. The second half of the song then amazingly morphs into a Motown style stomp. The key moment on this song and one of the key emotional moments on the album is when Butler sings \\"We're just a million little god's causin rain storms turnin' every good thing to rust. I guess we'll just have to adjust!!\\" and the way when he hits the word \\"adjust\\" and that melds back into that soaring chorus...awesome.    \\"Rebellion\\" is my favorite song of all and I keep pressing repeat on this. It deals with distrust at a youthful age. It has a foot thumping steady beat and persistent piano notes carrying through most of the song and you just have to listen to the poignant violin on the outro. Magnificent.     \\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" and \\"Haiti\\" are a couple of other good tracks. The former dealing with teenage disillusion and the latter dealing with the historical political turmoil of that island nation. If there is one theme that stands out on \\"Funeral\\" it's that \\"us against them\\" attitude that young people have as they're growing up, of disillusion, of pain, maybe the feelings of being cheated and trying to stay brave in the face ofoncoming storms of adulthood.     There are a few tracks that don't compare to those preceding five tracks. \\"Neighborhood #4 (Kettles)\\" and \\"Crown of Love\\" meander around a bit not really going anywhere, and \\"In The Backseat\\" stretches out a bit too long. But even in these moments the Arcade Fire's lyrics hold the listener's (at least mine) attention. I find the band more consistently good lyrically than musically, in fact.    I agree with another reviewer who said this album is not for everyone, but if you like ambitious, emotional, dramatic music with excellent intelligent lyrics then you're probably going to like this.
B00003CX5P|4.0|If not for Jar Jar Binks, i would have given this a 5, but the only let down for this movie was Jar Jar, it is nice that George Lucas decided to go back and start from the begining since he has actually planed it this way when he sat down and started creating Star Wars, but come on George what's up with Jar Jar.

At the same time, in San Diego, DEA special agents Montel Gordon and Ray Castro work in a case to eliminate one of the most powerful Mexicans cartel, and when they catch Carlos Ayala, key contact, his wife Helena will be dragged to the squalid world of her husband in order to save both hers and her son's life. Histories of the innocents, the guilty, the manipulators and the victims connect all in Traffic, an excellent cinematographic piece that stands out for being a vehicle for entertainment that sends out an important message.<br /><br />An absolute triumph of direction, screenwriting and performances, Steven Soderbergh's film is a powerful \\"docudrama\\" that challenges our intelligence, impresses us and it affects us. The cast is sublime and everyone without exception offers a memorable interpretation. Each actor inhabits their space without nothing or nobody robbing their momentum.<br /><br />Stephen Gaghan's script slowly involve us in histories of common people, until we entered in the different worlds where their lives take place, from the vast and hard Mexican desert, passing by the most luxurious offices of Washington, to the suburbs where the drugs abound, waiting for their next victim.<br /><br />Soderbergh, a director capable of wonders, again improves himself giving the film a different look, using colors to represent diverse atmospheres and histories and using the camera-in-hand technique to intensify the realism of the scenes.<br /><br />Generally, the world of drugs is displayed in movies to reflect the self-destruction of the people who use them. In Traffic, is not about an affected person, the whole society is the victim, addicted in one way or other to this terrible affliction. Many people are in the incessant search of answers to end this situation. Answers that, -judging by Soderbergh and Gaghan's expositions of -, have never had effective solutions. The movie is not about criticisms, nor does try to propose ideas, is simply trying to show a reality where nobody will get away clean.offices of Washington, to the suburbs where the drugs abound, waiting for their next victim.<br /><br />Soderbergh, a director capable of wonders, again improves himself giving the film a different look, using colors to represent diverse atmospheres and histories and using the camera-in-hand technique to intensify the realism of the scenes.<br /><br />Generally, the world of drugs is displayed in movies to reflect the self-destruction of the people who use them.

B00003CXCT|5.0|In a Galaxy far far away, when my parents need to leave the house for a little bit and didn't want me to pick on the babysitter they would put these movies in and i wouldn't move until they were over.  I was extremly excited when they anounced they will release the original trilogy on DVD because i don't own a VCR anymore and the only time i got to watch them is when i went back home to my parents house, so i picked them up the same day they were released and watched all three the same night plus the extra's, if you love Star Wars this is a must have.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|I always thought that mathematics could drive a person crazy.<br /><br />After watching A Beautiful Mind, I could verify that my theory is not absolutely preposterous.<br /><br />This drama based on a real life history presents Russell Crowe as John Forbes Nash Jr, a mathematical genius whose mind goes through an intense trip from health to madness to health again. The complexity of the brain and its effects in human behavior are explored with a clarifying view in this film.<br /><br />Nash's story begins in 1947, when the \\"mysterious genius of West Virginia\\" arrives at Princeton to attend his studies. Obsessed with come up with a really original idea, Nash is most of the time solving complicated equations in the library, in the large windows of his room and even in the bar where he hangs out with his competitive companions.<br /><br />And it is on a simple day that the idea appears suddenly. His study in the theory of the game audaciously contradicts the Adam Smith's doctrine. One hundred and fifty years of accepted ideas suddenly are not fashionable anymore and Nash's life changes forever. Now working at the recognized MIT, Nash becomes involved with some Cold War investigations, while simultaneously his personal life gives a complete turn when he meets Alicia, a physics student and eventually, his future wife.<br /><br />But the dreamed life of Nash soon crumbles when they diagnose him paranoid schizophrenia. His genius becomes cloudy and from that moment, Nash must fight to apply the logic - the one that once served him to solve complicated theorems- to the disease that every day tries to moves him away more from reality.<br /><br />Narrated from Nash's point of view, the movie tries to baffle us by mixing reality with fantasy; a technique that effectively makes us understand how confused a mind can get.<br /><br />Russell Crowe offers a dramatic interpretation as Nash, as we see him age 40 years in screen. The actor takes a comfortable ride through the different facets of Nash, from the safe, arrogant genius, to the lost and tormented man that`s desperately trying to get rid of his demons.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly, as Alicia, complements Crowe in all senses. Desolated by the disease of her husband, Alicia fights under pressure to continue loving the upset genius and offering the emotional support that he needs so much.<br /><br />Although inevitably the movie falls with its sentimentality, A Beautiful Mind is a film that's worth watching. Is not about mathematics or the important merits Nash offered to the world. It's about his genius, and how he accomplished to control his delirious and how he became not only a person with a truly great mind, but also with a great heart.through the different facets of Nash, from the safe, arrogant genius, to the lost and tormented man that`s desperately trying to get rid of his demons.  <br /> <br />Jennifer Connelly, as Alicia, complements Crowe in all senses.

0451169514|5.0|If you only read on Stephen King book i would recommend \\"IT\\".  The way he develops his characters in this book is great, the way he makes you feel that these are your friends too, some you may have grown up with and you feel that you were there when the fought \\"IT\\".  Then they fall away from eachother, and 27 years later IT comes back and brings them all back together again after they had forgot about eachother and what they did 27 years ago.  Then, one of the most heart wrenching things i have read, and by Stephen King nonetheless is that after their task is done, the forget eachother again in a cloud which they can only almost touch in dreams.  It has been almost 27 years since \\"IT\\" last cause his havoc, will he come back or did they finally kill \\"IT\\", if you have read \\"Dreamcatcher\\", one would wonder with the spray paint written across the memorial \\"Pennywise Lives\\" I almost hope if Stephen can do it again with the same story telling as the first that he would revisit Derry again to fight \\"IT\\"
B000001FC0|5.0|\\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" was the first CD I ever bought, which I did about four months before I actually had a CD player (stockpiling for new technology is a dominant gene). But this was one of the first really hot CDs and it was where I got my infamous \\"three song rule.\\"  This rule states:  If you are interested in an album by a new group all you need to justify the purchase is for the album to have three solid songs you would like to have. This one offered up \\"Shout,\\" \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" and \\"Head Over Heels.\\"  The first two made it to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 and last one topped off at #3.  Of course the album went to the top of the charts as well, but more importantly there are other interesting tracks on the album besides the big three.  \\"Heads Over Heels\\" is actually part of a suite with \\"Broken,\\" and both \\"The Working Hour\\" and \\"Listen\\" are above average.<br /><br />This edition offers up extended mixes of \\"Shout\\" and \\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\" as bonus tracks, but they are hardly necessary to justify having this album in your music collection.  I still listen to \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" about once a month and there is always a touch of regret that Tears for Fears self-destructed. The group produced a rather unique blend of synth-pop that made it stand out from most of what was going on in 1985 and the lyrics would have made for nice essay questions on a psychoanalysis exam:<br /><br />They gave you life<br />And in return you gave them hell<br />As cold as ice<br />I hope we live to tell the tale<br /><br />Who would have thought that Arthur Janov's primal scream theory would result in deep lyrics?  But then the group's name comes from that same source and the whole idea was much more in evidence on their debut album \\"Hurting\\" (\\"Mad World\\" from that album is reworked to great effect by Michael Andrews and Gary Jules at the end of the cult film \\"Donnie Darko,\\" which also used \\"Head Over Heels\\" to make Tears for Fears the official group of the film).  Such ideas are still in evidence on this album, but if \\"Hurting\\" is about emotional pain then \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" is moving on to the healing process.  This is not exactly a concept album, but the songs do fit together in a way that suggests a definite sense of direction.  But then when they start singing about four leaf clovers and do a techno-rap song like \\"Mother's Talk\\" you are just going to lose people who are going to go back to the melodies and not bother to figure out the words and dive for deeper meanings.<br /><br />Looking at the writing credits on these songs you would have said Tears for Fears was clearly Roland Orzabal's group, but by the time Curt Smith bolted they had produced only one more album in three years which had one decent song on it. So Tears of Fears does not exactly come under the heading of a One Hit Wonder, but they certainly only had the solid really great album. However, unlike other groups you might point to in similar circumstances from this same time period (e.g., A-Ha, Mr. Mister), this was the group I really thought had the musical talent to build on.  In retrospect, I think it is clear that they did have the talent and Tears for Fears is arguably the most memorable \\"lost\\" group of that period.s are still in evidence on this album, but if \\"Hurting\\" is about emotional pain then \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" is moving on to the healing process.

B00003CXCT|5.0|I grew up with the movies and loved them all, and I agree that some of the changes Lucas made were not for the best.... okay I don't necessarily like any of them, but the heart is definitely still there.  No, I don't know the name of every creature that walks across the screen, and no I don't own every action figure of Luke Skywalker in existence, but they are great movies, and if you haven't seen them yet,  buy them or borrow them, whatever!  Love 'em, you'll be a fan for life, hate 'em... well at least you'll finally get all references that are still made on primetime TV.
B00004U8DU|5.0|After a couple of albums that were more noted for hit singles that smacked too much of pop music for their fans, namely 1968's &quot;Waiting for the Sun&quot; with &quot;Hello, I Love You&quot; and 1969's &quot;The Soft Parade&quot; with &quot;Touch Me,&quot; the Doors got back to their roots with &quot;Morrison Hotel.&quot; This is clear from the opening track on this 1970 album, the rock 'n' booze anthem &quot;Roadhouse Blues,&quot; which blasts this album into the stratosphere. Robbie Krieger's opening riff sets the tone and Ray Manzarek pounds away on the piano to establish the mood, with the whole thing capped off by Jim Morrison's vocalized howls. You can hear live versions of &quot;Roadhouse Blues,&quot; but unfortunately none of them were ever performed in the perfect locale, which would have been a bar. But you can imagine how great it would sound to hear this one blasting the top off of some juke joint.<br />There are not any hit singles on the group's fifth studio album, which is undoubtedly why it went over better with the fans of the Doors, even if it only made it to #4 on the Billboard album charts. To help validate the blues the Doors brought in the great sessions jazz guitarist Ray Neopolitan, albeit as a bass player (the Doors never really bothered with one). The requisite touch of the exotic can be found in songs like &quot;Waiting for the Sun,&quot; &quot;Queen of the Highway,&quot; and &quot;Indian Summer.&quot; Morrison, who was noticeably disengaged in terms of both his lyrics and his singing on previous albums, is back to waxing poetic big time, as evidenced by &quot;Ship of Fools,&quot; which mixes nihilistic imagery with prospects for hope. Again, Morrison is found commenting on the counterculture, singing about how &quot;Everyone was hanging out/Hanging up and hanging down/Hanging in and holding fast.&quot; Musically the instrumental break is where the group gets to indulge in some showmanship where the emphasis is decidedly on jazz and no longer on pop.<br />The other great track is &quot;Peace Frog,&quot; which comments on the &quot;Blood in the streets,&quot; but is more notable for Morrison's musings on an episode from his childhood in some of his most searing imagery (e.g., &quot;Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding to death&quot;) and poetic (e.g., &quot;Blood is the rose of mysterious union&quot;). Again, Krieger and Manzarek provide the appropriate musical accompaniment to the verbal images of cultural unrest as the end of the turbulent Sixties being thrown out by Morrison. The Doors often commented on what was happening in the streets without ever offering a solution, and this song is one of their best efforts in that regard. One final track of note remains, and that would be the slow blues tune &quot;The Spy,&quot; simply because its music, if not its lyrics (e.g., &quot;I know the word that you long to hear/I know your deepest, secret fear&quot;), anticipates the last great Doors song to come on their final album, &quot;L.A. Woman.&quot;longer on pop. <br />The other great track is &quot;Peace Frog,&quot; which comments on the &quot;Blood in the streets,&quot; but is more notable for Morrison's musings on an episode from his childhood in some of his most searing imagery (e.g., &quot;Indians scattered on dawn's highway, bleeding to death&quot;) and poetic (e.g., &quot;Blood is the rose of mysterious union&quot;).

1400034779|5.0|I can't praise this book enough.  It is so gentle, so loving, and so reverent of its worthy heroine,  that we cannot help but fall in love with her.  As a student of Africa, I greatly appreciated McCall Smith's successful attempt to convey the dignity and humor of Tswana culture and of the profoundly sensible and human characters he created.  <br /> <br /> But you definitely do not have to have any prior knowlege of Africa whatsoever to appreciate this easy, heartwarming and uplifting read.  This is a great book if you're feeling down as it reminds you of the kindness of so many people and of all the important values in life.  Definitely a classic.  NOT a mystery but a work of literature that will make you smile all the way through.  I don't know why it's sometimes classified as a mystery.   <br /> <br />I promise you you will not be disappointed by this book or by the sequels! <br />
1400031567|5.0|Mr. Mankell's story about a bizarre Geromino-Hoover serial killer is a great study of life inside and outside the police department. All his characters are finely drawn, and the atmosphere is fairly dripping with fluid description. Inspector Wallender is among the very best of today's thoughtful and slightly burned out police detectives, and the social background here is done beautifully,too. The 3 flaws are(1) we know the killer too soon, which makes this reviewer less likely to turn the pages,(2) Wallender's forgetfulness of losing his keys,(3)his forgetfulness in checking out photos of the crime scene.This gives away nothing in this otherwise near perfect realistic, contemporary European thriller.
B0007XT87G|5.0|It's interesting to see the diversity of opinion about this album.  Some dedicated PT fans seem to hate it.  Others think it's the best yet.  The diversity of musical tastes seem to parallel the diversity of expression that I have seen throughout the evolution of this amazing band.  But I think it's safe to say that Steven Wilson has begun moving away from the \\"floyd-ish\\" mockery he began with, and is now moving deeper into his own well of musical ideas.  We may not all appreciate the directions he takes us, but he has found voice, and he shouldn't be beholden to us.    My overall impression is that, as Porcupine Tree struggles to be noticed by mainstream audiophiles, it continues to produce amazingly good music.  Steven Wilson's wry but melancholy vision has permeated every PT album from the band's inception, but over that span of time, his postulate has produced an increasingly refined and poetic (as well as dark) voice.    It took me a while to settle into Absentia, but it became my favorite and most played album as I kept finding new undertones and subtle meanings with each listen.  Deadwing is, in contrast, an instant fascination to me.  But again, one of the reasons I took to it right away was that I knew there was rich territory to explore.  This one will be with me for quite a while.    Superficially Deadwing could be considered the flip side to Absentia, but there are some significant differences to the project.  The orchestral backgrounds of \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" and \\"3\\" are missing from this new album, replaced by significant stanzas of \\"a capella\\" and sound effects.  The railcar sounds are reminiscent of \\"Off the map\\" instrumentals.    There is some guitar work here that I can trace directly back to Pink Floyd, a ripe field to which Steven frequently (perhaps too frequently?) returns.  (Listen to the instrumental portion of \\"Dogs\\" on the \\"Animals\\" album and you will pick it up.)  Hard to believe that 30-year-old music can still provide such fertile ground for contemporary sound.  I also hear some things that remind one of \\"Voyage 34\\".    It's the lyrics of Deadwing, as well as Absentia, that continue to pull me in, time after time.  In that sense, the two albums are a pair. The lyrics are the stake that the instrumentation drives true and painfully home -- and would it be unmanly of me to say that sometimes the combination brings a tear to my eye and an ache to my heart?  \\"Lazurus\\" and \\"Arriving Somewhere\\" are those kinds of songs, much like \\"Trains\\" on Absentia.    I'm curious about the message in the notes saying that the Deadwing project is an outgrowth of a screenplay written by Steven with Mike Bennion.  Is there a PT film in our future?
B00005JM02|5.0|The animation of this film is absolutely mind-boggling. Although being familiar with computers I still have no idea how Pixar managed to create this beautiful underwater world. In every scene the reflection of the sun sparkles through the water. Technically this film is a work a great art. <br />The storyline is strong and contains an undeniably pleasant moral: if parents were a bit more easy going and children were a tad more restrained then families would get on better. Along the way it also promotes understanding of differences in the way we are or behave.  <br />As usual with Pixar the humour is everywhere, from the Sharks Anonymous (who try to stop eating fish) to the Ninja crab and the laid back current surfing giant turtles. <br />This film is not only a thoroughly fascinating underwater ride but a beautiful showcase of American filmwork.  <br />A must for anyone who has children, nieces, godchildren ...
B00005JKWJ|4.0|Two things are prominent in this fast-paced, gory, adrenaline pumping sequel:  the action is non-stop and the Reaper vampires are some of the ugliest creatures committed to cinema, and impressively real-looking.  Wesley Snipes returns as Blade, the half-vampire/half-man killer who is recruited by a Nosferatu like vampire (played with quiet relish by Thomas Krestchmann) to rid the world of these mutant vampires who are impervious to silver, stakes and garlic; sunlight seems to be their only mortal enemy.  Snipes reunites with Kris Kristofferson and takes on nerdish Norman Reedus to join forces with \\"normal\\" vampires to wipe out these deadly new creatures.<br /><br />BLADE 2 moves like a tornado, with dazzling fight sequences, lots of flashy gore, and tremendous atmosphere from director Guillermo Del Toro (Hellboy).  Ron Perlman is on hand as a particularly nasty vampire whose cockiness and macho bravado is properly put in its place finally.  And Leonor Valera is beautiful as the vampire Nyssa.  Luke Goss gives fierce delivery to his role as the original Reaper.  There are a few surprises at the end, which gives BLADE 2 a powerful presence as a genre film.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|2004's SAW was and still is one of the best thrillers I've seen in quite a while.  First-time director, James Wan, along with first-time writer, Leigh Whannel, have concocted a smart, stylish, edgy, and boldly twisted movie about a serial killer whose goal is to place people in life or death situations in order to gain an appreciation for life.  This interesting concept focuses on Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) and his cellmate (Whannel).  They awake to find themselves chained to pipes in a \\"subterrainian bathroom\\" with a body laying in between them laying in a pool of blood holding a tape player and a gun.  Once the men find the tapes in their pockets they listen to their instructions: Lawrence must kill Adam by 6 pm or else Lawrence's wife (Monica Potter) and daugher (Mackenzie Vega) will die.  But why have these two men been chosen and are they telling the truth? <br /> <br />In a parallel story, Detective Tapp (Danny Glover) is on the hunt for the notorious \\"Jig-Saw Killer\\" after a run-in with the masked man doesn't go his way.  It's a match of wits as the time ticks down for him as well as the two prisoners. <br /> <br />Wan and Whannel crank up the suspense with only a couple scares, but they are surprising and well-executed.  This by no means detracts from the movie's creepy, industrial art-house look they were going for.  This is not so much a horror film as it is a suspense/crime thriller.  On a \\"shoe string\\" $1 million dollar budget, the movie is a masterwork and made with a nice grisly quality.  For first time makers and this limited budget, the end result doesn't show any signs of limitations.  Some seasoned vets don't make movies that look this good with this much attitude.  One can tell that these two men really believe in their debut. <br /> <br />Some of the best scenes are the flashbacks of the killer's victims.  Try not cringe as Amanda (Dena Meyer) is given just minutes to disembowel a living man in order to find the key in his stomach that willunlock her \\"reverse-beartrap\\" helmet or else have her jaws ripped clean off.  It's the few insanley twisted moments like this that really place SAW a cut above the rest.  Be warned, the violence isn't the most ever put on film that's for sure, but it is Rated R for strong grisly violence and language, and little is left to the imagination.  <br /> <br />Why 4 stars? Perhaps even 3.5?  Well, though the movie is well-made, original, and somewhat shocking, the acting, especially by its lead, Cary Elwes, is a bit campy and unbelieveable.  Maybe that's the fault of the director and writer? It isn't all terrible, but he fumbles just enough for it to become noticeable as some scenes play off as funny when they're definitely not supposed to. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a solid debut with plenty of jolts to keep your glued to your seat for just over an hour and a half.  It's disturbing, inventive, and for once, THE FINAL TWIST PAYS OFF BIG TIME!!!  Believe me, first-time viewers will not be disappointed and will find it surprisingly simple.  Perhaps that's why some people don't like the twist?  That's because they were fooled by something that was right in front of their eyes the whole time.  It's a great one nonetheless, and in my opinion, worth checking out.  I don't know what SAW 2 holds in store, and I doubt it will be nearly as good as its predecessor, but Wan and Whannel have made their impact.  I look forward to their upcoming projects because of their style and bold approach to the genre.
B00000IGGA|5.0|True, I was driving down the highway late last night after my last class I teach this semester and I figured maybe I was too hard on Springsteen so I put D&D in again and thought okay the first song has stupid lyrics (It's hard out here ain't it Bobbie, just devils and dust, heh heh heh-) and then further along that album goes I get this craving for a real song.  Some real passion, something that's not contrived and sterile, something that doesn't thank an over-hyped heavy metal producer for \\"Making my music better.\\" (What a joke!!)<br /><br />I dug through the pile in the little center compartment in my Forenza.  It was dark, too dark to see, there was a darkness everywhere.  I flicked on the Cheap plastic overhead light.  Shelby Lynn, Frank Black, The Wows, The Murphys, Elephant, Rancid, Sony CD-R's flew everywhere-I love all this stuff but I've played it to death and besides, I needed something to fill that void I only half-expected Bruce to fill.<br /><br />What did I find?<br /><br />Glory!!! A copy of Mule Variations!  Of course!  Somewhere in that rotating stack of 50 CD's I have in that center console is always at least three Tom Waits CD's.  I kissed it.  (When you are looking for a particular music fix and don't get it, you have to find it.  You have to go get it.  You need it.  You don't want philosophical anal sex with a prostitute played to fake strings and sung like a funeral durge...)<br /><br />In it went.<br /><br />Now home being forty minutes away was okay.  I smiled and tapped to Big in Japan.  Even his poem in the middle What's he building in there had a better sound than anything on D&D.  And then three songs that Bruce should be listening to if he truly wants to make his music better:  Hold on, House where nobody lives, and Come on Up to the House.<br /><br />Listen, Boss, you want to make your music better?  LISTEN TO TOM WAITS MORE!!!!<br /><br />Tom Waits is a songwriter.  He's our best, in my opinion.  I know those things are subjective.  But he is.  Mule Variations and Real Gone illustrate a songwriter at the top of his form, not someone needing props or retreads.<br /><br />Well the moon is broken<br /><br />And the sky is cracked<br /><br />Come on up to the house<br /><br />The only things that you can see<br /><br />Is all that you lack<br /><br />Come on up to the house<br /><br />All you have to do is listen.subjective.

B00005TT77|4.0|First, a warning: if you're the kind of person who holds Beatles music sacrosanct, and believes nobody but the Beatles should be playing Beatles songs, you'll probably  dislike this album intensely. Stay away from it. <br /> <br />For the rest of us (those of us who prefer that our music not be trapped in amber): if you like to hear good songs thoughtfully reinterpreted, this is the album for you. Some covers will probably appeal more than others, according to taste, but don't let your preconceptions stand in the way of liking a song on its merits - for instance, I'm not any kind of fan of Eddie Vedder or the Stereophonics in other contexts, but their respective cover versions here are favorites of mine. <br /> <br />So, once again: if you don't believe any popular music recorded since 1970 is worthy of your attention, don't buy this album. Everyone else: open your mind and your ears, and give it a spin.

But as easy it was to enter a travel agency and book a Caribbean cruise on the luxurious Island Princess instead, so difficult it becomes to withstand the moral pressure their neighbours on Hemlock Street are putting on them to keep the Christmas spirit alive. But Luther is determined to go ahead with his crazy idea, no matter what it takes.<br /><br />With Skipping Christmas John Grisham is again trying out something completely different. Where he already diverted from his proven concept of legal thrillers to socially engaged drama with A Painted House, he now tries to expand his craft by writing a satirical novel. And a fine job he did, indeed. Skipping Christmas has turned out to be a well composed and warm fairytale that comes with quite some funny episodes. Don't expect anything as hilarious as the books of Terry Pratchett, to name but one, but for example Luther's quest to put a Frosty on his roof will sure cause some smiles.<br /><br />Nevertheless what did disturb me is the topic addressed in this book. The first part of the novel gives a frightening view on a society that has made the commercially driven rituals of Christmas into a religion on its own. While reading the book it becomes clear that in the world depicted by Grisham escaping the Christmas frenzy is almost impossible. I silently hope that this is more fiction than reality, but you never know for sure. The funny part is that the ending is in complete contrast to the tone that was set in the beginning of the book. Now I do wonder if this venomous twist was introduced with just a commercial purpose. If not then this makes Skipping Christmas a wonderful masterpiece of satire that in the end makes fun of itself.<br /><br />Actually, there are definitely two ways of reading this book: as a satire or as a Christmas carol. You decide. But your choice reveals a lot of who you are... beware!is book: as a satire or as a Christmas carol. You decide. But your choice reveals a lot of who you are... beware!
B0008ISM40|4.0|When I sat and listened to the album, I was pleasantly surprised. The fist bit was hard, heavy and great. The middle of the album got kinda poppy and dancy, but the end of the album was the best part. The last few songs were haunting, slow and just beautiful. I highly recommend this disc.
B0000CFW87|5.0|i just bought both CD's and you know why?  i simply listened to the short samples here on amazon, and that was all i needed to fall in love with josh, who just happens to look like a younger version of my husband, not kidding. <br /> <br />I love this music, and i pray that josh gorban keeps on recording and singing to the public, i will go to his concert any time.  he makes my heart feel and my soul soar.  thank you, Josh Gorban.
B000002UW1|4.0|At the time of its release, I welcomed the clean production that Scott Litt brought to R.E.M.'s 5th album. It was the first time in a while that the band didn't sound muddy. <br /> <br />\\"The One I Love\\" was the first single and made it further up the charts than any previous R.E.M. song. I love this song, play it with my band at every show, often first because it is impossible to forget the words.  <br /> <br />This album contains some of Peter Buck's best guitar solos, which over REM's history have tended to be brief and infrequent. \\"The One I Love\\" solo is classic Buck, with a little bit of southwestern kick. On the infectious \\"Strange\\" Buck lets out his loopiest solo yet. It sounds like a couple guitars overdubbed, but I've seen Buck pull it off by himself incredibly in concert. \\"Lightnin Hopkins\\" is loopy riffs all the way through.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, R.E.M. became infatuated with Scott Litt's production and stuck with him for at least the next ten years worth of albums. Then the scourge of his input became apparent: he makes R.E.M. sound toothless, too radio-friendly.  <br /> <br />\\"The One I Love\\" is a good song, but listen to any bootleg recording of it that predates Document (they played it on the Lifes Rich Pagent tour). This song used to be a manic explosion, but now it's kind of a plaintive cry. From then on, every time I'd see REM play an unreleased song in concert, I'd be sorely disappointed by the lackluster version that would make it to the record (Undertow, The Great Beyond, etc.). REM's association with Litt also coincided with them leaving behind most of the Southern flavor that made them distinctive. Litt also started substituting drum machines for Bill Berry, which may have contributed to Bill leaving the band. Enjoy this R.E.M. album, the last one before they were spoiled by Litt and a big WB record contract.

068987474X|5.0|This interesting read was presenting to me by one of the ladies in our Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club. I must admit I couldn't put it down!!!! I finished He's Just Not That Into You in less than one hour!!! It was an easy read with humorous dialog.  <br />The book was written from two points of views: Greg Behrendt's and Liz Tuccillo's. I found both views to be helpful and honest. Beforehand, I thought Greg's would be more bias, but in fact, learned that his view was just as fair and straightforward as Liz's.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this \\"no excuses truth to understanding guys\\" book to any female who's constantly worrying over their mate. Ever wonder why he's not calling you? Pick up this book. Ever wonder why he disappears for days? Pick up this book. Ever wonder why he cheats? Pick up this book. It will save you the humiliation and stress of making the ultimate mistake of your life: marring a man who's just not that into you. <br /> <br />To the young girls just finding out about this thing called \\"dating\\", this book is for you also, but with a bit of advice before you read it. Don't be so quick to throw a guy away who doesn't want to have sex with you. That's what's wrong with society today. IT IS NOT JUST ABOUT SEX PEOPLE! This was my only complaint with He's Just Not That Into You. This book teaches you that a man, in your case, a boy, is just not that into you if he doesn't come on to you. That's BOGUS! Get to truly know your boyfriend FIRST. If he comes on to you too fast DUMP HIM! <br /> <br />Rolanda,  <br />Nothing BUT Page Turners Book Club <br /> <br /> <br />

B000002MP2|5.0|I remember the day I bought this album. I was thirteen years of age, and the year was 1994. It was the fifth CD I've \\"ever\\" bought, and it totally spun my musical tastes into high gear, driving me to discover a world that I had never been exposed to. Along with Offspring \\"Smash,\\" this was the first album I've ever bought that I felt I could identify with on a personal level. This album was the cure for boredom in the lifeless suburb I grew up in. My buddies and I would just sit around listening to this album for hours on end; everybody had it, no wonder it sold over 14 million copies.<br /><br />\\"Dookie\\" was a case of accidental success, much like Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\". The latter could be thanked for Green Day's success in many ways. Green Day hit at the right time, with the right sound. Reviving punk rock isn't the easiest task, but Green Day made it seem like child's play. At their core, the California based punk rock trio were masters at reviving the fast and catchy three-chord punk tunes that everyone's grown to love. Even though Green Day would never out sell \\"Dookie,\\" their influence has reached the masses. These guys opened the door for a revival of punk metal, third wave ska and pop-punk. I'd venture to say that Green Day is the most influential band to come along in the mid nineties, second only to Nirvana.<br /><br />It's a good thing pop music was better back then, than it is now; because it makes my stomach turn to hear good music mixed up with garbage. But Green Day was in good company back in 1994 (Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Live, Stone Temple Pilots, Beastie Boys, The Offspring, etc.). Undoubtedly, everyone remembers \\"Longview,\\" \\"Basket Case,\\" and \\"When I Come Around\\". Those songs and videos were played around the clock on the radio and MTV, earning them diamond status. \\"Longview\\" was their first single off of the record, and a huge hit, thanks to it's raw bass line, heavy guitar, audacious attitudes, and catchy melodies. I feel sorry for the kids that have to put up with today's pop music. I feel pretty privileged growing up in the boom of grunge. It's not as great as the 60s or 70s, but a hell of a lot better than the pop music the new millennium has brought us. \\"Basket Case\\" was most definitely their most popular song of all time, maybe forever. It saturated the airwaves far more than it's predecessor, reaching a much larger audience. The same could be said about \\"When I Come Around\\", they simply kept topping themselves with bigger hits. Aside from the hits, there was also some great album tracks, such as the lovely \\"She\\" and \\"Pulling Teeth,\\" and \\"Welcome To Paradise\\" (a re-recording of the same song off of their \\"Kerplunk\\" album) which also received airplay. This album was a defining moment in which I learned to appreciate a \\"full album\\" as opposed to single tracks. Ever since then I've been on the quest for the perfect album.<br /><br />Another thing that I've always been obsessed with, is the album artwork. I had a large poster of the illustration hanging in my room that I'll never forget (since I lost it over time). Dogs throwing and launching crap at everyone, including Jesus. It was some pretty funny stuff; very punk.<br /><br />I can say with pride, that these guys are still one of my favorite bands. I haven't missed a beat of their career, and thankfully, they still haven't made a bad record to this date. If you like any sort of rock music, I have no doubt that you will like this album.have to put up with today's pop music. I feel pretty privileged growing up in the boom of grunge.

B0007N1AI6|5.0|ALTHOUGH I THINK THEIR SOUND HAS CHANGED. SOUNDS LIKE THEY HAVE  <br />HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO ANOTHER KILLER BAND I LIKE. SHALL I SAY  <br />PRIEST THEATER OR DREAM PRIEST. THIS IS A VERY PROG METAL PRIEST BUT I LIKE IT. GET IT YOULL LIKE IT.
B000003S5H|5.0|There just aren't many words to describe this album's beauty. This is one of those albums that just sweeps you away into another world when you push play. The tranquility, comfort and soothing soundscapes will captivate your mind, tease your ears, and ultimately, it keeps you coming back for more. Every note on \\"Moon Safari\\" is perfectly timed. As far as construction, this album tops most albums I've ever heard. Analog synthesizers, organs, electric pianos, and soothing vocals make up this vastly unique album. There is a very cinematic feel to the album, which boasts much more than their fluffy first single \\"Sexy Boy\\" has to offer.<br /><br />Nicolas Godin and Jean-Benoît Dunckel recorded \\"Moon Safari\\" in the legendary Abbey Road studios (also a studio for classic records such as The Beatles \\"Abbey Road\\" and The Beach Boys \\"Pet Sounds\\"). I can't help but think that these guys captured the spirit of these legendary artists, since they are undoubtedly influenced by the likes of Brian Wilson, Burt Bacharach and Pink Floyd. Most importantly, these guys are all about making music for the love of it, not for the money or fame. Every track works cohesively with the next, making it a fantastic full (but short) listen; all killer no filler as Jerry Lee Lewis would put it.<br /><br />Standouts would include \\"La Femme d'Argent,\\" \\"All I Need,\\" \\"Kelly Watch the Stars,\\" my personal favorite \\"Talisman,\\" \\"You Make It Easy,\\" and \\"New Star in the Sky (Chanson Pour Solal)\\". There really aren't many records like it. Groove Armada's \\"Vertigo\\" is similar, but simply not up to par with \\"Moon Safari\\".<br /><br />Overall, if you enjoy soothing, sexy, soulful music, you will love this album. This album isn't for any specific age group; my dad loves this stuff. This album is accessible to nearly everyone with a good taste. I highly recommend purchasing this album; a burned copy just won't do.
B000000OMB|2.0|terrible supergroup schlock.  If this is their best cd, I wonder how terrible the others are.  mind alteringly dumb lyrics that are mindless pervade this cd, by the official \\"prog rock supergroup.\\"  supergroups tend to suck hard, and I would say that this band blows more than most.  Avoid at all costs, there is much better prog music out there.  I was previously a fan of the work these guys did in other bands before, and I am extremely dissappointed that something so aseptic could be brought forth by them.  Maybe they didn't have that much talent in the first place.
B000002I25|5.0|This is one of the most groundbreaking and innovative debuts ever released by a rock band, or anyone, for that matter. Opening with the classic \\"Break On Through (To the Other Side),\\" The Doors lead you through a set of wonderful psychedelic rock. One of the greatest things about the Doors is their unique sound, heralded by Ray Manzarek's ever-present keyboards. The twisted riff that opens \\"Light My Fire\\" is timeless, and the hypnotic middle section is one of the finest things the band laid down. \\"Twentieth Century Fox\\" has always been one of my favorites as well, but the whole album comes to a magnificent and eerie close with \\"The End.\\" An eleven and a half minute opus including some of the most disturbing lyrics Jim Morrison ever devised set against a languid, hazy, psychedelic backdrop. If you really want to get into the Doors, this is certainly a great place to start.
B00000IQW5|1.0|Well, it didn't appeal to me personally -the story, the characters, no, usually I am such a big fan of Steven Spielbergs' various masterpieces, and despite \\"Always\\" I'm really impressed with his talent of making such different movies, and so well. Jaws, Close Encounters, Schindlers' List, Minority Report -you name it! The man is a genious, no argue there -but this movie simply hasn't got the touch nor the style.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|I'm wild about \\"Careless Love!\\" This CD simply does my heart good. The tracks range from vintage tunes to contemporary numbers. Each being filled with Madeleine's smoky voice. Reminiscent of Billie Holiday and Bessie Smith, Peyroux is destined for greatness.
B00004Y6NU|5.0|Dire Straits has always been one of my favorite bands and although I prefer the self-titled album and Makin' Movies over this as an album, nothing on any album ever made will beat the song \\"Telegraph Road\\". It's 15 minutes of genius and I don't care what kinda music you like, after listening to it once you will agree it's the best. Private Investigations and Love over Gold are both like ok songs, but Industrial Disease and It Never Rains are really good too, although not coming close to the first track on the album. <br /> <br />As a previous reviewer said don't let the fact that there's only 5 tracks scare you off, and this is a must-have for any fans of rock.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Many of the complaints about American Idiot are in regard to how overplayed and annoying the singles are without actually saying much about the album in general. American Idiot is not a record that can be judged by the singles.<br />This album was crafted as a cohesive work; it isn't meant to just be thought of as a random collection of songs. I don't have a TV and don't listen to the radio very often so I can't attest the accusation of these songs being overplayed, but I know that I ordinarily would not be able to stand a song along the lines of Boulevard of Broken Dreams. However, while listening to the album, it's the perfect song to follow Holiday, which itself is the perfect song to follow the end of Jesus of Suburbia. There is a logical, musical, and lyrical progression from one song to the next through the entire album.<br />I'm somewhat privileged to live in the relatively media-free bubble that I do. I don't feel the need to defend my punk rock credibility by tearing down the pop rock band that was part of the punk scene over 10 years ago, and I'm not driven to buy into the hype surrounding whatever band is popular at the moment. My opinions of this record come from my experience of taking it home and sticking it in while I was washing dishes, and being completely amazed by the quality.<br />Also, the fact that I, an aging punk rocker, and my roommate, a jazz musician, both think that it's the best album of 2004 should say something.
B00005JNVS|4.0|A nice mix of Kill Bill and Hotshots.<br /><br />I have watched thousands of movies, reviewed hundreds on amazon or otherwise, and can honestly say that Kung fu Hustle made me laugh like no other.<br /><br />Seriously, I could go into the plot, which is more or less an excuse for more awesome acrobatic achievements of excellence, but Kung fu hustle is about the prat-falls. It's Flat out hilarious. Never have I laughed for the duration of an entire film.<br /><br />It seems that Bruce Lee and the Wachowski's have finally met the Anamaniacs. Support the cause, go see it, then tell your friends. Kung fu Hustle is a fantastically unique bit of coolness. ~saos~
B0000024JA|4.0|This album was pretty ill when it dropped back in the day. Looking back, the RZA was experimenting with his production, and was still seeking to establish his style. The mood of many of the cuts is remarkably dark and murky. On \\"Biscuits\\" Meth's lyrics are suppressed under a haunting minimal beat. You almost get the sense that he's rapping from within a deep dungeon, or better yet, locked in your basement on Friday the 13th. The mood picks up on a few tracks such as the classic \\"Bring the Pain\\", \\"Meth Vs. Chef\\", and \\"Release Yo' Delf.\\" However, the general tone on this album is suppressed and dimmed-out-dark. My favorite cut is the absorbing click-clack of \\"I Get My Thing in Action.\\" Overall, this album is basically a valued timepiece within the evolving lineage of hip-hop. This is one of four albums that the RZA exclusively produced for Wu-Tang soloists. That in itself marks its historical significance. In addition, Meth's following two albums fail to approach the creativity of this project.

0571081789|5.0|Without a doubt, my favourite book. I first read this book when i was 17 and it has been like both a biography and self help guide to me over the years.  My copy is now dog eared and worn, but very much loved. Sylvia's words sometimes felt like my own and i cannot say how much this book has comforted me when i have been feeling low.  Highly recommended for those of us who feel like depression may have no real ending (note the plastic starfish for her baby!).  superbly written by a sperb and underrated woman of our time. Thank you Sylvia, for letting us take a glimpse into your life.
B000002U9Y|4.0|For Pink Floyd's second album problems has risen to much in the band with there frontman Syd Barrett. He was obviously in no condition to continue on with pink floyd so they had the brilliant David Gilmour step in his place. Syd's condition got so bad that he couldn't even finish the album. He is on possibly half of the album the rest of it is saved with David Gilmour. This album is not quite as good as the masterpiece debut but it does have certain charms. The opener Let there be more light starts of with a great rythmical guitar line buildiong up with percusion, keyboards, bass and finally we get into the song. Remember a Day a good tune by wright which I hear he is not proud of because of the fact when Syd left they all had to start writing the songs for themselves and were very naive on how to do since syd wrote most of Piper. Set the controls is ok but sounds way better when they played it Live at Pompeii. Corporal Clegg is a song not very many people like and I have also heard Rick Wright say this is god awful. All the kazoo noises with the salvation army background and the lyrics aren't great either. It's probobly good that the band left this one alone and din't play it live. The title track is pretty good but not nearly as good as it is at Pompeii. I was pretty disapointed with it. And of course we get to the end of the album where it syd's swan song for pink floyd. Jugband Blues is neither jugband or blues but it has the classic Syd Barrett that we all know and love. Jugband is definetly one which is a great treasure on this album. This album was kind of put together sloppily but the band was trying the best to keep it together by replacing there front man for good. And this begins the next chapter for Pink Floyd. Not as good as The Piper at the Gates of Dawn or the latter albums but still a must have. <br />
0553213105|5.0|Pride and Prejudice isn't Jane Austen's most popular novel for nothing.  The story, which is set in pre-Victorian rural England, is full of elegant wit and humor fit for all ages.  Though its romantic themes are directed more towards women, men too can enjoy this tale of first impressions and first loves.  Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is a classic love story that will hold you in its grip from the first page to the last.<br /><br /> The story begins when a handsome bachelor named Charles Bingley and his friends move into the neighborhood where the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, lives with her four sisters.  Elizabeth's older sister, Jane, and Mr. Bingley fall in love at first sight.  What makes this novel so captivating is that Jane and Mr. Bingley are persuaded by others to bury their feelings for each other.  Throughout the novel, the reader is kept guessing as to whether or not they will end up together.<br /><br />  Elizabeth, meanwhile, attracts the attentions of Mr. Bingley's best friend, Mr. Darcy.  However, her first impression of his arrogant demeanor forms a prejudice within her that prevents her from returning his admiration.  Likewise, Mr. Darcy's pride makes it hard for him to reveal his feelings to her.  As Amazon.com's editorial review on Pride and Prejudice claims, \\"The point is, you spend the whole book absolutely fixated on the critical question: will Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy hook up?\\"  Although the plot is built to answer that question, it contains more than just 18th century romance to keep you interested.<br /><br /> Conversation keeps the pages of this novel flying by.  Whether you're listening to Mrs. Bennet grind on her daughters, or you're in the room at Netherfield hearing Caroline Bingley talk trash about Elizabeth, you will beg for more.  You'll be somewhat satisfied to witness Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy duke it out, but you will not be able to stop until you find out what happens next.<br /><br /> Pride and Prejudice is an essentialclassic for teen and adult readers alike.  It explores the world of love, the dangers of preconceived notions, and the negative affects that self-gratification can have on relationships.  Tyler C. Powell, who posted his review on Amazon.com, stated that through Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen \\"has lived up to the hype surrounding her name.\\"  I concur completely, and recommend reading this novel and others by the same author.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time.  Why?  It's a beautifully wrought out story about life, death, betrayal, love, and honor.  The animation is Disney at it's best, superior to Beauty and the Beast, which is my second favorite Disney animation film.  The voice acting is perfect, the characters are very well developed, and the story reflects the humanity in all of us.  Losing the one you love, and thinking you're responsible as a result of terrible cruelty from someone you trust is the worst thing that could happen, and to see Simba reclaim his proper place with his own courage and help from true friends is tremendously uplifting and joyful.  Simba LEARNS and grows so much in the course of the film and it's just a joy to grow with him.  The music is gorgeous, especially the background music, and while I don't enjoy Elton John's renditions of these beloved songs, the performances within the film were top-notch.  Beautiful, detailed animation, geniune, feeling voice acting, and a real, compelling story make The Lion King first in its class, and then some.
B0006399FS|5.0|Good Lord! Look at all these bad reviews. Look at all the good reviews placed here to combat the bad reviews! What is it between these two groups? Good Heavens! Oh no. Could it be? Could it be U2 is at last confronting the Great Divide, the Great Generational Divide?  <br /> <br />Some of these bad reviews, many of them seem written by honest to god well intentioned music loving punks! That isn't meant in a bad way at all. U2 started out as a bunch of well intentioned music loving punks. They started out by wanting to cut through the pretense and artifice of 70's era corporate rock. Now they are the very embodiment of that beast, and a generation with the very same values as this band are starting to reject them.  <br /> <br />Reading these reviews it looks as though there is a mini drama being played out here between people who are trying to fight the good fight against a corporate rock act, and other people who are trying to fight the good fight to save the last of the great bands that still has some control of it's destiny and *isn't* a corporate act. As Bono himself once observed giving the keynote speech at a U of Penn graduation \\"Sometimes the best way to serve an age is to Betray it.\\" So, three cheers to those fighting the good fight against U2... only WHY pick on U2?  <br /> <br />What about Joss Stone. Ok voice. Attractive... but? Come on... if she were not attractive? What would there be to listen to? An \\"Ok\\" voice? You know how many discs are out there that you've probably skipped through and forgotten because of \\"Ok\\" voices?  <br /> <br />Corporate rock is stuff that couldn't or wouldn't have survived without a marketing department.  <br /> <br />*Sigh* Trust me gang... that ain't U2. U2 have been at this since they were in their teens. They toured their buts off all across America for YEARS before they had any kind of hit in the USA. Heard of \\"The Joshua tree?\\" They had 4 albums and a live disc before that. They worked their butts off to build an audience with their talent and energy. Did they play their cards right in the business world too?  <br /> <br />Sure. <br /> <br />Guess what, so did the Beatles.  <br /> <br />Would U2 have mattered and found an audience withOUT that business world? In a heart beat. They were new and different 25 years ago before anyone had started copying their style to make beer commercials. There was a time when no one in the world sounded like U2, and that's the reason you've heard about them this many years later.  <br /> <br />Yes there is corporate rock. Yes U2 is on top of the music business, and yes they are past their prime (sorry fans)... but come ON! YOU will pass your prime too someday. We all do. People cross the Great Divide, and become older. What makes this disc worth defending is that they are still out there doing it, and they are still on the road. Ok... fine, as one reviewer has pointed out there are better bands out there such as Pearl Jam. True... and besides Pearl Jam? Green Day?  <br /> <br />Yeah \\"Ok\\" band... but they aren't going to be able to keep their foot in the corporate door to prevent it from getting slammed shut on rock. Oh... sad sad thing young ones. No one had ever heard of Green Day until Kurt Cobain killed himself and central casting over at corporate needed to hire another scruffy melodic punk band to keep cashing in. Oh sad irony. Sure Green Day is a band... but they didn't make it on to TV without a major dab of corporate Vaseline.  <br /> <br />They didn't fight there way up or pay their dues, they were thrown into a spotlight.  <br /> <br />Sorry folks. If you are trying to fight the good fight to keep rock alive don't choose Green Day to have your back in a street fight. Pick a band that grew up with the Stones in their prime, that collected New York Punk records the way Jagger& Richards listened to old Chess Blues cuts. Pick a band that know what they are fighting for, and who know what Rock can be if it can stay alive until another generation finds some part of it that hasn't been plastic wrapped. Is U2 in plastic wrap now?  <br /> <br />Maybe... but they are keeping alive the idea that Rock shows can happen in arenas. Pearl Jam can do that. Radiohead don't want to. Coldplay were only charming when they reminded people of the young U2. And the rest?  <br /> <br />The Killers? Franz Ferdinand?  <br /> <br />Maybe someday, after they have toured their butts off, and released their first four albums and a live disc. But until they get there, someone has to keep the lights on. Someone has to keep the idea of rock alive in a world of Britney.  <br /> <br />Attacking this band for being corporate is like smashing a greenhouse for rare trees because it's not part of the forest. These guys are keeping the lights on for rock. They have their foot in the door, and they are waiting for you, they are begging for you punks to get yer stuff together in time so you can join them and push that door open. THEN you can leave them behind, and they will be cheering you on as you go. Maybe this album is a placeholder, but what a place worth holding!  <br /> <br />If you chop U2 down... do you think that means that corporate music will be dead?  <br /> <br />Prop them up so that other acts will be able to stand even higher on their shoulders. Different things happen when people cross the Great Generational Divide. Some people get cynical, and try to grab as much as they can for themselves. Some think about what they will leave behind, and try to make things better for those that will follow.  <br /> <br />Rock isn't five bands in a basement. Its five *busses* full of fans going from your town to a concert in another. It's not about corporations, it's about populations, it's about meeting each other, and it's about things way bigger than the room you listen in or the headphones you have. It's about letting people know it's ok to get together... and maybe miss a few days... or weeks of work.  <br /> <br />That's rock. <br /><br />If you get to see it, you'll have these guys to thank for holding the door open before it could be closed.  <br /> <br />The Generational Divide is just the crack open of the door between those who have, and those who are on the outside. Fighting the good fight against corporate rock? And just how many people has corporate rock killed? There are bigger fights. There are bigger pictures. U2 isn't any kind of enemy. They are trying to stay large enough so that the enemy can't shut big music down. Young punks want to fight, but they haven't been around long enough to know WHO to fight. U2? These guys aren't sell outs. Stop throwing stones at them. You are on the same side.

B0006SSOHC|2.0|Perhaps one would need to see the whole movie to make this decision.  I couldn't.  I've never had a strong stomach.  I love thrillers, abhor horror.  The difference is that horror relies on splatter, thrillers on playing with your mind. <br /> <br />I thought this movie was more thriller than horror when I rented it.  If it was truly in the vein of Seven, then the movie really wouldn't be overtly graphic.  It would just be outrageously disturbing.  Disturbing is fine.  That's why Seven and Identity are a couple of my more favorite movies.  They are psychologically disturbing without offending your visual sensibilities.  I was hoping Saw would be that way. <br /> <br />I think this is a movie that will appeal to many people.  If you like horror, or if gore doesn't bother you, this movie has a great premise and some decent acting.  (If you rent this movie hoping for some redeaming message, stay away.) <br /> <br />For me, though, the movie was so relentlessly brutal that I just couldn't watch it all.  So, if you're like me and you enjoy movies that play with your mind and not your eyes, stay away from this movie.  If you're the kind of person that likes your mind and eyes being played with, you'll probably enjoy the movie.

0792844890|5.0|This is by far one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Loaded with spoofs of Star Trek, Star Wars (and various other sci-fi movies and TV shows), you won't stop laughing until the movie's over. I think the funniest aspect of this movie is the over-abundance of some of the worst puns imaginable, some of which are even funnier today than they were nearly 20 years ago. That, combined with some of the best sight gags I've ever seen (example: at one point they pull out a video of the movie that they're still in the process of making, and the video has the entire movie on it, even parts that they hadn't made yet...) and great acting makes this a must-see for anyone Mel Brooks, Star Wars, Star Trek, comedy or sci-fi fan. Several of the movie's stars became famous several years after this was made. Daphne Zuliga would later star in the popular series \\"Melrose Place\\". Bill Pullman later starred in \\"A League of Their Own\\", \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\", \\"While You Were Sleeping\\", \\"Casper\\" and \\"Independence Day\\". Rick Moranis, while already well-known for his role in \\"Ghostbusters\\", would later star in the classic \\"Honey I Shrunk the Kids\\". \\"Spaceballs\\" had a bigger impact than you may think.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought the Firefly season after reading an interview with Joss Whedon.  He spoke somewhat sadly of a little show called Firefly that got cancelled after only 11 episodes.  This sparked my interest so I bought it and watched the whole thing in one weekend.   <br /> <br />Firefly stars an ensemble cast of actors that compliment eachother so well that the audience can't help but be drawn into their world.  The scripts are well-written and involve moments that can be touching to downright hilarious.  The sets and costumes are done so well that the Firefly 'verse is completely believable despite the show's sci-fi genre. <br /> <br />I highly recommend these dvds to anyone.  At best this show will leave a lasting impression that will have people waiting with baited breath for the movie to come out (September 30, 2005), at worst, its a show with no commercials. <br /> <br />

B000001EHS|5.0|Def Leppard was one of the most successful rock bands of the 80's and this excellent compilation contains 15 of their most searing hits.  Included are such classics as \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", \\"Animal\\", \\"Photograph\\" and \\"Hysteria\\" (my favorite).  For those who like ballads, \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"When Love and Hate Collide\\" should wet their appetite. <br /> <br />Def Leppard was legendary for their loud guitars and thundering drums (although their druummer only had one arm!).  Add in Joe Elliot's excellent lead vocals and each song in this collection is a rock and roll classic.  This collection is great because all of the greatest hits are available on a single cd, so its not necessary to buy each cd individually to get all of these songs; just purchase this one great disc.  Def Leppard based their reputation on loud guitars, booming drums, and extreme vocals.  This cd captures each of these elements on every song.  Buy this great disc and listen to some heart-pounding rock and roll at its absolute best.

044024157X|1.0|The first Grisham I read was The Partner. I loved it and proceeded to plow through every one of his books. In the last five to six years, save The Brethren, his books have become nothing more than essays that go nowhere. After now having read The Broker and The Last Juror (both having only the thinest of plots- if they can be called plots) I can confidently say I would only buy another Grisham if all the book stores and publishers in the world burned down and someone was giving one away. You may think I'm being harsh, but I get the feeling Grisham's heart is no longer in it and he is only writing for his publisher and hip pocket now.

B000024LML|4.0|I think it's a shame that all these rappers like Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent,and many others don't give any respect to M C Hammer. He brought the white audience to rap. Not only that, he was such a stand up guy, he gave a whole lot of people jobs, unfortunately those people took advantage of him. Now he's treated like a pariah. Some of these guys should stand up for him, it's what's right.
B00005YXZH|3.0|I agree with some of the previous 3-star reviewers here in that I believe this album, if you were to strip it of the loopy production and Jim O'Rourke's off-beat mixing, would be shown to be the middle-of-the-road pop-rock record that it truly is.  Anyway, what I'm getting at is this: great songs should be able to stand on their own and not have to rely upon overly fancy production.  Strip George Martin's orchestral touches from \\"The White Album\\" or \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" and you're still left with a set of unequivocably great songs.  On the other hand, the 11 songs here, 8 of them penned by Jeff Tweedy and Jay Bennett (whose contributions to the band are vastly underrated) and the other 3 by Tweedy alone, are nice and charming fare, but too often they fall back on the same lazy, overused chords and watery melodies found all across the indie rock landscape.      Tweedy's lyrics throughout are interesting, if somewhat overbearing, beat poetry that make a brief impression, but then slide straight off into the distance.  The \\"confessional\\" and tired-sounding nature of his words, coupled with his low-register delivery, together just don't measure up to those of any other of the great singer-songwriters (Dylan, Drake, et al.) whom he so obviously imitates.  I hear plenty of swirling electronics, bloopy keys and the ocassional blast of white-noise, but behind the superfulous touches I don't hear a musical genius at work.  Tweedy is an accomplished songwriter with a distinctive voice, but he is not a visionary, and his material is nowhere near as strong as that belonging to songwriters such as Will Oldham, Mark Everett, or even to Radiohead, the band to which Wilco is so often compared.      With the exception of \\"Summerteeth,\\" no Wilco album really separates itself from all the other good bands that churn out music just like this: the first two albums are serviceable country-rock, and this and its follow up, \\"A Ghost Is Born,\\" are uptight, faux-experimental fare.  I don't see howanyone could call this a \\"difficult\\" listen, as it's a highly conventional and straightforward album, with a few noisy moments here and there: it's \\"Being There\\" (check \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"Sunken Treasure\\" from that release) with cleaner and more elaborate production.  Turning a pretty pop song into a wall of noise is an age-old trick, and one that's been done far better and more daringly by the likes of the Pixies, Nirvana, the Olivia Tremor Control, Slowdive, Sonic Youth, and many others.  \\"Ashes of American Flags\\" and \\"Poor Places,\\" for example, are fairly interesting noise studies, but they are not groundbreaking, plus they lurch along at sleepy, incredibly boring paces, pumping their modest melodies for all that they're worth.      If anything, this album is incredibly conservative, timidly shying away from the explosive revelation that it always seems to approach but never quite reach.  Again, this record is not bad, just incredibly overrated.  It's not experimental, \\"weird,\\" or revolutionary: it's just ordinary.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 have so much money its unbelievable that they are charging the large amounts of money to people who want to come and see them at their shows. <br />What do they need it for?

B00007G1ZM|4.0|Before watching \\"Mildred Pierce\\" I knew almost nothing about it. All I knew was that it was a story about the relationship between a mother and daugther and that Joan Crawford won the Academy Award for her performance. As the credits rolled and I read the name James M.Cain I knew I was in for a surprise. At that point I figured out this was going to be a noir film. \\"Mildred Pierce\\" impressed me so much that I consider it one of the all-time great noir films.<br /><br /> As I watched the film I started thinking about the Lana Turner\Tony Stompanato scandal. If you remember Turner's daughter said she shot Stompanato in self-defense. I thought perhaps the film was based on that incident. But thank goodness for the internet I was able to research the Lana Turner story and found out it happened in 1958. \\"Mildred Pierce\\" was made in 1945. So there went my theory. I guess what \\"Mildred Pierce\\" could be described as is a case of life imatating art. You have to admit, there are connections.<br /><br /> \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is kind of hard to describe. I'm afraid, if I haven't already, I'll reveal too much. But considering the fact the movie is considered a classic, many may already know the story. I'm not sure how much I should tell you. Maybe it's best I don't.<br /><br /> It's odd for to to think that before this movie Joan Crawford was never even nominated for an Oscar. I'm not sure \\"Pierce\\" is really her best performance. Back in the 1930s when she was working for MGM Crawford made some truly amazing films. The movies dealth with taboo subjects. Think of her performance in \\"Paid\\" about a \\"working girl\\" who studies the law and actually outwits the police. After the production code set in you may have noticed one of the themes of most films was \\"crime doesn't pay\\". Here Crawford is showing maybe it does. Or what about \\"Laughing Sinners\\" (Clark Gable co-stars) that too dealt with touchy subjects. It's a shame to think Crawford's work had gone unappreciated by the Academy. But, isn't that the way it always goes. Actors and actress give one great performance after another and never win an award and when they finally do win it's for a \\"lesser\\" performance. I mean, do you mean to tell me \\"Scent of A Woman\\" is really Al Pacino's best performance? Crawford is good in \\"Pierce\\" don't get me wrong, but, I don't think it should have been the only performance she ever won for.<br /><br /> \\"Mildred Pierce\\" does such a great job creating a noir mood. Pay attention to the use of shadows and lighting. Look at the scene near the end with Pierce, Veda (Ann Blyth) and Monte (Zachary Scott) all in the basement. Notice how Crawford walks for out of the darkness (literally and metaphorically) to find out the truth about her daughter and Monte. Also pay attention to Crawford's shoulders. The more money and power she gets the broader her shoulders are made to look. Giving her an almost masculine look.<br /><br /> \\"Mildred Pierce\\" was nominated for 6 Oscars  including \\"Best Picture\\" (It lost that year to Billy Wilder's \\"The Lost Weekend\\") and Ann Blyth and Eva Arden were both up for \\"best supporting actress\\" as was the film's screenplay. Oddly though the movie's director Michael Curtiz (\\"Casablanca\\") was not nominated. I wonder why?<br /><br /> Bottom-line: One of the best noir films I've seen. A movie that leaves a lasting impression on the viewer. While I don't think it's Crawford's best performance, it is effective nonetheless.. But, isn't that the way it always goes.

B0000TB01Y|5.0|This CD is unbelievable!! i saw the show in Toronto a week ago and it was the most amazing thing i've ever seen! It made the CD a million times better. All of the vocals on this CD are amazing. Idina Menzel is the only person that can still give me goosebumps after hearing the songs a hundred times already. Here is my opinion of all the songs: <br />1. No One Mourns The Wicked-9/10- Awesome song by Kristin Chenoweth that shows off her opera training. <br />2. Dear Old Shiz-6/10- Not a very important song, but in the show it is our first glimpse of Elphaba. Still a good song, but can be skipped. <br />3. The Wizard And I-10/10- This is Idina's first song and she is amazing! I get goosebumps when i hear this. <br />4. What Is This Feeling?-9/10- I grew to like this song after a while. It is actually very funny and I liked it even more when i saw it. <br />5. Something Bad-7/10- Not my favorite song, its the only song William Youmans sings, and he does well (for having to sing like a goat!). Idina sings toward the end which makes it even better. <br />6. Dancing Through Life-10/10- This is a very fun song that Norbert Leo Butz sings. It gets the whole cast singing, including Michelle Federer who plays Nessarose (she sings another song that got cut from the CD that i will review at the end) <br />7. Popular-9/10- I grew to love this song after a while. Kristin Chenoweth is so funny, i was cracking up when i saw it live. A very funny typical musical number. <br />8. I'm Not That Girl-9/10- This is one of Idina's solo songs. it is fantastic, full of emotion. <br />9. One Short Day-8/10- A good song with upbeat music that involves the ensemble. <br />10. A Sentimental Man-6/10- Joel Grey is very good in this song, im just not a fan of this song. <br />11. Defying Gravity-11/10- The breathtaking act 1 finale that will leave you in awe every time you hear it. Idina and Kristin are amazing! (Its even more breathtaking live, especially when Elphaba defys gravity!)The end willgive you goosebumps and leave you speechless. <br />12. Thank Goodness-8/10- Good song by the ensemble and Kristin Chenoweth who again shows off her opera training. Its a good act 2 opener. <br />13. Wonderful-7/10- Not my favorite song. Again Joel Grey is great, and Idina is great when she sings. <br />14. I'm Not That Girl (reprise)-7/10- Kristin Chenoweth sings this short reprise of I'm Not That Girl. Its a very smart song thrown in, and if youve seen the show, youll understand why. shes singing it. <br />15. As Long As You're Mine-10/10- Awesome duet between Idina and Norbert Leo Butz. This is a very sweet love song, and the singing and emotion is so powerful. <br />16. No Good Deed-10/10- One of my personal favorites! This is one of those songs where Idina shines. The song is full of emotion, and a sudden realization for Elphaba. <br />17. March of the Witch Hunters-7/10- Good song by the ensemble (and a main character, but i wont say who) <br />18. For Good-10/10- Idina and Kristin's powerful duet as they say goodbye to each other. This song will bring tears to your eyes (im tearing up thinking about it) because of the emotion both women put into the song.  <br />19. Finale-10/10- This song is like a mix of No One Mourns the Wicked and For Good. It actually makes my cry more than For Good (only after i saw it live). This is the perfect end to the perfect musical. <br />(20.) The Wicked Witch of the East-10/10- This is Michelle Federer's (Nessarose's) song that was cut from the album. I was extremely disappointed because she has a beautiful voice that, in this song, can be as powerful as Idina at times. She is so full of emotion when she sings and speaks. This song was cut because it would give too much away and most of it is dialogue. It is still one of my favorites. <br />          If you read this review and still dont believe the CD is amazing, take it from the 300+ other reviews that say it is. I listen to this constantly and it never gets old, and i dontthink it ever will. \\"Wicked\\" is a musical full of so much heart, it will be a part of Broadway and our hearts for years to come.
0156027321|5.0|The narrator, Pi Patel, double-majored in zoology and religion.  He loves Canada but misses the heat of India.  Ponchiderry, site of his childhood, had a zoo and a toy train.  Before going to Ponchiderry Pi's father ran a hotel in Madras.  Perhaps there is a natural transition from hotelkeeping to zookeeping.  In a zoo, though, the guests never leave their room.   <br /> <br />To a child, the zoo was a paradise on earth.  The best times to visit a zoo are at sunrise and sunset.  Animals are territorial and in the wild live lives of compulsion.  A biologically sound zoo encloses just another territory.  A good zoo has clearly worked out coincidences.  Getting animals used to humans is part of the art of zookeeping.  The flight distance is diminished.  Much hostile and aggressive behavior of animals is social insecurity.   <br /> <br />While the family and the zoo are traveling  across the Pacific to Canada the boat sinks.  The ship had not been a luxury liner.  Pi lands in a lifeboat.  A zebra and a hyena end up in the lifeboat, too.  Next Pi sees that Orange Juice, an orangutan, is present and seasick.  The boat churns with the swimming below it and around it of sharks.  The orangutan, a former pet, is not able to defeat the spotted hyena.  The hyena  had already caused the demise of the zebra.  The hyena is bested by another animal on board, a tiger, Richard Parker.  The name resulted from confusion over the appellations of the animal and a previous owner much to the amusement of Pi's father.   <br /> <br />Pi finds emergency food and water and makes a list of the supplies available.  In the early days to distract the cat Pi throws a rat at him.  Later he works out the territorial issues, he makes a raft from the oars, and the matter of dominant position in order to coexist with the tiger on their sea voyage.  He notes that fear is life's only true opponent.   <br /> <br />They survive 227 days at sea.  After the emergency supplies are exhausted, the vegetarian manuses fishing for sustenance and a solar still to turn salt water into fresh.  Rain and turtles are major disruptions of daily routines.   <br /> <br />The boat lands on a carnivorous island where the tiger eats meerkats and Pi sleeps in a tree until he discerns how truly dangerous their circumstances are.  He sets off again in the lifeboat eventually landing in Mexico.  The tiger, Richard Parker, disappears.   <br /> <br />The Japanese ministry of transport receives word that a survivor of the Japanese ship, Tsimtsum, has surfaced.  Mr. Okamoto speaks with Piscine Molitor Patel, Pi, in English.  Pi is told the carnivorous island is a botanical impossibility.  Mr. Okamoto and his companion do not believe that Pi lived in a lifeboat with a tiger.  Disbelieved, Pi invents a story to satisfy his auditors.   <br /> <br />The tale is a delight.
B00025ETIW|5.0|ok, i read reviews for \\"I brought you my bullets you brought me your love\\", and half the people there are just talking about how MCR \\"sold out\\" when they came out with this album. it really pisses me off! either you're a fan of them, or you're not!! just pick one and go with it! you can't say, \\"i WAS a fan, but now they got popular, so i'm NOT.\\" seriously.  who cares how popular a band is, it's about the MUSIC not about how many people like them! personally, i'm a huge MCR fan and i love \\"Three Cheers For Sweet Revenge\\" as much as i loved their first album! anyway, i should probably actually talk about the cd now... i really love this cd from beginning to end. i never skip songs, i listen to it the whole way through. every song on this is completely awesome.  my favorites would probably have to be Helena, Thank You For The Venom, I Never Told You What I Do For A Living, and I'm Not Okay.  the guitar solo in I'm Not Okay is AWESOME. gotta love MCR.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Going into this movie, I tried to push expectations out of my mind. The plotline sounded interesting, and appeared to have potential, but based on the previews it also looked like the kind of film that could easily flop if not handled with care. Luckily, \\"Collateral\\" did not disappoint me and, while not perfect, was even a bit better than I'd hoped. Max (Jamie Foxx) is an LA cab driver. Vincent (Tom Cruise) is a professional contract killer with five hits to make in a single night. Upon his arrival in the city, he hails a cab. By coincidence, it happens to be Max's. (It's not clear why he didn't just rent a car and thus save himself from entanglement with a witness to his murders, but this can be overlooked without too much effort.) As Vincent and Max make the rounds of LA, ticking victims off the list one by one, a police detective (Mark Ruffalo) notices the strange similarities between two homicide cases (Vincent's victims) brought into the morgue, and the chase is on.<br /><br />The bulk of the movie is driven by tension and suspense in the build up to the climactical cat-and-mouse chase scene at the end. This sense of building tension is accentuated by the innovative use of an orchestral soundtrack, making for an interesting musical background. One thing that pleased me is that \\"Collateral\\" is slightly more intelligent in nature than a lot of action movies, and thus is not readily predictable. You're never entirely sure what will happen next, nor is it apparent how the film will end. Unfortunately, the ending itself leaves a little to be desired. There is so much build up that the climax of the film, by comparison, seems somewhat flat, and the conclusion is not altogether satisfying. There isn't a real sense of resolution, and the viewer is left wanting a little something more.<br /><br />The choices in setting and cinematography are interesting, and effective. Much of the movie has a bit of a \\"Phone Booth\\"-esque feel to it. Though an action film, a lot of that action takes place in a very confined space, in or in close proximity to the taxicab that is the central element of the storyline. And it is not JUST an action movie, either, but has an emotional element that allows one to connect with the main characters to a higher degree. Director Michael Mann has also made creative choices in where and how the various scenes were shot, enhancing the film's impact. You can gain a particular appreciation for his skill and eye for detail by watching the featurettes \\"City of Night\\" and \\"Visual FX\\" on the second disc.<br /><br />The acting was competent all around. Jamie Foxx is particularly good as the hero in the film. It was interesting to see Tom Cruise as a villain. He has never struck me as an actor whose characters have much depth, and I find that his movies (the ones that work, anyway) are generally carried more by plotline and action, but he is convincing here. I would not go so far as to say his role here stands out above the other work he has done, but he does manage to make the antagonist of the story startlingly charismatic, playing on our emotional allegiances right up to the last few sequences of the film, where he simply becomes ruthless and cold. Mark Ruffalo plays his part well, but his limited parts never really allow him to step forward into the viewer's attention. Another character I would like to have seen more of is Annie (Jada Pinkett Smith), the romantic interest of the film. While she has a strong presence when on screen, and cuts an impressive figure as a strong and professional lawyer, her character is used primarily as a tool to drive the plot forward, and not as a personality in and of herself.<br /><br />While I did enjoy the movie, there are a few areas where it falls short. While I liked the premise, which stands out a bit from your average run-of-the-mill action flick, it fails to deliver any real punch that makes you sit back and go \\"Wow!\\" when the film is over. As I mentioned earlier, the ending isa little flat, a little lacking, creating more of a \\"That's it?\\" sentiment. Also, the movie has little replay value. While quite entertaining on a first-time viewing, it primarily holds the audience's attention via suspense, and once you know what happens, there isn't much else to dig into on subsequent viewings. The characters, while likeable, are not particularly memorable, nor are there many quotable lines. It's a good movie to rent once when you're in the mood for a suspenseful action ride, but it's not the kind of film you're likely to want to watch on a regular basis.<br /><br />The DVD extras are worth watching. \\"City of Night\\" is a longer featurette on the making of the film, which provides interesting insights on Mann's various filmmaking choices. \\"Special Delivery\\" gives a little information on how Tom Cruise prepared for his role as Vincent. \\"Shooting on Location\\" takes you into the cinematography of the film. \\"Visual FX\\" is a particularly interesting segment on the movie's cinematography. There is also one deleted scene, with commentary, and a piece called \\"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx Rehearse,\\" which is just that - a sequence of rehearsal recordings for various scenes in the film. Overall, a DVD worth renting. It isn't one I'd add to my personal collection, but it was an enjoyable viewing experience.nding is a little flat, a little lacking, creating more of a \\"That's it?\\" sentiment.

0060987464|3.0|Marilyn Manson is one of rock music's most controversial figures. His mannerisms, his beliefs, and the things he sings about are bound to stir up strong emotional feelings from different people. If you've ever wondered about the life experiences that created the modern- day Marilyn Manson, then this is the book for you.<br /><br />Manson was born Brian Warner in Canton, Ohio, and his early years were spent doing typical boyish things. But the one experience Manson points out in this book that forever changed his life in a negative way was his attendance at Heritage Christian School. This \\"educational\\" private institution was run by staunch protestant fundamentalists and the administrators of the school were very strict, very brainwashing, and very intolerant. They told kids like young Brian Warner that, because he was a member of the Episcopal faith, he had no chance to get to heaven. This extremism led Warner to rebel, and he was never the same afterward.<br /><br />Manson talks about all sorts of other personal life experiences that had an important impact on his life. A neighbor guy once tried to molest him and he and his cousin discovered one day that their grandfather had a secret stash of adult films and women's clothing. These experiences, and the constant demonization of sex at his school, led Manson to become obsessed with topics like sex and religion, and they are mentioned continuously in this book.<br /><br />Besides his past (which keeps coming back to haunt him), Manson also spends time talking about his life as a rock and roller. Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails is one of Manson's close confidants (the two had a falling out, but I think they are back to being friends again) and he has had personal relationships with other people and with plenty of women. He talks about living in Florida and the process that led to the formation of his band, showing the reader the long, hard road that must be plowed to reach the heights of the music world.<br /><br />One thing I didn't like too much about this book was the drawings of the human body and the diagrams that identify the parts. Not because they are nasty or anything like that, but because I didn't think they added much to the book. Also, at some points, I found the writing to be a little creepy. Manson talks very bluntly about sex, drugs, religion, etc., so you need to be prepared to hear some outspoken language. Some will find it shocking, while others will find it weird but also fascinating.<br /><br />Marilyn Manson is an unusual fellow for certain. But he is also an intelligent guy who offers some interesting perspectives on life. Many will not agree with everything he says, but some of his philosophical views will get you to think and re-think how you stand on these topics of controversy.e thing I didn't like too much about this book was the drawings of the human body and the diagrams that identify the parts.

B00005JLD4|3.0|This rather well made & enjoyable Australian film is billed as a true story.  We are shown an individual, half-caste, Aborigine girl by the name of Molly Craig as she is forceably taken from her mother and thence to a place called Moore River to be brought up amongst whites.  All the children at Moore River, we are led to believe, have similarly been remanded here for their own good and against their and/or their parents' will; the director all the while conveying the view that---in this manner---the Australian government went about trying to extiguish Aborigine culture, by removing half-caste (ie., those with one white parent) Aborigine children from their families to be brought up as white.  The focus of this film concerns a young girl (named Molly) as she walks over a thousand miles back to her mother, after she escapes (with her 2 sisters) from Moore River.  The guardian of that institution (played by Kenneth Branagh) is portrayed as one determined to locate these girls and have them forceably brought back for their own good.  It's a remarkable story actually---the girl Molly did in fact walk over a thousand miles! back to her mother & home in the 1930s (by following a low \\"rabbit proof fence\\" through western Austalia.  The real Molly Craig, when viewing this film, however, declared \\"This is not my story.\\"  She wasn't actually taken by force, for instance.  Her step-father even consented to her being sent to Moore River.  Moreover, the 1936 Royal Commission into treatment of Aborigines showed that 1,003 of Moore River's 1,067 children weren't \\"stolen\\" but voluntarily brought by their parents to get a schooling or be safe ; for their own good (as half-castes were sometimes harrassed and/or shunned by other Aborigines).  Read all the details yourself from the Australian Civil Liberties Union at this address: ([...]) To boot, the illiterate girl who portrayed Molly Craig in this film herself ran away from the making of this picture; not once, but twice!  And after the film was completed she was then sent to boarding school by the director (yes she was brought back twice too, to complete the film) until she decared she didn't want to be there either; wanting simply to go home---a desire she was ultimately granted.  The director declared that he was only trying to help her---notwithstanding the film's Kenneth Branagh character saying the same thing in the film while being presented as a racist.  Mind you, I LIKED THE FILM.  It was well shot.  The children actors were very believable.  The Australian landscapes involved herein were captured to great effect too.  The problem is---after reading up on this for several hours on the internet---I know not what's true and what isn't concerning the story of Aborigines in Australia; except that the director of this film apparently took an awful lot of liberties with the story on which he based Rabbit Proof Fence.  That the director had the audacity to put a photo of the real Molly Craig at the end of the film, too, inclines me to not recommend this film.  But I won't go that far since I actually liked the film.  Instead, let me suggest that you not take all you see and hear in this film as necessarily part of the notion that \\"This is a true story.\\"  And should you decide to give this film a try do at least have  a look at the article I've indicated above.  Thanks for reading my thoughts herein & I hope you take them in the spirit in which they were offered; honestly, I find it hard to understand why folks wouldn't want more information when it's rather pertinent, I think.

0393035158|5.0|Sam Harris provides a stunningly clear analysis of the consequences of believing in things on faith, without sufficient evidence. I picked this book up thinking that it would merely rehash things I already believed but was surprised by how much was there that informed and shed fresh light on the subject. This is more than just a polemical assault. After all, all one need do is outline the facts of our major holy books and show how ludicrous they are in light of modern knowledge, and then discuss how these absurd beliefs are still touted in various places of importance such as the senate floor of the United States, and the problem will become clear to anyone who cares to listen. Facts in this case seem like a polemical assault because religionists ignore the lunacy of much of their own scripture until someone like Harris reminds them of it. <br /> <br />   Its time we acknowledge that faith is not some benign form of thinking that moderates can gloss over. Faith in anything for any reason due to insufficient evidence is a cowardly, arrogant, and disingenuous mind-set based entirely on fear, and nowhere is this process more pronounced than with religious faith. The consequences are nothing less than a threat to the existence of mankind. <br /> <br />   What I also love about this book is how experience based mysticism is singled out and promoted as a rational alternative to faith based religion. We do not have to continue using our outdated mythological \\"holy\\" books as the template for all of our discussions on morality and spirituality. It was secular dialogue that ultimately brought modern morality to the religious masses, not organized religion itself. Any cursory glance at history exemplifies this point. Somehow we need to conserve spirituality in a form which does not require the shutting off of one's reasoning faculties. Just the fact that creationists and ID theorists get a \\"fair and balanced\\" say about evolution is proof that faith is the engine leading usinto Sagan's \\"Demon Haunted World\\". I won't even mentions stem cell research. <br /> <br />   When you read this book, don't skip the footnotes! They are hillarious and they are necessary. My favorite one was where Harris states that a meeting between certain Buddhists and ecclesiastical Christians to discuss spirituality is akin to a meeting between Princeton physicists and the Kalihari bushmen to discuss the physics of cosmology (err something like that). <br /> <br />Read this book!
B00008DDSC|4.0|Not quite in the same class as \\"Muriel's Wedding\\", \\"Secretary\\" is similar enough in theme, content, and style for it to be a safe viewing bet those who liked that film. \\"Secretary\\" suffers during its last third by not really having anywhere to go with the story it has introduced so entertainingly in the first two thirds of the film.<br /><br />Fortunately, the cast comes through in the end even if the movie does not. By the end Maggie Gyllengaal (the title character), James Spader (her boss), and Jeremy Davies (her boyfriend) have all managed to achieve the rare distinction of leaving us convinced that no one else could have played their characters so well and that Director Steven Shainberg made three perfect casting decisions.<br /><br />Most guys will have fallen in love with Gyllengaal by the midway point of the first trailer they see for the film. What they find in the film will confirm that their instincts were correct. Most actresses would have been unable to keep the character from seeming pathetic but Gyllenhaal makes her seem plucky, and her quiet assertiveness (once she has found something she wants) permits the film to transcend its political incorrectness and actually celebrate our uniqueness.<br /><br />In what I thought the funniest scene, Gyllengaal and Davies take the stale \\"fake organism\\" device and play it better than it has ever been done. She is spectacularly under-whelmed by her first sex with him and he is so self-absorbed that even the most feeble sounds of pleasure in movie history do not clue him in about her true feelings.<br /><br />Most of the interest (and humor) comes from checking out the subtle clues Gyllengall and Spader provide us about the changing status of their relationship, because a lot is happening between them that is not shown or even specified. The two have subtle little signals by which they step out of their roles, with subtle gestures they let each other (and the audience) know that they both know what they're doing. In this unique way we observe their growing recognition of the other's natures and needs; and eventually their realization that they are unlikely to ever find anyone else who so completely understands them.<br /><br />Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.r growing recognition of the other's natures and needs; and eventually their realization that they are unlikely to ever find anyone else who so completely understands them.

The third season, though, is even more funny than the others. The relationships, tentions, laughs, fights with parents/kids/lovers is overwhelmingly wonderful. You have to see it! I cant wait!

My favourite tracks are: Beautiful Intentions, Next Best Superstar, Don't need this, ad Little Piece of me. Recommended for everyone out there, not just Mel fans. She has a great voice, and also great music to go with it, not to mention astoudning lyrics.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|It has been a week since I saw this movie for the first time, and it still has lingered with me.  Very rarely does that happen anymore.  This movie is based off of the novella written by Stephen King (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption).  I am an avid Stephen King reader and fan.  I had read the novella, and very much enjoyed it.<br /><br />Those who read books (especially Stephen King books) know that very rarely, are the movies based on books made correctly.  Very rarely, are the movies based on books enjoyed at the same level as the books, because one cannot simply film a book.  One cannot capture the same feelings, the same depth, the same character development and emotions that a book depicts, and that is why so many movies based on books are dissapointments.  Even more rarely, are the movies based on books considered to be 'just as good as the book'.<br /><br />I have never said this about another movie before in my life, and probably never will again, but the movie version of the 'The Shawshank Redemption' was in fact, 110% better then the book.  Yes, you read that correctly.  The novella itself was very short.  Coming in at around 100 pages, it was an extremely quick read.  I personally felt the movie opened up Red's character more, and made the viewer relate to Andy a little more, and allowed room for more sympathy.<br /><br />After the credits began to roll, I had a lump in my throat and a feeling that just hasn't shook from me in the past week.  Everything about the movie was done... just right.  It was a quiet, gentle, yet harsh and sorrowful movie.  Imagine recieving TWO life sentences for a crime you did not commit.  I can't even comprehend it.  One of the best things about this movie, is the fact that it makes you share these feelings with the characters.  The lonliness, the sorrow, the anger, the hope.<br /><br />Tim Robbins has given one of the finest performances I have ever seen in an American movie.  Morgan Freemans performance and narration are top notch as well.<br /><br />I live in Cleveland Ohio, which is about 50 minutes from Mansfield Ohio.  Mansfield Reformatory was the jail that Shawshank was filmed at.  You can take tours of the enormaous abandoned building that has been standing since the late 1800's.  The building in it of itself is amazing, bursting at the seems with history.  I had taken a tour last summer, before I saw the movie.  I appreciate the prision a lot more now, and feel grateful that I live so close so that I can make another trip this summer.  They have props everywhere from Shawshank hanging around.<br /><br />I am glad to have watched this movie. It has made it's way into my top 5 movies of all time list.  It will take your breath away, and make you stop for a minute and just appreciate everything you have.ce and narration are top notch as well.   <br /> <br />I live in Cleveland Ohio, which is about 50 minutes from Mansfield Ohio.

B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam is a band that reaches out to a lot of people. The alternative rockers, the hard rockers and the grunge freaks. \\"Ten\\" is a milestone to represent what Seattle had to offer during the grunge explosion of 1991.<br /><br />\\"Once\\", the opening track, kicks things off perfectly. Then we have the ever-so-popular \\"Even Flow\\", where Eddie Vedder sings really fast lyrics at one point. What makes the song stand out even more is that if you are an SNL viewer, Adam Sandler did a parody to this song when he was \\"Operaman\\". After \\"Even Flow\\" is the unforgettable \\"Alive\\", which takes things to a slower level. This is Pearl Jam's power ballad here.<br /><br />\\"Why Go\\" gets things moving forward, but the pace slows down for \\"Black\\", which is a very emotional song and a favorite of mine. After \\"Black\\" is another hit single, \\"Jeremy\\", which tells about some crazy stuff that happens to kids. The next five tracks are also great as well, but \\"Porch\\" is a favorite of mine. It takes me back to the days when I was only 3 three years old and didn't have to worry about prejudice and hate.<br /><br />If you want a true grunge classic, I advise you to purchase Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\". It's such a shame that there are many bands these days that are trying to imitate grunge, yet they end up on the dreaded MTV and corporate radio. Creed decided to take this album 9 years after this was released and call it \\"Human Clay\\". What a shame. Pearl Jam will always be the better band.
0345457684|4.0|Morgan combines hard sci-fi with a hard-boiled detective story in this amazing action triller.  His central sci-fi idea is that in the twenty-fifth century, technology exists that can transfer a person's consciousness into an artificial cortical stack implanted in the brain.  Essentially, this means that it is much more difficult to die a final death as people can \\"sleeve\\" themselves into new bodies as needed.  This is the situation with protagonist Takeshi Kovacs, who finds himself re-sleeved into a  disgraced detective agent's body and is forced to solve a complex and intriguing mystery. <br /> <br />Great storytelling and interesting characters make this novel worthy is it's Philip K.

Linkin Park is so what's happening! Brad Delson can play the guitar a million times better than Jimi Hendrix, Kerry King, John Petrucci and Yngwie Malmsteen combined! This band will blow all those poseurs out of the water, along with Good Charlotte, Limp Bizkit, Simple Plan and Green Day! MTV RULES!<br /><br />(if you took this B.S. seriously, this is for you. I don't know who I hate more, Linkin Park or Limp Bizkit...)
0441003257|4.0|<br />This story succeeds at being charming, funny, exciting, and outrageous all at once.  The action is silly and light-hearted at times, but the characters are compelling.  While you're laughing, you will really care about these folks - from Crowly, the well-meaning fallen angel, to Anathema Device, the aspiring witch and Newton Pulsiver, the aspiring witchfinder, and last but not least, Adam (the Antichrist) and his dog, Dog. <br /> <br />Definitely recommended...
B000002AS3|5.0|This is the best album from Oasis and what a hot first album it is. Not too many bands have earned this kind of debut other than the current release from Flannelmouth called Rain Inside.  Both are raw, stylish and tend to ignite a great sense of coolness. In any case, the killer tracks in my opinion are Live Forever and Supersonic. They are going to tour with Kasabian soon and wow, add Flannelmouth to the agenda and were all in heaven at least for one night. This album is for Oasis collectors.
B00005B4GU|5.0|By the time 2001 rolled around, Radiohead were one of the most critically-acclaimed rock bands of all time. \\"OK Computer\\" had been voted the greatest album ever on numerous occasions, and in late 2000 the band released the follow-up, titled \\"Kid A.\\" The album stormed to No.1 in both the US and UK, which is an incredible achievement for an album which received no promotion from the band and no music videos or single releases. Six months later they followed this up with \\"Amnesiac,\\" which was described by many as Kid B; an album similar to Kid A, recorded at the same time.<br /><br />This album is very good in my opinion, but it took quite a few months for me to realise this. The albums that have come after OK Computer are more difficult to get into, and you really have to open your ears to appreciate what you're hearing. You can't just sit back and hope to like it, you've got to put the effort in as well. The music on this album divides critics because some see it as self-indulgent twaddle, while others see it as great music by a band who are experimenting with their sound through different styles and genres. The people who don't like it tend to be single-minded middle aged men who listen to nothing but glorified rock from bands such as Oasis, Led Zeppelin amongst others, and while there's nothing wrong with that music, they should really try and open their ears a bit more instead of being set in their ways.<br /><br />Amnesiac opens with the brilliant \\"Packt Like Sardines In A Crushd Tin Box.\\" This song has a tinny, transparent sound to it that sounds just like the title of the song suggests. The beats here are very electronic and ambient, and the chorus is memorable as Thom Yorke mumbles, \\"I'm a reasonable man, get off my case, get off my case!\\" The next song is the beautiful ballad \\"Pyramid Song.\\" This song is a very gorgeous and heavy slow song with sullen wails and aching cries. Thom's vocals seem very off-key to begin with, but they soon become crystalline. The last two minutes of this song are brilliant and very visual; I imagine looking at a lake, shrouded in dense fog whenever I hear this song. \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" is one of my favourite songs that Radiohead have ever recorded, despite certain people criticising it. The reason for my love of this song is that it is unlike anything I have ever heard before, and this is because of the amazing beat that runs through the song. It starts abruptly and catches you off-guard with a beat that slams in hard four times. It then stops, and starts again, and stops and...you get the picture. Yorke's vocals are distorted here, adding a sense of coldness to the song; there's no emotion here, but the mechanical sound of the song is very memorable. \\"You And Whose Army?\\" is another amazing ballad that features clouded vocals from Yorke. You could imagine being surrounded by a pale blue light as he sings to you through the dense darkness. This song has political undertones and an amazing final minute where Thom's vocals ascend, sounding more like a rock standard from any other band.<br /><br />\\"I Might Be Wrong\\" is another amazing piece of work that doesn't reply too much on the electronica of some other songs. The song has a rather catchy beat that runs the length of the song. Yorke's vocals are hidden behind this beat, sounding almost muse-like. \\"Knives Out\\" is probably the most accessible song on the album, and it's no surprise that it was one of the album's few singles. The video to this song is just crazy. The song itself, however, isn't so and sounds very typical of late Nineties Radiohead. The beat is rather fast and the lyrics are astounding as always. Yorke's vocals are on top form in this song which is rather gloomy and depressing in tone, but ultimately a great song with a peppy sound that contradicts its message. \\"Morning Bell/Amnesiac\\" is probably my least favourite song on the album, because I really don't like the intro. Yorke's vocals grate on me here a bit, but luckily the album is redeemed with the brilliant \\"Dollars & Cents.\\" This song is so unusual and features a great string section that adds a sense of epicness to the song. I can't quite explain it, but this song has a beat that sounds just like the title suggests; like cents being dropped into a money box!<br /><br />\\"Hunting Bears\\" is a short intro style song that runs for just two minutes. The guitar here is a bit harsher than anything else on the album, and the song seems pretty pointless. \\"Like Spinning Plates\\" is similar to Pulk/Pull from earlier in the album because there is a great focus on minimalism. It can be argued which song best achieves this, and while I think Pulk/Pull does, many others feel this song is more successful in doing so. The song opens with a strange beat that does indeed sound like plates spinning around at high speed which is joined by a jittery sound. There's no singing until about 106 seconds into the song, and when we finally do hear Yorke's voice, his vocals have been reversed so we don't know what on earth he's singing about! Overall a great song. The album closes with \\"Life In A Glasshouse,\\" which is not the best song on the album but still features strongly in the album as a whole. The song features almost jazzy undertones and a strange trumpet, which recalls \\"The National Anthem\\" from the Kid A album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />What I have noticed a lot by listening to this album is the way in which Thom Yorke has a brilliant knack for giving songs names that sound very similar to what you actually hear. This is evident on the first song of the album, and on songs such as \\"Dollars & Cents\\" and \\"Like Spinning Plates.\\" This isn't the best Radiohead album in my personal opinion, but it's still very good and essential in any fan's collection. If you don't like it, try to listen to it more because it does grow on you. Infact, I'd probably place Amnesiac as my second favourite Radiohead album after OK Computer, because I'm far more inclined to the experimentation of their latest albums that their earlier stuff on \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"The Bends.\\"d with the brilliant \\"Dollars & Cents.\\" This song is so unusual and features a great string section that adds a sense of epicness to the song.

Infact, I'd probably place Amnesiac as my second favourite Radiohead album after OK Computer, because I'm far more inclined to the experimentation of theirlatest albums that their earlier stuff on \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"The Bends.\\"
B000268QB2|4.0|This album is soothing and has a certain chill out factor one needs from time to time. Apparently, they are a part of a Britpop rebirth. However, the version of Britpop is up for debate. I think it is close to Coldplay, Flannelmouth and Radiohead. I can certainly recommend this album if it is the chill out factor you are looking for. Listen to the clips and you will know what I mean.
B000002LQR|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are arguably my favourite band ever. They are a band that everyone has heard of, and millions of people buy their records. The resurgence in their popularity with 1999's \\"Californication,\\" and 2002's \\"By The Way\\" saw a whole new generation of teenagers go out and buy their back catalogue. I am one of these 'new fans' and have only been a fan for about three or four years, but in that time I've bought eight albums by the Chili Peppers, and at some point will probably own all of their records. When I listen to their music, I just get taken to another place, and I really like that place! Not many bands can last for twenty years and be at a point of such critical and commercial success.<br /><br />The band's most prolific album to date still remains their 1991 classic \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" which was released on the same day as Nirvana's \\"Nevermind!\\" That's something that doesn't happen very often; two all-time classics released on the same day! While Nevermind had more of a cultural impact and sold more, in my opinion, Blood Sugar Sex Magik is a *slightly* better collection of songs. There's seventeen songs here of pure rock and funk, and they all flow so seamlessly. I've actually owned this album for over a year, and just couldn't get into it. It's taken quite a while to penetrate the genius of this record, but once this is achieved, the results are sure to be rewarding for years to come.<br /><br />The album opens with the funky \\"The Power Of Equality.\\" While not one of the best songs on the album, this is a great intro that prepares the listener for what is to come over the next hour or so. Anthony Kiedis' vocals are sharp and precise. \\"If You Have To Ask\\" is an even better song with a deep rap in the verses, complemented by high backing vocals in the chorus. This song works very well with catchy guitar licks decorating the bass. \\"Breaking The Girl\\" is an almost waltz-like song with a sweeping chorus between the lyrics, \\"Twisting and turning, you're feeling the burning, you're breaking the girl!\\" A classic in the Chili Peppers back catalogue. \\"Funky Monks\\" is a great, funky, upbeat song with fresh vocals and a strong melody. Anthony's vocals are very appealing and the repetition of the lines in the verses is very anthemic. The high vocals, \\"You are on the run,\\" in the chorus also add to the song's longevity. \\"Suck My Kiss\\" is a very powerful rock song with hard-hitting vocals and string drums. The guitar riff of this song is incredible, and the way the lyrics make you think dirty thoughts is so subliminal that after a while you just grow accustomed to them!<br /><br />\\"I Could Have Lied\\" is one of the best songs on the album, but is often lost in the loud and funky reputation of this album. This is actually a very gentle ballad that will just take you to another place - a place of tranquility and perhaps even spirituality. The verses are gentle like a lullaby and the choruses are powerful, albeit soft in their melody. The guitar solo is the centre of genius on this masterpiece. \\"Mellowship Slinky In B Major\\" brings the funk back to the forefront with a stomping guitar riff that runs through the song. The peppy beat of this song soon morphs into a beast for the chorus. \\"The Righteous & The Wicked\\" has a force that just drives and drives into your head, with a swinging chorus that is just meant to be sang loud and proud in a car, with the roof down, on a long road trip through the desert! \\"Give It Away\\" is a classic and the second most popular song from the album. The video to this song is amazing and very sexual (isn't this just the sexiest rock band around?!) but the song is so much more! The pure funk on this song cannot be denied. It's totally undiluted, carnal, feeling the beat that rocks your body. The drums are incredible and guitar solos are works of genius.<br /><br />The album's title track, \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" rocks hard but has a soft, gentle intro. The choruses are a melting pot of rock, funk, hints of pop, and rap. The true centrepiece of the album and easily the most famous song by the band ever is the next song. It is of course \\"Under The Bridge,\\" and is worth nothing less than the title of masterpiece. This song saved the band and meant so much to millions of people all over the world. An anthem if ever I heard one! \\"Naked In The Rain\\" is one of my favourite songs from the album, because it has a punk rock style to it that is somehow separate from every other song from the album. The verses are well structured, the bridges flow seamlessly between the verses and choruses, and the chorus is, well, just amazing. The backing vocals that sing \\"Naked in the rain!\\" are awesome. \\"Apache Rose Peacock\\" is another fantastic song that tells a cute little story about a girl Anthony saw, and his reaction to this. His reaction is hilarious and very explicit with hints of animal passions underneath!<br /><br />\\"The Greeting Song\\" is a fast-paced song that rocks well but reminds me of something from \\"Mother's Milk\\" more than the rest of the material from this album. It's still quite a good song though, just not the best. \\"My Lovely Man\\" is a brilliant song because Flea plays a very melodic bass here, one of the highlights of his career in this amazing band. \\"Sir Psycho Sexy\\" is the longest track on the album at just over eight minutes, and it's not really one of my favourites. The lyrics are probably the most explicit I've ever heard in any song, and as a gay man, it's a bit gritty to hear all about these female sex passions! The lyrics as a whole are more of a poem, though, and what a poem. The album closes with \\"They're Red Hot,\\" which is a rather pointless outro to any otherwise amazing album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This album sold around 8 million copies in America throughout the Nineties, and is one of those classic rock albums that will just continue to sell and sell and sell! The music is timeless, and because of this it WILL keep selling for decades to come, meaning different things to whole new generations of fans. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are an incredible rock band, and their place in the hall of fame is definitely secured. This album is a big reason why, and one of the reasons why I will continue to buy anything they release in the future. Work begun in March on the band's new album, and is surely one of the most anticipated records in years!

B000002UAU|5.0|Nobody has to tell you about Sgt.Pepper's influence, its the Citizen Kane of pop music. But as far as the greatest Beatles album of all time, Revolver takes that title. Any way you look at it Sgt.Pepper is the height of their studio work, where songs like Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds, Mr Kite, and of course A Day In The Life will silence anyone who rip on The Beatles. From the start SPLHCB was Paul McCartney's brainchild, where he created a fictitious rock band to move away from being \\"The Beatles\\".The title track(in a brilliant medley with Ringo's singing spot With a Little Help From My Friends),Getting Better, and When I'm 64 shows Paul versatility with different styles of music with extraordinary results. Within You, Without You is George Harrison's best Raga song of the trio he recorded with the group(Love You To &lt;Revolver> &The Inner Light &lt;the B-side of Lady Madonna> rounds them out).Unfortunately, Pepper has been labeled a psychedelic album. Although chemical consumption was one of the factors in making this album, Magical Mystery Tour was their real foray into psychedelic music. One of my many gripes about Pepper are the rip-offs that followed(Her Satanic Majesties Request, After Bathing at Baxter's)as well as that 1978 turkey of a movie. But like anything else in art, the more imitated and ripped off, the greater the art. <br />
B000002MG1|4.0|R.E.M. are one of the most consistent rock bands of the past twenty years and have enjoyed huge success all over the world. They're one of those bands who I've always known about, but never actually felt the desire to buy one of their albums. This changed late last year when I bought perhaps their most popular album to date, 1992's \\"Automatic For The People.\\" I have enjoyed this album a lot over the past few months, but I wouldn't say it's a masterpiece that has urged me to purchase their entire back catalogue, as I have done with other acts such as Radiohead and the Red Hot Chili Peppers.<br /><br />This album was released in a flurry of hype and critical-acclaim because of the singles taken from it. It was an album hailed as one of the best rock records of the past ten years, and it topped the charts all over the world. I personally think that this album has its highs and lows, but the highs, fortunately, far outweigh the few lows. Lead singer Michael Stipe has a distinct vocal style with a trademark yelp that defines the music his band makes, which is a mixture of rock, pop and traces of folk.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Drive,\\" which is a rather dark song that sets the tone for the album. This doesn't necessarily mean that this is a dark album, but it definitely has shades of grey (like the album cover displays) that define its style. This is also one of Tori Amos' top ten songs of all time, and that woman knows her music! \\"Try Not To Breathe\\" is another great song with a great guitar running through the song. Stipe sings with passion here in one of the album's best unreleased songs. \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonite\\" is definitely an album highlight in my opinion. I love this song because it really is so catchy and melodic. It's also a massive radio hit and will be played for years to come - one of those songs you grew up listening to and could hum along to off by heart. \\"Everybody Hurts\\" is possibly the band's most popular song ever, and widely classed as one of the most emotional songs ever recorded! This is indeed a beautiful ballad and a landmark of the Nineties, but I've heard it a million times that sometimes it starts to grate a little bit.<br /><br />\\"New Orleans Instrumental No.1\\" is just over two minutes long and seems rather pointless. This is followed by \\"Sweetness Follows\\" which is a rather poignant and relaxing ballad. The guitar is an ever-present force in this visual song. The song is the kind of song to think back and contemplate your thoughts on with thought-provoking lyrics and beautiful lyrics from Stipe. There's a real sense of melancholy in this song which works so well in the centre of the album. \\"Monty Got A Raw Deal\\" is an average song in my opinion and doesn't really do much or go anywhere interesting. Repeated listening might change my mind on this song, but I'm not holding my breath! \\"Ignoreland\\" is one of the best songs on the album and one of the true rockers on an album which features many slow songs. This song has a thumping beat and rocking verses. Stipe's vocals are incredible here, and the build up to the chorus with the \\"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!\\"'s is very impressive.<br /><br />\\"Star Me Kitten\\" is seen my many as a forgettable song, but it's actually one of the songs that I remembered the most on my second listen of this album after the initial first listen. Stipes' vocals in the verses are beautiful and work very well with the guitar which is very spacious and epic. \\"Man On The Moon\\" is an absolute gem of a song and probably one of the finest songs that I have ever heard. This is another very memorable song that literally everyone - no matter what you're age, race or music style - will have heard of. It's a true classic, with important lyrics that are also catchy and very melodic. The chorus is amazing as it ponders on the possibility of life after death. \\"Nightswimming\\" is another stunning song with a gorgeous piano. Stipes' vocals crack on \\"Nightswimming, *deserves* a quiet night!\\" creating the most emotional and gorgeous song on the album in my opinion. The idea of being naked swimming in water, used as a metaphor for Stipes emotions is a great idea. The album closes with the gorgeous \\"Find The River,\\" which features a very classy production. Stipe sings with passion as always, and the lyrics are beautiful.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 8/10<br /><br />This album isn't perfect, but it's very good. If you're looking for quality music, R.E.M. wouldn't be at the top of my list, but they'd definitely be in there. Their music has had its ups and downs in the past twenty years and they have released countless albums, but the work as a whole stands out impressively well. Automatic For The People is one of the few albums from their career which should find its way into every true music lover's record collection. From its world sales, I'd say it's made its way into quite a lot in the past 12 years.\\" creating the most emotional and gorgeous song on the album in my opinion.

B000002UAF|5.0|Now this is a great example of top notch musicianship .Not only was this the soundtrack to The Beatles first feature film ,and it was made under a tight deadline, but its also their first album consisting of entirely Lennon & McCartney compositions. Also amazing is the fact is that not only did it include the eight film songs but has extra material that are no means filler. There no denying the quality of classic material here, from the rocking title song to the pop swing of the happy-go-lucky I Should've Known Better and the classic ballads If I Fell, And I Love Her, Things We Said Today, and I'll Be Back. I'll Cry Instead is their first foray into country western territory that will be fully explored on their next album Beatles For Sale. Though Can't Buy Me Love has not worn well over the years, its still a bona fide classic. Like the movie itself, this album always seem to recall The Beatles in a more innocent time, though the music is just a next step into the evolution of the greatest body of work in pop music history. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Maybe the greatest show ever  Buy it right now <br />(Whedon fans show your support)
B000002UAI|5.0|Many have commented on the album cover, showing the group a little frazzled from the last two years. Nothing could be farther from the truth as Beatles For Sale, although a great album, is a bit of a disappointment, especially coming after A Hard Days Night. Where the previous album was made up entirely of original material, BFS goes back to the Please, Please Me/With The Beatles format of eight new song plus covers. Fortunately this album was a progression in the evolution of their music. A new influence named Bob Dylan prevailed on song like No Reply, I'm A Loser and Baby's In Black, as well as country western in I Don't Want To Spoil The Party. The cover songs aren't too shabby neither especially Buddy Holly's Words Of Love and Ringo's take on Carl Perkins' Honey Don't. Though voted the least favorite Beatle recording(Maxwell's Silver Hammer got my vote on this one),Mr Moonlight features a very passionate John Lennon vocal. Like any great artists, The Beatles hit a snag with this album, but BFS has enough great moments to reassure you that its only a momentary lapse.
B0000DDAU9|5.0|Mastodon is a very talented band. Brann Dailor's drumming ALONE is worth purchasing. This album has exellent songwriting, there's no verse-chorus-verse-chorus-bridge-chorus thing here! Just great lyrics. There are also rapsy vocals and distorted bass from Troy Sanders, crushing guitar work from Bill Kelliher and Brent Hinds, as well as ocasional backing vocals from Hinds. . If you think Linkin Park is heavy, prepared to be scarred here. Mastodon, in addition to being ultra talented, is one of the heaviest bands in existance! The album starts with the addictive opener \\"Crusher Destroyer\\". It has a roar in the beginning and becomes a brutal math-metal song. The next song, \\"March of the Fire Ants\\", is a good song, another favorite, also the first Mastodon song I heard. The third track, \\"Where Strds The Behemoth\\", is my favortie song here. Just listen to Dailor's drumming. Other great songs include \\"Mother Puncher\\", Ol'e Nessie\\", and \\"Trilobite\\". All of these songs are good, but the above mentioned songs are my favorites. This is recomended if you like math metal, metal in general, or just good music in general.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />1. Crusher Destroyer 5/5<br /><br />2. March Of The Fire Ants 55/5<br /><br />3. Where Strides The Behemoth 5/5<br /><br />4. Workhorse 5/5<br /><br />5. Ol'e Nessie 5/5<br /><br />6. Burning Man 5/5<br /><br />7.

B000002UA9|5.0|After two hit singles(Love Me Do & Please,Please Me which eventually became the albums title track) an album was inevitable. But since The Beatles didn't have the clout for even a budget sized production, this album was recorded in one day .In these days of artist spending millions, and taking years to complete an album, PPM is amazing in the fact that they practically banged this one out and 37 years later despite many rough edges, it still sounds fresh. Another amazing facet was that 60% of the album was self composed, especially at a time when musical acts recorded other writers songs suggested by their producer. This was essentially their stage show in the studio, where they even topped it off with their no holds barred performance of Twist & Shout. The originals(especially I Saw Her Standing There, Ask Me Why, PS I Love You,& Do You Want To Know A Secret) follow up on the precedent that the two aforementioned lead singles had set. The cover songs aren't no slouches either(the sweet Anna, Boys, A Taste Of Honey and of course Twist & Shout).Some of today's mainstream music listeners may be put of by the rough edges, flubbed notes and shaky vocals, but its those flaws that give PPM its charm.

B000002UZ1|5.0|After The Beatles retired from touring, they could've easily became complacent especially after changing the face of pop music. But this is where the fun really begins.67-70 represents their studio years where they took their music to unimaginable heights(Strawberry Fields Forever, SGT PEPPER, Magical Mystery Tour) then they came crashing down(the white album, Let It Be)and went out in style(Abbey Road).Though a much better collection than 62-66(and you don't get shortchanged this time),these two sister albums represent the epitome of pop musician required listen for any musician to show them how its suppose to be done, as well as a must have for any music fan. Granted the whole picture can be found on their individual albums(especially Rubber Soul, Revolver, Sgt Pepper, Abbey Road),but once you experience these two, you will want more. A splendid time will be guaranteed indeed. <br />
B000001DYJ|5.0|This is my favorite KISS album ever, and that is saying quite a bit. KISS's incredible beat and guitar steal the show yet again. <br />Track by track: <br />01 - Creatures of the Night: Very good song, especially to open up the concert. Nice explosion at the beginning. 9/10. <br />02 - Deuce: Great, great song. Incredibly driving beat, and nice solo. 9/10. <br />03 - I Just Wanna: I love most of the song except the chorus, which isn't really that great. Good song overall though. 8/10. <br />04 - Unholy: I love this song. What more to say? 10/10. <br />05 - Heaven's on Fire: The lyrics are a bit...suggestive, perhaps, but the song is still great. The backup in the chorus sounds good. 9.5/10. <br />06 - Watchin' You: Great beginning. Afterwards, though, the song deteriorates in my opinion. 7.5/10. <br />07 - Domino: This is a good song, but not a great version. The singing is too low to hear very well. 7.5/10. <br />08 - I Was Made for Lovin' You: This is definitely one of my favorite KISS songs, and this version is fantastic. I especially like the explosions in place of drums at one part. 10/10. <br />09 - I Still Love You: Very good song, but a bit repetitive. I prefer the harder rock songs by KISS, not the slow ones. Still, this song is sung with a great deal of dedication. 8/10. <br />10 - Rock and Roll All Nite: KISS's most famous song, and a great one. Incredible beat, great guitar, awesome melody. 10/10. <br />11 - Lick it Up: Again, the lyrics are very suggestive. The song itself is good but repetitive. 9/10. <br />12 - Forever: This is actually a good slow KISS song. Well, not exactly slow, but definitely not hard rock. 9/10. <br />13 - I Love it Loud: My favorite KISS song of all time. I just can't find anything wrong with this song. It's pure hard rock :) 20/10. <br />14 - Detroit Rock City: Probably my second favorite. Insane beat, awesome drums, incredible guitar, great lyrics...it's got everything. 15/10. <br />15 - God Gave Rock 'N' Roll To You: I likethis song a lot. I don't think KISS wrote it, but they play it well. 9/10. <br />16 - Star Spangled Banner: It's ok, but more of a ripoff of Hendrix's Woodstock performance than anything else, and not as good. I won't rate this one because it has no lyrics, and it's just the guitar. <br /> <br />In short: If you only one KISS album, get this one. This is, in my opinion, the ultimate album. GO KISS!!
B000002UAC|5.0|On my 16th birthday back in the 80's, I receive The Beatles Collection, A box set containing the original twelve albums in their British configuration(on vinyl even)thus even before the first wave of CD realizes was weaned on these versions. The US release Meet The Beatles(the difference being the inclusion of the With The Beatles originals, Till There Was You, I Saw Her Standing There, and the I Want To Hold Your Hand/This Boy single)was once called the soundtrack to Beatlemania. A little more snappier than its British counterpart, but it doesn't give you a full picture. With The Beatles continued the progression of the group as a well oiled unit. The rough edges of Please, Please Me are smoothed out and the originals(especially All My Loving Wanna Be Your Man,& It Won't Be Long) display a much needed injection of confidence. The covers displays the group as versatile stylist(from the rockers Roll Over,Beethoven, Money and the Music Man's Till There Was You).Even George's melancholy Don't Bother Me shows he's on the right track(especially with later songs like Taxman, While My Guitar.. and Something).Most acts rest on they're laurels after a success like PPM, but WTB shows that this is another stepping stone to the next level of success.
B0008ISM40|5.0|All I really have to say about this album is to make sure you get the dualdisc version and listen to it in surround sound or you will never appreciate this album for what it's worth.  The best production I have ever heard on an album.  You can really tell Trent enjoyed making this album, and how much he likes his fans.  I just hope we start seeing more of his albums released in 5.1 format.  And as a side note, the title song is amazing, unlike what most people say.
B000002UDB|5.0|Where Pepper has been labeled a psychedelic album, MMT shows a more detailed picture of The Beatles foray in this genre. Where the British version was a two EP set(?)of the soundtrack music, the US version expanded it to an album that included the non-album singles from '67(Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane, All You Need Is Love/Baby, You're A Rich Man & Hello, Goodbye).The best songs from the film are the now standard Fool On The Hill, as well as the brilliant I Am The Walrus. Your Mother Should Know has a certain charm that even made the final scene in that terrible movie a welcome relief. Even for those who didn't see MMT(or who did and regrets it)the music in the end always conjures up a vivid picture of The Beatles psychedelic period.
B000060MMI|5.0|It would be the understatement of the year if I said I loved Flogging Molly- They just are that good! I first heard them on the 10th Warped Tour CD and I fell in love. This album is dripping with emotion. Dave's writing is at its best here, and the band's energy is even present in this recording. There is a reason this band has the rep for being the best live band in the world. Buy this CD and you will find yourself chanting with the best of us at the next show
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles self titled double album AKA the white album, is probably the most brilliant yet bewildering album ever. You get great music by Lennon, McCartney, Harrison & Starr, but not The Beatles. By 1968,group unity was virtually non-existent.   Each member worked on their own tracks(sometimes Paul would play, as well as over-dub his own music without the rest),while the others only functioned as session players. The music however isn't without merit. From Back In The USSR all the way through Goodnight, the album has a diverse, yet chaotic appeal that would be disastrous in anyone else hands. The album goes from rock(Helter Skelter, Yer Blues, While My Guitar..,Everybody's Got Something To Hide..)to pastoral(Dear Prudence, Mother Natures Son, Blackbird)personal(Julia, I'm So Tired, Sexy Sadie)to even whimsy(Obla-Di,Obla-Da, Martha My Dear, Piggies, Birthday)with an ease that only The Smashing Pumpkins Mellon Collie.. has ever come close to achieving. Even though Anthology 3's white album out-takes show the tension between the group wasn't on tape, the real tensions were ahead. And although an ironically titles album, it paves the way towards their 70's solo albums.
B0007N1AI6|5.0|What an album! judas Priest have been out for ages and really do know how to put on a show. Brilliant guitar riffs, vocals and fast drumming makes this very listenable, over and over. <br /> <br />If you like iron Maiden, Pantera, Black sabbath and Slayer, buy this!
B000002UYZ|5.0|My original rating is 4.5 due to the shameless way this album is sold and the justification is preserving the original format of the album. But hey, it's the Beatles, in all their glory going from a reckless band breaking in a new drummer(Love Me Do, Please, Please Me) to a more polished act(I Wanna Hold Your Hand, A Hard Days Night) and breaking new grounds(Yesterday, We Can Work It Out)and pushing the barriers of pop music(RUBBER SOUL, REVOLVER, Paperback Writer).From reading most of the reviews, it seems the Beatles have somewhat falling out of favor, especially by those who weren't born during the Beatles reign was born six months after their break-up and the Beatles still are as influential to me as REM & Beck. Some say \\"they weren't great musician, the songs were corny, they're outdated\\".Judging them by today standards this may be true. But if it weren't for the Beatles, pop music would be a very uninteresting place. Sure John's chord strumming was a bit repetitive at times, George's leads were copied from Chuck Berry & Scotty Moore(who's weren't)and Ringo's drumming had nothing on Keith Moon. But what they lacked in chops, they made up for in the music. Sure it started out as \\"bubblegum\\" at first ,but their songs evolved and became more complexed. As they pushed the boundaries of songwriting (using modes, and changing keys in off the cuff places)their use of the recording studio was amazing as well as their experimenting with other instrument(the string quartet on Yesterday & the sitar on Norwiegian Wood).Maybe those of you who dis The Beatles should remember that some of these things we take for granted in music were pioneered by them. And for every uptight snooty band more interested in finding the lost chord should remember that the one's who lack in musicianship are the ones who are the most ingenius (REM, The Velvet Underground...). <br />
B000062YAZ|5.0|What a great album! These dudes really are in league with Iron Maiden and Judas Priest, not to mention Pantera. They are the ultimate classic heavy metal band and are the poster boys for any other metal/rock band since.  <br /> <br /> Heavy guitar riffs and bass make this an extremely listenable piece of art. Not for everyone, but if you enjoy abit of the old Black Sabbath or ACDC, check this out!
B00001NFCY|5.0|Human Clay is (in my opinion) the greatest Creed album of all time. I think this was my 4th cd I had ever bought, and it was my first Creed album. With \\"Are You Ready\\" Human Clay starts well. The song is great and is one of the high points of the album. Next is the superior \\"What If\\", a strong song that is one of the finest Creed songs to date. After that is the less impressive \\"Beautiful\\", but I can listen all the way through it every time. After \\"Beautiful\\" Human Clay continues to rise and really never comes down. \\"Say I\\" is one of my favorite Creed songs, even though its oblivious that it probably wouldn't have done good as a single. Next is \\"The Wrong Way\\", another good song. Next is the excellent \\"Faceless Man\\", the 2nd song I learned to love from the album. I wish Creed would have released this song as a single, I think it really had the potential. After \\"Faceless Man\\" is \\"Never Die\\", another good song that kinda reminds me of \\"The Wrong Way\\". Next is \\"With Arms Wide Open\\", a truly excellent song that went on to be a #1 single. After \\" With Arms Wide Open\\" is \\"Higher\\". \\"Higher\\" is one of Creeds most popular songs and is my favorite song. After \\"Higher\\" Human Clay sorta levels off, but that didn't suprise me, it would be hard to have a better song than \\"With Arms Wide Open\\" and \\"Higher\\". \\"Wash Away Those Years\\" is a good song, and is played commonly on my player. The last song is \\"Inside Us All\\", which is I think the lowest point on the album, but is still good in its own right.       So with all that being said I believe Human Clay is one of the finest cds ever made, and is certainly Creeds best.  (P.S. I've heard Creed being compared to Pearl Jam, and I've checked them out as well, and I really don't think they even come close to Creed. I would really recommend this album over any Pearl Jam album ever released.)
0553213105|5.0|This classic novel  follows the Bennet sisters as they search for marriage.  The joy of this book is relating it to modern day romance and marriage.  Many parts of the conversations and desires are familiar to today, while many other parts are foreign.  Austen also has a great sense of humor, although many times I wondered whether it was intended as funny or whether it only appeared comical from a  modern point of view.
B000002TLX|5.0|It is no doubt that Richard Marx is one of the most talented singers and songwriters of the last two decades. It is a pity he is not in the limelight these days. This collection encompasses the best he has to offer. There are a few tracks that could have made this collection even more impressive than it already is. Yet, it still is a musical gem.<br /><br />  The highlights of the album are \\"Endless Summer nights\\", \\"Right Here Waiting\\", \\"Angelia\\" and \\"Children of the night\\". The other songs are comparable. For anyone that wants to listen to love songs that will kill you with their intensity, this is the collection to listen to.<br /><br />  Thank you Richard for two decades of fabulous music!!!!
B00005JNTV|4.0|Ah, the joys of having a theater right across the street.  Tonight, after work, we decided to check out Sin City, as we've been wanting to see it for quite a while.  So, on opening night of the new theater, we tromped on over, gave them our pre-paid passes and sat down in the theater.  After numerous commercials and numerous trailers (boo to the commercials!), the first scene came on.  A little over two hours later, we came out of the theater entertained, though slightly disappointed by the whole thing.<br /><br />Sin City is based on a series of graphic novels by Frank Miller, and it looks like it.  As numerous articles have stated, the movie looks like it took panels straight out of the comics.  Three storylines are used, beginning with Bruce Willis trying to track down a child molester on his last day on the job.  We then get Mickey Rourke playing Marv, a disfigured man who finally finds a woman who is nice to him, getting framed for the murder of a prostitute.  Finally, Clive Owen gets involved with the wrong woman, which could bring the end of the truce between the prostitutes that run Old Town and the police.  We then go back to Willis' story to finish the film, as the girl he saved is all grown up and carrying a torch for him, even as others are after her.<br /><br />Sin City is told in a noir style, with voice-overs throughout the entire movie.  It became slightly weird when some of Owen's voice-overs actually came directly out of his mouth, but then again this is in a scene where he's talking to a dead guy (and the dead guy is talking back), so perhaps it's excusable.  Some of the dialogue in these voice-overs (as well as dialogue between the characters) is overdone, sounding wooden and relying on the actors to make it even remotely believable.  A lot of Mickey Rourke's dialogue is like this, and he's not as successful in making it palatable as Owen is.  Other dialogue, however, fits the style perfectly, and while it's not Shakespeare, it's not meant to be.  The successful lines are those that the actors take just this side of serious, but still have some fun with it.<br /><br />Sadly, Brittany Murphy is not one who can do that.  Her acting is horrible in this movie, her breathy delivery of the noir dialogue reinforcing how corny it really is.  She tries really hard to be the femme fatale, but she fails miserably.  She has one long scene with Owen and Benicio Del Toro, and they both run her over with their talent.  When she finally leaves the screen, I breathed a sigh of relief.  It helps that Owen's segment was the best of the three and he gets to interact with Rosario Dawson and the rest of the prostitutes.  I was quickly able to forget Murphy and move on.  Jessica Alba as Nancy, the grown-up version of the girl Willis rescues, is ok but not wonderful.  Thankfully, that applies to most of the rest, too.<br /><br />Standouts do include Owen and Del Toro (who has some hilarious scenes after a certain event happens), Willis doing a good job of playing the \\"hard as nails with a heart of gold\\" role that he often plays, and Michael Madsen as Willis' partner.  Madsen has one of the toughest jobs, as his dialogue is some of the worst, but he does a good job overcoming it.  Maybe he's used to bad dialogue by now, given the movies he's been in.  Rosario Dawson also does a good job with what she has, though her final scene is a bit overplayed.<br /><br />The violence is quite graphic, with red blood being enhanced by the black and white photography.  Even when you don't see the bullet enter the head, you often see the blood splatter on the person doing the killing.  If violence makes you squeamish, this is not the movie for you.  For some reason, the movie seems to have a crotch fetish, as quite a few characters are shot or otherwise stabbed in the nether regions.  This all was quite shocking at first (and I was *ready* for the violence, so it's not like it was a surprise), but I quickly got used to it.  Mickey Rourke's storyis probably the most violent, as there are close gunshots, blood flying from punches, beheadings, cannibalism, and an axe being applied to almost every part of the human body.  Once that story is over, it's toned down a bit.  Of course, that's like saying a category 4 hurricane is toned down from a category 5, so don't get the wrong impression.<br /><br />Is the movie good?  Is it worth seeing?  I can tell you that I enjoyed it.  The violence is very stylized and well-choreographed.  The stories are interesting and the characters, while often over the top, are still engaging.  The acting fits the story for the most part, with the exception of Murphy.  Some of the characters weave through the various storylines, making cameos in the ones that don't directly involve them and giving the movie something to tie all of the stories together.  I liked how Willis' story framed the other two, giving us both the beginning and end of the movie.<br /><br />Finally, I didn't mind the grimness.  And this movie *is* grim.  Not only is it violent, but don't expect the usual ending to any of the stories.  A lot of people who like violent movies go to enjoy the mindless action, thinking \\"ooooooo cool explosions\\" and letting it wash over them.  It can be a fun way to watch some brainless eye candy.  Don't go to this film expecting the same.  It is not fun.  There are a few funny moments, some witticisms by some of the characters, but this isn't your normal action movie.  It can bring you down if you're not careful.  Still, if you like this sort of thing, Sin City is a wonderful example of the genre.e's story is probably the most violent, as there are close gunshots, blood flying from punches, beheadings, cannibalism, and an axe being applied to almost every part of the human body.

B0007DAZW8|2.0|I believe as a musician, that it's important to express one's self through his/her music. <br />This is very appearant in Daft Punk's latest production.......................BECAUSE MANNNN!!! I DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE THINKING OR SMOKING WHEN THEY MADE THIS ALBUM. <br />I'm gonna be brutally honest - this album has pure CHEEEZZZZZZ written all over it (with the exception of MAYBE 2 tracks). <br />Most of the album sounds like they layered a few tracks, hit the Quantize Button on the keyboard, LEFT TO THE BATHROOM FOR FIVE MINUTES, AND THEN COME BACK AND PRESSED STOP!!! <br /> <br />For those who beg to differ, play this album in front of your homies and guage the reaction. <br />Unless they're HIGH AS A ROCKET, I GUARENTEE THEY'LL HAVE A NEGATIVE RESPONSE.  <br />NOT EVEN GOOD ENOUGH FOR THOSE MELLOW \\"PRIVATE\\" OR \\"LISTENING\\" SESSIONS. <br />I've followed Daft Punk for a good while now and I'm becoming less and less a believer with each production album they put out. I'll TRY and keep-the-faith anyway.  <br />The \\"HOMEWORK\\" days are gone!!! <br />PEACE!!!
B000002OX7|5.0|When \\"Who's Next\\" was released in 1971, it was more or less the result of a compromise between their record company and the band. Pete Townsend had since \\"Tommy\\" been working hard on a very ambitious project called \\"Lifehouse\\", which would feature at least 20 songs. For several reasons this project never saw the light of day, but some of the best songs were released as the album \\"Who's Next\\".<br /><br />Though Townsend was frustrated with having to do with this compromise, the album is among the very best Who albums and is often referred to as album of the year 1971.<br /><br />It features classic Who songs as \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\", \\"Behind Blue Eyes\\" and \\"Getting in Tune\\"; in fact all tracks are incredibly strong. The Who's playing and Daltrey's vocals were never better.<br /><br />A lot of the abandoned \\"Lifehouse\\" tracks have been released over the years. The \\"Odds and Sods\\" rarities compilation from 1974 contained some very strong tracks from it.<br /><br />The bonus-tracks \\"Pure and Easy\\", \\"Baby Don't You Do it\\" and \\"Too Much of Anything\\" are abandoned \\"Lifehouse\\" tracks.<br /><br />Unfortunately the complete \\"Lifehouse\\" album can never be released as some songs have been lost due to deteriorated  mastertapes.<br /><br />Still, this CD release contains some much great music that it would be ungrateful to moan about what was lost, and not just enjoy what was released.
B000002ADT|5.0|If I was limited to five albums on a desert island, I would also take along \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floyd, \\"Siamese Dream,\\" by the Smashing Pumpkins, \\"Revolver,\\" by the Beatles, \\"A Love Supreme,\\" by John Coltrane, and \\"Strangeways, Here We Come,\\" by The Smiths, but if I could only take one, it would be \\"Kind of Blue.\\" <br /> <br />Simply put, \\"Kind of Blue\\" is the best record ever made, by any artist, in any genre of music, ever.  It will survive any amount of playing; it is impossible to tire of this wonderful album.  It is unlikely it will ever be surpassed.
0812550706|5.0|I first came across this book while in 7th grade.  At the time I purchased it merely for the interesting cover art, not knowing how much I would come to enjoy Card's work. <br />Set in the future where Humans are preparing for a third war with an alien species called the Formics or Buggers, Enders Game follows the path of young Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggen from a undersized child in elementary school to a teenage commander of the Human fleet. <br />Card's storytelling is top notch in this book, creating detailed settings and interesting characters to occupy the book.  His ability to balance the immaturity and childish tendencies of the characters, while at the same time demonstrating their advanced intelligence is superb. <br />I was also impressed with the moral and ethical issues brought up by both the students and the commanders of the battle school as Ender faces and eventually overcomes several different obstacles on the way to his final showdown with the Formics.   <br />The only bad thing I can say about this book is that I wish it were longer.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I admit that I was extremely skepticle that this album would be good. The hype for it seemed over the top and I wasn't impressed with Charmbracelet which was supposed to be her original comeback album, but the album was a bland album. The only reason it flowed was because the songs all sounded the same. The Emancipation of Mimi, however, has many different colors to it, which creates a diverse album that still flows well. Unlike Mariah's other albums (although I only have a few others) like Rainbow and Butterfly, the songs don't all sound the same. On those albums Mariah stuck with a general formula which she apparently follows significantly less religiously. With this effort she has expanded and experimented with other sounds, yet still reminiscent of her older work.  <br /> <br />So the album starts off with a bang. It's Like That, a great song nonetheless, still I feel is not on par with Heartbreaker or Fantasy; my two favorite Mariah up-tempos. Still, it's hip-hop sound and care free message make it enjoyable. We Belong Together is one of the gems of this album. At first I thought this was going to be a boring song, but it's amazing. It reminds me of Breakdown, but more exciting vocally, with a more interesting melody and background music. Generally I find that this album contains much better background music that stands out as much as her vocals.  <br /> <br />The album continues into a few cool, calm songs. Shake it Off is a nice little R&B song. Mine Again has elements of typical Mariah ballads, but at the same time I find myself listening to the music in the background as well, which actually has instruments rather than keyboards. It's a nice change. Plus her voice sounds AMAZING on this song! (I'm currently listening to it actually.) Then we taste Mariah with The Neptunes on Say Somethin, which I feel is another best of the album since I love this kind of music. The beat flows so smooth along with Mariah's voice. Just a great song to move to. <br /> <br />Continuing into more up-tempos, Mariah works with JD who sounds surprisingly like Nelly, but produces one of his best songs in a long time. I thought he was slipping, but with this he's proving a comeback is coming. One and Only reminds me of Clowns from Charmbracelet, only it has much better melodies and it's more fun with the aid of a rapper (in this case, Twista). What sets this album apart from her others is the numerous up-tempos, as the ballads suddenly take a backseat, which I must admit is a nice change. I like hearing Mariah's hip-hop/dance side. Circles, however, delves back into typical Mariah territory nicely. Your Girl is a poppy dance-along/sing-along song. It's really fun and different than anything on this album, kinda like older Mariah up-tempos.  <br /> <br />I Wish You Knew is another nice, different sounding ballad, leading into the next song, To The Floor. I kind of expected more from Mariah and Nelly, but truthfully the song has grown on me upon numerous listens. It has a great beat and is another fun let <br />s-go-have-fun-tonight kind of song. Joy Ride reminds me of Bliss from Rainbow (content-wise) but sounds much different; so much so that I can't really compare the two otherwise. But the vocals on it are nice and strong, as they are in Fly Like A Bird, which is a great way to close the album. Mariah utilizes her voice and her backup singers nicely and creates a truly inspiring and uplifting song that the album lacked up until this point.  <br /> <br />If there is a Mariah album you're considering buying, this is the one to buy. Especially if you like up-tempos and are looking for a less formulaic Mariah. And as for the return of the voice, I would say she always had it, she's simply using it better and making better choices as to when to use her softer whispers versus when to belt. With this album, she generally balances the dynamics nicely, which many of us have missed from Mariah lately.
6305078491|3.0|Although filmed in 1932 with sound recording, Carl Theodor Dreyer's VAMPYR is for all intents and purposes a silent movie.  It is a fantastical story replete with vampires, coffins, a brace of beautiful virgins and stakes (metal this time around) to be driven through the hearts of the evil undead.  If it had replaced some of the thick atmospherics and languorous close-ups with a little more action I might have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />  Mood has always sat at the first table in vampire movies, and VAMPYR lays it on with a trowel.  Young Allan Grey (Julian West) stops at a strange inn.  An old man with a scythe walks along the river bank.  Shadows without bodies dance upon the walls.  A strange old man enters his room, rousing Allan from his sleep.  Quiet, the old man says.  She must not die!  Do you hear?  He takes a wrapped package, writes `To be opened after my death' on the outside, and then vanishes.<br /><br />  This might delight the gothic horror fan, but I found it confusing, with more confusion to follow - including the ending.  Not to say that there aren't some beautiful scenes buried within in this movie, but as a whole I found it baffling and not a lot of fun.  It doesn't help that this premium priced dvd boasts a very hard to watch transfer print.  Just about every frame has a scratch or flare and some of the scenes are incredibly washed out.<br /><br />  Appended on the end of the movie is Wladyslaw Starewicz's delightful 1934 THE MASCOT, aka THE DEVIL'S BALL.  Combining live action and stop-action animation, this 25 minute movie creates a surreal world of a child's dolls coming to life and partying with the oddest collection of characters this side of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas, a movie obviously deeply influenced by Starewicz's gem.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I rated this show with four stars. Even though I have problems with some of the story arcs, nevertheless I think it's better than both \\"Next-Gen\\" and \\"Voyager,\\" good though these were (TOS and DS-9 being favorites).     I must admit being a bit befuddled and dismayed by the show's early departure from the established history of the Trek universe; I had hoped we would get to see the formation of the Federation and be allowed to view the genesis of the Federation's conflicts with the Klingons and Romulans. Instead, we were shown a temporal cold-war and the Xindi story arc (if Earth was really devastated by a Xindi attack why did Spock never reference this important bit of history in TOS?). The Xindi arc was well done and I liked it, but it was a diversion from established Trek history.     I did think the main characters evolved nicely over the course of the show, particularly Archer and T'Pol-they took her character to some very interesting places.  Having Lt. Reed's operative status \\"recativated\\" was also a nice character revelation.       I'm just sorry it took four seasons for Manny Coto and Judith Reeves-Stevens to come on board. Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens (authors of some of the best Trek novels) should have been scripting plots from day one, instead of coming aboard only in the fourth season; they know the Trek universe better than the producers themselves. They could also have utilized other great Trek authors such as Keith R. A. DeCandido, Greg Cox and SA Perry.    Though each season had its share of very memorable shows, season four is by far the best, as it got back on track exploring TOS prehistory. Finally, the explanation for the marked differences between the Klingon's of TOS' era and those of the movies/ Picard's time! We were also shown the basis for the antagonism between the Andorians and Tellarites. The two-parter \\"In a Mirror Darkly\\" was nothing short of amazing! In this episode we get to see the mirror universe Enterprise crew aboard theUSS Defiant, one of twelve Consitution Class ships, and sister to Kirk's Enterprise (the Defiant was drawn into \\"interspace\\" in the award-winning TOS episode \\"The Tholian Web\\" and lost with all hands). Seeing the alterate Enterprise crew aboard the Defiant was awesome. The produces of Enterprise did a masterful job of recreating TOS starship sets. Seeing what the Tholians actually look like from the neck down was nice as well, although the sense of mystery regarding their full appearance which had been maintained heretofore was kind of nice. And as I said, it was also nice to see Lt. Reed as a covert intel agent in season four.    All-in-all Enterprise was a very worthy addition to the Trek universe; had it not been cancelled prematurely it could have truly gone where no man has gone before.    Live long and prosper.

0790732254|3.0|People rave about this movie -- and I had thought it would live to its reputation before I saw it -- but it just isn't convincing. Each of the four protagonists oscillates between being outrageous and borderline psychopatic, and being a normal person the next instant, then going back to crazy again. The older man, for instance, would insult his wife and bring her dirty laundry out in a particularly mean way, but when a minute later she does the same, he acts shocked that anyone could behave that way. Same goes for her, and in fact the other two as well, as the viewer is meant to be shocked by the outrageous person, then feeling emphatic for the normal person. And those reversals happen at the rate of one a minute. <br /> <br />Real people aren't that way, which makes this drama, while fairly interesting in itself, lose lots of its appeal -- it doesn't teach anything about the real world but about some imagined one where people's pshyches work in a different way.  <br /> <br />And not to forget that each of those four drinks maybe 10+ glasses of hard liquor in a short time -- and they were drunk before their fateful encounter to begin with. That doesn't make the intellectual exchange among them any more believable.
B0002858YS|4.0|My 17 year old nephew gave me this incredulous look when I said, \\"The album rocks.\\" As a 36 year child of the 80's British invasion scene, I heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and heard hints of Duran Duran underneath the music. Getting the album from my nephew, I gave it a listen and was hooked. There are definite undertones of U2 and the darker side of The Smiths. For those of us in our mid to late 30's looking for new music reminding us of the good old music days, go for it. I think you'll like it!
B00024BHTC|5.0|Oh, the reviewers here are making me so angry! Fair enough, you like Nightwish, you don't like this album. I can understand that. But what is the point of coming on here bashing Nightwish just 'cause you don't like this style of music? (and I mean YOU, 'A Music Fan'! Why are you calling yourself a music fan if you spend ages writing crap reviews for no reason?!)<br /><br />Another thing. How dare people say that Nightwish isn't for teenagers!! That's AGEISM you f**cking jerks, pure and simple. Nightwish is for anyone who appreciates them, ok? Not all teenagers like Limp Bizkit or Avril or whatever. I think it's really arrogant to be making assumptions like that ...<br /><br />Talking of assumptions ... why do lots of reviewers here keep making stupid ones? Like; 'Oh, only people from Finland would like this'. WTF?!! Or; 'All the reviews were written by 13 year olds'. That's obviously NOT true! (Just for the record ... I'm 16, and from Scotland, and a girl ... define THAT) I'd also love to know where this so-called 'Music fan' comes from ...<br /><br />'K. I should at least mention the album itself, since I'm technically reviewing it! I think it's amazing, their best work yet, but I loved Century Child, which apparently some people didn't. It seems to me that Nightwish are a band that varies a lot, and some of those variations are not to everyone's taste. People mentioned that Tarja's vocals are a lot less operatic ... I have to say, this is a welcome idea, in my book. Sorry, but after a while, her opera singing gets a little annoying. But not here!<br /><br />I think the best songs here are 'Romanticide' ... which grew on me, the dark feel to this song took a while to get used to; 'Planet Hell' ... this song rocks! It's got to be the perfect balance between symphony and metal; and the undescribable, amazing, wonderful 'Ghost love score'. Really. This song has to be heard to be understood.<br /><br />'Siren' is a great experimental song they pulled off; 'I wish I had an angel' is an experimental song they didn't. I know many fans like it, but I really don't, I'm afraid. It's the worst song on the album, I think. 'Higher that hope', though, is another great song, and of course, 'Nemo' is too. (I was humming that in Maths one day, and loads of people asked what I was singing ... proof that Nightwish have amazingly catchy beats!)<br /><br />Right, now I'm feeling a lot calmer. Sorry about this huge review, but I had to say something. I just hope potential fans don't get put off by all the stupid reviews here ... like I said before, if you're a fan who doesn't like this direction, fair enough.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Being a fan for as long as I can remember, Mariah's new album is superb and marks the 'Return of the Voice'. <br /> <br />This album is full of hits that is coming our way. When I first bought this CD, I wonder how's it's gonna be, but after first listening, I was like .... wow !  <br /> <br />My personal favourites are Mine Again, this song reminds me of Fantasy/Butterfly album, very retro and has the R&B feel. I just couldnt play enough of this song.  <br /> <br />There are ballads where you will listen over and over, like I Wish I Knew, Circles and We Belong Together. I am just so happy, she is really BACK and emancipating herself from any oppression.  <br /> <br />Not forgetting her fast tempo/hiphop/rap and her collaboration with JD, Nelly and Snoop D. Say Something has that catchy tune, makes you wanna say somthing as well :)  <br /> <br />This album is so complete as if a greatest hit album. I believe this album is a metamorphosis since butterfly album, picking up slowly and everchanging to an upper level.  <br /> <br />Truly, she has something for her lambs! but then again, she is gaining more strength this time, to reach out for new fans!   <br /> <br />So when Mimi's back, you may say 'what the hack?' <br />Be it Circles or It's Like That,  <br />She will make her presence as a matter-of-fact! <br /> <br />Go, grab this CD now, you will not regret it!    <br /> <br />     <br /> <br />
B00004Y5A8|5.0|a grand album for any bowie devotees . It simply highlights the musical flair that. Bowie always possessed. The live recordings makes this set  a  gem, all tracks very unique and original. Possibly my favorite Bowie album, simply because of its rarity. You wont here bowie like this on any other  cd.
B00006G8G1|2.0|This is a great band and a great show.  The set list is perfect. The sound is great.  Awesome picture quality.  But why on earth are there so many cuts?  The picture changes way too many times.  This is how a film school student would put it together.  With that many cuts per minute, how the hell are you supposed to enjoy the show?  Are they trying to hide something?  Did the band lack energy?  I love the band, but I think it was a mistake for Steve Harris to cut this himself.  I never criticise unless I can do better myself...  and I have (see Manowar's Hell on Earth's Part 2, 3 and 4).  Just because you have 18 cameras, doen't mean you have to use them all within the space of a minute.  It's not modern and it's not cool.  It is embarrassing. Live After Death is still a great production.  Why go backwards! Live DVDs, like a good wine, should be allowed to breathe a little.  I look forward to the next Maiden DVD.  Hopefully things would have settled down a little and we can all enjoy the show!
B0000A36J5|5.0|To all the reviewers who complain that the film versions of TLOTR are not as good as the book: HOW COULD THEY BE?  The movies are TLOTR based upon Tolkien's masterpiece.  Please note the words \\"based upon\\" and write your reviews accordingly.  No, the films are not(and could not have been)as good as the book.  As motion pictures, however, they are crowning achievements, as near to perfection as we are ever likely to get.  Future generations will see them as such.
B00008OLIC|5.0|As far as songs go, this is not the best Motley Crue album (that would be \\"Too Fast For Love\\"). But in regards to everything else, this is their masterpiece. Much credit goes to Bob Rock, the producer who is famous for coaxing metal bands into the mainstream. He does a fantastic job here, bringing out the true Motley sound; even the weaker tracks sound impossibly vital. But production alone does not a masterpiece make. \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" marks the moment when Nikki Sixx finally captured his muse and got everything right. These songs may not have the scruffy charm of the Crue's early work, but all of their best pop songs are here, from the title track, with its chugging groove that finally established Motley Crue as a band that understands the power of the low end, to \\"Don't Go Away Mad (Just Go Away),\\" which is the most perfect song these dirty boys ever penned. Captured here is the essence of Motley, but more important is the way that it is captured; this is when Vince Neil & Co. announced they were ready for primetime, and \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" appropriately became their biggest selling record. To make a really weird comparison, this album is the equivalent of the Cure making \\"Disintegration\\": everything somehow lined up perfectly and the result was one for the history books. \\"Dr. Feelgood\\" is a document of everything great about Motley Crue, and it doesn't matter that all the records that followed basically sucked. This album cements their place in history as masters of a certain kind of rock'n'roll. No one has done it better since.
B00005JLTN|1.0|Unbeleivable disappointment, where did the story go? what about the plot, why does everyone wear sunglasses 24/7? the dialog in Matrix was flawless and not one wasted line, this one is nothing but one liners that a second grader could have strung together, Link? what was that about? commander and niobi? well script writing 101 says you have got to have conflict, something for everyone sure took all the flavor out of this sequel, where is James Cameron when you need him, this sequel was dead when it started out the movie by showing the ending as the hook. <br /> <br />two thumbs down. <br /> <br />but the sunglasses are great looking, i want a pair that can survive getting punched in the face repeatedly.

037575251X|5.0|These three stories are amongst London's best fictional works- some say they *are* the best, especially, \\"The Call of the Wild\\" and \\"White Fang\\", it all depends on one's taste, of course, but rest assured, these stories are gripping and the intrigue of their moving plots keeps one glued to the book.<br /><br />As a freind once said of \\"Call...\\" and \\"...Fang\\": \\"These are just about the two doggone best [canine] stories I have ever had the pleasure to read!\\". Indeed.<br /><br />All three stories are set in Alaska during the gold rush days of the late 1800's and London spent time there to absorb the feeling of this beautiful, but unforgiving land. He is so descriptive of the landscape, one feels like they are there themselves. This is the magic of London's writing- he so expertly drops the reader right into the scenery and the characters. Indeed, we see and feel what they see and feel- even the animals- especially, the animals, for they have personalities that engage and create both sympathy and admiration  for their trials, tribulations and triumphs. London is one of those that the measure of literary genius is judged by and taking in just about any of his works will demonstrate why.<br /><br />The basic storyline of the \\"The Call of the Wild\\" has a dog named \\"Buck\\" who is living in a comfortable setting in California, suddenly yanked away by black-market dog thieves who are selling them to the ravenous needs of the gold prospector's supply market where they are then pressed into the tortuous dogsled industry. Buck eventually gets free and joins his native soul-brothers, the wolves. From the human world back to his ancestral roots, hence, the calling of the wild instinct.<br /><br />\\"White Fang\\" is the antithesis of  Buck`s situation: a wolf pup raised partly by Indians, wolves, and eventually being absorbed all the way into the human world... you guessed it, in California where he settles into the same basic comfortable world that Buck was torn from. The tale of how that turn-of-events happens is as engaging as Buck's story.<br /><br />\\"To Build A Fire\\" is a very short read and describes a man and the unforgiving, harsh winter of the Alaskan outback. He finds himself trapped by an intense snow storm and soon realizes that this normally easy trek is turning dangerous. What will happen? London skillfully gives us the psychological drama of harsh realities setting in.<br /><br />For those that have not yet taken in any of London's work, this book is a good place to start. One might then want to take in more, including London's non-fictional work.as engaging as Buck's story.    \\"To Build A Fire\\" is a very short read and describes a man and the unforgiving, harsh winter of the Alaskan outback.

6301562143|4.0|Actually, 4 1/2 stars would be more accurate. For those of you who follow my reviews, you know that I like most things that have to do with Batman. As a child, I really liked the Adam West episodes. Sadly, Adam West's wonderful series was cancelled after only 3 seasons. Well, 20 years later, Tim Burton would ressurect Batman. Obvioulsy, it wasn't the 60s anymore. It was the 80s. And Tim Burton did a really great job of bringing back some of the original foundation, but at the same time bringing enough of his own dark and gothic signatures into the picture to allow Batman to transcend into the 80s. Well, all of that said, Michael Keaton did a great job of respecting Adam West's patterns, but at the same time not copying him. Keaton does in fact capture the essence of the loose and easy going Bruce Wayne and the dark, serious, and very sad Batman. Gough is excellent as the ever loyal Alfred. While Gough does remain faithful to the role, he does add a side of Alfred where he says things now and then that Bruce Wayne//Batman may not want to hear. Jack Nicholson did a very good job of taking the baton from Cesar Romero and bringing the Joker into the 80s. And I certainly did not mind the new element that the Joker was a loyal second in command to a crime boss, who was double crossed, but somehow came out of it alive and flipped the tables. Nicholson also made sure we realized that while the elements of psychosis were brewing before the double cross, they did not come into play until AFTER the double cross. Bassinger is fine as the lady in Bruce Wayne // Batman's life who carries some intelligence, purpose, and dignity. Alexander Knox is fine as the character who in doing his job crosses the path of Bruce Wayne // Batman. Finally, the scenery, musical tracks, suspense, and acting are all top notch. My only real complaint (and why I am deducting a half star) is that the final fight between Batman and Joker lacks a climactic edge. (I would like to say look at the fight between Patrick Swayzee and Jimmy in \\"RoadHouse\\"), but I'll keep it closer to home. Look at the confrontation in the episode \\"Joker Is Wild.\\" Cesar Romero's Joker made his own utility belt, and there was a brutal nearly even fight between him and Batman in the end. In an animated episode, Kevin Conroy's Batman, and Mark Hamil's Joker had a brutal fight on a roller coaster, and after some wrestling,the Joker had Batman pinned down. Batman got in a lucky kick, and the Joker fell screaming. But that said, we must thank Tim Burton not only for bringing the character of Batman back from the 60s, but paving the way for the excellent animated series that were to follow. If you like this movie, be sure to see Part 2 \\"Batman Returns.\\"een Patrick Swayzee and Jimmy in \\"RoadHouse\\"), but I'll keep it closer to home.

B000003C4K|4.0|\\"It Ain't About No Goldfish......It Ain't About No Starkist Tuna Fish.......And It Ain't About No Trout!!!!  This Song Is Called Piranha!!!!!\\"  That's the intro Exodus vocalist Paul Baloff & guitarist Gary Holt came up with when they performed \\"Piranha\\" live, one of the many classic songs Exodus' 1985 debut album.  Holt & co-guitarist Rick Hunolt churn out so many amazing riffs on BONDED BY BLOOD it's almost unbelievable.  When I was taking guitar lessons back in the '80s, one of the songs I HAD to learn was \\"Bonded By Blood\\".  Songs like \\"Exodus\\", \\"No Love\\", \\"Strike Of The Beast\\", & the aforementioned \\"Piranha\\" are a guitar player's wet dream.  Gary Holt in particular plays some amazing solos.  Tom Hunting does a phenomenal job on the drums.  Exodus' bass play, Rob McKillop, is totally lost in the mix.  It doesn't really matter though, because Holt, Hunolt, & Hunting more than make for the absence of a bass guitar sound on the album.    I'm giving BONDED BY BLOOD four stars because there a few minor problems.  Paul Baloff's vocals can be irritating.  He had a screechy-screamy style on BONDED BY BLOOD.  It does come across like fingernails on a chalkboard at times, especially on the song \\"Deliver Us To Evil\\".  He was aware of the problems with his voice.  I remember listening to an interview that a heavy metal radio show did with Baloff in the summer of 1986.  He said he was taking singing lessons.  Unfortunately, Baloff was out of the band by the fall of '86.  The singing lessons paid off though.  Baloff reunited with the band in the late '90s, & they put out a live album called ANOTHER LESSON IN VIOLENCE.  Baloff sounded so much better.  Sadly, he died a few years ago of a stroke.  He was a character.    The other problem is the lyrics.  In 1985, it seemed like every thrash band was doing the whole death/kill/hell/satan thing.  Exodus fell into this as well.  Here's a sample from the song \\"Exodus\\": \\"Bloody corpse makes me feel great/Painkiller in my life/Cut theirflesh to the bone/Use a rusty knife\\".  Yeesh.    Still, this is one of the best thrash albums ever made.  It's totally aggressive & full of attitude.  When I was a teenager, this is one of the albums I put on when I wanted to scare my parents.  Twenty years later, I still enjoy listening to it.  Music like this just isn't made anymore.    BONDED BY BLOOD & ANOTHER LESSON IN VIOLENCE are the only Exodus albums you should buy.  They replaced Baloff in '86 with Steve Souza, who had previously sang for Testament (then known as Legacy).  Souza sounds a bit too much like Bon Scott (AC/DC).  Exodus have never put out a studio album that matches the intensity of BONDED BY BLOOD.  In fact, they seemed to become the clowns of thrash metal with their subsequent albums.  If you doubt what I'm saying here, just look at the album covers for PLEASURES OF THE FLESH, FABULOUS DISASTER, & IMPACT IS IMMINENT.    BONDED BY BLOOD is Exodus at their best.

B000063DHK|2.0|I know what you're thinking: Everyone else gave LIVE AFTER DEATH four or five stars this guy is only giving it two.  So what do I know that everyone else seemingly doesn't?  For starters, I can tell you that the drumming & the drum sound on this album are both weak.  In 1982, Maiden had a drummer named Clive Burr.  He played on the band's first three albums & was an absolute powerhouse.  The band was fierce sounding with him behind the drum kit.  However, he left the band for personal reasons in late '82, & was replaced by Nicko McBrain.  Nicko sounds fine on Maiden's studio albums, but he was much weaker sounding in live situations, & the band lost a step on stage as a result.  1985's LIVE AFTER DEATH documents this step backwards.  The 1982 in-concert version of Iron Maiden & the '85 version almost sound like two different bands.  Some of the fire had gone out of the band's sound.  When Maiden plays their older material, it has a going-through-the-motions type of feel to it (i.e. \\"22 Acacia Avenue\\", \\"Children Of The Damned\\", \\"Run To The Hills\\", etc).  The band sounds like they're rushing to get through the melodic verse sections of \\"Revelations.\\"    Another problem is Adrian Smith's guitar sound.  When he is about to take a solo on a few of the songs here, his sound system makes this awful hissing sound when he switches from rhythm to lead (& then back again).  Co-guitarist Dave Murray has no such switching issues.  Smith also is not an aggressive rhythm player.  He tends to play rests when he should be strumming.    Vocalist Bruce Dickinson over-sings at times.  I understand that he's trying to be heard over the rest of the band, but he has a tendency to take it too far.  There's also too much vibrato in his voice.  \\"Revelations\\" & \\"Flight Of Icarus\\" are prime examples.    There are some good tracks here.  \\"Powerslave\\", \\"The Number Of The Beast\\", \\"Wrathchild\\", & \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" are the albums highlights.  Dave Murray has a good guitar sound & he plays some very good solos.  Steve Harris' bass guitar comes through pretty clearly in the mix.     If you want to hear Maiden at the peak of the powers as a live band (& you're willing to spend the money), check out the EDDIE'S ARCHIVE box set.  It contains a double CD recording of the band's 1982 show at the Hammersmith Odeon in London, England.  Or you should check out the PART 1: THE EARLY YEARS DVD.  Clive Burr plays drums on both, & the band sounds like they're on fire.  LIVE AFTER DEATH sounds like someone put the fire out.
0385512058|4.0|For someone who is a poor networker (lets just say introvert) like myself, this was a very interesting book.  It showed me a different way of looking at relationships.  I think that for people who are not naturally extroverted, and network-savvy, this is a good book. <br /> <br />It doesn't really tell you any \\"secrets,\\" like \\"to get Larry David to come to your kid's birthday party, do ____.\\"  But he does clearly lay out some not-so-unknown-but-still-needs-to-be-said things like \\"don't be a wallflower at an industry conference\\" - network, and get to know people as people - not just as the guy who can fix your printer.  That guy certainly has other interests than printers.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Sinatra at the Sands...it's a must have for even the most casual Sinatra fan.  It's one of Frank's best albums and like a classic film or novel that will never fall out if fashion.  Recorded in 1965, when Sinatra was fifty years old; the set showcase's a confidant Sinatra.  Drop in this CD and grab your favorite beverage, relax and prepare to be transported to a time long gone.  By the end of the album you'll wish you had actually been at the Sands to see the show live.
0385486804|5.0|This book tells the story of a young man who turns his back on the materialistic society we live in and literally walks away from it. It is a great book, one of my all time favorites. It is far more than the story of someone going to Alaska as it is sometimes represented. Buy it and see for yourself.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I saw half of this movie back in 93' and I was mad/sad that I couldn't watch the rest of the movie (I had to go home) but I knew that I loved the movie cause while I was at home I was repeating everything I heard in the movie.  I also did the accent (sorry my chicano cousins) and my white friends that saw the movie with me got a kick out of it.  I found myself wanting to watch all of the movie but I couldn't find it at any rental stores and I couldn't find it in any which made me very mad.  Three years later I finally found the movie on VHS and I had to buy it. <br /> <br />I saw the movie and I wasn't disappointed.  I love how they had three storylines all in one movie.  The prison scenes were the best parts and you would think that if it's really like that then people would do anything to keep themselves off that path.  The only thing I think they should've done was focus in on the Miklo, Paco, and Cruz's family.  You know show what the family had to deal with when faced with their actions.  All in all it was still a good movie and I recommend it to anyone who is into good movies. <br /> <br />I think I'm gonna watch it again :D  Vatos Locos forever! <br /> <br />VL
B0002OERI0|1.0|I wish I hadn't wasted my money and time on this.  Why did Green Day have to sell themselves out?  I mean, I'm still a fan of all their past albums, but this is by far the worst ablum I've heard in years (well, second to anything by 50 Cent). <br /> <br />This would have been great if: 1. they didn't go with a mainstream alternative/rock sound.  2. it wasn't heavily laden with politics.  See, I want to listen to music, not hear somebody's political viewpoint. <br /> <br />And, please, everybody stop calling Green Day punk.  They are not punk.  Take it from a fan of the band, they are not punk.  They are alt/rock/pop.  \\"They're punk because they rebel against the system\\".  That would actually make them hippies.  Punks rebel against society and they don't care what people think of them.  Green Day does care and they're not rebelling against the system.  They're not punk. <br /> <br />Anyways, if this is the direction this band is going, I'm just going to have to turn my back on them.
B0002S947K|5.0|This can't happen.  This isn't true.  It's not possible.  A guy wakes up one day to his alarm clock playing a Crosby, Stills, and Nash song and it is so powerful that he knows what he is meant to do and that is to become a singer songwriter and make a fantastic debut album.  That's exactly what Ray LaMontagne has done here.  He taught himself to play guitar and to sing \\"from the gut.\\"  Having a tough upbringing is perhaps good fuel for writing great songs but being able to actually write and sing those songs like Ray has done is just unbelievable to me.  When I first heard him I thought he was black because he sings with such soul.  He's a white guy who really does sing from the gut.  He sings from deep down in the essence of his troubled soul.  This album has some redeeming qualities.  It isn't all about \\"trouble.\\"  Ray's answer to life's inevitable problems is through love.  Their is some melancholy here but it is balanced by a romanticism as in the line \\"I would walk miles through broken glass just to fall at your feet.\\"  All the songs are great but a few of my favorites are: \\"trouble,\\" \\"forever my friend,\\" \\"hannah,\\" \\"how come,\\" and \\"jolene.\\"  I am thoroughly impressed by this debut and I look forward to hearing more from this soulful singer.  This isn't a very good review because any attempt to describe how great this album is will fall short.
0316779237|5.0|...this book already has a lot of reviews, but I wanted to say that whenever the author says \\"what I wanted to say\\" or \\"what I should have said to them,\\" you're about to laugh really hard.    On the other hand, the first story is th best with the others (while funny, if dark) don't quite measure up to expectations.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|There are certainly some very fine aspects to the film Phantom of the Opera, now out in DVD. But there are also some fairly obvious flaws. <br /> <br />On the positive side, Joel Schumacher was very wise to make both the Phantom and the Count, Raoul, handsome men with very different appeal and to balance these men's attributes so as to create a real tension in the mind of Emma Rossum as well as the viewer. The viewer is put in the position of asking \\"which would I chose\\" throughout the action.  <br /> <br />Gerard Butler is excellent as the darkly handsome smoldering long hidden secret lover whereas Patrick Wilson plays the more stereotypical heroic leading man, full of priviledge but capable of heroic action. Patrick Wilson's role here is archtypal, he makes all the moves of the hero. If you want to see Patrick Wilson display his considerable acting skills however, watch him in \\"Angels in America\\".  <br /> <br />The music is beautiful and permeates the entire film so that after you leave the theater you can't remember a time in the film that the action was not floating upon and propelled by the musical score. <br /> <br />The supporting cast was superb. Minnie Drive as the opera diva, Carlotta, played her role over the top, which was perfect for this entire over-produced production. <br /> <br />Now, after identifing three stengthens of the video, I want to point out two weaknesses. <br /> <br />First, this operatic product does not really translate well as it moves from stage to film.  Wheras the sets may seem appropriate from the seats of an opera house, on film they seem corney and hoaky. Do we really think that white horses, caves, and boats on a river would all really exist underground under the opera house? <br /> <br />Second, Emma Rossum, a beautiful angelic woman who emits vulnerability with every blink of her long eyelashes, has a voice that does not convey operatic strength. Such a weak timid voice could never carry the lead in an opera. For the intimateduets with the Phantom or with Raoul, it works, but on the stage she misses the mark. <br /> <br />Thus Phantom of the Opera is a mixed treat for the viewer.
0670033375|5.0|This is an important book. Whilst the literary standard of the work is variable, the subject matter is never less than interesting. Other writers have covered similar ground previously, but by popularising the subject, hopefully many thousands of people will begin to understand the serious environmental issues facing us, which concerned environmentalists having been trying to tell us about for many long years. Rather than rewrite a review here, I have written a full resum and review, including relevant URLs, of \\"Collapse\\" on my internet site, the address of  which I am not allowed to publish here (your might find me on Google), but my short review is this: <br /> <br />Did I enjoy the book? Yes. Very much yes. <br />Was the book moving? It was at turns enlightening, moving, concerning, frightening. <br />Was it well written? Yes, but some editing would have been helpful. <br />Is the book important? It is difficult to think of anything more important than the subject of this book. <br />Should you read the book? Yes, unless you are one of those right-wing bigots who's \\"reviews\\" are published in the Amazon book pages, \\"reviewers\\" who are basically just slagging off at Jared Diamond. <br />Do you need to buy the book having read such a detailed synopsis?! Yes. Support an excellent writer and a concerned environmentalist. <br /> <br />Whilst the organisation and writing of the book rate about four stars, I have given it five stars to acknowledge the importance of the content.
B00005QK5X|3.0|of course that's the rub for many good local bands. the wipers were (are?) a very good local band but i had never heard of them before amazon .the reason for that is there are no great songs on this box set. they play great, sound great but nothing is memorable (except maybe the overall guitar driven sound). comparisons to the velvet underground, love or big star are absurd because all those bands had many all time great  songs. and that's the main difference between all time greats and very good local bands. great songs. it's what's lacking on this box set. 3 and 1/2 stars.

It's their only album where all the members of the wu are present, and it has that originality that their later albums lack.  each mc in the group is a sick rapper, my personal favorite is the rza and ghostface killa.  some tracks you should check out to convince you that this album is hot: C.R.E.A.M., Bring Da Ruckus, Can It All Be So Simple, and Protect Ya Neck. <br /> <br />word up.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Great movie. Starts in flashback and introduces you to the life of the opera house. Makes your heart bump. I really loved it. Emmy Rossum and Gerard Butler made an excellent job interpreting the Phantom and Christine. The music is great, and EVERYTHING is just really really gooooooooooooooddddd.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|What can I say?  A wonderful movie about love ... different kinds of love.  The good and the bad are shown in this movie, but in the end I  believe that love is actually all around us - we just have to look for it.

B000002UB6|5.0|By normal standards, this is a brilliant album. By Beatles standards, this is a weak album, simply because they had recorded so many outstanding albums before they did this one. Nevertheless, there are some outstanding songs here.<br /><br />My favorite song here is Long and winding road, a song apparently inspired by a road in the Mull of Kintyre. Paul McCartney originally offered the song to Tom Jones, who had previously covered some other Beatles songs, but Tom politely declined thinking the song was not likely to be a big hit. Tom regretted his decision after seeing the Beatles take it to number one in America. In Britain, the Beatles did not release their version as a single so it became a minor hit (and the only hit) for Ray Morgan, about whom I know nothing else.<br /><br />Get back and the title track were both huge Beatles hit on both sides of the Atlantic and, like Long and winding road, are well up to the standard expected of the Beatles. Of the other songs, I particularly like Across the universe (the only other track here to make it on to the Blue album 1967 to 1970), One after 909 (which I didn't really appreciate until I heard Willie Nelson's cover - and I still prefer that to the original), Two of us (the opening track) and the traditional Maggie Mae. The other songs are fine but not as brilliant as we'd come to expect from the Beatles.<br /><br />If, by some fluke, this is the first Beatles album you hear, you'll be wondering how anybody could criticize it. If, on the other hand, you've heard some of their other albums, this one may come as a huge disappointment. The reality is that it's definitely worth a listen (indeed, several listens), but if you haven't got the other Beatles albums buy them first.

076790382X|5.0|I tend to like all of Bryson's books, some better than others.  But this one seriously made me laugh out loud. <br /> <br />Yes, Bryson's humor tends to be on the predictable side...  but his turn of phrase is amazing.  It's not so much the situations, but it's the way he writes about them, and his choice of words, that keep me coming back. <br /> <br />This book is a collection of columns, which makes it easy to read when you anticipate lots of interruptions.  I think the longest chunk is four pages.  Almost anyone has time for a four page chunk. <br /> <br />I can go back and reread this frequently for a good laugh...  if you like sarcastic humor, this is a book for you.

0393316041|4.0|Feynman was a brilliant scientist, and he has made fundamental contribution to the field of quantum mechanics. But, this book is NOT about any of his scientific discoveries. It is about his character, his nature and his wit. This book is like a collection of humorous anecdotes from various points in his life - like breaking locks at Los Alamos, being the youngest Mr.Fixit for radios, his adventures at topless bars, his personal eccentricities, his emotions about his early demise of his wife - to name a few.  <br /> <br />      Feynman is a good storyteller, though I do not agree with all his views, esp, that he has scant respect for fields not connected with physics or mathematics. I am a computer scientist myself and I feel that Feynman's disrespect for other fields of study, esp those related to humanities will not make this book a suitable reading for a person deciding to make a career choice. He provides an unbalanced and in my opinion, an unfair review of other fields of study. <br /> <br />     If you are a scientist and are looking to have a hearty laugh or two, you'll finish this book in one sitting. <br /> <br />
B0000640VM|5.0|I saw this film when I was 15 years old. I love this film very much.

The characters in this movie are lovely, especially Oliver and his little master, Jenny! And Rita is a beatiful female. If you're a Disney fan, this film is worth viewing to you!

B00004XONN|4.0|At the time Kid A was made, Radiohead (or perhaps Thom Yorke specifically) felt like their music had been blown way out of proportion and that the media overload they were feeling was too much to handle.  They responded by creating this album of minimalist electronica that was seemingly anti-Radiohead, but ended up being the most natural Radiohead record yet. <br /> <br />There are twinges of derivation on here, like most great albums - Aphex Twin, Kraftwerk, and even Sigur Ros inform this music as much as the Pixies did for The Bends and OK Computer.  Bu the end result is decidedly unique and one that only Radiohead could have really created.  Electric pianos, synthesized drumbeats, and sampling sequencers wrap \\"Everything in It's Right Place\\" in a digitized haze, but at the core of the song is a beautiful chord progression and melody, just like the sonically weird yet viscerally gorgeous Radiohead of the past.  The general theme right off the bat with this record is one of confusion and alienation - of waking up suddenly from a long sleep, wondering what exactly is going on.   <br /> <br />It becomes clear throughout Kid A that Radiohead did things often for no reason other than they felt good to do.  The controlled chaos of hook horns that eventually consumes \\"The National Anthem\\" was done partly to make a statement, but it was also done partly because Thom Yorke enjoyed dancing uncontrollably to it.  Similarly, the straight-up dance beat of \\"Idioteque\\" works not because it was crafted for a club's dance floor, but because it was what Radiohead wanted to do.  All this sonic experimentation would be a bit pretentious if there weren't real musicians creating it; but the attention to detail and artistic integrity that Radiohead put into these songs makes one wonder if they could make a polka song and keep the crushing emotional impact of their other work.  Judging by the leap they took on Kid A, the answer is probably \\"yes\\". <br /> <br />There are a few \\"traditional\\" songs on Kid A as well; simple guitar- and piano-driven tunes such as \\"How to Disappear Completely\\" and \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack\\" keep the electronica premise from appearing as shtick.  Even these songs, however, feel entirely different from past anthems such as \\"Karma Police\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\"; there is a sense of alienation, of searching, of trying to find one's way in a suddenly desolate world.  No doubt these themes are autobiographical; it's rare to find an artist whose work isn't to some degree.  But for all their \\"self-indulgent\\" pandering, Radiohead are quite good at pulling the listener into their world and showing them around. <br /> <br />Kid A has its flaws.  But flaws are often a way of showing that even the loftiest of us still have a heartbeat.  Radiohead, for all their talk of paranoid androids, are clearly paranoid themselves; but they are paranoid humanoids, and their hearts beat strongly on this record in a melancholy, yet beautiful, way.

Only a novel could incorporate a twentieth century history of the Ukraine under Stalin, an evocation of immigrant cultural archetypes, a documentary on aging in the industrial west and tell it in Jane Austen-like prose that resonates with the humor of a Woody Allen movie.

B0007O38XU|4.0|Spaceballs The Review <br /> <br />I love Spaceballs, It is one of my all time favourite comedy's. Mel Brooks puts together one of his finest achievements in this spoof on Star Wars, Star Trek, Space Odyssey, Buck Rogers, Planet of the Apes and the Wizard of Oz, just to name a few. And with a terrific cast of Bill Pullman as Lone Starr, the captain of Eagle 5 (which is a Winnebago with plane wings) and his pal Barf (No, not that. That's his name) played by John Candy. He is a Mawg, that's someone who is half man and half dog; he's his own best friend. Anyway, they're flying around in space and get a call from some space mobsters who tell them they owe Pizza The Hut a large amount of money. One million space bucks.... By tomorrow!! <br /> <br />But luckily Princess Vesper (Daphne something) and her droid Dot Matrix (voiced by Joan Rivers) decides she does not want to marry Prince Valium. So she takes off in her Space Mercedes into space. But soon she is under attack by the evildoers of the universe, The Spaceballs. Led by President Skroob (Mel Brooks) and Dark Helmet (Rick Moranis) and his side kick Kernel Sandurz (George Wyner ) they soon catch up with Vesper and attempt to kidnap her. She calls her father, King Roland (D. Van Patten) to help. And the King calls Lone Starr and Barf to help rescue his daughter. Then the journey begins to get vesper home. Will Lone Starr get her home in one peace? Will Spaceball city ever have fresh air? Will the elevators at Spacemart ever work in both directions? Can you find Waldo? To the answer to at least one of these questions, you will have to see, Spaceballs the movie.     <br /> <br />The new collectors edition I have to say I am a bit disappointed with. On disc 1 it has a really cool menu set up, parodying the star wars menus. For the first time ever I think, I actually watched the menu screens for about 10 minutes before doing anything else. It is really cool and funny. There is an audio commentary and an option to watch the film in ludicrous speed. There is also 2 eggs on there, not really worth looking at, but if you go to the sound options, just under the 5.1 in a bunch of languages, you'll see the last two have the word Mawg and Dink in them, click those to view them! <br /> <br />On disc 2 you'll find a surprisingly low budget and cheap menu compared to disc 1. No thought has been put into 3 pictures: One of the Winnebago, One of Spaceball one, and, one of Vespers Merc. You choose which craft display menu you wanna use, if you click the Winnebago, you sit in the pit of Eagle 5 and choose the option from there.... same with Vespers, and in space ball 1, you do it from Mr. Radar.  <br />From inside you can access the newly made Spaceballs the documentary. It runs for about 30 minutes and has most of the cast talk about their memories of Spaceballs.  There's a long interview with Mel and the other guy who wrote it, discussing how it all came about, And a tribute to the late John Candy (R.I.P). <br /> <br />Also, there is quotes, which you click on who you want, then choose there quote (I dunno why) and there is also a 25 question long trivia game, which was very easy, but at the end the results are not worth it. I thought it should have shown a clip or something. There is a bunch of photos and the storyboard comparison thing that no one ever watches.  <br /> <br />The 3 things that disappointed me where.  <br />1. I have the first DVD they brought out of spaceballs, and it had a behind the scenes extra on it. That extra is not anywhere on either of these two discs! <br />2. There are no deleted scenes. <br />3. There are no out-takes or bloopers. <br /> <br />So, I leave you with this final remark about this movie, that is one of the all-time greatest comedy's..... dink-dink, dink dink dink, dink-dink-dink dink dink. dink. dink! dink dink? dink dink dink-dink!!!

B00008CMR6|3.0|Confederate soldiers are helping to fund their losing cause at the end of the Civil War by stealing gold shipments from the railroad. Colonel McNally (John Wayne) is assigned to stop them. An ingenius robbery plot is executed by the French/Mexican confederate Captain, Jorge Rivera but is foiled at the last minute. And somewhere in the Union army two traitors remain at large...<br /><br />Years later, the circle is reformed when a helpless maiden, Shasta, (Jennifer O'Neill) rides into town at the same time as retired Colonel McNally. She is looking to bring to justice  the very cads that McNally is still searching for. Add the rebel Captain and seargent and the team is nearly complete as justice swings out to seek its final judgement on the villains.<br /><br />Who swaggers more convincingly or rides taller in the saddle than John Wayne? From beginning to end, the viewer is compelled to smile at the bravado, warmth, and fun of the film.<br /><br />Made 35 years ago, this is without doubt, the corniest of the John Wayne westerns. The Duke and Jack Elam turn in the best performances of the bunch. John Wayne is \\"comfortable\\" in every respect!
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Recorded in 2003 and 2004, this CD serves as an interesting piece of history, but isn't always good listening; Ray Charles by this time was nearing his mid seventies, and though one could say he was past his prime as a recording artist, the real problem in this album lies in who he is singing with; time has been merciless with some of the others paired with Ray (even though many are not that old, but the years have not been kind to their voices).<br /><br />\\"It Was a very Good Year\\" with Willie Nelson is sad in a way that goes beyond the melancholy of the song. Willie, just three years younger than Ray, sounds very tired, and this is followed by \\"Hey Girl\\" with Michael McDonald, with equally depressing results.<br /><br />\\"Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word\\" is my favorite Elton John song, but this rendition is a huge disappointment, as Elton's hectic life has frazzled his voice.<br /><br />Ray seems to reflect the energy of his duet partner, and the better and stronger the singer he is teamed with, the better Ray's performance is.<br /><br />The highlights: Ray sounds great with Norah Jones in \\"Here We Go Again\\", and this track includes some terrific Hammond B3 work by Billy Preston.<br /><br />\\"Fever\\" is also marvelous with an electric, brilliant Natalie Cole, as is the Gladys Knight duet with \\"Heaven Help Us All\\", and B.B. King is miraculous (and is the oldest boy on this CD !) in the bluesy and stupendous \\"Sinner's Prayer\\".<br /><br />Johnny Mathis sounds wonderful, but the slower than molasses rendition of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" was not the best song selection.<br /><br />The arrangements and musicianship are top notch, and most of the production is either by Phil Ramone or Phil Burke.<br /><br />I feel this would have been a fabulous recording from start to finish if the singing partners had been chosen with more care, to uplift Ray rather than drag him down, and a better choice of material, with the accent on the upbeat. Nevertheless, for fans of Ray Charles, this is a piece of history from his later years, and his spark of genius can still be found among the tracks.<br /><br />The sound is excellent and total playing time is 51'40.of history from his later years, and his spark of genius can still be found among the tracks. <br />The sound is excellent and total playing time is 51'40. <br />

B00030590I|3.0|I cannot help but compare this movie to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. Please do not get led on by the television ads saying \\"Every bit as good as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.\\" It is not even close. I found it difficult to like any of the characters in the movie, including Jet Li's role (Broken Sword was O.K.). The plot was slow. As the Emperor and Jet Li went back and forth, comming up with theories, I found glancing at my watch every five minutes. I don't think movies should do that to the veiwer. For all of its shortcommings, Hero made up for them to a point with its breathtaking visuals. Especially the fight between Jet and Broken Sword on the lake. Over all, it was an alright movie, but not one that I would bother to see again.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Love Buffy, love Angel, even love Fray, but Firefly is my favorite of all Joss's efforts. The man is a genius. Firefly has a great set of characters that have regular, everyday problems. Even if they live on a spaceship. I love the show's concept, and the relationships between characters just got better and better. Until the show got canceled by some idiot network execs.  <br /> <br />Luckily, the movie is coming out.  It's amazing that television networks are so far removed from what people actually want. The junk that's on TV now can't hold a candle to Firefly. <br /> <br />You can't take the skies from me.
076790382X|3.0|About two years ago when my husband and I made up our minds to study abroad in the U.S., one of my friends, who have lived in Boston for many years recommended Bill Bryson's  I am a Stranger Here Myself to me.  She told me this book reflects American life and will help me learn American ways of living.  I kept her words in mind, but didn't read this book until it was chosen as our assigned material in a reading class in the U.S.  After reading through this book, I realized why my friend suggested me read it.  This book is really a great comfort to foreigners, because what Bill Bryson told the readers mostly resonates with what we've encountered in our daily lives in the U.S. <br /> <br />     As foreigners, we usually assume that lack of proficiency in the language is the cause of ineffective communication and it puts us in a very awkward situation.  However, in the chapter, \\"What's Cooking,\\" we know that though a native speaker, Bryson is also bewildered by the complicated terminology the server uses to introduce the special dishes in a fancy restaurant.  And in \\"How to Rent a Car,\\" Bryson has a difficult time figuring out the complexly tiered options in the contract just as I did when I rented a car in the U.S. for the first time.  Sometime it makes foreigners feel secure and relieved when realizing that a native speaker is in the same boat.    <br /> <br />     I am so glad that I got the chance to read this book.  Not only did I understand more about American customs and culture, but I also benefited greatly from the author's funny expression and vivid description in English.  For foreigners, making ourselves acquainted with American ways of thinking and speaking is crucial to dealing with daily events in a foreign country.  In my opinion, Bill Bryson plays the role of a spokesperson for Americans as well as foreigners.  In his sarcastic but intriguing tone, Bryson candidly points out some ridiculous phenomena in American society.  Some may regard him as agrumpy man complaining a lot in his book, but I was fascinated by his unique humor.  I sincerely suggest anyone who would like to travel to the U.S. read this book beforehand.  This book is of great help to getting a broad outline of the life style in America. <br />

B0000DIXN7|5.0|The word that best describes Amy Winehouse is cool.  When you read an interview, see her website and things like that, the first thing that comes to mind is that she just seems really cool.  And her cd follows suit.  It is very creative and mixes so many genres so well that it is a disservice to try and classify her music.  The one song that really signifies this is \\"In My Bed\\" which starts off with a piece of a Nas song, moves into a jazzy feel, the chorus is pop-ish, and then moves back into the jazz-oriented feel and then back to the Nas riff.  These transitions in the song are seamless.  This is just one example--her songs seem to indicate a lot of different influences. <br /> <br />Off the whole cd, my favorites are \\"In My Bed,\\" \\"Take the Box,\\" and her remake of \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" but I would recommend the whole cd to people.  You would just miss her vibe if you only listened to one or two songs.
B00005JKG7|5.0|There is a fog outside my window as i am typing this :)<br /><br />The Fog was a film i first viewed as a child, it absolutely terrified me, the idea of mist carrying something deadly is in itself a terrifying idea, then there is the fact that when our vision is curtailed we panic (eg as in sudden darkness).<br /><br />In this film an ancient curse catches up with the residents of a sleepy seaside town, long dead sailors arise as spectres inhabiting a creepy almost sentient fog which sweeps inland at a supernatural rate. As the fog moves in, one woman trapped in a lighthouse sounds out a warning, \\"stay away from the fog there is something in the fog\\". Carpenter is really good at building scary or paranoid atmosphere as he proved in 'The Thing' and 'They Live', the fog builds up an excellent atmosphere of dread throughout. Horrors must have atmosphere or they become silly creature features which more closely resemble dark comedies, The Fog has atmosphere and good acting performances in spades. The fog is a good horror, made in a mould which they have forgotten how to use nowadays.<br /><br />My advice is to go towards The Fog, get into The Fog.
B000001F3C|5.0|Although War never receives the critical acclaim and praise that Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby get, War is the U2 album that is most influenced by passion and emotions expressed through rock. After 1983, U2 moved on to more a of a pop/rock stage, while also expanding their horizons with power ballad classics. That being said, the essence of this album alone gives it the flavour to satisfy my tastes, as I have always had a deeper love for the languished, meaningful rock classics. This is the only U2 album I own, which may not qualify me for being a true fan of their music.<br /><br />To review some of the music that lies on this disc, we open with the booms and clashes of one Sunday Bloody Sunday. A song that changed my outlook on the world as a whole, most specifically through the lyrics. U2s raw interpretation and outcry on the lost innocence of the world is expressed heavily through melodic emotions. To follow, we get the track Seconds, primarily built around a love provoked meaning. New Year's Day is a favourite, mostly because of the melodic phases and backing lyrics. Nevertheless, it is superb songwriting. Moving on, we see U2 stay very consistent with the general theme of the album, Drowning Man is a great song, and Two Hearts Beat As One is probably the most rock oriented song on the album. Other great songs on this album include '40' and Refugee. The album runs very smoothly as well, and the musicality of the band is sensational.<br /><br />The most impressive component to this album is that a great number of rock listeners can enjoy it. U2 explored different styles of music in their later years, but for me this is the only album of theirs that I need to own. The cover art is well chosen and properly represents the expression that U2 delivered to the music audience. Highly recommended to any fan of U2, lovers of emotional and passionate rock, or someone looking to broaden their taste in music.
B000022TSV|5.0|Carmen is an excellent example of what an Opera can be when major talent is assembled.  The acting is as good as the voices; the music is excellently played and beautifully incorporated into the choreography and direction.<br /><br />It is the best Carmen I've seen - but here's the kicker:<br /><br />The direction in this movie is some of the best.  Reds are prolific and really bring home the heat - the red clay - the passion.  Don't miss the change in color when Carmen dies - it is subtle, but suddenly things are not so red.  The life drains from the palette as it drains from Carmen.<br /><br />Personal:  I was looking forward to seeing Domingo in this movie.  He is wonderful.  Carmen, however,  has always been a Maria Callas to me: black gypsy hair, mature, mysterious, sure of her power and faintly cruel in her use of it.  I was stunned to see Julia Migenes at her first entrance.  A freckled redheaded hoyden Carmen was my ideal by the end of that first scene.  What a difference the interpretation of Carmen makes to the entire story.
B0001CNRS4|1.0|Damn this movie sucked. Why? Lack of talent. Lack of a script. Lack of substance. Lack of intellect. Lack of having a point. Lack of creativity. Lack of acting. Lack of trying. And ultimately, at the end of the movie, it left me with a lack of giving; lack of giving a rat's ass about how it was going to end. At least Jessica Alba could have shown her knockas. Minus 3 stars for this slop.
B000068MKZ|5.0|I discovered Carla Bruni's all French album for over a year now and I still enjoy listening to it. I happened to have one of the tracks off of her album from a sampler I received from Naive called Tout Le Monde and it's so good! She has the most amazing voice!! Because that song is so good I had to get the entire album. It's so great to hear Carla's voice periodically in the background when you are having a stressful day. If you don't know anything about Carla Bruni she is the famous supermodel from Italy.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I consider myself a newcomer to the Enigma fold, but after browsing through their catalogue of albums, I found that \\"Screen Behind the Mirror\\" stands above the rest as Michael Cretu's most disciplined, theatrical and energetic effort to date. Few criticize Enigma for being too dramatic, but this is what truly sets it apart from the debatable genres it has been placed in. \\"Screen Behind the Mirror\\" carries the best of all worlds, and those who adore the previous albums will be right at home with this puppy if they still harbor doubt about it.    The first Enigma was inventive and provided a taste of things to come with its erotic beats and unique samples swooping in and out to ethnic chanting and simple words of wisdom, a technique that would be greatly improved upon in \\"Cross of Changes\\", but definitely shines in \\"Smell of Desire\\" and the title track of this album (minus the ethnic chanting).     The third Enigma was very subtle and meditative, and so was not an album to dance to, but \\"SBTM\\" possesses a raw energy that will have you swaying to the groove and stomping your feet, especially in the primal-like \\"Push the Limits\\" and vocal-heavy \\"Modern Crusaders\\". The rest in between are equally great and like I mentioned before, cement it as a truly underrated masterpiece, standing next to \\"Cross of Changes\\" as mandatory owning. If you're new to Enigma like I was, it would  be a smart move to start out with this, and then if you're good and satisfied with it, dive right in with the rest that Cretu has to offer.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Because Coppola's daughter wrote and directed it, critics loved it. Trust me on this, this is one bad movie. Bill Murray is not a serious actor.....yet somewhow was nominated for an Acedemy Award for this performance. There is nothing even remotely appealing about the movie. A teenager may laugh on occasion, but that's about it.
0393312836|2.0|Why?  That was the main question I seemed to be asking myself while reading Burgess' A Clockwork Orange.  I had the same problem watching Kubrick's movie version made back in 1971.  Why does young Alex act the way he does?  He has normal and loving parents; he is a mere 15 years of age.  His background just does not seem to mesh very well with how he is presented: a brutal, savage rapist and even killer.      The story opens relentlessly with Alex and his hoodlum friends kicking the snot out of an innocent civilian.  Next, they go to an innocent woman's house, rape and beat her to death.  (Also bloodying up her husband).  Finally, they break into another innocent woman's house, where everything goes wrong.  Alex cracks her over the head a bit too hard and ends up killing her.  He is immediately sent to prison.  The police don't treat him too kindly, but who would?    Alex, after spending a year in prison, gets sent (or rather volunteers) to be part of a new \\"experiment\\" in which violent criminals are cured of their inclination towards evil.  They are forced, against their will, to watch violent and unspeakable films.  Repeated viewings of these films lead the victim to a feeling of nausea and sickness.  Soon, they have no desire to commit violence.  I guess you can call it stripping away at human freedom and brainwashing.    After Alex gets let out of this institution, he attempts to go back home.  His parents reject him.  Distraught, he wanders to a place where a bunch of old people are gathered together.  Ironically, one of them is the same man Alex so ruthlessly beat up in the first part of the novel. He is recognized, and \\"attack of the senior citizens!\\"  They all attempt to beat him up and scream for his blood.  Give me a break.  Next, he discovers one of his childhood hoodlum friends is now a cop along with his former enemy.  They beat the tar out of him, of course, because nothing good can happen to Alex at this point.    Next, he wanders to the same exact house in which he brutally raped and killed a woman earlier in the book.  The man who answers the door does not recognize him though.  He helps him clean his wounds, feeds him, and is compassionate towards him.  He soon recognizes Alex, however, because of the unique slang language he used.  He ties that language to the same villain who attacked him years earlier.      After being shut up in a room, Alex can't take it anymore, and jumps out of an open window.  He doesn't die, however.  Soon after he is taken to a hospital where the doctors \\"correct\\" him and he becomes the same violent freak we have all learned to love from the beginning of the novel.  He is cured.  Hurray!! Society is outraged at how \\"unjustly\\" poor Alex was treated. Another bit of irony for you, the man of the wife Alex raped and killed gets sent away to an institution so he won't be anymore trouble to Alex.  Oh the corrupt government gets its just punishment gets its due for doing what they did to poor old, violent, raping, murdering, old lovable Alex.    Ugh.  Where do I start?  The most glaring thing that upset me about A Clockwork Orange is that because of the way it is written, we are supposed to sympathize with Alex.  How can you?  I also don't understand the question the novel asks us in an offhand matter, \\"Is it right to \\"reform\\" people by taking away their freedom to choose?\\"  No, not for normal people it's not.  Alex could have been sent to the electric chair for the things he did, in my opinion, so who really cares if they took away his freedom?  I think he was better off as a mindless twit than a sadistic rapist.  Did the people he raped and killed have a freedom of choice?    IF Burgess would have explained a bit more the society in which Alex lived, maybe my questions would have been more properly answered.  He does nothing to explain this ultra-violent society.  I can't even picture this \\"nightmarish future\\" because Burgess does nothing to describe it.  He also gives us no insight to why Alex acts the way he does.  I couldn't get that out of my mind.  I like the British ending a tiny bit better because it gives Alex a bit more human elements, opening the door for a possible future change.  Maybe he is somewhat human after all, maybe all that violence did cause some regret.  By this point, however, it is too late to really care.    The only thing I really liked about this novel was Burgess' creative use of slang and jargon.  He invents Alex's language.  I like the creativity involved in that process, but unfortunately it can't save this mess.  Too bad it couldn't have been used on a greater novel.    I know this book is herald and praised all over the world, but even Burgess himself can not figure out why, (he says this in his introduction).  Can I pity or sympathize with a character I know nothing about?   Alex is as cardboard as characters get, aside from the creative, confusing language he uses.  I know he likes Beethoven.  What else? Hmmmmm.    Also, can I picture a futuristic world that is not described?  I learn nothing of this \\"ultra violent society, aside from the random acts of violence Alex and his friends commit.  How can this be a fable of good and evil, when no good is shown?  Listen to the sequence of events in this novel, a beating-a rape-a murder-another prison beating--violent films--abandonment-another beating-a fantasized rape-a bit of redemption.     A Clockwork Orange is real hoax of a novel, it entices us to believe it is a thundering statement against forced mind control and restraints on human choice and freedom, but all it really does is rejoice in the viciousness of its \\"hero\\", Alex.      Grade: C- (Orignial version)  Grade: C (British version)
B0000844MV|5.0|<br />  I'm sure you've read a ton of reviews about how great this movie is, so I won't bore you with another one.  What I will say, in difference to what others have written, is that the English dubbing is fine.  No dubbing is ever superior to the original dialogue, but they do a pretty good job here overall.  Supposedly the original cast did their own voice work in English as well as German when making this film.  (Don't know if that's true.  As this was actually a German mini-series made for television.)  Anyway, if you don't know sub titles, you can certainly enjoy this great epic of a motion picture with the English dubbing.  After you finish it, and realize how amazing a film it is, you'll certainly come back and watch it again, and maybe then you'll see the original translation (Which differs greatly from the spoken one.) and enjoy the movie all over again. <br /> <br />One of the best movies ever about WWII.  If you like this, be sure to check out Stalingrad.
B000002JSN|5.0|this is to Fred Dursts Numba One Fann. Please tell me you're being sarcastic in your review. My IQ dropped 50 points from reading your review. this is a must for rock and led zeppelin fans. just great music.
1400043662|3.0|Murakami must have finished this book around the time he did a best selling Japanese translation of JD Salinger's most famous work--\\"Catcher in the Rye.\\" It shows. Like Salinger and Holden --and Murakami's own work,--this one too dances around the jagged wounds of history.<br /><br />Biographers, including JD's daughter, believe that Salinger visited Jewish relatives in Central Europe just prior to World War II and then during the war  was involved in at least one liberation of a death camp. Apparently he was not brought up \\"without a religion\\" as was Holden, but was indeed bar-mitvahed and did not find out that his mother Miriam nee Mary, was born Catholic until he was in his twenties. Keeping this in mind, \\"Catcher\\" is a major  work of avoidance. A traumatized Jew creating a lovely WASPiesence.<br /><br />The same case can be made with Kafka Tamura's sentimental dwelling on the sanctity of mommy and sister's vaginas. (No exaggeration here.) Indeed, Murakami is sentimental about the redemptive power of vaginas in many of his novels. In no way does Kafka Tamura-- or his redemptive vaginas --illuminate history; if one thinks of how Kafka predicts history in even his short one page stories, hearing the dark killing clouds approach on cats feet before the events happen, Tamura's copping Franz's allure is a literary crime that one should not easily forgive Murakami of. (Just as you may not forgive me for ending the previous sentence with a preposition.)<br /><br />Truly the interesting person here \\"On the Shore\\" is the librarian Oshima, and that is why the novel still deserves a 3.<br /><br />Someday, Murakami will write something decent. Just as Salinger did with \\"9 Stories.\\"  (Bravo, JD, bravo!--See? I DO LOVE YOU!) And I love you too, Murakami! I saved some raw cats hearts and lined up some nice vaginas just for you! Take your pick!
B00001OH7V|5.0|I've heard a good share of the Bowster's albums and this one is only eclipsed by Ziggy and possibly Hunky Dory. It's basically Bowie's hard rock album(even the most hard-rocking numbers on Man Who Sold The World probably couldn't quite be called hard rock...well maybe one or two...I dunno) and is not nearly as experimental as Low or as everyone says it is. <br /> <br />1. Beauty and The Beast(9/10) - This song is great but it took a few listens to grow on me. <br />2. Joe The Lion(10/10) - Rough sounding and one of Bowie's most hard-rocking songs. Great riff courtesy of Robert Fripp and powerful singing by Bowie. The lyrics are pretty much nonsense, but who the hell cares. <br />3. Heroes(10/10) - The album's best song, pretty far up on my nonexistent \\"Best Bowie Songs\\" list, probably Bowie's best and most powerful vocal performance, and one of the best all time vocal performances in rock history. <br />4. Sons Of The Silent Age(10/10) <br />5. Blackout(10/10) - A pretty strange sounding song but great. <br />6.V-2 Schneider(9.5/10) <br />7. Sense of Doubt(9.5/10) - A nice brooding instrumental. <br />8. Moss Garden(10/10) <br />9. Neukln(10/10) <br />10. Secret Life of Arabia(8.8/10) - Not quite as good as everyone says but still very good. <br /> <br />Overall - 10/10 <br />One of Bowie's best and among the best of alltime. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0812550706|1.0|the plot is clever ..training a  child genius in a military school in space to save the world, ..ludicrously..six year old military geniuses  dont miss parents, dont go wide eyed with wonder on seeing new places, dont  even crave for ice -creamor cookis and have the self discipline which would put the monks to shame! wow!!  <br /> <br />..but actually its the hidden messages in the book which are the most repulsive part of the book. for eg: <br /> <br />1. treating young children in a tough manner and sadistically only makes them tough and thus for their benefit.  <br /> <br />2.The final test of greatness is whether u have the courage to crush /wipe out others completely when push comes to shove. such ppl are heroes. <br /> <br />3. Its OK to wipe out races, countries, people as long as they are 'others' ie. not us. you can feel sad about the mindless killing but its necessary to cleanse the world.  <br /> <br />4. Children have monstrous minds and filthy language. (might be true ::). <br /> <br />5. evolution of human beings meant learning how to kill and a good thing too..or how else could we have killed the tigers. (im paraphrasing) <br /> <br />7. Homophobic refernces against gays. <br /> <br /> <br />all in all a better writer could have done a much better job with the plot.
B000002MP2|4.0|If you like fast, upbeat music, the album Dookie covers this description very nicely. The songs are short and catchy. My personal favorite is Welcome to Paradise. The song developes excellent harmony on the chorus. However despite the album's qualities, i do have a few complaints. One is that all the songs seem to get repetitive after a while. I'm not saying they sound exactly the same, but some are very, very close. It's bazare why greenday would make some songs have very similar chord progressions. i know a lot of bands do that, but greenday brings this to a whole new level. Another complaint i have is that some of the songs are ripoffs on old songs; basket case, paradise, among others, they sound eerily similar to songs in the past. So what i'm basically saying is that greenday is not that innovative. but so what? I have to admit i like the songs and they brought us out of the post nirvana days. they deserve to be where they are in the music scene. if you like punk rock music i highly suggest buying Dookie

B000000I3O|5.0|Raw, fiece, grotesque, and wild. But also tons of fun. This is the Misfits at their best.  I could argue tracks 4-14 is punk rock at its best and that Danzig is one of the best, if not the best, punk singers ever.  The Patty Hearst ode \\"She\\", the great chorus on \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and \\"Horror Business\\", the lewd \\"Teenagers From Mars\\", the erie \\"London Dungon\\", the slasher flick come-to-life \\"Skulls\\", and probably my favorite \\"Astro Zombies\\" about doing the human race a favor by destroying it, all brilliant. Its easy to see why so much was infulenced by these guys. True there are some nitpicks I never really cared for \\"Bullet\\", the Earth A.D. stuff isn't their best. But pound for pound its the best of the Misfits.  One thing, though I prefer some of the recordings here, if you cannot stand low budget production and want to hear some Misfits. Buy something else. I recommend Walk Among Us or Static Age. Though their sound is less raw, they are far from bad recordings. Then pick this one up.  It is essential if you are a fan.

I did enjoy \\"Feelin' Good\\", and \\"Quando Quando Quando\\".    \\"Home\\" nearly makes me cry.  The rest of the album... just kind of blah. <br /> <br />I also was very disappointed to find that when trying to convert these songs to mp3 format for my Dell DJ, they sound like they are \\"skipping\\", making them nearly impossible to listen to.  It plays just fine in the regular cd player though.

However if you are looking for a fast paced sci-fi book about nanotechnology, this is a good book.  Not detailed hard sci-fi, but Hollywood sci-fi.

B0007OCG56|2.0|Suffice it to say, I had better than average expectations  for SPANGLISH, particularly since it was helmed by James L. Brooks. That alone swayed me to watch it, despite my bewilderment that Adam Sandler continues to get work beyond  his usual one-note comedic roles.  Boy, what a letdown.  SPANGLISH, though not without its' moments(few and far between as they are)isn't a patch on his previous BROADCAST NEWS or even the flawed but still watchable AS GOOD AS IT GETS.  Alot of what's wrong with the movie(for me anyway)can be traced back to Tea Leoni's character Deborah, who has got to be one of the most utterly unlikable, unredeemable characters I've ever seen actually make it on to a movie screen.  There's so much wrong with this role--she treats her children like second class citizens in favor of hanging out with the housekeeper's daughter, she treats her alcoholic mother like a third class citizen(sorry, but I'd be drinking even more than her if I had that harpy for a child), and seems almost indifferent to the needs of her husband.  The fact that Tea Leoni, who hasn't given a decent performance since FLIRTING WITH DISASTER, plays her like an over-the-top, cartoonish whirlwind, doesn't help matters in any regard.  In relation, Adam Sandler actually gives a halfway decent performance, and Paz Vega is a true find as the immigrant housekeeper who is struggling to assimilate to new foreign surroundings while still trying to retain her heritage.  The true saving grace of the film, though, was the underused but comedically brilliant Cloris Leachman, who brings tangy zest to the role of Leoni's mother and effortlessly owns every scene she's in.  That said, this film was ultimately a true disappointment, especially from someone with such a history of rich characters like Brooks.
B00008972S|5.0|(...)<br />Well, now that we have that out of the way, let's take a look at the actual movie.<br />WSS is, as I have said, a 1961 adaption of the Shakespearean drama Romeo and Juliet. Verona, Italy becomes 1950's Manhattan; the Capulets and Montagues become warring gangs: the Puerto Rican Sharks and the white-boy Jets. The parallels are fascinating: the Prince of Verona becomes the short-tempered Officer Krupke, the balcony becomes a fire escape, the Friar becomes the wise and worried Doc - it continues throughout the movie.<br />The dialogue is realistic and revealing, the characters real and honest. Issues such as racism, violence, and prejudice are brought to light, along with the blinding nature of young love.<br />With incredible coreography (27 pairs of pants split in the course of filming!), innovative (for the time) and striking filming,  and wonderful, catchy, heartfelt music, the old familiar story of star-crossed lovers takes on a bright, vibrant, bursting young life.

B00065MDRW|5.0|Time and time again we are confronted with artists who put out a great debut album and never climb that high ever again. When it comes to talking about the paradigmatic example of such a phenomenon my choice would be King Crimson and their debut album \\"In the Court of the Crimson King.\\" Released in 1969 with its distinctive cover art, this was the album that set the standard for progressive/psychedelic rock for the next decade. Except for the title track the songs are ensemble efforts by guitarist Robert Fripp, drummer Michael Giles, bass player and lead vocalist Greg Lake, keyboard player Ian McDonald, and lyricist Peter Sinfield.<br /><br />The best track on the album is the first, \\"21st Century Schizoid Man,\\" with its big main riff and jazz-rock middle section (\\"Mirrors\\"). The music is somewhat distorted at times, but that does not stop the group's musical virtuosity from coming through. As you would expect from the title, the song paints a picture of dystopian future that embodies the worst tendencies of the late 1960s, and remains the standard by which other progressive rock epics are judged. In terms of political sensibilities nothing comes close. The song also stands out because the following track, \\"I Talk to the Wind,\\" is more folk-rock and constitutes a sort of cleansing of the palate before proceeding to the rest of the album (it is actually a song members of the group had played on earlier efforts).<br /><br />The title track is not the best King Crimson song, but it is probably their best known one (and the one song that was written just by McDonald and Sinfeld). The conceit is of a medieval court afflicted by a black queen, fire witch, and other equally dark images heading for total destruction. It is a daring finality, teetering on the brink of the sort of bombastic pomposity that often afflicted progressive rock (Emerson, Lake & Palmer's \\"Tarkus Suite,\\" with its synthesizer excess is the example that springs to mind). Musically on this album as a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent. When I was growing up the singing voice I most wanted to have was Greg Lake's, and this is the album when he sounds the best. The result is that \\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\" is one of the albums that has to be considered when you are making a list of top albums from the Sixites or in the history of progressive rock music. It does not matter that King Crimson had a revolving door lineup and that it would take them years to come up with anything close to this classic album.a whole it is McDonald who makes the biggest mark on the album, playing mellotron and assorted other instruments like saxophones, although Fripp's guitar is also prominent.

B0000TB05A|5.0|A couple of decades ago when U2 played a concert in Champaign-Urbana they showed up after the gig at a local bar and when it was learned the boys had never been to a college sorority they were escorted over to one and shown the place in the middle of the night.  The story appeared in the &quot;Daily Illini&quot; and the most interesting part was how the group did not behave like rock stars in a sorority, which sounds like a good idea for a bad movie, but how they acted like they were guests in someone's home.  The lesson would be that U2 was not too big for their britches and when you watch the 2002 concert film &quot;U2: Go Home: Live From Slane Castle, Ireland,&quot; there is ample evidence that nothing has changed during the intervening years.<br />The concert itself is from 2001, when U2 did two huge shows at Slane Castle, which is where they recorded their &quot;Unforgettable Fire&quot; album (thereby explaining why the documentary on that album and the recording of &quot;Pride (In the Name of Love&quot;) is included on this DVD).  What you get is the band performing in front of 80,000 adoring fans on their Elevation Tour (thereby explaining why it is the opening song), in their signature mix of high energy and absolute ease.  The concert is a mix of the new (e.g., &quot;Beautiful Day,&quot; &quot;Kite,&quot; Walk On&quot;), the old (e.g., &quot;New Year's Day,&quot; &quot;Out of Control,&quot; &quot;Desire&quot;) and a few things that came out in between (e.g., &quot;Until the End of the World&quot;).<br />What stands out for me is the balance of the group.  While Bono is out in front playing to the crowd and the Edge is right behind with his distinctive guitar playing, the rhythm section of Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen, Jr. are providing a driving hard rock foundation for those songs that always sound best in an arena, content to stand on stage and let the other half of the band stand in the spotlight.  It is significant that above the giant screen behind them there are four individual screens that focus on a single band member throughout the concert.  There have been so many bands that have self-destructed from interpersonal conflicts that having these four guys from Dublin stick together for what will be three decades come next year (Mullen formed the group in high school in 1976 where they were a Beatles/Rolling Stone cover band called Feedback and then Hype before settling on U2).<br />The other undeniable fact is that &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; remains a powerful political anthem after all these years.  Everyone who was weaned on MTV remembers the music video from the group's concert at Colorado's Red Rocks Amphitheater that was part of the &quot;Under a Blood Red Sky&quot; concert video and seeing Bono lead 80,000 Irish fans in the responsive portion of the song can give you chills.  You watch U2 in concert, or put on this DVD and turn up the sound because for some reason the music sounds better than on a CD, and it is hard not to agree they are not the best rock 'n' roll band in the world.them there are four individual screens that focus on a single band member throughout the concert.

6303442889|5.0|The political controversy over \\"The Day After\\" when it was first broadcast in 1983 had to do with the idea that a television movie about a nuclear war was an indictment of the policies of the Reagan Administration. Of course \\"The Day After\\" was not an attack on a particular president, but rather it represented the liberal nightmare of the worst of all possible futures, with a full out nuclear exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. Four years later the ultimate conservative nightmare was aired with the mini-series \\"Amerika,\\" in which the United States has been taken over by the Communists. Both were predicated on questionable assumptions, the former on an escalation of a conflict over Berlin and the later on the effects of an electro-magnetic pulse, but those were both simply excuses to tell the story that wanted to be told.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"The Day After\\" is not so much a story as it is a depiction of what a nuclear war would be like that comes under the heading of \\"seeing is believing.\\" Prior to the airing of this television film Hollywood showed what it was like to live in the world after a nuclear war in films from \\"On the Beach\\" to \\"Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome,\\" suggested that a nuclear war would be so horrible that a president would drop nuclear bombs on New York City rather than go to war in \\"Fail Safe,\\" and ended the Cold War satire of \\"Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" with a series of atom bomb's exploding set to the popular song \\"We'll Meet Again.\\" But what they did not show was what that nuclear war would be like. Even the \\"Star Wars\\" universe assumed there would be a nuclear war some day, as did I, but depicting the horrors of such a war was never really done until \\"The Day After.\\"<br /><br />However, exploding mushroom clouds and the victims of radiation poison were not what was most memorable about \\"The Day After.\\" The icon image from the film became the shots of the missiles taking off, with the people of Lawrence, Kansas looking up into the sky at the ICBMs headed towards the Soviet Union knowing that their missiles were heading for us. Suddenly it became clear that the true moment of horror would be when you saw those missiles because chances were you would never see the mushroom cloud that took your life. In fact, given the choice between being incinerated and surviving long enough to watch your loved ones suffer horribly, I think most people would hope for the quick death. This film turned those last few minutes of life from the old joke about how you need to bend over, put your head between your knees and kiss you ass goodbye into an enduring image of outright terror.<br /><br />The worst moments of this film are the painful period between the missiles taking off and the nukes exploding. One of the silos is right next to the Dahlberg farm, and the emotion nadir of the film is Denise Dahlberg (Lori Lethin) comes down the stairs holding the wedding dress she will never get to wear and her father tells her to get into the storm cellar. Then Jim Dahlberg (John Cullum) has to go upstairs and drag his wife Eve (Bibi Besch) screaming and crying away from the bed she is making in a desperate attempt to pretend that the world is not coming to an end.<br /><br />Jason Robards is Dr. Russell Oakes, who along with Nurse Nancy Bauer (JoBeth Williams) has to deal with the casualties following the detonations at a besieged hospital, and Stephen Klein (Steve Guttenberg) is the guy who takes refuge with the Dahlbergs. Joe Huxley (John Lithgow) is the college professor who gets to supply most of the relatively small amount of exposition the story requires: a student thinks they are safe because Kansas is in the middle of nowhere, but the professor is the one who points out \\"There's no 'nowhere' anymore\\" since there is an Air Force base and 150 Minutemen Missile silos spread halfway down Missouri, all constituting \\"an awful lot of bullseyes.\\" When the missiles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well.<br /><br />I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched \\"The Day After\\" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a \\"nuclear winter\\" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen. To say that this was a sobering idea to give an audience that was already depressed by what they had seen, would be an understatement. Sagan, of course, was opposed to the use of nuclear weapons and condemned the arms race. Speaking on the other side, which is to say in favor of the concept of nuclear deterrence, was William F. Buckley, Jr., and what we got to see in that debate (which is still available on video) was that both were right.<br /><br />It is rather amazing, given the history of humanity, that it has been almost sixty years since nuclear weapons have been used in war. Ironically, we now live in a world where we still believe that those weapons are going to be used, although now we assume it will be the work of terrorists (or an attempt to stop terrorists) and not a war between East and West. I would not be surprised if right now Hollywood is kicking around ideas of what it would be like the day after that sort of nuclear detonation, going beyond what we saw in \\"The Sum of All Fears.\\" Hopefully it would be as successful at forestalling our worst nightmares as \\"The Day After\\" has been these many years.iles take off he is the one who knows it takes thirty minutes to reach their target, a fact that applies to the incoming missiles as well.  <br /> <br />I remember the night of November 11, 1983 as I watched \\"The Day After\\" how ABC did not run any commercials after the nukes went off and that right afterwards the network had a special news program in which Dr. Carl Sagan introduced us to the idea of a \\"nuclear winter\\" and the fact that the reality of a nuclear exchange would be much worse than we had seen.

B000051ZST|1.0|I watched this at a friends house at a party and everyone was laughing their heads off.....except of course me. Not trying to be a sour-puss or anything but seriously, I couldnt see anything in this movie worth even the slightest chuckle. Its exactly the same as American Pie except theres a cross country road trip in the plot. Ok, some drunken idiot with a perfect looking girlfriend at some party school has sex with some random slut and video-tapes it. Miraculously it gets sent to his girlfriends dorm or whatever wh@re house she lives in. Now him and his rich friends need to go on a road trip and waste their money and get their car blown up just to get to the video in time. OK! now heres the punchline....I couldnt see any of the characters as people but as spoiled smartmouth little runts who think that they can do anything they want when they want. So therefore, why would a guy waste his time to get this \\"girl of his dreams\\" back in his life.....wow their sex life will diminish they will cheat on each other even more and probably do all this while get hard liqour injected into their veins. So what? Why is it that movies have to portray college kids as smart-ass little punks walking around with a 24 hour hard on and trying to hump everything they see, and have to get doped up or drunk every night, and that if their 'perfect' relationship ends their lives will be ruined. Once again this a series of films that need to end....it all a started with American Pie...I admit I bought American Pie unrated edition back in '99 when i got caught up with all the hype.....wow theres a few more naked teenagers than in the R-rated version...big deal! thats pretty much how the Road Trip Unrated DVD is...along with Van Wilder, American Pie 2, Old School, and just about any other teen party movie with Tara Reid or Sean William Scott, so just to clarify my affirmation of these kinds of movies, they need to end because the humor and characters and actors are getting just plain annoying,and all my friends are caught up in this kind of crap so its a nightmare when we all watch movies together.
B0000506TE|5.0|\\"L.A. Woman\\" is the final album put together by the Doors before the death of Jim Morrison and what is so striking about it for me is how the two best tracks, the title one and \\"Riders of the Storm,\\" are so different from the rest of what is on the album. Contrasting the start of those tracks with the opening song on the album, \\"The Changeling,\\" and they are like night and day. Most of the rest of this 1971 album is really blues oriented, with \\"Love Her Madly\\" clearly being the best of the bunch, and some of the rest being instantly forgettable. I think it is obvious that the band was trying to get back their credibility after veering too far in the direction of pop for a couple of albums, with \\"Morrison Hotel\\" and this one righting those wrongs. But since a few of these songs are pretty forgettable, \\"L.A. Woman\\" is an album that is caught between a 4 and a 5 but you have to round up given how good its two best songs end up being.<br /><br />My two favorite parts of Oliver Stone's movie \\"The Doors\\" is when we hear Ray Manzarek in the background fooling around on the organ until he gets the bit for \\"Light My Fire\\" right and the end credits with the tracking shot showing the record of \\"L.A. Woman,\\" with Val Kilmer's Morrison taking advantage of the great acoustics in the bathroom. For years when I was driving back from the Twin Cities and coming up the final hills before being able to see the lights of home, to wit the \\"city of lights,\\" \\"L.A. Woman\\" was the song I would play in the car because it perfectly suited the moment.<br /><br />Since the track opens with the sound of an accelerating car engine it is easy to see why the songs is associated with driving. Robbie Krieger simulates that sound on his guitar, but with a hint of eeriness that leads into first Manzarek's keyboards and then John Densmore's cymbal tapping and session player Jerry Scheff's throbbing bass. From that intriguing beginning the song generates its compelling rhythm and allows Morrison to wax lyrical. The bridge represents one of the most creative changes in rock history, using a tango tempo while Morrison sings about burning hair before getting to the final section where the anagrammatic \\"Mr. Mojo Risin'\\" makes his appearance. On a lot of these tracks Morrison's voice sounds about shot, but there are no complaints about \\"L.A. Woman,\\" which qualifies as his last great vocal performance.<br /><br />\\"Riders of the Storm\\" is one of the moodiest Doors' songs and the lyrics create a sense of foreboding (e.g., \\"Into this house were born/Into this world we're thrown\\") representing the questionable side of human existence. Musically Manzarek captures the sound of the storm, with actual thunderstorm sound effects dubbed on to the track, while Densmore again works the cymbals and Scheff provides a simple bass line, reflecting a minimalist approach that is quite effective. The song made it to #14 on the Billboard charts after Morrison's death in Paris (\\"Love Her Madly\\" had made it to #11 while the title track was just too long for AM radio). The \\"L.A. Woman\\" album only made it to #9, which, believe it or not, makes it the worst performance by a Doors album. Of course, a decade later Morrison and the Doors were bigger than ever and \\"L.A.

0783229321|1.0|A while ago I told my buddy in my class that i never saw Animal House, He looked at me like I just drank a cup of cat piss........Ok now Im a social reject for never seeing this movie, so I figured what the hay, ill go rent it <br />Allright now Im a college student..i dont live in a dorm but I take classes at a smaller school in a big town so theres stuff to do.....all I could muster from this movie is that unless your getting smashed every weekend or making yourself looking like a fool you wouldnt fit in at any school. This movie proves that this is the case. I dont know why college kids are so impressionable to these kinds of movies, its so cool when they do it, but when we try it we get arrested, injured or emotionally ruined.......and yet we keep at it every weekend. Well not me.......I dont see what the big deal is with college kids partying every weekend...and as for fraternities.....(this is kind of off the subject) but why would someone want to like try and get themself castrated just to get into an endless keg party in a rich kid's house(noticed that in Van Wilder), its just a stupid tradition that our generation needs to put an end to. lets move on to something else.......
B000059T1E|5.0|The original 1970 disc \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is one of those albums that marks the end of Sixties music for me and I have always thought of \\"Glad\\" as the song that really allowed Traffic to justify their name and really jam. I truly cannot think of a better instrumental number from this period (the end of \\"Layla\\" does not count), plus I have an irrevocable association in my mind for the song and one of the more interesting movies I saw my first semester of college.  Ironically, this was not supposed to be a Traffic album but the first solo album for Steve Winwood, who was still only 22 years old at that point although already a veteran of the Spencer Davis Group with the classic \\"Gimme Some Lovin'\\" on his resume as the definitive screaming organ piece of the decade.  Winwood intended to play all of the instruments on his album (just like Paul McCartney did on his self-titled solo album that same year), but then Winwood had Jim Capaldi and then Chris Wood to help work on the sessions and suddenly Traffic had not only its first album in a year but its best one.<br /><br />The most amazing thing about this album is that while you have the opening track \\"Glad,\\" perhaps the best example of jazz influence in rock and roll, you also have the mournful folk ballade \\"John Barleycorn,\\" with the voices of Winwood and Capaldi entwined over and around an acoustic guitar.  You would swear these songs had to come from different albums because they really have nothing in common representing jazz and folk as they do. This time around the band takes the time to explore their songs, with four of the songs lasting longer than six minutes, which in 1970 was really considered pushing the envelope.  It also signaled a new level of musical commitment for the group to artistic rather than commercial success, since these were the four longest songs they had recorded to date. The group might still be jamming, but at a higher level that before their last breakup because they are simply on the same wavelength at this point.<br /><br />The other thing that strikes me about Traffic is that they really knew how to start a song, especially the awesome piano lick that begins \\"Glad,\\" but also on \\"Stranger to Himself\\" and \\"John Barleycorn.\\"  The album made it to #5 on the Billboard album chart.  \\"Empty Pages\\" was actually released as the obligatory single and although it is arguably the catchiest tune on the album and shows Winwood's virtuostity on the electric piano only made it to #64 on the singles chart.  As for the question of whether \\"Freedom Rider\\" is really about Jim Morrison of the Doors, you can make of that what you will, but it is too late for me to make that a major association in my appreciation of the song.  \\"Stranger to Himself\\" is actually a message song, but focusing on the lyrics is always problematic on this album given the attention that must be paid to the music.  That is why \\"John Barleycorn Must Die\\" is arguably the greatest Sixties album not produced in the actual decade of the Sixties.n the same wavelength at this point.   <br /> <br />The other thing that strikes me about Traffic is that they really knew how to start a song, especially the awesome piano lick that begins \\"Glad,\\" but also on \\"Stranger to Himself\\" and \\"John Barleycorn.\\"   The album made it to #5 on the Billboard album chart.  \\"Empty Pages\\" was actually released as the obligatory single and although it is arguably the catchiest tune on the album and shows Winwood's virtuostity on the electric piano only made it to #64 on the singles chart.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|It's rude and it's crude, especially for puppets... but it is definitely worth a look-see.<br /><br />Not only are the jokes, humor, and even the soundtrack itself very hilarious, but the satire is delicious as well. Although it may seem that it is bashing the Bush administration, it also sticks it to whiny, power-abusing celebrities that believe that they know all there is to know about world politics by reading one newspaper and whatnot. It is definitely worth watching; check it out!
B0009WFEK0|3.0|Homages, hat-tips and disco-punk are the thing in LCD Soundsystem, brainchild of James Murphy. There's nothing here to get it nominated for \\"Best album of the year,\\" but the self-titled dance album has both its good and bad sides -- the main disc is middling, while the second is marvelously weird.<br /><br />The catchy, fuzzy single \\"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\\" kicks things off in a not-so-great note -- it's a fun song, but not one to listen to multiple times. From there on, LCD Soundsystem trips merrily off to swoony technoballads, ear-blistering electronic waves, and vaguely muffled yowls from Murphy, who sometimes sounds like he's being eaten by the drum set.<br /><br />It's a tripwire-taut, catchy collection of melodies, with that slightly jerky edge that is currently in vogue with some top-selling indierock bands. Like those bands, LCD Soundsystem has some debts owed to Brian Eno, Wire, and the Fall. It's entertaining, but it's also not terribly memorable.<br /><br />That changes with the second disc, which is a few tracks shorter but makes up for any lack of creativity in the first disc. Here the beats are less intense, the music is fringed with ambient sweeps, and everything feels more comfortable and looser. It's like wearing a broken-in sneaker, versus the new, stiff tennis shoes -- read, the first disc.<br /><br />There are slow numbers, interspersed with wild beats and filtered vocals, and tightly-wound little dance numbers, as stripped-down as a dance-punk sound can be. It ends on a surprising note, with the chaotic-sounding \\"Tired\\" and two versions of the song \\"Yeah.\\" The crass version is more openly dancey, while the pretentious version is trippy and dense.<br /><br />It takes awhile for this dancey punky swippy electroclash to really catch on -- initially it sounds like the same ol', same ol', especially in the very overrated \\"Daft Punk...\\" song. How often can we hear Murphy ending lines with \\"... at my house... MY HOUSE!\\" before wanting to go back to ours? The music has some solid basslines, beats and vaguely retro sounds, but it isn't terribly memorable.<br /><br />The first disc is too repetitive and dancey, as if made specifically for clubbing. Fortunately, it is saved by the bonus disc. This stuff is more creative, less dancey, and none of those six precious tracks is a dull one. They have stranger melodies, spoken lyrics, and even panpipes played in one song. Wild! Wicked!<br /><br />LCD Soundsystem's debut album is a fun listen, mostly because of the second disc. The basic dancepunk songs are middling to annoying, but the weirder songs are bliss.ack to ours?

B00005JMYI|3.0|I found Anchorman to be amusing, with occasional hee-haw big laughs at singular jokes with the overall 'amusement' factor due to the idea of the film.  This ain't a documentary.  It's an evening's worth of mildly amusing entertainment. <br /> <br />However, the DVD commentary - yes, I do watch the commentaries after I have viewed the film - is exceptionally funny and better than the film. It is perhaps the best commentary of any film on DVD that I have encountered.  <br /> <br />Why?  Because it is a non-stop improvised comedy routine that sends-up commentaries on DVD.  It's hilarious and even includes, unexplainably, Lou Rawls adding his two cents to the conversation.  There is a \\"fist fight\\" that leaves Ferrell wounded and bleeding and...well, you have to listen to it all.  They never do get around to describing the film...and hence, the joke. <br /> <br />The commentary is funnier and fresher than the film. <br /> <br />Buy the DVD - listen to the commentary.
B00079018K|4.0|Well, it's about time Manchester got a revival -- it's been around fifteen years since bands like the Happy Mondays and Stone Roses erupted onto the music scene. Now with late-70s and mid-80s music being revived in newer, trendier bands, it's about time we got to England in the late-80s and mid-90s.<br /><br />Enter Kasabian, a Leicester band who put out catchy, synthy, and extremely entertaining rock'n'roll. What does their self-titled album sound like? Well, it has some echoes of those Manchester greats, except that it has a synth edge over those heavy riffs. Add in some very radio-friendly melodies, which are almost guaranteed to get these guys noticed by the media.<br /><br />Not that that's a bad thing -- they resemble fellow electro-Manchester band South, which happens to be among my favorite Britpop bands. Kasabian is just  lighter. They kick things off on a strong note with the expansive \\"Clubb Foot,\\" which pairs gritty rock with sweeping synth, over Tom Meighan's languid vocals.<br /><br />Fortunately this is not one of those albums that has one good single, and then gets lazy. Things stay catchy and gritty, all throughout the album, with heavy riffs and steady rhythms, and Kasabian keep their style varied enough that listeners won't be left thinking, \\"Oh man, are they playing that riff AGAIN?\\"<br /><br />Not to mention the singing: Meighan has a very strong, melodious voice. In almost every song, he sings slow and lazily. He sounds either stoned or inattentive, except for a few wonderful songs where he sounds completely into what he sings. \\"John was a scientist, he was hooked on LSD/Interested in mind control and how the monkey held the key/Said that all life is experiments somebody's planning for the heir/It's for the unexpected citizens who hallucinate in fear,\\" he purrs happily.<br /><br />Yeah, it can get pretty heavy. but the music is also tempered with an ethereal edge -- there's a brief interlude which is all muffled riffs, deep synth and angelic vocals. At the very least, all that synth serves to lighten up what could have been a dark album, and adds an epic edge to what could have been terribly ordinary music.<br /><br />The flaw? It gets a bit fragmented, with two peppy electronic \\"interludes\\" sitting between harder rock'n'roll. They're pretty, but they feel out of place.<br /><br />Things climax with hints of another possible direction for them to go in: \\"U Boat,\\" a rich soundscape that fades away into silence... before fading back into a different mix of \\"Reason is Treason.\\" It's all hard angles and explosions, and if anything, this mix is even better than the radio-friendly original. (Talk about having your cake and eating it too)<br /><br />One of the few albums that is catchy and musically rich, Kasabian's debut is one of the best releases this year.

B000066I6N|4.0|I was recommended this CD by one of the local disc jockeys from a classic rock station here in Reno just after its release. Robert Plant's style had gradually changed over each album/CD that came out. His first solo \\"Pictures at Eleven\\" sounded very close to the music of Led Zeppelin as was his second cut \\"The Principle of Moment\\". It wasn't until \\"Manic Nirvana\\" when there was a different style that sounded very upbeat.    The tracks in \\"Dreamland\\" feature an assortment of styles, but the track \\"Darkness, Darkness\\" sounds very close to the typical blues style of Led Zeppelin such as \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" (Led Zeppelin III). \\"Song to the Siren\\" sounds almost identical to that of \\"The Rain Song\\" (Houses of the Holy). \\"Hey Joe\\" is a remake of a Jimi Hendrix song of the same title, but with a little more suspense in it. The beginning of \\"Red Dress\\" would sound like something that came out of a Rod Stewart song.    Above all, the CD is excellent for any Robert Plant or Led Zeppelin fan. Buy it!!!!
0517221160|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.<br /><br />Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement.ust a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well.

So when I listened to this CD I was really taken aback at how good it was. It wasn't overly synthesized crap, and every song is written by DeGraw himself which, to me, signals musical intelligence and integrity.  <br /> <br />The Stripped CD is pared down to the bare minimum of just Gavin DeGraw's voice (he can actually sing!) and a couple instruments. I think having this 2nd CD after the initial album came out was a great idea. It offered a different take on the songs on the album and proved that Gavin DeGraw is the real deal. He's a musician who can sing and write with the best of them.  <br /> <br />Among my favorite tracks are \\"Just Friends\\" and \\"Chariot\\" but the entire album consists of great songs, so you never have to skip around.  The Stripped album has an extra song \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" originally by Sam Cooke and this really exhibits Gavin DeGraw's maturity and talent in music as we see his ability to make tasteful choices in covers and his ability to actually pull it off.  <br /> <br />I actually like \\"Stripped\\" more than the originally released album and I absolutely adore his live shows because his voice is grittier &  sexier, and the songs are just much more appealing in a live format.  I would really recommend checking out archive.org to download (it's legal) some of his live shows to see for yourself just how good he is live and to hear some of the songs he has written that are not on the Chariot or Stripped Album (\\"Cop Stop\\" being my favorite.) <br /> <br />Don't mistake him for John Mayer or Jason Mraz just because he is a solo white guy who plays a little guitar (his main instrument of choice is actually the piano). He has a very different sound and he is more than worth checking out.
B000067UUJ|4.0|British band Muse broke out in the US with their third album \\"Absolution,\\" and establishing them as a remarkable new rock band. They're epic, intensedark, and majestic in a proggy-Pink-Floyd-meets-Led-Zeppelin kind of way, and so it's hardly a surprise that \\"Hullabaloo\\" is a remarkably strong collection.<br /><br />No, it's not a new album. Rather, it's a collection of B-sides, rarities, and a 2001 live concert. Most bands don't sound too great in either case, but Muse does. The first disc is made up of their B-sides and rarities, which tend to be quite good actually.<br /><br />It doesn't start off promising, with the schizophrenic prog-rocker \\"Forced In,\\" which would be fine if it weren't for the endlessly cycling synth that obscures everything else. But things get stronger after that, with the explosive downward spiral that is \\"Shrinking Universe\\" (\\"There's nothing left to die for!\\"), the softer poppy \\"Recess,\\" and the surprisingly gentle acoustic ballad \\"Map Of your Head.\\"<br /><br />Most of the other songs follow those examples, either being epic and bombastic or quieter and more intimate. With, of course, some eerier songs thrown in, like the rippling sweetness of \\"Shine Acoustic.\\" Are they as good as Muse's proper albums, especially since a few B-sides sound like the lost soundtrack of the X-Files? Not really, but they are remarkably good, and still better than average.<br /><br />Which brings us to the live performance, which took place in October of 2001, in Paris's \\"Le Zenith.\\" Well, to put it simply, these guys rock. It opens with a cheering crowd, right before they kick off into a tornado of bass, drums and guitar. Unlike many rock bands, these guys lose none of their power or musical richness in live performances.<br /><br />The inevitable flaw? Well, that would probably be Matt Bellamy -- he doesn't sound too different from in the albums, but it's sometimes hard to hear him above the drums, explosive synth and spiralling bass. However, the guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing. If Muse are known for their prowess in live performances, then it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The B-sides are a minor treasure trove, while the live album is a gem in itself, bringing their concert to life as nothing -- except a DVD -- could. A must-have for Muse fans.guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing.

Lipton's illustrations are excellent, creating the visuals necessary to relate to his detailed scientific material. His stunning research breaks the bonds of traditional approaches to how the body gets sick and how the body can heal.
B000274THQ|4.0|GOODBYE, LENIN! is an enjoyable and original film. It is a blend of both comedy and drama. The plot of the film is simple enough. It is told through the perspective of Alex Kerner (played by Daniel Bruhn) who tells the story of his mother (Kathryn Sass), a loyal member of the Communist party who is abandoned by her husband and has to raise her children alone. The mother has had some difficulties in the past and the children become very protective of her, especially Alex. Like many young people, Alex is involved in protests against the oppressive East German regime and when his mother witnesses his arrest, she has a heart attack and is comatose for eight months. She misses the major historic upheavals, including the fall of the Berlin Wall. When she awakens, her doctor recommends a no stress lifestyle and her children decide that the best way for this to happen is to make it as if the Berlin Wall never fell, and try to create a mini communist nation in the family's apartment. The antics of Alex provide for humorous situations. He quickly becomes westernized but reverts to former ways when he is at home. He and a friend devise ways to rebroadcast old news stories and slowly brace the mother for the changes. While clever humor is found throughout the film, it never becomes silly, a credit to skillful writing. We also see the bonds of love between the Kerner family, particularly mother and son, and get a glimpse of the heart wrenching decisions people had to make during the bleak years of Communist rule in a divided Germany.<br /><br />Critics can say that the film is implausible at best, yet the combination of the acting and writing, as well as the lighting and atmosphere of the film make it entirely believable. It also gives us an appreciation of just how life changing the fall of the wall was, and hwo different the world has become in a short time.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree is known for writing fantastic music, and that is exactly the same thing they have done with \\"Deadwing\\". They have taken their same fantastic style and have crafted it enough to create another amazing album. Is it better then \\"In Absentia\\"? Probably not, however, it doesn't fall too far behind. \\"Deadwing\\" is an album full of graceful melodies, hard rocking guitar riffs, and the same amazing singing from Steven Wilson. He really shows the wonders of his vocal chords on such tracks like \\"Halo\\", and \\"Mellotron Scratch\\". Here is a tracklisting, their times, and the ratings for each song. <br /> <br />1. Deadwing 9:46- 10/10 - An absolute wonder of a song, perfectly crafted to include prog rocking Porcupine Tree, and the heavy sides of their musical array. <br /> <br />2. Shallow 4:17- 9/10 - The first single is a short and sweet little hard rocker that almost everyone can enjoy. <br /> <br />3. Lazarus 4:19- 10/10 - One of the greatest songs to grace my ears, this song is pure beauty. Wilson's vocals and the musical quality is excellent, this is great to relax to. <br /> <br />4. Halo 4:38- 11/10 - This is one of my favorite songs on the album, and is ultimately a very catchy, fun song to listen to. The ending is very cool, and I love Wilson's vocals on this one. <br /> <br />5. Arriving Somewhere(But not here) 12:03 - 12/10 - This is it, the high water mark of the album. This song is a force of its own and truly is one of the best examples of excellent musicianship i've heard in a while. Many people will love this song. <br /> <br />6. Mellotron Scratch 6:57- 11/10 - My favorite track on the album, Mellotron Scratch is a great slow rocker with a fantastic ending. I love everything about this song. <br /> <br />7. Open Car 3:46- 9/10 - Another short and sweet song, has a good chorus. <br /> <br />8. The start of Something beautiful 7:40- 10/10 - This song will probably be most known for its fantastic final minutes. The 3 mintue Instrumental near the end should be and will be recognized for one of the most beautiful pieces ever. <br /> <br />9. Glass Arm Shattering 11:13- 10/10 - This isn't the best ending track, and definitely does not live up to say \\"Collapse the Light into Earth\\", however, it is definitely a very good song. This song is very reminescent of Pink Floyd in some respects, however, holds its own. <br /> <br />10. Shesmovedon(bonus) 5:00- 9/10 - This song is a remake of their older version that was one their album \\"Lightbulb Sun\\". It's a good song, however since I haven't heard the original, I don't know how it stands as a remake. <br /> <br />Make no mistake, Porcupine Tree has added another wonderful cd to their already star studded discography. I highly recommend this album, because it's really very good.
B00005JG6Q|5.0|I would definitely consider this an art film.  Why?  It's simple, the story is so complex I had to watch this 3 times.   I still don't understand some parts of the story.  The fellow who was shot by the politician.  He was also part of the Akira terrorist organization?  How come they were laying off bombs?  And why was he tied to the government?  At the same time, why is the general allowing experiments on Tetsuo?  What they are creating is what the terrorists are believing in?  So in essence the government is creating their own enemy?  It still gets me confused.  I like the clean stories like Star Blazers and Macross Saga. <br /> <br />But for what it is, Akira is a great art film.  It really takes on its own life and interpretation of the nuclear age.  Obviously this movie was inspired by the atom bomb.  The entire movie starts with a mushroom cloud.   I highly recommend this film for those who just enjoy art films.  And for those that love complex stories, this is your film.
0553802534|5.0|I only wish Lisa Gardner had more books out there. Mary Higgins Clark used to be my favorite, but I like the gritty, edginess of Lisa Gardner's books. Alone captivated every moment of my attention while I was reading it, as have all of her other books. I can't wait until the next one! And being from New England, it was nice to be familiar with the setting.
B00009V7T2|2.0|When I started looking for new music last year, one thing was made clear: Everyone loves The Mars Volta and they wrote one of the greatest albums of 2004. Not usually one to pay much heed to popular opinion, the argument of \\"Too prog or not too prog?\\" grabbed my interest, and I picked up a copy. <br /> <br />The first thing I noticed was the music. It's all very well done, and as an album it flows well. I was starting to enjoy it somewhat, and then I made the FATAL mistake, and started listening to the lyrics. Hooboy. Let's take a look: <br /> <br />\\"last night I heard lepers <br />flinch like birth defects <br />it's musk was fecal in origin <br />as the words dribbled off of its chin\\" <br /> <br />Words pulled out of a hat, or failure to graduate from primary school? You decide! <br /> <br />Based on the psychic journeys of their now-dead friend who shot up rat poison and, after a week-long coma, killed himself, De-Loused in the Comatorium is the worst piece of self-indulgent piffle I think I have had the displeasure of listening to in years. That's not to say that it's  in some way musically inept. The music is fine. But as someone said about their lyrics \\"It's like they stuck a whole bunch of PSAT words in\\" the rhymes are forced at the best of times, and the bigger words are spoken with such a lack of confidence in their use that I'd be willing to wager the band had a Thesaurus to hand when they wrote the songs. I could go on about how romanticizing the comatose adventures of a dead friend is poor taste at best, but frankly my bile will only stretch so far. <br /> <br />The only thing that saves it from the single star is the music. <br /> <br />Don't buy this album - save yourself the waste of time and money.
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie may have had critics raving over it but to me, this movie was horrible. Firstly, a CGI computer animated Hulk who can leap like there is no gravity? What the? Secondly, Eric Bana (the actor who plays Bruce Banner) is looking like a tired kid who's had enough play and is saying \\"Let me out! I've had enough!\\" And the truth is, in an Australian interview with the Aussie star, he did claim to dislike working on the Hulk. It's a terrible movie in my opinion. Everything looks so fake due to so much CGI and Eric Bana is in it only because he gets paid so much money.
0688163173|5.0|This book was definitely one of my favorites.  It plays with your mind...a great trait in a well written suspense novel.  At the end I was beginning to feel as if I were going insane!  I wish there were more books like this one.  The setting (mental institution out on an island) was perfect for this story.  This book is definitely one that makes you think...even long after you've finished the last page.  A truly magnificent read!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw phantom of the opera in January, I have seen the play about 2 times and just loved it. The movie really does a good job of going from the Stage to the screen. Now if you are die hard about this play being exactly like it is on stage then I will tell you now that you are not going to like it. The movie had to manuver certain aspects of the play to make it all flow together for the screen. <br />   The singers are wonderful, even though it is supposedly an opera there are no opera singers in the movie, in the traditional sense, but then again the play didn't have any true opera singers. Michael Crawford will forever be the phantom in many people's minds and sarah brightman is christine, yet these cast members make a memorable preformance and just take the play to a new level. I will say that they cast each role perfectly, I never like raoul in the play because he was too much of a righteous guy that he just got on my nerves, in the movie he is exactly the same way.  <br />   Take the oppourtunity to experience this movie and just sit back relax and enjoy. I loved this movie and am so glad that it is coming out on DVD soon, the music and story are just so enchanting that it will never get old.

0440178002|4.0|I have read this book twice now, with about fifteen years in between. Both times I left feeling like I had walked away with a newfound knowledge into a society that I knew little of. From what I understand, Clavell was a prisoner of war during WWII under the Japanese and he related this experience in the book King Rat. I find it fascinating that instead of harboring an immense resentment towards this culture, Clavell embraces it and brings to life a novel such as Shogun.<br /><br />This book spans a well-crafted period of transformation on the part of Blackthorn, an English pilot for a fleet of Dutch ships that reach the end of its foreshortened journey on the shores of Japan. Though the book might follow Blackthorn on his journey though various levels and occasions of Japans society, it is really more a story that attempts to explain Japan and why it is the way it is.<br /><br />I have read King Rat and Tai Pan, and found both of these books to be lacking in some way. If you have started with one of these books and are hesitant to pick up Shogun, I beg of you to reconsider. Clavell is at the peak of his powers here and you will be satisfied with the pages that await your turning.
078681859X|5.0|Entertaining and fast pased.  Would recommend it to everyone.
6300133605|2.0|Rod Serling had a hand in this 1981 screenplay, (based on a Morris West novel), but even he couldn't solve the problem of turning a literary thriller into a cinematic one. Franco Nero, a Colonel in the Counter Intelligence Service, investigates a murder linked to a plot for a fascist take-over of the Italian government, but his investigation largely proves to be a series of one-on-one interviews which provide tedium rather than tension, and rather than engineering a bang-up climax, he disappointingly concludes his investigation by simply showing a home movie to a roomful of suspects. On the plus side are the attractive Italian locations and a solid cast which also includes Anthony Quinn, Martin Balsam, Christopher Lee, Eli Wallach, and Claudia Cardinale. There's also a scene in which a sweaty Nero is tortured while strapped to a chair and stripped to a jockstrap. At age 38, Nero still has the physique for this blatant bit of \\"beefcake bondage\\" but his torture -- involving nothing more than a hypodermic needle -- is, like the rest of the movie, surprisingly tame. Indeed, the average fraternity initiation would display a more imaginative infliction of pain.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Okay, I know that many will cry foul at the obvious 'rip-offs' committed by the writer, but that doesn't stop it from being a great movie.  The actors are very believable and the action sequences at the end are really good for the budget they had (believe it or not, there was NO wire-work used in this movie.)  It starts slow, so stick with it, because the ending is amazing.
B0007XT87G|5.0|this is truly a stunning piece of work...i find every track to <br />be equally good..i own all of PT's albums and  have to say i  <br />think this is their best...i heard them play Shallow at a  <br />show two years ago,and hoped it would be on their next album.. <br />well, i got what i wished for..definitely their heaviest song <br />yet..this album takes different directions and i like the variety..Lazarus is one of the most beautiful songs ever <br />written...can PT ever go wrong?........
B00008K9Z5|5.0|I can go on and write a page about how good this album is , but Im not. Listening to this album is not like listening to an average album , its an experience. As a person who was a fan of Hybrid Theory when it first came out , and still consider it my favourite album of all time ,my expectations for there next album was very high , and boy did they ever deliver. From heavy songs such as &quot;Don't stay&quot; and &quot;Hit the floor&quot; to softer songs such as &quot;Easier to run&quot; and &quot;Breaking the habit, listening to this album will take you on a emotional rollercoaster.<br />   I listen to tons of metal (Manson , Korn , Deftones) but no one's music gets to me like Linkin Park does. Once you start to appreciate Linkin Park for what they are (Shinoda's lyrics , Chester's vocals , melody's and small distorted noises in the background) you will probably become a fan for life , like millions of people on this earth have already become.
B00000FZ1V|5.0|Ah. The paranormal. Just when you think its safe to write such things off for good, along comes a movie that will make you laugh at them. <br /> <br />Drs. Peter Venkman (Bill Murray), Raymond Stantz (Dan Aykroyd), and Egon Spengler (Harold Ramis) work for the parapsychology department at Columbia University in New York. While Dr. Venkman doesn't really believe in the paranormal (he's really only in it for the chicks), the other two do. And just when the three do find proof that ghosts exist, the University revokes their funding and kicks the three off the campus. <br /> <br />Not to be held back, the three open their own business and call it, what else, Ghostbusters. Although business is slow at first, soon the three are up to their knees in ghosts. And before long, our ghostbusters are not only fighting ghosts, but also the EPA. <br /> <br />\\"Ghostbusters\\" was an immediate hit when released in the summer of 1984. It eventually went on to gross over $220 million and land at #7 on the all-time box office charts (at the time of this review, it is currently ranked at #40 with over $230 million). In addition, the movie has gone on to gross over $112 million in movie rentals. <br /> <br />There are many reasons why this movie has become a cult favorite with its fans. Some of the funniest lines in the movie were not written, but actually ad-libbed during filming. This is a testament to the comedic genius of Murray, Aykroyd, and Ramis. The Oscar Nominated song \\"Ghostbuster\\" by Ray Parker, Jr., is still one of the best movie songs of all time. In addition, there is the always eating, green ghost who slimed his past Dr. Venkman and into our televisions sets as Slimer in the 1988 animated cartoon series of the same name. And who can forget the giant Stay Puff Marshmallow Man? Not before or since has there been a movie monster as great as this guy. <br /> <br />The DVD carries the standard extras that have become common over the years. What's missing are some of the outtakesthat had to have happen during filming. There is no way you can convince me that these three comedians didn't find ways to crack themselves and each other up. <br /> <br />The best extra on this DVD is the commentary by Ivan Reitman, Harold Ramis, and one other person (sorry, I forget who). You have a choice of either listening to the audio commentary during the film or watching the \\"video\\" commentary. This \\"video\\" commentary is a lot like the old \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\" series, in which you can see black silhouettes of our three commentators sitting in front of the movie talking about it. <br /> <br />If you have never seen this movie before, you should watch it at least once. Chances are that you will become a fan of it. <br />
B00004REBO|2.0|This movie is just plain icky.  Carol Burnett's character drinks constantly, is in her underwear most of the time, makes sexual advances to Daddy Warbucks, and does a burlesque dance with Bernadette Peters and Tim Curry.  It was embarrassing to watch with  12-year-olds.  I wouldn't show it to younger children.   <br /> <br />The story is good. The visit with F.D.R. is interesting.  Maybe the newer version made in 1999 is more appropriate for children.

B00003CXCT|5.0|You might think a debate about which was the better movie, The Godfather, or Star Wars, might be a little strange, but I was discussing it with a friend tonight, and came up with some perhaps off the wall comments, so I thought I'd post them here. Interestingly, one can find Star Wars on some movie website's top 100 films, although usually, such as on the AFI (American Film Institute) website, if there's a great sci-film in the top 100, it's usually 2001.<br /><br />Although many people might not put the original Star Wars movies up there with the Godfather as films, they were, although perhaps not great flicks in the sense that they had great acting, a great plot, a great script and dialog and other traditional film values, still, they were a lot of fun and the special effects were terrific. If I want great acting, plots, and writing I can always rent Citizen Kane, Bad Day at Black Rock, Mutiny on the Bounty, The Shawshank Redemption, The Godfather, etc.<br /><br />Most film historians would probably say 2001 is a greater sci-fi film, but it's a very different movie from Star Wars in that it's almost as much a mood piece as a sci-fi flick, and really gets by on the superb direction and vision of Kubrick, not because the plot or script or acting is that great. In fact, unless you read the original book, the ending is completely nonsensical (the whole Starchild thing is nonsensical anyway although I like Clarke).<br /><br />And as for the Godfather movies, it seems to me that all you had to do to make an impression in this movie was have an appropriately Mafioso-esque mug and demeanor (meaning that you look like you're going to kill the next guy who cuts ahead of you in line all the time) and go around with a beetled brow and a sedulous but crazed look in your eyes, occasionally shooting people in restaurants or in bars and such, and apparently that counts for great acting and atmosphere. No doubt there was some great acting in the movie by the admittedly notable cast, but sometimes the movie's reputation seemed to be as much the result of the shock effect of some of the more grisly violence scenes (such as the horse's head one) as anything else. In other words, lots of gatuitious sex, drugs, and violence in a movie for me doesn't automatically equate to great film-making, which is what seems to sell these days.<br /><br />Well, clearly I'm being a little facetious here. But also the question is a legitimate one, which is how one really objectively evaluates the aesthetic and dramatic qualities of films that are so different in one sense, and yet so much alike in another (all films basically simply being more visually dramatic presentations of your typical printed story). I don't pretend to know the answer to this question myself, except to say that what makes both novels and films different is easy to say, because of the problems in translating the book into a film, but what makes them truly great enough to stand out from the herd isn't always that easy to distinguish or to articulate.<br /><br />That having been said, I'm a great fan of the whole Star Wars trilogy and whether they are truly great movies or not doesn't really matter that much to me. Besides, people get snobbish about movies the same way they do about wines and such, and I think a movie should first and foremost be entertaining rather an attempt to create \\"great art,\\"--whatever that might be--and the whole Star Wars trilogy had more of that as far as I'm concerned than ten of the greatest \\"art\\" flicks.ie's reputation seemed to be as much the result of the shock effect of some of the more grisly violence scenes (such as the horse's head one) as anything else.

B00011D1RC|4.0|Lets face it, \\"Grand Hotel\\" is essentially a soap opera, albeit an entertaining one, with ornate trappings.  What distinguishes this film from the mundane is it's incredible cast(Greta Garbo, John Barrymore, Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford, Wallace Beery) who breathe life into otherwise ordinary material.  I would recommend this film to anyone who want to see these screen legends in an ensemble setting.  That said, a better film of this type is \\"Dinner at Eight\\".  Not only does that film include the Barrymores and Beery but also a simply dazzling Jean Harlowe performance.

B00005K3NR|5.0|In 1974, Stephen King wrote a novel called \\"Carrie\\".  At the time, he hadn't been known, he was struggling financially, and he was an English teacher earning next to nothing.  He wrote the first few pages to Carrie and immediately threw them in the trash, thinking it was terrible.  His wife came by, pulled the pages out of the trash and urged him to continue.  She thought it was good, and after King finally finished the novel, he was willing to admit he liked it too.<br /><br />King ended up earning as much as Mario Puzo did for \\"The Godfather\\" in advancement pay for the book, and Carrie launched his career.  Two years after Carrie ran away with selling over three million copies, Brian DePalma adapted it into a film.  Today it's known as a horror movie classic!  And since it's movie debut in 1976, nearly every story Stephen King writes gets adapted into film!<br /><br />Carrie is your classic story about a misunderstood girl.  She's trapped by her over-christian mother, who never lets her do anything, and is picked on constantly.<br /><br />One fine day at school, Carrie experiences her first period, and several students throwing sanity napkins at her screaming \\"Plug it up!\\"  Carrie, helpless because she's never had her period before, slumps in the corner in shame.  She goes home to her extreme christian mother, and her mother thinks she must've sinned.<br /><br />As Carrie goes on, taking torture from other students, there's one out there that feels sorry for her.  Her name is Sue Snell, and she manages to convince her boyfriend to take Carrie to the prom.<br /><br />Of course, Carrie's mother doesn't approve of it.  And as Carrie begins to find her own independence, she also begins to discover her unique ability to move things with her mind.  The power of Telekinesis.<br /><br />Chris, a girl who has nothing better to do than torture Carrie, gets suspended for the stunt of throwing sanity napkins and tampons at Carrie, decides to get even with her.  She gets her boyfriend, and they go and get some pigs blood.<br /><br />During prom, Carrie and Sue's boyfriend, Tommy, are elected Prom King and Queen, and that's when Chris pulls her stunt that will soon bring about the death of nearly everyone at the prom.<br /><br />When Carrie finally gets the pigs blood dumped on her, she snaps and takes her revenge!  Of it's time (and even today) the scene is still amazing to look at.  Even though they left out one of the best lines in the book (\\"Pigs blood for the pig!\\") they did manage to portray the destruction caused at prom.<br /><br />The movie only shows the Prom massacre, but in the book, the whole town felt the rage of Carrie!  Luckily, this part isn't thrown into the movie as it is too much for some to handle.<br /><br />While it doesn't look nearly as good as it did twenty years ago, it's still an amazing film to watch.  The first Stephen King adaptation, turns out to be one of the better ones.  Later adaptations as memorbale as Carrie (\\"Misery\\" \\"Stand By Me\\" and \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" to name a few) came a little too few and far between, but Carrie in itself was a treat.<br /><br />To this day, the acting is still memorable, and the scene that made Carrie a popular film (the last scene) is still perfect.  If you enjoy Stephen King, Carrie is the perfect example of what an adaptation should be.  It's not exactly like the book, but it still keeps the basic idea.  THAT'S what a movie adaptation should be.<br /><br />It certainly doesn't live up to horror standards today.  By that I mean, it really isn't scary at all. Horror movies even today aren't scary.  But you'll love this movie.  Any Stephen King fan owes it to himself/herself to see this film.her.

B000035P7X|5.0|This is probably a more true and revealing portrait of the world's greatest songwriter than any interview with Ed Bradley on Sixty Minutes could ever be.  We see Dylan in his youth which seems an impossible eternity ago and he is already, by the time the film starts rolling, a massive phenom.  The British press are tertiary characters in his life and they appear as both foils and fans.<br /><br />The one thing that I would say most describes this documentary is the word \\"alive.\\"  It is a living, breathing document of what life was like for St. Dylan before he went electric and alienated all of the folkies.  The black and white is artful and adds to Don't Look Back's importance.<br /><br />We see Dylan as a boy and as a man.  He labors over his lyrics while smoking and drinking the nights away with his friends.  I had a good laugh when they showed the girls screaming over his presence.  It's humorous to think of Bob as a sex symbol.  He is accompanied by a giggling Donovan along with playful band mates and a hyper-vocalizing Joan Baez.  Keep an eye on the left of your screen during the introduction and you'll see a distant Allen Ginsberg conversing to someone off-screen during Bob's card flopping \\"Subterrean Homesick Blues.\\"<br /><br />This movie is fresh after nearly forty years.  I'm glad Pennebaker was there to record our hero in his glory.
0060958324|5.0|The reader is led through three stories narrated in first person, each complementary, and all three integral to the success of the book. Firstly, there is a father-son motorcycle vacation with all its problems, solutions and in this case poignant analogies. Secondly, the narrator presents the history of his mental conflict caused by losing himself so deeply in the evolution of an idea, and finally he gives an analysis of the concept of quality and its place in the history of philosophy. This book's brilliance for me is not in the offering of a solution to the multitude of questions that confound so many, but in its well formulated questions and descriptions of situations that the reader is left to contemplate. As an engineer I find that it is often the process of defining the question or situation correctly that creates an understanding that finally leads to appropriate answers. A must read for anybody with an interest in philosophy or the struggle for compromise between art and science.

B000002U9Y|3.0|The second and last album with Syd Barrett. In fact most guitars are by David Gilmour. Very mystical and somewhat heavy and draining. <br /> <br />1.Let There Be More Light- <br />About one and a half minutes is an instrumental opening. The singing and music is really cool. If you listen closely you can hear double tracked vocals whispering the lyrics on the verses. The drums are neat too. <br /> <br />2.Remember A Day- <br />A Rick Wright song and frankly not that good. This song (like most of the album) has no conventional drumming, just fills. All of Rick Wright's songs (if you listen closely too) are all about memories of yesterday and one-night-stands. <br /> <br />3.Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun- <br />Extremely psycadellic and ethereal. The combo og organ, tympani, vibraphone, gongs, and seagull sounds is amazing. The live versions of this song are always better. <br /> <br />4.Corporal Clegg- <br />An experimental sounding song in which the guitars sound straight from Alice Cooper. A story about a war veteran with disturbing habbitts and flashbacks. A very interesting fact is that if you mute the right and left channels at certain points you can make the song instrumental. <br /> <br />5.A Saucerful Of Secrets- <br />A.Something Else- <br />A long climax to one gong note. Mostly just howling and organs. <br />B.Syncopated Pandemonium- <br />The best drumming Nick Mason's ever done. Simply a duet between thundering drums and a clanging and dramatic piano. <br />C.Strom Signal- <br />A short organ solo. More of just a prelude. <br />D.Celestial Voices- <br />The BEST song I've ever heard. The only instuments are an organ, bass, and synthesizer. A chorus backs it up and creates the most dreamy and glorious feeling no drugs can produce. The Ummagumma version is better. <br /> <br />6.See Saw- <br />The worst Floyd song next to Paintbox. Another song with a copule different temp changes. To me it's nothing but an insult to the song before it. <br /> <br />7.Jugband Blues- <br />A very cool song. In a way it's Barrett'last stand. The marching band who appears on this song must have changed their name after fans and critics bashed this song.
B00004TH7Z|3.0|This CD was a bit of a dissapointment for me. My first two Iron Maiden albums were undisputed classics. \\"Killers\\" and \\"Somewhere in Time\\" set a very harsh standard for this band to live up to - and since 7th Son on they've actually being quite dissapointing.  I've like single songs off each album but I haven't liked the albums as a whole. This album is no different. <br /> <br />\\"Brave New World\\" is an OBVIOUS improvement over past records such as the \\"X Factor\\" and \\"Virtual XI\\" it's really no better than something like \\"Fear of the Dark\\".  All hype aside this is a decent record with some strong highlights. \\"The Fallen Angel\\" and \\"Ghost of the Navigator\\" being the most wothy additions to the Maiden catalog.  Really, this is just an ok - if overlong CD that plays well and fades on repeated listens. <br /> <br />It's Iron Maiden. It's got five or so killer tracks. It's worth the buy.  Just don't think it's going to make a huge impact in the long run or fix Maidens slipping fortunes both in sales and creativity.
B0000B3B95|5.0|That quote could very well be The Hulk's motto, for no matter what is levelled against him, he grows stronger with increasing rage. The Hulk is another Marvel character I have enjoyed since peering into the pages of comic book legendry and watching the series with Lou Ferrigno {who also briefly appears herein}, and I must say that this film does him justice. in My opinion. Ironically, Dr. Bruce Banner just wants to be left alone, yet antagonists repeatedly attempt to get a rise out of him, to their horror.<br /><br />The Hulk/Bruce Banner dichotomy definitely exemplifies the were-creature of The Id, at odds with himself, instead of accepting and controlling his own darkside, which in the comics, he eventually does accomplish. We also see this symbology in the characters of Dr. Jeckyl & Mr. Hyde, and of course, The Werewolf. If these emotions are seen as natural proclivities, balance is attained, thus expressing them in constructive ways.<br /><br />The CGI kinematics are very well done, flowing gracefully and believably - yet the question remains, how does The Hulk acquire those purple pants? At no time does Banner wear purple pants, yet they appear mysteriously every time. But I digress. The Hulk presented here is an absolutely inhumanly large creature, sometimes growing to about 12\\" tall, his massive frame supplemented as his adrenaline increases.<br /><br />I thought one of the most impressive scenes was during the mutant dog battle, as he heroically saves his love interest Betty from their fearsome jaws, and the desert sequences when he jumps miles across land, and in San Francisco - the savage beast is quelled by the gentle hands of the lovely girl, whose father is a general persuing him relentlessly through desert and urban environments, using everything from tanks to fighter planes, which The Hulk tosses about like toys.<br /><br />Banner's father appears as an unassuming janitor working at the lab, released after years of government captivity, with a chip on his shoulder, and is intent on gaining revenge for his incarceration. His opportunity arrives when he uses the solution combined with Gamma Radiation to acquire his own powers of melding with whatever object he touches, and absorbing energy, which proves to be just too much for him when he and The Hulk lock together during the final battle scene.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Banner must seclude himself from his beloved Betty for her safety, and dissappears into the world, but a force such as this cannot be contained forever, manifesting when angered again.gaining revenge for his incarceration.

0553583182|5.0|A friend lent me this book because of he said it helped him. This book uses a lot of great stories, anaologies & some bible lines. I'm not of any religious demonination so I just go past those bible passages which are very few.<br /><br />This book is great in how it uses a lot of scientific studies & pyschology to help makes it's point. It only uses religion & the golden rules to say that that has been known for centuries. He even quotes many well known sucessful people such as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Thomas Edison & even Marcus Aurelius.  It's not written with just fluff. The book is easy to read & not pompous in any way. It also never puts you down for any bad habits or thinking.<br /><br />The only time he seems to slip when he advises you how to deal with people who enjoy misery or use manipulation to force people through guilt, fear, etc. to do their desires.  He seems to disain those people. At least he has good advice to use love & never to allow them to \\"get\\" to you. He knows hate does not conquer hate/fear, only love is your own recourse. You don't have to even like someone or to be their friend or be forced to have them in your life to purely love people & wish them well & happiness. That alone will help you to be serene, calm & have a better perspective in life. He knows when you hate someone for whatever reason, they WILL know you do subconsciously & will subconsiously hate you back. This can be a great hindrence especially if it's a boss. You must get over it & not hate them & try to see the best in them. You don't have to want to be their friend, but just keep their good attributes in your mind & wish them happiness in life. There is no evil in anyone, there is only hurt, fear, grief, feeling neglected & depression that makes people lash out. No one is above those feelings sometime in their life.
B0002KVUKW|3.0|Into the macabre world of classic horror monsters brought back to life in this quaint film, where, not since Mad Monster Party, the three primary icons in Dracula, the Wolfman, and Frankentein's Monster reunite - here to do battle in a rather ingenious plot wherein Dracula desires to bring his progeny life, but needs Frankenstein to complete the experiment.<br /><br />In the beginning, Mr. Hyde makes an impressive cameo appearence, although this seemed a bit unecessary, and could have been saved for a subsequent film, along with perhaps The Mummy - even with the other monsters for that metter. Unfortunatey, the characters in this depiction are rather one-dimensional, and the scenes move by much too quickly - the overall impression of this presentation seems more like an action-adventure fight movie, rather than a horror film, so the true fear element is absent here, but is fun nonetheless.<br /><br />I enjoyed the impressive aesthetics of The Wolfman, done to perfection in My opinion, although Count Dracula could have been better cast, but the brides are exquisite in their beauty and ferocity.  I thought it adorable when the \\"draclings\\" were released from their cocoons, flying down to feed upon the villagers below. Frankenstein is a tormented creature here, inspiring pathos in his apparent selfless nature and terrible desolation.<br /><br />Van Helsing himself is presented in a more contemporary manner, wielding remarkable weaponry, particularly the rotary crossbow and the shiroken-like blades. He is commissioned by The Vatican to purge these 'evils' from the world, and during his travel to Transylvania, meets with a gorgeous brunette warrior-princess, who joins him in his quest, whose brother just happens to be the wolfman. Eventually, Van Helsing is infected by The Werewolf curse, that proves to be a key ingredient in his battle with the demonic Dracula. I did like that idea - that The Count tranforms into a magnificent Vampire-Demon  - a decided improvement on his humanoid counterpart.<br /><br />CGI effects abound here {sometimes too much}, the soundtrack is pretty good, and the credits are actually quite creative as well.t on his humanoid counterpart. <br /> <br />CGI effects abound here {sometimes too much}, the soundtrack is pretty good, and the credits are actually quite creative as well.

B00005JMXX|2.0|I like Dennis Quaid. I like sentimental movies. And I even like Dennis Quaid in sentimental movies, witness my love affair with The Rookie (2002). So when I say I could have lived without seeing The Day After Tomorrow, it's not just Quaid-bashing or too-hip-to-watch-a-tear-jerker posing. <br /> <br />Yes, the special effects were something in this film's corner, but the preachiness about global warming, the far-fetched plot, and the over-the-top acting by virtually every character left me cold (sorry about that one). <br /> <br />Seriously, though, had I paid full price to see this one in the theatre I'd have been peeved.

It's about people trying to destroy nature for their own benefit and others fighting against it. It's a struggle that goes on in the real world, and Miyazaki really knew how to portray that struggle. <br /> <br />This movie is so wonderful and breathtaking that immediately after I finished watching it I just wanted to see it again! It's perfectly animated and all around WONDERFUL. This is a must for any anime collection, along with other Miyazaki movies. He is a wonderful anime artist!

This record is the best of the best.  If you want a concept album, this is the creme de la creme.  If you just want great rock, David Gilmour plays some of the most emotional and respectable guitar solos ever.  This album IS WITHOUT DOUBT THE BEST EVER.  Of course I am a huge floyd fan and I love all their records from Piper to Division Bell, but even if you don't like Floyd, pick this up right now, it might just change your life.
B00003CX5P|3.0|The original films were mostly remembered for their great special effects (for their point in time) and cheesy acting. This newer version, while having great special effects, is extremely long. This 1999 blockbluster, i think, was only successful because of its name and the reputation the Star Wars series has. This movies acting is way too good for the Star Wars series and doesn't have the great comedy like the older movies. Overall, not bad, but not very good aswell.
0060763280|2.0|I bought the book for $12 and read it. It had some ideas I could use in my life. However, it was the seminar that annoyed me. The last chapter of the book is about educating yourself at seminars. Big surprise! I actually flew to Atlanta in April 2005 for the seminar because I couldn't attend the ones in NY and NJ. I left after the first morning session and spent the rest of the weekend hanging out in Atlanta (the CNN Tour was good). They have you High Fiving each other and dancing around the room like an Anthony Robbins seminar with fire walking. Sheesh! I even peeked my head in two days later and they were STILL dancing around (they would've drank poisoned Kool-Aid by that point). They also tell you to bring a $100 bill and a blank check. Judging from the back of the table sales I guess it was to prime people to spend. EACH seminar runs $4,000! I was very disappointed with the \\"free\\" seminar that cost me $500 because I had to fly to it and get a hotel room at the Sheraton. Definitely an overhyped book to get you into the preview seminar to shell out thousands of dollars.
B00005JNBQ|3.0|What a bizarre treat! The characters are absurdly humorous. Peel away the deadpan nature of the main characters (and the smugness of the \\"in-crowd), and you'll find the emotional vulnerability that every teen (and adult) feels.  Napoleon's skit is priceless. It's an unexpected treat. Also make sure to watch the finale AFTER the credits run.
B00005JLEU|5.0|\\"Spirited Away\\" is nothing short of a modern classic in a time when new true classics are hard to come by. It's very inspiring and ambitious, while being beautiful and touching at the same time. The movie centers around a little girl who has been forced to work in a bathhouse that serves spirits in order to save her parents from their awful fate that has been brought upon them. However, she makes plenty of new friends along the way, and these supporting characters are just as intriguing as the main character herself. Add upon this the beautiful score and theme song and you have a movie destined to last. The story takes many twists and turns, but it shouldn't be too hard to follow for most people.  <br /> <br />As for the special features on the DVD, they really give a fantastic insight into how much labor it required to produce this movie. The \\"Making Of\\" documentary is very satisfying and leaves very few aspects about the making of the movie untouched. The \\"Behind the Microphone\\" extra introduces you to the voice actors that took part in the English-translated version of the film, and \\"The Art of Spirited Away\\" displays the effort that was put forth in producing this movie for an American audience. There's also a feature where you can take a peak at the storyboards for the first scene of the film while the audio track plays underneath. The only feature that's not particularly worthwhile are the Japanese trailers. Admittingly, some of these are very very good. However, some are just too similar to each other and it becomes very tedious to watch these for 30 minutes straight. In any case, the special features are very informative and accomplish their task in giving insight to the making of the film.  <br /> <br />This movie is not just for kids, but I'd recommend this to families who might be looking for a new movie that they could watch together.
B0002WZTOI|2.0|Kelly McGillis was boring, which actually shouldn't be a complaint for she blended in with all the other boring elements in this film.<br /><br />Most of the shots centered around jets, which yes could have been cool if the stunts wheren't impressive, and the dialogue weak at best.<br /><br />The romance between Cruise and McGillis felt more like a boy having a crush on his 9th grade teacher. Yes, that's right, it was the dryest romance scenes I've ever witnessed. Example: Kelly gets mad at Cruise and he races off on his bike. She races after him in her car, defying (Or not) death by car crash and eventually Cruise pulls over. Don't ask why he felt the sudden need to pull over for absolutely no reason, for he was suprised to see his 'lover' there yelling at him. He tells her that he doesn't want her being so foolish, and she yells back at him. Thats probally the exent of romance in this flick. Boring.<br /><br />Plus, by the end of the movie we've had so much testotrine intergrated throughout the movie that its a wonder the men managed to keep the jets safe with all the needless stunts they tried to impress us with.<br /><br />In ending, this movie was a waste of time and film. Too bad Cruise couldn't have broken into the industry in a more interesting movie.
B00000D9TK|5.0|Out of my three Celine French albums, this is the best one I own. It's hard to pick a favorite song here, but ones that stand out for me are: On nes changes pas, L'abandon, Papillon, and the title track itself. Celine gives a range of her abilities on this album, from slow songs such as Papillon, to more upbeat songs like Dans un autre monde. The only song I really don't listen to on this album is number 11, where Celine sings blues. It doesn't matter though because 11 out of the 12 songs are absolutely wonderful. You do not have to know a word of French to appreciate this album.
B00003CXXP|5.0|A.I is a wonderfully, emotional movie about one boys journey through the world to find acceptance and what makes us who we are. The truth of the matter that the only real thing that makes human's what we are is the capability to love.<br /><br />Haley Joel Osment is exceptionally brilliant as the young Android that is given to a family as a replacement for their injured son until he gets better. But heaven only lasts so long for Osment, and soon he finds himself at the center of the family's son jealousy. He is sent away where he finds himself on the run for his life as he escapes from robot flesh festivals and those sent to capture or destroy him. All the while, Haley is trying to find away to become real so that his 'Mother' will love him like she did her real son.<br /><br />Jude Law is also spectacular in his own role as the pleasure giving Android who finds Haley and vows to help him find his way to the city at the edge of the world. Where the blue fairy can turn boys into humans and make his mother love him. What happens will leave you crying as the film unfolds for its a film of intense emotions and and one boy's desires to just be loved.<br /><br />Originally the film was to have ended with Haley stuck at the bottom of the ocean that flooded New York. Alone with Teddy, staring at the everlasting smiling blue Fairy, but Spielberg (My hero) stepped in and decided the ending was just to depressing. So it was changed, and I believe that it is ten times better than if it had just been left. Definatly more emotional, but better nevertheless.<br /><br />Humanity will never look the same again.
B00005JLWN|5.0|Just purely superb on every aspect (the plot, story line, characters, acting, the fighting scenes, choreography, etc). One of the best-produced action films I've seen in years.

B00003CXDG|3.0|This is a horrible sequal to the original Mission Impossible, and should never have been shot. Who would have thought that after Face/Off John woo could make such a film. There's too many circumstances in this film that make it to hard to believe. Cruise seems to carry around his disguises in his pocket, and his makeup kit in his packback. For instance, he kills a guy and manages to find a mask out of his backpack that looks exactly likes the dead guys face. Now how is that possible?<br /><br />Then his girlfriend, talk about infidility. But he always goes back to her, and it gets so bad that we wind up not knowing who the girl really loves. Cruise, or his nemesis. She sleeps with both, so I'm not sure.<br /><br />The first was good, the second was just really, really bad. Plus, they seemed to have forgotten the timid, rather shy attitudes of the man in the first. He really got egotistical and proud in the second. A prime example of letting things go to your head.<br /><br />Altogehter,  the first was good, the second, I leave to your decision.
B0002ZDVFE|5.0|I had to watch this film a few times to appreciate it more. It wasn't just an action flick but it had some inteligence in the plot. It was logical and well thought ought. That's what made this flick good. The only drawback that I saw was the car chase scenes which it gets repititive and old pretty fast.     The music along with the moods of the scenes had just the right tempo to them. The Bourne theme had a nice sound in which it help exemplify the character further. Ohhh, the guns and the high powered rifles with scopes are cooool indeed.     It was four star movie but, with a surprise ending in which humanizes Bourne along with Miss Neski made this movie into a five star. I had no problem wth the cinematography. I hope the next movie will be just as good.

And after<br /><br />John Cusack makes a committment to marry his girlfriend he spoils his wedding just to again run after some girl who was stupid enough to make him run in circles to please her silly fancies. The first time I watched this movie I shut it off even before it had begun, then felt bad and then tried to finish it. Bad Idea. Its an irritating movie about romance gone absolutely bonkers. Don't waste your money even to rent this unless you are a die-hard romance fan.<br /><br />AAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGGGGG.
B000005PRX|5.0|If you follow my reviews, you know that I like Batman for the most part. (Be it Adam West, Michael Keaton, or Kevin Conroy.) Of the 4 live Batman movies, this is probably the best one. If Tim Burton's style was really good in \\"Batman Part 1,\\" it was fine tuned and brought to a new level in this sequel. In this second chapter, the atmosphere is dark, dramatic, and gothic, but it also is plausible enough. The Christmas season only adds to the power and intensity of this piece. Keaton is a little more dark and serious this time around (even as Bruce Wayne), but there is an acceptable amount of his loose and easy going side present. Gough is still in fine form as the loyal and trust worthy Alfred. The movie alternates between fast action, emotional intensity, and some well placed comic relief, but the movie is NEVER boring. Onto the villains. One great thing about this movie is that all three of the villains have an interesting similarity to Bruce Wayne // Batman. The Penguin had a traumatic moment as a child that separated him from his parents; Max has at least a seemingly legitimate role as a business man; and Seleen Kyle has to absorb too much frustration which can only release itself in her other identity. That said, each of the three villains bring an interesting contribution to the piece. Despite the crimes of the Penguin and Catwoman, we are allowed at least some sympathy for them. And through either clever script writing, or Christopher Walken's ways, we are allowed to like him despite his crimes. Another thing Burton does very well is that these 3 villains (rather than just forming an alliance against Batman) have interesting ways of crossing the path of the others, forming temporary alliances, and ofcourse having the eventual falling outs. One mistake from Part one, that Burton more than corrects in part 2, is the climax. Batman ofcourse is present, but this time he has 3 villains to contend with. (Another charming bonus is that by this point, the villains are not exactly united in harmony with each other and against Batman.) Without ruining the movie, the less than happy ending seems to fit better than the happier endings on the other 3 movies. If you like Batman, you really must have this movie. My only complaint is that Devito doesn't make the Penguin as charming, sophisticated, or intelligent as Paul Williams would eventually do. But in Devito's defense, it probably is not right to compare him to the later Penguin that Paul Williams would play in the animated series.not exactly united in harmony with each other and against Batman.)

B00005JL78|5.0|This is definatly one of Cruise' best and my favorite of Spielberg's after A.I. Minority Report is snappy, fun and intriguing as Cruise fights to break the rules and find the murderer of his son, and the man who he is supposed to kill.<br /><br />I say supposed, for Cruise is chief of Police, and Collaberater on a project called PreCrime.<br /><br />PreCrime in short is supposed to find and stop crimes before they've happened all due to the pheoninimal powers given to three people called the precogs. The Precogs dream of the crimes which is wired into a computer that allows Cruise to view and find the murders. Capture and imprison them.<br /><br />The only problem is that there is a minority report, being that some preplanned crimes where simply that. Preplanned but without going to really be enacted. Cruise finds this out when he himself is accused of a murder, sending this chief of police on a wild run to escape. Even more intense as Colin Farrell arrives as the FBI agent sent to take over the operations. And who goes after Cruise, even more deadset on capturing then the cops as he believes Precrime is bogus and wrong.<br /><br />So there's the basic formula to this movie, but what a movie it is. Think of it as Catch me if you can in a space age world, hectic and intrancing.<br /><br />Spielberg is a genus, and he weaves and tells this story like the best of them. So sit back and enjoy, and let the master take you away into his world.....
B000006FYP|3.0|When Tim Burton gave up control of Batman, things would go downhill.(I know I'm not the first person to say this.) While Tim Burton makes his scenery dramatic, gothic, and chilling, he still leaves enough of reality and plausible aspects. While Tim Burton's directing carries a somber dignity, this guy Schumacher created a VERY GARRISH COMMERCIAL! The neonish scenery is flat out annoying. The batmobile is so fake it's laughable. (Now compare this to the 1966 Batmobile where they were careful to build the bat features into the car in a subtle but distinctive way as opposed to just taking a car and slapping a batface on it.) Rather than the majestical background music that Tim Burton offered, the soundtrack sounds like a commercial for certain groups. In short, the directing is sickening. What saves the laughable directing is some good acting. Val Kilmer is second best to Michael Keaton, but second best isn't always so bad. And he does convincingly make Batman a figure of sorrow more than anything else. Gough is still in good shape as the wise and reliable Alfred. O'Donnell is more of an angry Robin than Burt Ward or Lorene Lester (animated series), but then, this is when they have first met under tragic circumstances. It was nice of Chris O'Donnell to give a small tribute to Burt Ward: 'Holy rusted meatle Batman!' Tommy Lee Jones is acceptable as Two Face. (Even in the excellent animated series, this was not the most developed character, so Tommy probably did the best that could have been expected.) Jim Carey kind of steals the story as the Riddler. While he may seem loud and annoying at times,(compared to the revenge driven, but calm and intelligent Riddler from the animated series), we should remember that this is the way Frank Gorshin portrayed him in the 60s series. Kidman is fine as the woman with intelligence who crosses the path of Bruce Wayne // Batman. I can't quite call this Batman movie a 'must have.' But if you are willing to put up with horrible scenery and poor directing, for the sake of some pretty good acting, then this third chapter of Batman is acceptable.nd poor directing, for the sake of some pretty good acting, then this third chapter of Batman is acceptable.
B000000WF0|5.0|Along with Oasis and Blur, The Verve were one of the biggest British rock bands of the late Nineties. Unlike the other two, though, The Verve achieved this status from just one album. After their debut album \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" and its follow-up, \\"A Northern Soul,\\" the future of The Verve was uncertain. Lead singer Richard Ashcroft retreated throughout 1996 and most of 1997 and the result was \\"Urban Hymns,\\" one of the most popular albums in Britain of the entire decade. This album was released in 1997 but sold the majority of its total sales throughout 1998. A staggering 2.48 million copies were sold in the UK alone and the album spent a total of 12 weeks at No.1, placing this album as the eighth best-seller of the decade, behind such other classics as Oasis' \\"(What's The Story) Morning Glory?\\" and Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill.\\"<br /><br />This album was fuelled by four massive hit singles which ruled radio and became anthems amongst a society emerging from Britpop. I bought this album about a year ago to try and build up my collection of albums from the Nineties. It took me quite a while to really enjoy this album because it runs for 75 minutes, and a lot of the songs are quite long, usually around the six minute mark. What this album achieves, though, is a total sound of its own. It's like you're travelling through a tropical rainforest in the middle of the night, exploring nature and realising the true beauty of life. Because of this, the album holds up very well eight years after its initial release.<br /><br />The album opens with the classic \\"Bittersweet Symphony.\\" This is by far the most popular song of the band's career, and with good reason. I mean come on, this song was written by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards. It's an absolute classic and one of the best uses of a string arrangement I've ever heard in my life. This is life-affirming, beautiful stuff. If rock music was heaven, then this is the soundtrack for sure. The video is also amazing and features Richard just walking down a London street not giving a s**t about what people think of him as he knocks people out of the way and stops for no one. \\"Sonnet\\" is another brilliant song and has a rather depressing tone. The mood of this song is expressed perfectly through Ashcroft's emotional vocals. I can't remember a video for this song, but I sure remember it being played to death on the radio. \\"The Rolling People\\" runs for more than seven minutes, which in itself gives the feeling of an epic song. It truly is a very bold and interesting rock song with heavy drums and a great guitar riff. Ashcroft's vocals are awash in a sea of pure rhythm, on definitely one of the album's best songs. \\"The Drugs Don't Work\\" is an amazing ballad and became the band's first UK No.1 single in September 1997. This song was released the week Princess Diana died, and totally connected with the whole nation. Such an emotional piece of songwriting.<br /><br />\\"Catching The Butterfly\\" is a great song which features a strange sound that reminds me of an old rotating wheel. Strangely, this is a very natural and organic song and has a very catchy melody. The arrangement of the verses is beautiful and the choruses are very impressive. \\"Neon Wilderness\\" is the song that, for me, best expresses my vision of walking through a tropical rainforest at the dead of night. The sounds that this song creates are very beautiful and relaxing; it's almost like tripping out on yourself when you hear this! A shame it only lasts for under three minutes though. \\"Space And Time\\" is a complete masterpiece! This is one of the album's best songs and runs for nearly six minutes. The guitar on this song is very calm and tranquil and the backing vocals harmonising is rather hippie-like. The chorus is amazing and very epic, making this one of those songs to listen to whenever you're feeling down. \\"Weeping Willow\\" is quite a good song but I wouldn't say it is a stand out on an album of other amazing songs.<br /><br />\\"Lucky Man\\" was one of the album's four singles and was a huge hit. This song is very dream-like and tranquil, with catchy verses and sing-along choruses. It's a song that celebrates the beauty of life and teaches that rock music from this particular decade doesn't ALL have to be suicidal. \\"One Day\\" is another one of my favourites from this album because it's so hopeful. Ashcroft has a beautiful voice in this song that echoes over the sparse guitars and vivid drums creating a vast, epic song. The chorus is a revelation and celebrates that wonder of life that is a prominent theme throughout the songs. \\"This Time\\" is probably the most upbeat song on the album and is a shock to the system after about an hour of dreamy, tranquil rock music. This is also one of the shortest songs on the album, which is a shame because it's a very catchy piece of pop rock. The chorus is very beautiful and will just take you back to Britain in the late Nineties going through many changes. \\"Velvet Morning\\" is seen by many to be one of the best sons on the album, but this isn't the case in my opinion! This is still a great song, don't get me wrong, but it doesn't impress me as much as some of the other songs did. The album closes with \\"Come On,\\" which is a very progressive rock song, build up as the seconds tick away. By the fifth minute, this is a load and bold monster of a song that Oasis would be proud of! There's also a two minute hidden track at the end of this album that sounds like a radio trying to get a reception. When it finally becomes clear it sounds like another version of Neon Wilderness, which is superb in my opinion.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />This album was one of the best of 1997, and while I favour Radiohead's \\"OK Computer\\" (from a few months prior) as the album which people remember the most out of the two, the impact of this album cannot be denied. People bought this in droves, and it wasn't just media hype; the hype is fully justified. Yes, some songs on this album are a bit too long and I think 15 minutes could have been cut from the overall length, but there's a reason why this album ranked inside the Top 20 of a recent nationwide poll by Channel 4 to find the Greatest Album Ever. That reason is based upon solid songwriting, strong music, great arrangements, bold sounds and beautiful vocals. Buy this now, it's essential in any rock lover's collection.<br /> <br />\\"Lucky Man\\" was one of the album's four singles and was a huge hit.

B0007GAERG|5.0|Lemme simply begin saying that i never been a real Mariah fan. Not that i was a Mariah hater or anything, but i didnt really took interest in her music. I did liked almost all of her singles, so i'm kinda confused now asking myself why i didnt buy any of her records...till now. I decided to buy the Emancipation of Mimi, after hearing her second single \\"We Belong Together\\".That song has a surprisingly fresh ballad element that just drew me to take Mariah for a spin on this record. \\"Its like that\\" didnt really do it for me....at first...now i really like it after hearing it on the album. <br />here's my review of the album: <br /> <br />Its like that (8/10) its a cool song and all, but its kinda \\"not a really surprise beat\\" kinda song...loved the lyrics and mariahs voice though. <br /> <br />We Belong Toghether (10/10) This song made me buy this album...u know the kinda song u just log in to MTV the whole day just to watch the video and hear the song...thats how good it is... <br /> <br />Shake it Off (8/10) i love the beat and mariahs flow in here.. <br /> <br />Mine again (8/10) this song has a 70's trumpet vibe in it...this is mariah showcasing her high pitched voice...love it! <br /> <br />Say something (7/10) ok, uhm, this song is so so, snoop dogg trying to sing is not exactly a fresh breath in the morning..he's trying though...this song has kind of a neptunes produced mid tempo song vibe. <br /> <br />Stay the night (9/10) WOOOW...this song is very good...i like the beat and mariahs voice truly captivates the essence of the song...i loved it when i first heard it..i love the chorus (buy the cd and u'll know what i'm talking about) <br /> <br />Get ur number (10/10) THIS SONG SHOULD B MARIAHS NEXT SINGLE!!!...this song is off the weezy fo sheezy....absolutely a club song with a very tasteful beat..Mariah is at his best with this song..i liked it better than \\"Its Like That\\"...JD sounds like Nelly in this song though <br /> <br />One and Only (10/10) this song makes me think of \\"Hope- Twista feat Faith Evans\\"...not the beat, but just the energy of the song....its the kind of song where u like listen to the whole album and just sitting there thinking of \\"when does this song finally come up?\\" <br /> <br />Circles (8/10)..classic song..nothing special, still cool <br /> <br />Your Girl (9/10)...kind of a mid tempo song, still cool & has a nice beat to it <br /> <br />I Wish You Know (9/10)..i love the \\"live concert vibe\\" in this song...another classic ballad  <br /> <br />To The Floor (8/10)..i love the song..also mid-tempo featuring Nelly..i dont like Nelly, but his voice in this song goes good with Mariahs..he sings in this song wich sounds kinda cool <br /> <br />Joy Ride (20/10)in case u'r \\"like huh?..what the heck?\\", yes, thats a 20 out of 10....I ABSOLUTELY LOOOOVEE THIS BALLAD.....MY FAVOURITE song on this album...words cant describe the emotion on this song..love Mariahs voice on this song..and i'm gonna quit reviewing this song cause words cant describe..u just have to buy it to listen to it.... <br /> <br />Fly Like A Bird (8/10) has a gospel/soul vibe to it....the chorus is good and mariahs voice is very good on this song. <br /> <br />All i can say is: Mariah u got a NEW FAN after this album..( i'm gonna check out \\"the greatest hits\\" album)
B0007GAERG|5.0|At first I was worried that this CD would flop but now that I've listened to it, I'm blown away.  Maraiah is definitely back, the voice has returned and she's as inventive as ever.  Each track has Mariah's personal touch on it as well as features greats today like Nelly and Snoop.  They add to the tracks, not take away.  Each song you can relate to and sing along with, whatever she did to prepare for this, she should do again!  I'm impressed, this is her best album since DayDream without a doubt.  Pick it up, at any price. You won't regret it.
6305280762|3.0|The year 1974 saw the emergence of the \\"Disaster Movie\\" hit the Silver Screen.  The two big \\"Disaster Movies\\" that were released were \\"Earthquake\\" and \\"The Towering Inferno\\".   In addition to both taking place in California, both had great success at the box office thanks to two of the great all-time cast ensembles ever.    One thing that was different about \\"The Towering Inferno\\" is that it was a long movie by even the standards of the 1970s.  This movie was 165 minutes.   While I am not against having a movie of this length, the sad thing is that this movie doesn't utilize an all-star cast to fill up this type of screen time.    Overall, directors John Guillermin and Irvin Allen succeed at creating an action-packed movie.  However there isn't the type of character or storyline development that one would expect from this type of movie.  Still overall, this movie has to rank as an all-time classic. <br /> <br />First the all-star cast.  And for 1974, this read like a Hollywood Who's Who.   Some of these were already legendary Hollywood names - while others were still to emerge as Hollywood names.   The cast includes: Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Faye Dunaway, Fred Astaire, Susan Blakely, Richard Chamberlain, Jennifer Jones, O.J. Simpson (yes \\"The Juice\\"), Robert Wagner, Susan Flannery, Gregory Sierra (i.e. \\"Julio\\" from \\"Sanford and Son\\"), Mike Lookinland (i.e. \\"Bobby Brady\\" from \\"The Brady Bunch\\"), singer Maureen McGovern, and Dabney Coleman. <br /> <br />The plot-line is revolves a 135 story Skyscraper that is fictionally the world's tallest building (the building is even superimposed on the San Francisco skyline and it does a decent job).     Because of poor wiring thanks to the Chief Engineer (Chamberlain), a fire breaks out and begins to spread.   This fire takes place the night of the opening party that is taking place on the top floor of the Skyscraper.   Much of the movie focuses around the rescue of people from the building - and the focus eventually turns to saving the guests who are at the party on the 135th floor. <br /> <br />One thing that is disappointing is the lack of development of several of the characters.   All of the seeds were there to develop the characters of the three main characters:    Fire Chief Michael O'Hallorhan (McQueen), Building Architect Doug Roberts (Newman), and Building Owner James Duncan (Holden).   Of these three characters, I think Holden's character as the building owner is developed the nicest.  James Duncan starts out as a character more or less interested in \\"saving face\\" the night of the party he is hosted (i.e. he tries to over-simplify what is happening with the fire).  As the movie develops, it is Duncan who takes a leadership role in coordinating the rescue efforts - and even says he will sacrifice himself as one of the last to be rescued.   Newman's character of Doug Roberts is more or less relegated to becoming a rescuing crusader throughout the movie - not leaving his character much time to develop.  McQueen's role as O'Hallorhan portrays him as a no-nonsense Fire Chief.  As the movie progresses, McQueen takes on more of an action role - thus also limiting his growth as a character. Although we see some real emotion from O'Hallorhan when he is told of what happened with the Scenic Elevator - if we saw more stuff like this, McQueen's character would have really been strong.    <br /> <br />Many of the other characters don't make the use of their talents.    Faye Dunaway and Fred Astaire's roles are nice in the movie - but I don't think they ultimately contribute to the movie's end product.   Even Lookinland - while playing on of the two children involved in being trapped in the building, doesn't really grow into more of a \\"child hero\\" like I would expect.   Perhaps the best role of the minor characters is of Richard Chamberlain.   He is the closest thing to the movie's villain.  His selfishness as the rescue efforts continue are done very well.    Finally, a note on O.J. Simpson - what a lousy security guard he is!  Basically all he does is rescue a cat. <br /> <br />By today's standards, I'm not sure how well a storyline like this would play out.  For starters, there is no mention of anything called automatic sprinklers in this movie.   You can also see that fire codes - while important, aren't really a big deal back then.   When Duncan wants to basically ignore the Fire Department's order to evacuate - you wonder: \\"could they really do that back then??\\"   <br /> <br />You'll see some great special effects in this movie.   The pyrotechnics of this movie are outstanding - the fire and explosions seem genuine throughout the movie.   The scenes will the helicopter and scenic elevator are legendary - in addition to having great special effects, you will see some of the film's most exciting sequences.   I thought the scene when Roberts and the 2 children getting trapped in the stairwell was way too long - somehow I think that time could have been used better. <br /> <br />There is somewhat of an interesting angle in this movie.  At the end of the movie, O'Hallorhan discusses how they were lucky that on the number of casualties for such a disaster.  He mentions, \\"One of these Days - they're gonna kill 10,000\\" (referring to unsafe building codes).   27 years later - although not Arson or bad construction practices, we would see the World Trade Center disaster.   I also thought O'Hallorhan's offer to \\"work\\" with Roberts on the good fire safety practices is an interesting twist. <br /> <br />Overall, this was a good movie.   I probably rate it somewhere between 3 and 4 stars.  As mentioned I do think that much could have been done to develop the storyline and characters - and still preserve the integrity of this movie.  If this movie were ever to be remade today, I'm sure there would have to be some major changes to the storyline just to adapt it to today's society.   Still I'd check this movie out.
B00028HBKM|1.0|I was so disappointed with this film.  I can't believe so many people were fans of this movie.  Let's argue logcially here.  Reviews of this film should not be based on whether the reviewer is religious or not.  Reviews should focus on this particular film and what kind of a job it does (or doesn't do) in conveying a message.  So, we all get the message loud and clear that Jesus died a brutal death.  They could have summed this up in 5 or 10 minutes (instead of 127 minutes), then focused on what was behind the death and what might have been learned afterwards.  This was a pathetic attempt, with no apparent message behind the carnage.  Is this really what our public craves now: mindless violence?  Do we not have any interest in exploring and debating such brutality?  Why not challenge the audience to question history and question themselves in how they react to these powerful images?  There was nothing to think about or discuss after this film.  Doesn't this seem short sighted with such an important topic?  Doesn't this underestimate the audience and their mental capacities?  I'm afraid for this country if it is me that is overestimating the mind power of those in the audience.  Lets compare this graphic imagery with the torture scenes at the end of Mel Gibson's Braveheart.  In my opinion, the violent scenes in Braveheart served more of a purpose.  We already had an intimate understanding of what William Wallace had been through, and the cause for which he was willing to die.  Therefore, we question whether we could relate to the courage he demonstrates and what we might do in his situation.  We are flooded with emotion and respect for his taking a stand and willingness to sacrifice his life for the cause of freedom and fight against oppression.  Don't you think the makers of Passion could have explored different avenues to make us think?  What a disappointment.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Even though Mariah's never been away for more than two or three years, this is truly her most beautiful and talented attempt since \\"Butterfly\\". On \\"Mimi\\", she really goes all the way updating her material as well as being that Mariah we all learned to love with her catchy uptempo R&B-tinged songs and soaring ballads. <br /> <br />1. It's Like That - 8/10 - catchy, midtempo, will have you addicted for a week or so. Can be boring after that. It's the perfect mix of old Mariah with contemporary R&B. <br /> <br />2. We Belong Together - 10/10 - if you ever wondered when Mariah would try anything similar to Breakdown and release it as a single, since she kind of invented this type of song, this is it. We Belong Together is surely a dream come true for fans and Mariah herself said it was one of the three tracks she liked best on the album. <br /> <br />3. Shake It Off- 9/10 - another brilliant try for a midtempo/uptempo song. When you reach track three, you are sure Mariah has come back to the top. R&B/pop dance song. <br /> <br />4. Mine Again - 7/10 - The voice is here, true enough! Mine Again is where you'll listen to the powerful voice that recorded Vision of Love. It is a strong, seventies-to-eighties kind of ballad. <br /> <br />5. Say Somethin' - 8/10 - you will wonder why this song was chose initially as the first single. It doesn't catch you from the start, but you will be addicted to it soon enough. Features Snoop Dogg and it's another midtempo song... one of those only Mariah can do. It's just a delicious listening. <br /> <br />6. Stay The Night - 9/10 - been chosen as second single in Japan, Stay The Night has powerful vocals and notes, it's groovy, uptempo and should be seriously considered for a single in the US. It simply rocks! <br /> <br />7. Get Your Number - 10/10 - this is those kind of hate-it-or-love-it song. It's very uptempo and features JD, but don't think of Always Be My Baby. It's more contemporary, up to date, one of those songs J. Lo would bejealous of.  <br /> <br />8. One and Only - 8/10 - it's not a perfect song, but it keeps the tempo up and features Twista brilliantly. It's really nice to listen and has a nice beat, but nothing that will blow you away. <br /> <br />9. Circles - 10/10 - it's a ballad We-Belong-Together style. Very R&B, very nowadays kinda thing, and has stunning lyrics. Mariah's voice soars all along as always and it really gets you wanting to know those lyrics by heart. Who never been in this kind of situation before? <br /> <br />10. Your Girl - 7/10 - not a very catchy song, it's under three minutes, but it still has a nice vibe. If you keep listening to it, you'll end up loving it. But it doesn't outshine Circles, We Belong Together or It's Like That in any way. <br /> <br />11. I Wish You Knew - 9/10 - a very eighties ballad, very creative, in a rhythm that will remind you of old Mariah from 1990-1993. It truly soars with those high notes you'll only Mariah, Christina and other few performing it. It's brilliant. <br /> <br />12. To The Floor - 7/10 - for a Nelly collaboration, you'd be expecting a lot more. It's a strong uptempo song, it has a nice beat, but it's nowhere strong enough for a single. It seems they were having a lot of fun and it's truly inspired, though. <br /> <br />13. Joy Ride - 7/10 - a nice ballad, but doesn't compare to We Belong Together, Circles and I Wish You Knew. Mariah is happy this time, though, and you have an easy and nice time with it. <br /> <br />14. Fly Like a Bird - 10/10 - Mariah's favorite track and which started Emancipation's history is a gospel gem. It features her voice and high notes soaring, stunning vocals and just the right rhythm... you really feel inspired and in a high mode when this album ends. <br /> <br />Overall rating: this is a five-star album to stand besides Butterfly, Daydream and Music Box as her best albums ever!  <br /> <br />

But anyway I will not tell you what it's about cuz u probably already know that, just that it a wonderful movie. The songs, the clothes, the wigs( I bought a Farrah wig because of this movie and Farrah). Don't watch it if your a backwoods conformity freak.
B00004YZFR|5.0|I was at one of the Madison Square Garden concerts and also saw the movie when it was first released in NY. It's a tremendous film and the Maysles deserve full marks. This DVD version, however, has been slightly airbrushed in that two obscenities have been wiped out of it. At Altamont, in the original film, Jagger can be clearly heard saying \\"If we are all one, let's f*****g well show we're all one!\\" and a bit later, \\"We're going to do, we're going to do, I don't know what the f*** we're going to do. Both these instances have been tweaked out of the soundtrack, but they were in the original movie. Other than that, and the rather exalted price, this is an excellent re-issue.

He had to play it off in front of his associates like it was nothing. The saddest part was when he realized that they were going to come get him, so he tells his wife to tell \\"donnie\\" that he liked working with him and doesn't regret it just in case he were to call. Then he goes into the next room to leave his watch, wallet, and some stuff behind for his wife before leaving their home because he could not tell her what was going down, and just had to face the inevitable. I know that he was a criminal, but it was still too sad to watch. <br /> <br />
B00000G3Q4|4.0|For much of the gorey and bloody scenes, it was very entertaining, and for the most part humorous.  Though this movie's story plot isn't that great, I think you could ignore it and still enjoy it.  The one thing that really stumps me is that the dead can be re-animated by playing a tape, that really bothers me.  Besides that almost everything is pretty good, although the character Ash is almost always covered in blood or a bunch of blood is being splattered on him, and in some ways they overdid it a bit too much.   <br /> <br />I would recommend that people watch this movie, highly entertaining, gorey, and humorous, which is oddly enough a great combination.  I will say that that was one horny tree, and if you would be interested in what that means, go watch the movie!!!
B000060OFT|5.0|I must admit that when this movie first came out, I thought it was going to be dumb and brushed it off as one of those typical, Shakespeare, remake movies. My cousin did tell me that it was a good movie, but I still didn't believe it until I saw it for myself, and I was so impressed. Very impressed. The whole acting with the Dicaprio guy and Claire Danes was really good and I liked the fact that they still used the same old, English that the story was originally written in. That took a lot of hard work to memorize all those old English lines, while putting a modern day spin on it. That shows good acting ability, and I was truly impressed. Tybalt's character played by that John Leguizamo guy was the best! His portrayal was dead on with the character being the mean, spiteful, malicious, and antagonistic person that he was. Everything was good from the very beginning until the end. Never boring once, just really good acting and drama with a modern day spin to one of the most famous, entertaining Shakespearan play. Grade: A+

B00003CXAA|3.0|Where do I begin about this movie? Over-rated like Scarface, just like goodfellas. This is a trend now with these mafia movies. Again, I bought this out of curiousity to see what was all the hype of this so-called \\"greatest\\" movie of all time, next to Scarface, and yet, again, I was disappointed. Now, the movie was OKAY, nothing more and nothing less. It's certainly not all that. Some of the storylines were interesting like Michael Corleone and his rise to rule the family, and all the betrayals and backstabbings. A lot of it, however, was rather dry and boring. I can understand why people don't like part 3 of the trilogy. In part 2, I thought that Micheal forgave his brother, Fredo, for his betrayal, so when I watched the last series and happened that Micheal had him killed then I did not quite get that. I thought that he should have forgiven him since he was still his brother regardless. Then his daughter falling in love with her cousin, Vincent, his nephew was really disgusting and repulsing. Seriously, the only really good mafia movie is the Last Don. That movie really rocks! The first part is over 4 hours and last part is close to 3 hours, and never once did my brother or I get bored because the movie was so good. Great acting, good plot, interesting characters, good storyline, every bit was good. The Last Don should be on the list as the best mafia movies, not this garbage, though it's by the same writer. I know people will get mad at me for saying this. I don't see why people should take this so seriously...it's only my view. I realize that I am in a minority when saying it's over-rated, but please, let's not be so hostile and angry. Peace, people, peace.
B00009XITP|4.0|Good god, if you haven't seen this film and you are a teenage girl (or gay teenage boy), you MUST see it, for one reason and one reason only. OLIVER JAMES. he plays daphne(the lucky cow)s boyfriend in case you hadn't realised, and the first time (of many) i saw this film with my friends, we all practically fell off our chairs when that first scene with him singing came on...he is so HOTHOTHOT!!!!my friends video of it is getting severly worn down...the actual film is nothing overly special, a nice predictable teeny girly romcom which is quite good fun, but if the god that is oliver james wasn't in it, then lets just say it wouldn't be getting as many stars... well anyway, just get lots of your girl(or boy)friends over for a video night and have fun drooling together...
0790729725|2.0|This movie is so overrated, it's not funny. It's okay to watch when bored and not having anything else to do. But, seriously, it is way overrated and hyped up for reasons I don't know. I bought this out of curiousity to see whether this movie was as good as they say it is. That just goes to show you how mainstream America can influence everything in what's considered \\"great\\" and how people come to view this stuff. Because it's some mob movie, and America is fascinated with the mob and organized crime, then any movie with mobs and gangsters in it will be considered \\"cool\\" and \\"the greatest of all time\\". I must admit that I do have a fascination with the mob, so I bought this movie to see what the \\"life\\" is all about. This is the third mafia movie that I am buying that is way overrated and just hyped up, which makes me realize how overrated these mafia films are in the first place. So, I write this to warn others not to fall into the trap. (I also bought this for entertainment purposes and just to say I how some dvds, really). First off, the narration in the film by Ray Liotta character killed it. The narration was unnecessary, not to mention the loud-mouthed, obnoxious, always showing off Tommy to make up for his height. It was interesting when he talked about how he got involved in the mob and his upbringing, but that was all to it. The violence and tempers flaring, ready to kill someone over a petty insult to spare reputation and ego was all needless. Movies like this and Scarface are only for those that love gangster films and can tolerate unnecessary and uncalled for violence, beatings, and killings.
B00000K31Q|5.0|i love this film, its one of my alltime faves, only partly because it introduced me to the scrumptious heath ledger (he plays patrick in this film). i first saw it at school a year or so ago, because it's like the only decent video they own which girls and boys can enjoy, and i haven't been complaining the other five hundred or so times they've shown it to us since then!I love everything about this film, heath, the music, heath, the plot, heath, the shakespeare references, heath, the humour, and did i forget to mention, heath!even if patrick was played by someone else i would still like it, i just think it has a great atmosphere and is a really fun film to watch with your friends.
B00000099Y|5.0|this album is great. if you are a fan of heavy music, you will surely like this album
B000063US7|5.0|I just finished watching the DVD and am wondering what all the fuss is about. I'm a Genesis fan from 1977. And I also happen to be a Phil Collins fan. I just like his singing better. <br />  <br />Yes, it shows mostly songs from the latter part of their career, and yes I'd love to see \\"Supper's Ready\\", \\"Cinema Show\\", and \\"Fifth\\" performed in their full, unadulterated form, or at all. But that wasn't gonna happen. Get over it. <br /> <br />First, the DVD is visually stunning. I hadn't the chance to see the boys on this tour, and now wish that I had. I saw them back on the Abacab tour and it turned out to be the only time I'd seen them. The stage and light show alone are worth the price of the disc. And face it, despite what others may say, Genesis WAS a visual, as well as incredibly musical, band. And this type of concert drama and grandeur is sorely lacking in rock and roll. <br /> <br />Second, the songs. Yes, as I'd written earlier, they don't go back to the past more thoroughly, but the performances of the \\"Old Melody\\", \\"Domino\\"(By the Way, Phil's explanation of the Domino Theory is English comedy at it's best), \\"Home by the Sea\\" are stellar, and let's face it, the new stuff (with the exception of \\"Invisible Touch\\", never GOT that one) is still better than most of the stuff that their contemporaries were dishing around that time. <br /> <br />Third, the multiple angles blew me away. Concert DVDs have always been touted as being \\"like you were there\\". Well, I don't know about the rest of us, but I've never enjoyed the view from the front row. The camera angle from the back REALLY made me feel like I was there. And then I moved in for a closer look. Kind of fun playing director.  <br /> <br />Side note: Just about every song has at least 3 or 4 angles from which to view. A BIG plus. <br /> <br />Finally, my only complaint. During the extras interview, there should be a \\"Play All\\" option. <br /> <br />That's it. No comments about real or poser Genesis fans. Just that if you love the band, or if you just want to see a Concert performance the way that it REALLY should be filmed, RUN don't walk to get this.

It's simply the best book on the market. Written simply, simple enough for a child even, it still holds power enough to unhinge even the most mature of readers; it holds a certain sincerity of emotion that no book can rival - it doesn't cover things up in meaningless conversations, meaningless events and reflections - every word and sentance has a purpose - every chapter builds like music rising in intensity and complexity to divine heights.    It is a story of love, compassion, fear, desire - it has everything you could ever look for in a book. It will make your hopes soar with the character - it will make you cry in devastation.    And you'll never forget or regret having given it a try from the moment you read the first chapter to your dying day.    Masterpiece.
B00005JNQ8|2.0|The Interpreter 2.5/5 <br /> <br />I had high expectations for this film. It stars both Sean Penn and Nicole Kidman and is directed by Sydney Pollack, an Oscar-winning director.  <br /> <br />UN interpreter Sylvia Broome, specialist in African languages, overhears a possible discussion about an assasination attempt on the soon to be visiting President of Matobo. The President was a grass roots freedom fighter but after becoming the country's leader, he became a brutal dictator. Broome, as initally interviewed by weary Secret Service agent and recent widow, Tobin Keller (Sean Penn.) Keller is normally assigned to protect visiting dignitaries and tries to size up Broome and her accusations. <br /> <br />Soon, we learn that Broome's past in Matobo crosses with the dictatorship in way that affects her for the rest of her life. As the film drags on, we learn more and more about the past of the elusive Sylvia Broome. <br /> <br />The performances in the film are credible but not especially noteworthy, no doubt due to the weak script. Kidman isn't particularly appealing as the central focus of the film. Her vulnerability is diminished by her elusiveness. Her interactions with minor characters in the film, seem contrived, rather than by chance or surprise. <br /> <br />The film is not succint enough to make for a delicious thriller. It doesn't give you a good aha moment where it all falls into place. You don't get a chance to try to solve the mystery on your own like you do in other films. There are moments of tension, but they don't make up for the poor script. <br /> <br />I'll give Pollack credit, though, for not adding a fashionable, sugary romance. It appears romance was part of the shooting but all it was wisely edited out of the final cut. <br /> <br />The theatre was packed but it was mostly older folk, 50s and up. <br /> <br />I wouldn't watch it again.
0451526015|5.0|A wonderful blend of morality and wit, set in the background of beautiful phrasing and truly enjoyable descriptions.<br /><br />This book is very clever because it starts you off on par with Dorian - the main character - who then has his youthful innocence. Bit by bit, you find yourself fully strung on by the book's manipulative character who lures you in to the concept that everlasting beauty is more important than a beautiful soul.<br /><br />Though predictable, the understanding the author demonstrates for the boy's psychological qualms, which have direct parallels to our lives at present, makes this a spiritually moving read.<br /><br />The wit and mode he uses to drive his message home are second to none.<br /><br />Humorous, witty, insightful, and evocative, it's a must read.

This is only eight tracks, but there's alot of rock and emotion within. A must to own for the versions of \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"40\\", but also for the inclusion of the obscure songs \\"11 O'Clock Tick Tock\\" and \\"Party Girl\\". \\"Under A Blood Red Sky\\" does need a good remastering job, and why not toss on the live tracks from \\"Wide Awake In America\\" as well? Or how 'bout a new live album while I'm wishing?
B00005JNBQ|3.0|It's always funny with cult films. Everyone seems to like them and you watch them and you have no idea what the big draw is. Many times I've rented a movie simply because it was named by certain people has the best movie of the year or one of them. Yet I watch it thinking when's this genius supposed to come through? <br /> <br />Napoleon Dynamite(his real name apparently) is one of those nerds that you can't really imagine other nerds thinking he's cool. He talks in a very deadpan way, has a bizarre family and has curious habits such as eating potato tots he stuffs in his pockets. <br /> <br />The main plot from what I can tell is one of his friends(should I say one of his only friends) is running for class president which isn't even introduced until a good halfway or so in. So Napoleon wants to get him to win only they have to compete with Summer, one of those so popular for doing nothing girls that are in high school hallways. <br /> <br />Then there's his bizarre brother(?) who spends a lot of time chatting to his woman on the internet. There's also his uncle who has some weird money making idea all the time and is one of those relatives that embarasses you just by being themselves. <br /> <br />The acting isn't all that bad. I actually liked 2 of the girls: Deb who plays Napoleon's sort-of love interest and Summer, played by Haylie \\"I'm Hilary's sister\\" Duff. As for our main guy? Well if it was his job to sound bored he certainly nailed it. His eyes tend to be slightly closed half the time and he speaks in a drawling voice even when he's mad. And it sounds like he overacts to certain scenes, especially when there's something that upsets him. <br /> <br />I can't explain it. People love the film, others like me watch it and go \\"huh?\\"
B000002MUQ|3.0|Everyone seems to have a different Hagar-era favorite. My belief is that each album with him was a tad worse than the one before it. Not meaning that \\"Balance\\" is bad, but \\"5150\\" is easily my fave, then \\"OU812\\", etc. There are numerous songs here I like, but the majority sounds like good filler to me. Even the hit \\"Can't Stop Lovin' You\\" is just an average track to my ears. BUT, the album isn't bad either. \\"Seventh Seal\\" and \\"Don't Tell Me (what love can do)\\" are good, and \\"Amsterdam\\" is fairly rockin'. \\"Not Enough\\" is also one of their better and moving ballads. Overall I'd call this a must for the Van Hagar fanatic, but casual fans looking for another \\"Dreams\\" or \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" won't find it here.
B00005JNQ8|4.0|The Interpreter proves to be a solid but uneven movie about this woman played by Nicole Kidman who overheard an assassin plot against this dictator of a fictional African country while at work in the United Nation. Ironically, she is also from that country as well long ago. Sean Penn played a Secret Service agent who had to investigate and access the threat to that dictator who will be coming to the UN and also checked out Nicole Kidman's character as well.<br /><br />The general story moves along pretty well. The main characters are well developed. The movie played along as a some sort of a \\"spy thriller\\", a lot of cloak and dagger type of theme. Both Penn and Kidman's characters shared a same common problem of losing love ones and dealing with it. Both actors proves to be quite good in their roles. I am pleased that for once, Sean Penn isn't his usual outrageous self that some fans like him to be. He is very restraint in this movie, letting his body do his talking for him. Kidman I thought, was quite believable character and she proves herself to be a solid actress despite of her good looks. (Some reviewers actually panned Penn because he was so restraint.)<br /><br />Overall, the story works but only up to a certain point. The script wasn't as tight as it should be. By middle of the movie, you began to see thing far more clearly then what the director intented. The only real killer however, was the ending. After all that talk about forgiving, why would the movie end the way it did?? And what govenment would released a would be assassin based on a word of a secret service agent. Maybe I am giving away too much here in this review but overall, the ending hurt the film because its lack creditablity and believablity in contrast to the rest of the film.<br /><br />Amazingly, no sex scenes, no romance between the two leading actors, I guess they were just too busy staying alive and doing their jobs. That proves to be quite refreshing.<br /><br />Overall, pretty solid movie like I wrote before. But it could have been so much better if the director and scriptwriter didn't fall flat on their faces at the end. (I would give it a 3.6 stars rating if I had a choice.)solid movie like I wrote before.

0743487478|3.0|(...) I read Mr. Kohn's book with interest and curiosity.  While I am a strong believer in the usefulness of rewards in some situations, I certainly am also a proponent of using love and reason.  Mr. Kohn's assertion that the use of rewards is incompatible with an approach that emphasizes love and reason perplexes me.     As a clinical psychologist who works with children and families, I strive to address complex emotional feelings and interactions rather than simply to treat superficial behavior.  So I did appreciate Alfie Kohn's insistence in Unconditional Parenting on the need for parents to consider the underlying reasons for children's misbehavior.  His example of allowing his four-year-old daughter the usual snuggly bedtime story despite her earlier temper tantrum, which he recognized was connected to her jealousy of her newborn brother, aptly illustrates the need to take into account situational factors in responding to children's behavior.  Withdrawing his attention and refusing a bed time story (as Mr. Kohn asserts would be recommended by behavioral psychologists) would certainly only have left his daughter feeling more alone, angry, and jealous.    However, I am concerned that this book takes a quite extreme view about the use of rewards, discouraging parents from using what I consider to be at times a useful parenting tool that can help avoid stress and conflict.  That said, I am actually in agreement with Mr. Kohn that some who use \\"behavioral\\" techniques (following in the footsteps of the father of behaviorism, B. F. Skinner) do employ reward plans in a manner that ignores underlying feelings and fails to include dialogue and reasoning with children.     What Mr. Kohn doesn't seem to consider is the possibility that rewards can be used in a humanistic manner, that they can be empowering of children, and that they can facilitate warm bonds between parents and children.  (...)    In discussing research on use of rewards, I am concerned that Mr. Kohn failsto convey the results of the entire body of research on the effect of rewards.  It is true that research (most of it coming from studies done in psychology laboratories rather than in natural settings) shows that individuals who are rewarded for doing activities that are intended to be interesting are less likely to continue doing those activities, compared to individuals who are not rewarded.  But, this finding does not extend to activities that children don't find interesting.  Nor does it appear to apply to individuals who have a history of not succeeding at tasks.  In my experience, it is a rare parent who even thinks of using rewards for an activity that the child already enjoys doing!  It is in the mundane activities such as getting children to brush teeth, get organized and out of house in the morning, apply themselves to studying multiplication tables, and so on, that rewards can be useful in helping motivate children to do things they don't like to do.  I believe that in the process of earning strategically chosen rewards (e.g. enrollment in an exciting computer class after successfully memorizing multiplication tables), children can come to see the benefits of mastering the less interesting tasks of life.    Positive aspects of this book include Mr. Kohn's plea to parents to think about long-term objectives and to avoid pushing children too hard to succeed at goals that parents deem important.  I also very much agree with the way he urges parents to encourage children to problem-solve about how to resolve difficulties.    Children certainly benefit when parents respect their need for autonomy, love them despite their mistakes, and strive to develop children's ability to use reasoning to overcome problems.  However, there is no \\"one size fits all\\" approach to parenting. Children have distinctly different personalities, and my clinical practice as well as my personal experience raising two sons has taught me that some children respond to reasoning better than others.  Parents need to decide for themselves what approaches help them to be positive, loving parents.  They shouldn't feel it necessary to stick to a single predetermined philosophy.
B0007Y08T2|4.0|This is one of the 3 classic melodic death metal releases of the mid 90's (along with The Jester Race by In Flames and Slaughter of the Soul by At The Gates) The Gallery never quite recieved the same level of fame as the other two but it may possibly be the most ambitious of them all.  All the tracks are are very well done and contain many different parts.  There is endless amounts of time changes to keep you on your feet and plenty of melody to keep things listenable (and interesting).  Mikeal Stane's growl is very menacing but still not too grating on the ears. This combined with the intense speed makes this album a fairly brutul sounding one.  Fans of the genre or the band must own this album as it is a classic that still holds up today against the newer releases.    4.5 of 5
0316168815|5.0|I thought this was one of the most amazing books I've read in a long time. Alice Sebold weaves a beautiful tale of death and life, about a 14-year-old girl who is raped and brutally murdered in a cornfield one night on her way home. The whole book is from her perspective from heaven, focussing on her main want: to be back with her family who are falling apart after her murder. This is a top-rated book and something you could definitely read in one sitting. The characters are rich and plausible, and Alice deals with the strong elements of the book purely and with subtle tones of humour that make it, all together, an intriguing, wholesome novel that will never cease to shock, awe and amaze. <br /> <br />10/10

I would even take Grandma to see it if they did.  Oh, I also bought a copy on DVD for her for her personal DVD collection.
0060930187|5.0|The death of her father when she was only eight years old had a profound and terrible effect on Sylvia Plath.  It was the dark star that ruled her life and led her to a period of insanity in her early twenties and eventually to suicide when she was thirty.  All of this can be seen in her poems and in this thinly fictionalized autobiographical account of her mental illness.  She likens the experience to being sealed in a bell jar, isolated from the world, her view of which becomes heavily distorted by the glass walls of her mental prison.  She herself seems never to have faced up to the etiology of her neurosis and she does not describe her doctors as having discussed the issue, even though, after electroconvulsive therapy and (expensive) nursing care within an asylum eventually effected a cure of sorts (in reality, a temporary patching up), she describes herself as having been 'analyzed'.<br /><br />The Bell Jar is a painfully honest confessional that captures the characteristic self-absorption and craftiness of the mentally ill.  She had considerable difficulty finding the right voice for this, her only novel, but finally hit on a sparse, fragmentary narrative style, embodying surreal poetic imagery, that is reminiscent of Salinger or Nathanael West.  It is usually the girlish voice of the novel's protagonist rather than the mature voice of the author herself, with constant reference to hairstyles and shoes and of the unsatisfactory nature of the men in her life.  Their real failure, of course, was in not being her father, and the threat they posed was that they would, as he had in a sense done, finally abandon her.<br /><br />Plath herself said that The Bell Jar could never be published in America, and when, after the author's death, it was, her mother tried to stop its publication.  The characters and events were too thinly disguised for comfort.  It remains, like most of her poems, a raw and open wound, a beautifully written and compelling narrative that has deservedly become a modern classic.deservedly become a modern classic. <br />
B0007TKNIS|5.0|I have seen the movie The Phantom of the Opera eight (8) times. Yes, that is what I said 8 --- Why? Because I loved every minute of it and could not get enough of it.  The cast, the settings, the musical score, the SOUND AND GERARD BUTLER. What a beautiful, wonderful, absolutely great movie. What a wonderful fantasy and heart warming movie. Joel Schumacher should make more musicals like bringing back The Vagabond King or The Desert Song.I think Mr Schumacher did magnificently with this production. He made a great choice in Butler, Rossum and Wilson. And now I will purchase the DVD's so that I may have it for my own to watch over and over thru the coming years. Thank you so very much Mr Schumacher. Much luck to you in the future. Johanna     <br /> <br />
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I watched this movie in Japan when it first came out.  I was only a child then and even made a VCR copy before we left.  Unfortunately, my fatehr taped over it and I had been searching for it ever since.  When the DVD came out, I immediately bought it.  It is still as beautiful as I remember.  A definate masterpiece.  This is my favorite movie!
B00003BDXG|5.0|People seem to either love or hate this movie. If you hate it, you laughed at the title of my review.  But if you loved it, you agree completely. <br /> <br />The general public seemed to miss the point of this movie completely.  The Columbine kids certainly did.   <br /> <br />This movie wasn't made to glorify violence; we already have the news media doing that for us.  How comfortable would we feel if we actually witnessed Laci Peterson's grisly murder?  But we didn't, so we talked about all the details for months.  Corporations sell T-shirts with Charles Manson's image on it.  I wonder if people would still be wearing it if they saw his followers kill Sharon Tate and her unborn baby?  Stone's use of news clips further illustrates this point: the mock Time magazine cover, the O.J. Simpsons trial footage, etc.  <br /> <br />Not only does the movie have a powerful and important message hidden in the gore but it also has had an unexpected influence on  movies that have followed.  For instance, the Oscar winning movie Traffic employed the same tactics Stone used.  But I guess drugs are more vilified in our modern society than serial killers?

B0001LYH98|5.0|Originally, \\"Hours\\" was released in 1999, but this re-released issue is a welcome surprise.  Back in 1999, Bowie's \\"Hours\\" did poorly, but on a second listen, there is a lot of talent and new material that seems at first seems like a throw-away \\"Hunky Dory\\".  Sure, \\"Thursday's Child\\" and \\"Something In The Air\\" seem like frivolous pop, but take a second listen.  There is a lot of layering going on and some of Bowie's lyrics are more complex than initially heard.<br /><br />This new release with five new track versions is worth the purchase.  \\"Seven\\" is pure pleasurable pop, mixed just right and \\"Something In The Air\\" seems like a precursor to the \\"Rapture\\" (yes, in the Bible), with its ethereal, doomsday insinuations.  At the very least, it's all a good collection for a ride in the car.

0140277447|5.0|San Francisco Chronicle refused <br />to publish Iris Chang's rebuttal <br />to July 26, 1998 article by Charles Burress <br /> <br /> <br />In August 1998, Iris Chang wrote a lengthy letter to the editors of the San Francisco Chronicle. Chang wanted to rebut the charges made by Chronicle reporter Charles Burress in his article seen in the Chronicle, July 26, 1998. The Chronicle did not publish the letter. <br />From: IrisChang <br /> <br />To: Richard Rongstad <br /> <br /> <br />You may be interested in reading the letter I wrote to the San Francisco Chronicle last year, in response to his (Charles Burress') article about THE RAPE OF NANKING. <br /> <br /> <br />August 30, 1998 <br /> <br /> <br />To the Editor: <br /> <br /> <br />(Note to editor: The Chronicle has given a great deal of space to an article by Charles Burress devoted almost entirely to repeating charges of my right-wing Japanese critics. The letter that follows is long, but I believe the length and detail of Mr. Burress's charges require a response in some detail. For the record, I plan to post this letter on the internet and keep a copy of this letter on file for any journalist who asks me about Burress's article. A hard copy of my letter will also be mailed to the Chronicle this week.) <br /> <br /> <br />As the author of THE RAPE OF NANKING, I must respond to Charles Burress's July 26th article, \\"Wars of Memory,\\" which describes the controversy my book has provoked in Japan. <br /> <br /> <br />The often rabid criticism of my book among Japanese conservatives is certainly a proper subject for a press report, but Mr. Burress does a disservice to your readers by failing to explain the context of the criticism and by giving blind credence to charges made by Japanese revisionists. <br /> <br /> <br />One disturbing tendency in his article is to quote right-wing Japanese critics without demanding evidence to back up their allegations. I will cite three instances of this tendency. <br /> <br /> <br />(1) He writes that Ikuhiko Hata of Nihon University argued that eleven of the photographs in my book are fakes or misrepresentations. But not once in his article does Burress cite any evidence offered by Hata to support the charge or to describe how any of these pictures were artificially altered. Instead, Burress focuses on the caption under one photograph in my book, and uses what he claims is misleading in this one caption to support Hata's blanket charge of doctored photographs. (I discuss the caption below.) <br /> <br /> <br />Burress also failed to tell readers that Hata is not regarded as a serious scholar in Japan or the United States, very much because he is a regular contributor to ultra right-wing Japanese publications like Bungei Shunju. To provide a sense of the extreme nature of the views found in these publications (something Burress should have done when airing Hata's charges against me) the Bungei Shunju recently published an article that accused me, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation and Rupert Murdoch of being part of a gigantic conspiracy of the Chinese Communist party. Also, Marco Polo magazine -- formerly a Bungei Shunju publication before it was forced to shut down -- published as serious history an article from a Holocaust denier claiming that no gas chambers were used to kill Jews in Germany. <br /> <br /> <br />(2) Burress mentioned that a group of conservative Japanese professors held a press conference in June to attack my book as \\"grossly exaggerated and containing fake photographs.\\" But here is reportage sleight of hand. To encourage credulity among readers only marginally familiar with the issues, Mr. Burress quotes only the most constrained language of his sources. Left out of his article is that some of these academics told reporters that the Japanese army not only refrained from committing any massacre but were applauded for their kindness and good manners. Dokkyo University professor Akira Nakamura even insisted that it was the Chinese army that raped and murdered Chinese civilians before they retreated from the area and that the Japanese were \\"massacred unilaterally\\" by the Chinese up to that point. (Burress cannot claim to be ignorant about these statements, which would have greatly undermined the credibility of these critics with any sensible Chronicle reader, because he faxed me the original 22-page press release distributed during the press conference. I am enclosing a copy of this press release with this letter.) <br /> <br /> <br />(3) Burress also tells his readers that the Japanese ambassador to the United States called my book inaccurate and one-sided without mentioning that when grilled by reporters the ambassador failed to come up with one solid example of a historical inaccuracy in my book. He also neglects to mention that the ambassador's statements provoked immediate protests not only from Chinese officials but from Chinese American organizations, my publisher and the Simon Wisenthal Center. (In a letter to ambassador Kunihiko Saito, Rabbi Cooper of the Simon Wiesenthal Center criticized him for failing to come up with any specific details to back up his serious allegations. He also wrote: \\"Mr. Ambassador, this is a unique time in history when people and nations across the globe are finally taking stock of errors, misdeeds, and crimes against humanity during the World War II era. Indeed, I recently met in Tokyo with a group of repentant Japanese war criminals who publicly recounted their grisly crimes against innocent people which they carried out in the name of their emperor and nation. It is a sad state of affairs that the Japanese government lacks the vision and commitment to do the same.\\") <br /> <br /> <br />The criticism of my book offered by Burress himself is also demonstrably false. Here are two serious mistakes: <br /> <br /> <br />(1) On the first column of the second page of the article, Burress writes: \\"She calls her book the first in English to document the Nanjing tragedy (although one critic says that distinction belongs to \\"What War Means,\\" an account published in 1938 by H. J. Timperley, a British reporter for the Manchester Guardian.)\\" <br /> <br /> <br />This is certainly not true. On page 10 of THE RAPE OF NANKING, I clearly mention that THE RAPE OF NANKING: AN UNDENIABLE HISTORY IN PICTURES by Shi Young and James Yin was published in 1996, a year before my own book was published. My book also mentions other works that have devoted chapters to documenting the Nanjing tragedy, such as George Fitch's MY EIGHTY YEARS IN CHINA and Hsu Shuhsi's DOCUMENTS OF THE NANKING SAFETY ZONE. <br /> <br /> <br />On the book jacket, the editors at Basic Books wrote the following: \\"Iris Chang, whose own grandparents barely escaped the massacre, has written what will surely be the definitive, English-language history of this horrifying episode...\\" Definitive, not first. Surely not a claim that my book is the first English-language history of the Nanking massacre. <br /> <br /> <br />William Kirby, chairman of the history department at Harvard University, wrote in his foreword to my book: \\"This is the terrible story that Iris Chang tells so powerfully in this first, full study in English of Nanking's tragedy.\\" Again, \\"the first, full study,\\" not as Burress charges, \\"the first in English to document...\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Careless reading has led Mr. Burress to his careless reporting. I defy him to find one sentence in my book that specifically quotes me as saying that I have written the very first book in English that documents the Nanjing atrocity. <br /> <br /> <br />(2) In the second column of the second page of the article, Burress writes \\"Other mistakes occur in Chang's book, which quotes as 'compelling evidence' a secret telegram by Japan's foreign minister admitting that Japanese troops, 'in a fashion reminscient of Attila and his Huns,' had slaughtered 'not less than 300,000 Chinese civilians.' This was, in fact, a quotation from the cable of a British reporter, and concerned deaths not only in Nanjing but elsewhere.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Once again, the mistake is Burress's. On January 17, 1938, Foreign Minister Koki Hirota in Tokyo relayed the following message to his contacts in Washington, DC, a message that American intelligence intercepted, deciphered, and later translated into English on February 1, 1938: <br /> <br /> <br />\\"Since returning (to) Shanghai a few days ago I investigated reported atrocities committed by Japanese army in Nanking and elsewhere. Verbal accounts (of) reliable eye-witnesses and letters from individuals whose credibility (is) beyond question afford convincing proof (that) Japanese Army behaved and (is) continuing to behave in (a) fashion reminiscent (of) Attila (and) his Huns. (Not) less than three hundred thousand Chinese civilians slaughtered, many cases (in) cold blood.\\" <br /> <br /> <br />While true that Manchester Guardian correspondent H.J. Timperley originally wrote a report, which was stopped by Japanese censors in Shanghai (this is discussed in the paperback edition of THE RAPE OF NANKING), his estimate of 300,000 deaths found its way into the message sent by Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Koki to Washington, DC, which, in turn, was intercepted and decoded by the Americans. The significance of this piece of Japanese evidence is not that the Japanese were the first to report the enormity of the massacre but that that the Japanese government knew about the 300,000 figure given by Timperley, and included it in government communiqus. I continue to stand by my assertion that it represents a compelling piece of evidence that this was not something that occurred among low-level soldiers without the knowledge or complicity of Japanese higher-ups. <br /> <br /> <br />Finally, I must discuss the photograph of the villagers that the Chronicle enlarged and printed on page four. Burress claims that my use of this photograph is an error because - as Hata points out - this photograph was taken not in Nanking during the massacre, but shortly before the Nanking massacre, in a village occupied by Japanese troops. <br /> <br /> <br />Nowhere in the caption do I state when and where the picture was taken. My book reports on much of the horror of the Japanese invasion of China, as context for the Nanjing Massacre. In my book, the caption under the photo reads, \\"The Japanese rounded up thousands of women. Most were gang-raped or forced into military prostitution.\\" Those two statements are indisputable facts. <br /> <br /> <br />But there is an even more bizarre claim by Burress regarding this one photo. He claims that two villagers in the photograph are smiling, though how he can tell a smile from a grimace in a sixty-year-old photo escapes me. None of those many people who saw the photographs have noted any villagers smiling. It isn't obvious to me, it isn't obvious to the editors at Basic Books or Viking Penguin, and I doubt it is obvious to anyone who reads the San Francisco Chronicle. <br /> <br /> <br />But even if a smile is suspected, it does not erase the fact that the Japanese committed endless atrocities against Chinese men, women and children in occupied territory. A common tactic of Holocaust deniers is to pick at one small piece of evidence to draw attention away from scope and magnitude of the genocide. But a photograph of a Jewish child smiling as he gets off a train and heads for a concentration camp is not proof that the Holocaust didn't happen, but only of the irrepressible optimism of human nature. Nor is it proof that the child was happy and smiling a month later, when no cameras were around. Burress's nitpick here is also reminiscent of a dreadful time in our own history, and of those apologists for slavery who argued it could not have been that bad because the slaves were often seen singing. <br /> <br /> <br />The Japanese, like the Nazis, relied on deception to make mass executions and mass rapes more manageable. The hapless Chinese men, women and children rounded up by the Japanese were usually kept ignorant about their fate until it was too late to escape. In Nanking, women were guided to \\"marketplaces\\" to buy ducks and chicken, only to find platoons of soldiers waiting to rape them. Men were assured of food, shelter and safety by Japanese soldiers, only to be lured to remote areas and used for bayonet practice or decapitation contests. Whether a woman or two is smiling as they are escorted across the countryside by Japanese soldiers is really a non-issue. What matters is how these women were treated once they reached their destination.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This recording is definately the most advanced recording of anything available on the planet at this time. Porcupine Tree has even moved a step ahead of King Crimson ( a remarkable feat in itself) with this recording. After listening to this I can really understand how fitting it is to have Robert Fripp opening some of the shows for the band on this tour. I agree that Steve Wilson has become a musical genius (as Fripp is) as he is making the most advanced, well - written, original work of any artist out there. This CD has incredible depth, beauty, and insight into the times we live in - AND IT ROCKS HARD! Also check out Blackfield, Opeth, and No-Man (all with Steve Wilson). Porcupine Tree have risen above The Flower Kings, Spock's Beard, Dream Theater and all of the other New Progressive Rock Bands of the new century! I truly believe that this CD will be a classic for years to come. This one is going to be hard to top and anyone who does not have this in their collection does not know music. Period. A Billion star rating!
B00005JNEI|5.0|\\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is one of those films, like Michael Moore's earlier \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" and Oliver Stone's \\"JFK,\\" that polarizes audiences along political lines.  If you like George W. Bush, chances are you'll hate \\"Fahrenheit 9/11;\\" if you can't stand Bush, you'll probably love it.  There's little room for middle ground in today's sharply divided American electorate.  <br /> <br />Many critics of \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" claim the film is factually inaccurate. However, very few details of the film have actually been refuted. What really angers many about this film is its premise: that Bush ignored the threat of terror before the tragedy of September 11, 2001, and then used the attacks as an excuse to advance a radical right-wing agenda that included an ill-advised invasion of Iraq (which had no involvement in the September 11 bombings).  <br /> <br />Not exactly a cut-and-dried documentary, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is more of an essay film that relies on documentary footage to underscore Moore's hypothesis.  The footage and facts are expertly woven into a devastating indictment of Bush's policies.  You may disagree with the way Moore connects the dots, but his evidence does come from the public record (including actual quotes from Bush and his administration). <br /> <br />For all the political weight it carries, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is entertaining as heck.  Most of the comedy occurs in the film's first half.  There are montages of Bush vacationing to (you guessed it) the Go-Go's \\"Vacation\\" and of Bush Sr. schmoozing with Saudis to REM's \\"Shiny Happy People.\\"  Moore examines the \\"Coalition of the Willing,\\" finding that our allies include \\"superpowers\\" like Pulau, The Netherlands, and Costa Rica. (My favorite line: \\"Afghanistan? ...Oh, yeah. They had an army. OUR army!\\") Moore also milks the Patriot Act for laughs, hijacking an ice cream truck to announce its provisions to members of Congress (who admit they didn't actually read it).   <br /> <br />As events draw nearer to the invasion of Iraq, the tone grows darker, and Moore gradually dispenses with humour in order to focus on the story of military mother Lila Lipscomb, whose son goes to serve in the war.  Moore's delicate, sensitive handling of Lipscomb's heartbreaking story belies his reputation for guerilla filmmaking. <br /> <br />Near the end of the film, Moore offers this profound observation about our troops: \\"They serve so that we don't have to. They offer to give up their lives so that we can be free. It is, remarkably, their gift to us. And all they ask for in return is that we never send them into harm's way unless it is absolutely necessary. Will they ever trust us again?\\"  Unfortunately, conservatives refused to address this and other valid questions raised by \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\", instead focusing on discrediting Moore himself.  They must have felt vindicated when Bush narrowly won reelection in 2004.  But the election results do not invalidate the hypothesis of Moore's film.  Rather, as our troops remain in Iraq, as American casualties mount, and as Bush's rationale for war fades into obscurity, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" remains all too relevant.
B0004Z33G4|3.0|When Rambo first released on DVD, it wasn't even in a complete set.  Each film came out individually, First Blood part 2 had some special features, but than the other two had nothing more than trailers.  Than they released a special edition, which I thought was neccesary because it was given a good round of features.  Now they release it again, so you would expect even more features right?  Wrong!  First Blood and Rambo III have some decent extras, but why First Blood part II hasn't evolved from the previous edition is anyones guess.  The special edition set that was released prior to this one, had more documentaries, so is it really worth buying the ultra-edition just for the sake of a few minor changes.  Since First Blood part II hasn't got any extras, I reccomend buying First Blood and Rambo III ultra-editions individually only if you'd a die hard fan.  Who knows maybe in 5 years time, they will release a Super special edition, than another 5 years after that a Super duper special edition.  Why didn't Artisan include all the features on the ultra-edition with the special? the reason is obvious, they just want to milk as much money out of the fans as possible by re-releasing the set.  They did the same with Rocky and Terminator and a string of other movies.  There is no respect for fans anymore, film merchandising is clearly based on profit than value for money for the consumer. Mark my words, next on the list is Batman and Titanic, which will be given the special edition treatment, forcing fans to keep returning to the shop over and over. <br /> <br />Meanwhile I love Rambo the films with passion, but the marketing of the movies is ridiculous.
B00003CXCT|1.0|I guess I should have checked out some websites or reviews of this DVD set before I bought it, but unfortunately I failed to do so.  <br />  I was so excited to see that finally, the Star Wars Original Trilogy (as they call it) was on DVD for everyone to enjoy.  But when I bought the DVD and brought it home to my family, we were horrified to find that these were not the wonderful movies we remembered at all, but the awful 1997 Special Edition versions with even more awfulness added in.   <br />  Needless to say I returned the set immediately and got a full refund.  Calling these mockeries of Star Wars the ORIGINALS is an outright lie and total false advertising.  Who does Lucas think he's fooling here?  He may have tricked me into buying these DVD's once from the cover's false facades, but everyone, even I, know this is not the original trilogy.    <br />
B0007OCG4W|2.0|When I got this movie, I had in mind the impression that this movie was going to be about love, sex, sacrifice, and the struggle through confusion to find which person is right for you, or if there's such a thing as a right-er person. Basically, I had high hopes for the romance and development of this movie, and I was prepared to leave the television with a better perception of this thing we define as 'love'. And, regretfully, I was disappointed. <br /> <br />The movie started off well enough -- intriguing characters, a boldly funny cyber sex scene, and some strangling conflicts between loyalities. However, after about the point when all the characters were familiar with each other, the movie goes downhill. <br /> <br />The first point I have to make is the obsessive use of sexuality in the film. Do not get me wrong -- I believe that sex is an almost essential part of a film, a part of love that must be confronted and explained. But this movie took the concept of mixing up love and sex, and it became perverse. Revealing strip clubs, graphic language, equally graphic cyber sex -- at one point, I was confused as to whether I was watching pornography with a bony plot. Again, I think that there should be some sex in movies, but not as excessive as this one. <br /> <br />Yet this brings up an important point -- is this what our society is based on? In the movie, the words 'I love you' start to lose meaning, like a swear word used too many times. Is this an accurate representation of today's society, where the boundaries of love and commitment are undermined by sexual cravings? <br /> <br />I would say that yes, this does give the viewer a new perspective on the structure of our social lives, but then there are the actual characters to consider. In order to keep the plot going, the characters must break up, get back together, grovel, make love, lie, cheat, and basically commit every felony in a relationship. Apparently, the fact that your partner has lied to you, cheatedon you, and pretended not to love you is completely forgivable. But, when your partner asks you if you had sex with someone else, that is unforgivable. In simpler words, the characters were all ridiculously desperate. There is a difference between being love-stricken and being pathetic. <br /> <br />In general, I would have to admit that \\"Closer\\" was a poignant movie. It brings up important questions about how we handle our relationships and how we differentiate between love and lust in our society. But I left the living room couch feeling sickened by the desperate plot and undeveloped characters -- completely and utterly sickened. I can understand that other people love this movie, and I can see what is so original and beautiful about it. But it was not to my taste, and I wish to give a small warning in advance about this movie. If you believe that there is something remotely sacred in sex as I do, you will /not/ enjoy this movie.
B000002TQV|5.0|The Bends (1995.), Radiohead's second studio album<br /><br />'The Bends', Radiohead's second studio album, released in 1995 saw the alternative styled British rock band build on a great success with their debut album, 'Pablo Honey'. Radiohead were very much part of the new invasion of British bands which began to rule the airwaves in the mid-1990's, including other bands such as Oasis and Blur. However, Radiohead were very much different from the rest of the pack, themselves having a much more innovative and thoughtful style which characterised their sound. So is the average 5* rating of 'The Bends' on amazon.com and the continued praise which critics give it justified?<br /><br />The answer is yes. 'The Bends' is quite simply a masterpiece and is definitely one of the hallmarks of music produced during the 1990's. This album however, for some reason, often gets cast in the shadow of 'OK Computer' which a lot of people hail as their best album (it was their follow up effort to this). I personally think that 'The Bends' is just as good, if not better than 'OK Computer'. It is definitely Radiohead's heaviest album and is probably their most consistent. There is no uneveness to the music and it is excellently produced, with all of the tracks running perfectly into one another. Similarly, the album has a very refreshing and revitalising quality to it, which makes it a great listen every time. 'The Bends' for me, is perhaps the prime example of why Radiohead are one of the most influential bands of the last 20 years. It has been the benchmark for so many alternative bands who have subsequently formed, and it sounds so familiar as so many have tried to cop its style!<br /><br />So, a bit about the music itself. The album has plenty of different styled tracks. There is plenty of heavy stuff on here. 'Planet Telex', the opener, with its kind of futuristic style illustrates this from the start. 'The Bends', the title track, continues this theme - an excellent track with plenty of great riffs. The same is true for 'Bones'. With a lot of the songs, Thom Yorke's sings in a style were he often seems bored with the lyrics, but however, it works really, really well with the music. I would never say Thom Yorke was a great singer BUT the style he adopts characterises the Radiohead sound and is perhaps the main reason behind the bands instantly recognisible identity - Radiohead wouldn't sound the same with a different vocalist. The album also has plenty of dreamy styled tracks, another feature of Radioheads music which characterises the bands sound. The passionate '[Nice Dream]' is prime example, but you feel that style with 'bullet proof' and the final track 'Street Spirit .... fade out', an acoustic styled track which for me is one of the best on the album. 'My Iron Lung', 'Black Star', 'Sulk' and 'High and Dry' are all excellent efforts in their own right, never a dull moment between them - listen out for some brilliant guitarwork from Ed O'Brien on 'Iron Lung'. 'Just' similarly is a great track and is perhaps the track that really did gain Radiohead a lot of new listeners, with the video which was made for it which depicted a man laid on the floor with his eyes open, but no-one could talk to him. It was the kind of thing which captivated people with Radiohead's music and persuaded them to listen to more of the the band's music. 'Fake Plastic Trees' is perhaps the best track on the album. Thom Yorke sings about people who try to be something they are not. Its very powerful music.<br /><br />'The Bends' speaks for itself. Its a masterpiece which perhaps does not quite get the recognition it deserves. Radiohead are one of the best bands to come out of the last couple of decades and their unique alternative stlye has influenced many. 'The Bends' is definitely the place to start if you're building a collection of Radiohead cds - its a perfect introduction!same is true for 'Bones'. With a lot of the songs, Thom Yorke's sings in a style were he often seems bored with the lyrics, but however, it works really, really well with the music. I would never say Thom Yorke was a great singer BUT the style he adopts characterises the Radiohead sound and is perhaps the main reason behind the bands instantly recognisible identity - Radiohead wouldn't sound the same with a different vocalist. The album also has plenty of dreamy styled tracks, another feature of Radioheads music which characterises the bands sound. The passionate '[Nice Dream]' is prime example, but you feel that style with 'bullet proof' and the final track 'Street Spirit .... fade out', an acoustic styled track which for me is one of the best on the album.

B0007GAERG|1.0|I admire Mariah Carey, and I think she has a terrific voice.  However, I'm baffled by all the good hype about this album.  Every song sounds like the song before. <br /> <br />Ms. Carey is a great talent.  However, I think she needs to find either a better songwriter, or a producer who can find her better songs. <br /> <br />If you listen to this album, you won't find a tune you can sing, hum, or recognize from another. <br /> <br />That, in my opinion, is what makes a great singer--someone who can immortalize a song.
B000002UJQ|5.0|OK Computer (1997.), Radiohead's third studio album<br /><br />'OK Computer', Radiohead's third studio album, released in 1997, stands acclaimed by many, as one of the greatest album achievements of all time. The genius quintet of Thom Yorke (vocals), Ed O'Brien (guitar), Colin Greenwood (bass), Johnny Greenwood (guitar/keyboards) and Phil Selway (drums) prior to this album's release had already made a very big impression with their music, with the releases of 'Pablo Honey - 1993' and 'The Bends - 1995'. So, by the time of this album's release, a lot was expected of the British alternative rock band and they certainly didn't disappoint with this excellent release.<br /><br />'OK Computer' deserves a 5* rating anyday, the fact that it averages 4.5 stars on amazon.com is an insult and is in no part probably brought down to that rating by people who simply haven't given this album a chance, or simply have no taste when it comes to music - its a sad fact that one of the most influential bands of the last two decades gets this criminally unfair treatment. 'OK Computer' is an unbelievable album and I can see why many fans of the band acclaim this as Radiohead's best release, with its diverse and captivating style. I personally think that the album's predecessor 'The Bends' equals it and is just as good (yes - that's how good Radiohead are, they can produce one masterpiece after another!) but thats only my humble opinion. The other thing which I disagree with concerning 'OK Computer' is the overcomparisons with the godfathers of alternative rock, Pink Floyd. I don't know why people compare both bands' music - i can only find two similarlities. One is that both Radiohead and Pink Floyd were able to single handedly create a new direction with music in their own right. The other is that both bands have that releaxing, dreamy quality to their music. I think personally that the overcomparison only serves to drum down Radiohead's own genius.<br /><br />As I've mentioned, 'OK Computer' is a very diverse listen. 'Airbag' is a very mellow sounding opener with some whizz guitar playing and it runs perfectly into what is in my opinion, the album's best track in 'Paranoid Android'. This is 6 minutes of brilliance from the acoustic opening to the heavy jam which finishes the track. Its also very atmospheric, especially in the part where the whole thing slows down and Thom Yorke wails out the lyrics 'rain down on me' over and over. 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' follows this - a real free flowing track with that dreamy style to it that I keep saying Radiohead have - the keyboard and guitar playing is also pretty futuristic sounding on this track. 'Exit Music, for a film' is next up. Perhaps the most downbeat track on the album (but by no means depressing) - plenty of effects make it a great track. 'Let Down' is much more melodic return, with plenty of very much lethargically sung vocals from Thom Yorke - making this another classic Radiohead song. 'Karma Police' is an entrancing listen, with a great blend of acoustic/electric guitar styles. 'Fitter Happier' is a weird 2 minute track which, I think, uses Stephen Hawking's electronic voice - its an interesting experimental track which cleverly links together the first half of the album to the second. 'Electioneering' follows this. A heavier track, with a great riffs which is played out in style. 'Climbing Up The Walls' is a much more haunting track. Thom Yorke's vocals sound slightly distorted on this one. The downbeat instrumentation on this track is very effective, as is the strong drumbeat underpinning the track. 'No Surprises' follows this - this for me is perhaps the weakest track on the album, but its still very good. This track has had good commercial play and I feel as though it is a little overrated. 'Lucky' and 'The Tourist' are two excellent tracks to close out the album - the latter is a slow, thoughtful song with again a pretty dreamy style to it.<br /><br />OK Computer deserves all of the praise it gets. It is a true classic which for me, like the previous Radiohead album, 'The Bends' will never date or lose its appeal. There is a load of dimensions to Radiohead's music which is why they're such a great act. If you remotely like Radiohead's music or any alternative music from the last 10-15 years, then you're gonna love this album - definiteley a must buy!classic which for me, like the previous Radiohead album, 'The Bends' will never date or lose its appeal.

One will discover that America has not yet caught up with Adam Smith and his principles of free trade. Hazlitt is a much better writer than Friedrich A. Hayek. He writes about taxes, rent control, machines, wages, and many other things.
B00000DQSV|4.0|If you've ever read any of my reviews,(Notably the recent 'Rio' review,) you've heard me compare Duran Duran's albums to the Star Wars series. I believe it was Episode 1 that I compared Notorious to. Now, by no means do I call Notorious a 'failing' album. It is one of the hidden gems in the series, but some of the tracks are very forgettable. <br /> <br />We start out with the title track, \\"Notorious\\". This 4:18 long track is quite possibly my second favorite on the album, beaten only by \\"Vertigo\\". As expected from Duran Duran, there's a nice dancing-like beat, but horns? Electric Piano? You know you're in for something different. Simon's vocals are polished, and Nick seems to be learning the magic of sampling. <br /> <br />Next comes \\"American Science\\". I'm not sure, but there's something about this song that makes me love it. It could be the lyrics, maybe the beat, but I'd rather not know what it is. It makes me like it more.  <br /> <br />And now we have the second single, \\"Skin Trade\\". I wasn't too crazy with this song, besides the chorus. If the could have reworked the verses or something, it could be a lot better. Simon's falsetto seems out of place in the beginning. Eh. <br /> <br />\\"A Matter Of Feeling\\" is the one great though forgettable song on this album. You get lost in it, and then afterwards forget whatever happened. Amnesia is the only thing you'll get from this song...good beat, piano's okay, bass is great, it's just okay. Okay? <br /> <br />\\"Hold Me\\" is easier to remember than the previous track, but it's still kind of forgettable. As always, the beat is fine, and the bass seems to go along with it, but the \\"Na Na Nananana\\" around the 3:17 mark is kind of LAME. <br /> <br />\\"Vertigo\\" is a great, great song. In fact, it's my favorite on this album. The slow-like rock beat makes you want to clap along. The bassline reminds me of the \\"New Religion\\" days. The chorus is shining like always, and Nick Rhodes finds his way to fit in. Great job guys. <br /><br />\\"So Misled\\" is the song I'm pondering on playing with my band. Pretty darn good with great harmonies, which is great because we've got 2 background singers. We all take turns playing. Funk guitars enhance this song. <br /> <br />\\"Meet El Presidente\\" is a pretty good song. Pretty repetitive in the beginning for about thirty seconds, then it starts to pick up. I wasn't too crazy about the woman vocals, though. Too soul-like for Duran Duran. <br /> <br />\\"Winter Marches On\\" was a B-Side for Notorious, or something. Slow and epic with great lyrics. A beautiful song, this one is. Talking like Yoda, I am. It actually gives off a cold-like feeling. Reminds me of...well, winter. <br /> <br />\\"Proposition\\" is the last song on the album, and a great finisher. Mid-tempo with keys, bass, horns, and guitars. Simon's here too. <br /> <br />All wrapped up together, Notorious does not disappoint. In fact, I would reccomend it to you. So buy it.
B00003CX5P|5.0|Now, when this movie FIRST came out, I saw it nine times in the theater, owned the graphic novel, owned two Episode 1 novels, and owned the playstation 1 game which i played with my brother 24/7. This was a really good move, but you may not quite get the star wars feeling you desire. Its not quite as good as the original ORIGINAL trilogy, but its up there. I own it now, and on the DVD they add one deleted scene and extended podrace in the movie (plus you can watch them on the special features.) If you havent seen it yet-well, why not? Try it. I loved it. You might, too.
B0007Y4USW|4.0|When I first heard the album I didn't like it much. But when I returned to work after buying I heard my self singing, \\"I gotta shake it off... shake, shake shake it off\\" Over and OVER! So I revisted the album and I fell in love. The song \\"Circles\\" really gave me chills from the vocals AND the amazing lyrics. I think we can all relate to that situation Mariah Talks about in it. Stay the Night and Joyride are also 2 more of my favorites along with We Belong Together which I liked after seeing it'd debut... <br />So yea... She's definitely back and proving that there is a reason she is the #1 selling artist of all time
0743442539|5.0|Le Carre's classic work of spy-thriller literature was first published more than 40 years ago.  It harkens back to the day when the Communists were the Bad Guys, the West were the Good Guys, and all's fair in propaganda and war.  Although the world has changed a little bit since then, Le Carre's story is still griping and nail-biting, full of spies, double-agents, triple-agents and the like.  This book is able to keep hits hold on the reader because his austere plot, centered around the infiltration of Britain's spying-ring inside East Germany and the British spymasters attempt to fight back, is a framework on which Le Carre has developed the psychology of spying.  No one is ever quite who they seem, and as the motivations and actions of individuals blur into an ever-shifting moire field, the behavior of the various organizations are even harder to sift out.  But that is all part of the fun.  As the reader tries to figure out what will happen next, and gets stymied by each subsequent twist, you get more sucked into travails.  And the twists keep on happening right to the very end.  It is because of this brilliant writing that allows Spy to remain fresh and sharp after all these years.
0783225725|5.0|This is one of Clint Eastwood's best efforts. The subject of the film was later reprized in \\"Pale Rider\\", which is good in its own right, but \\"pales\\" beside the mythic resonance of \\"Drifter\\".    Clearly, Eastwood is using everything he learned at the feet of the master Sergio Leone, but goes the master one better. \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\\" had a strong anti-war message on a grand scale. \\"Drifter\\" is a more interior kind of study of group corruption, and the place of the a-moral avanger within the panoply of human foibles.    I'm surprised that no reviewer has taken up the Christological overtones of the film. The Sheriff of Lago is whipped to death in the street in front of all of the townspeople - just like Jesus on the stations of the cross. \\"The Stranger\\", as the returning (resurrected?) ghost of the Sheriff (who is only reckognized as such by the town dwarf), is also handy with a whip, as was Jesus when he \\"cleansed\\" the Temple of the corruption of the money-lenders (which is the exact hidden sin of the town).     \\"Lago\\" is obviously an anagram for \\"Gaol\\": the citizens are locked in a purgatory waiting room, and The Stranger has come to dispense judgment.     The role of the dwarf, whom The Stranger appoints first as Mayor and then as Sheriff of the town, simply to grind the faces of the towspeople in their own corruption, is a brilliant bit of Sergio Leone parody put on steroids!    The entire movie is paced excellently and has a very satisfying balance. Geoffry Lewis as the head of the bad guys later became a staple player in Eastwood's Malpaso productions, including an excellent turn in \\"Thunderbolt and Lightfoot\\".    All in all, this is a quintessential Eastwood film, and is probably the capstone of the Sergio Leone style Western. One can imagine the master grinning and nodding in approval during his first viewing of the pupils fledgling production!
B0007VCZ50|5.0|This is simply one of the best music DVDs ever made. You don't have to be a  <br />Sting fan to be turned on by the overflowing energy, joy, and musicianship which this band exudes.  The only other music DVD which comes close to this is the Talking Heads' Stop Making Sense. If you liked that, you'll love this.  But Bring on the Night goes way beyond Stop Making Sense, as it is more than just a concert video.  We are shown numerous rehearsal scenes which give you a feel of how this band worked together, as well as interviews with the musicians which are both insightful and hilarious (especially Marsalis). Hakim's drumming is smoking throughout.  Marsalis' playing is always interesting, reinforcing the impression he often gives of being best when he plays other peoples' music. Sting's and the backup singers' vocals are piercingly beautiful.  The sequence where you are taken into the delivery room for the birth of Sting's son, with \\"Russians\\" playing in the background, is truly moving.  The sound and picture quality of the DVD transfer are even better than the original.   It is a mystery why this movie was not a blockbuster success when it was first released 20 years ago. It is a bit pretentious, but after all, Sting IS a Brit and the pretentiousness of Sting in this movie pales in comparison with what followed in pop music, especially among Rap artists.  Perhaps the DVD version will enjoy the success this remarkable film is still due.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|WOW. I am an original fan of the cut-short-way-before-it's-prime series, and cannot say better than most of the other reviews. Bought the DVDs and LOVED them, too!! Great extras and insight-the bloopers reel is plain hilarious.  <br />   The world created by Whedon is...magical...there is no other way to phrase it. Great writing, and great set, but mostly great cast and characters, they completely make this world believeable and make you want to be a part of it. (FOX is I'm sure firing someone about now with all the positive movie buzz)  <br />   Especially with the Serenity movie coming out (and all the same cast, oh happy day!) you need to see the series. And after you see the series, you will want to see them again...so buy it already, you won't regret it!
B00005JM02|2.0|While Finding Nemo is visually stunning, it really wasn't all that good. In fact, the only good part for me was when the little girl walks in and the Psycho theme plays. If you want to see an outstanding Disney/Pixar film, see The Incredibles, it was actually entertaining. I know my view doesn't count for much, seeing as how everyone else absolutly loves this movie, just keep in mind, it really isn't all it's cracked up to be.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|in a relationship.  For most people, that's too much to take onscreen!  For me, it means that small moments of the film keep reappearing in my consciousness, unsettling me from time to time.  That return to the moment or moments caused me to give this sweeping character study by famed and beloved director Mike Nichols, 4 stars.<br /><br />\\"Closer\\" is a curious film, excellent in its execution, and yet, for those who go to films to be entertained, \\"Closer\\" will be a dismal failure. Look at it as a character study, a train wreck of every bad relationship you've ever had.  It is not at all entertaining; in fact, it is brutal and artificial in its conception, in its deception.  You are deceived into thinking it will eventually become a love story, but instead it is a story of emotional wounding.<br /><br />Four characters become entwined in relationships based on sex, which they perceive to be love.  The meeting of Dan (Jude Law), angular and sinewy, an obituary writer with a chilly outlook on life (and a lack of integrity that is so much on the surface, you wonder what it is the women see in him) and the luminous, voluptuous, Alice (Natalie Portman) is quite by accident in a London street.  She's running from a life in New York that wasn't turning out the way she planned, and it feels as though she will meet and take up with someone, anyone, on the street.  Dan is a good choice for her emptiness.  We see him next in Anna's (Julia Roberts) photography studio - now a semi-successful author who is posing for a book cover, and who has partnered with Alice for a couple of years, he is immediately arrested by Anna's behavior and looks and wants her desperately.  Alice arrives and Anna is taken with her looks and sexuality, photographing her in a beautiful shot that survives and lives to be a centerpiece in a future show of Anna's work.  Meeting Alice cements in Anna's mind that, as much as she is drawn to Dan, she does not want to be with him.<br /><br />As Anna rebuffs Dan, his smarmy response is to set her up for a meeting (unknown to her) with a wanton doctor that he meets online in a sex chat room.  The doctor, Larry (Clive Owens) is sexual in a primal, raw and needy way.  His encounter with Anna turns from the embarrassing to the sublime when he is able to cut through her reserve and anger with his amazing looks and rough charm.  Your initial reaction to Larry is that Anna is lucky to meet him.  His honesty, decency, and, despite his amazing looks and profession, his lack of polish are disarming.  The four have their first (and only) mutual encounter at Anna's photography show, and it is during this show that the filmgoer begins to become perplexed by the relationships.  Alice and Larry have an encounter that simmers in its desperation, Dan is undone at the outcome of his prank and it becomes apparent that Dan has never ceased pursuing Anna.  More surprises and misdeeds wait after Anna and Larry have been married, in an attempt at decency, only to have her withdraw in a baffling move, in favor of Dan.  The complex feelings of abandonment and anger; the raw emotion that opens when one half of a couple admits to cheating, is repeated in the encounters between Larry and Anna and Dan and Alice.<br /><br />Stunningly, the four are not finished with each other as the divorce proceeds and Larry encounters both Alice, who has returned to her career as a stripper, and then Anna in a scene that will leave you wondering what in the world could Anna's motivation be, and just what will ever make her happy.  There is no decency, no loyalty in the behavior of any of the characters, except for Alice, who retains her amazement and loyalty to her coupling with Dan, until she realizes just how self-absorbed he is and just how much of a game it all is to him, and finally, finally, breaks free; the only one of the three, you believe, that will ever be free of the deceit.<br /><br />It is easy to dislike and distrust Law, and eventually to cheer for his comeuppance.  Although I did not think his performance as strong as that of the others, the very nature of how much you DO dislike him, despite both ladies' love for him, is telling in how much he inhabited his character.  Roberts is credible as Anna, although her screen persona is far too warm to play the cold and confused photographer, who plays out her inner turmoil in her black and white portraits, which are stark, indeed.<br /><br />She is accurate in displaying her moods on her face, accomplished in her dialogue and there is no doubt about why both men would want her, but somehow, she is unable to pull the whole thing off.  Or perhaps she and Law just pale by comparison to the truly excellent performances given by Owen and Portman.<br /><br />Owen, who has been truly decent and sexy as Larry, is a revelation when he is spurned; his behavior varies widely from sorrow, longing and desperation to anger and coldly calculated emotional brutality.  This role, like much of what  Owen has played in the past (a fierce and rugged \\"King Arthur\\" in Fuqua's film of the same name, an intense and passionate turn as a doctor in Angela Jolie's \\"Beyond Borders,\\" in a revelatory role in \\"Bent\\" as a Nazi prisoner who is also a prisoner of his own homosexuality, and, best of all, his enigmatic and cold cynic \\"Croupier\\" role) is a tribute to his ability to immerse himself in the character, and then draw the audience in with him.  It is high time that the powers that be in Hollywood discovered him not only for his amazing screen presence and beauty, but his skill as an actor.  After \\"Closer\\", hopefully they will recognize leading man material and he will find a film that will propel him into the upper echelons of today's leading men, where he belongs.  He's had a long career of mostly \\"B\\" grade films, where his performance is the saving grace of the entire movie.<br /><br />As good as Owen is, he's eclipsed by the breathtaking turn of Natalie Portman as the character who disguises herself as \\"Alice\\".  She's tantalizingly sexual and a cipher between the wanton and the vulnerable in meeting Dan, meeting Larry, and in the strip club.  In private scenes with Dan, as part of a couple, she's engaging and almost childish in her love for him.  I've long thought of Portman as the young woman of the beautiful face, and thought she was amazing in \\"Garden State\\", but here she truly steps out of the \\"goody good\\" roles she's been taking in the past, and gives us a taste of what Natalie Portman, on the brink of adulthood, can be.  She alternately portrays innocence and the knowingness of a woman who knows she inspires lust at first glance.  Her scenes as a stripper are a revelation of beauty and body, and she's \\"large and in charge\\" of the encounter with Larry; that's when you know that, despite the hurt, despite her willingness to run from port to port in a storm, she's ultimately a survivor.  Portman was surprisingly cast, and Nichols' instincts and ability to direct such an amazing performance leave her, too, on the brink of a career explosion, if she chooses roles correctly.<br /><br />Unlike many of the critics, I did feel the chemistry between the characters; complete and utter longing and abandonment, not love.  By film's end, you are convinced that all of them are soulless.  I did not, however, feel or engage in the worth of any one character; was not rooting for them, was not drawn in by them, at least until the closing scene in New York, in which a very different Portman takes a walk as \\"Alice\\", now liberated from the need to hide or costume her appearance.  In this final walk, I was touched by how happy I was that she'd escaped the madness, and how much I wanted her to be happy.<br /><br />Nichols was fortunate to escape with an \\"R\\" rating for Closer as presented.  Should he have been given an \\"NC-17\\" he would have been forced to edit some of Owens's language and some of the scenes, notably from the strip club.  Although this film is not for children or teenagers, it is filmed in an honest and frank fashion, much of what Nichols is known for.  The frank sexuality is necessary to understand and to frame the characters' motivation.  The DVD version of this film, at least the only one that has been released at this time, uses Superbit technology, so the filming is beautifully portrayed, but none of the extras that would normally come with a DVD are present (and perhaps this was due to the rush to release it before the Academy Awards).  The film is shown in English and French, but there are no outtakes, no interviews with the players to understand how they got motivated into their characters (and this would have been fascinating, especially in the case of Portman), no Nichols interview, nothing to redeem the price of the DVD.<br /><br />One more amazing thing about the film, however, is the theme song \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" (the video is contained on the DVD) by Irish troubadour Damien Rice.  It is powerful and haunting, perhaps the best movie theme of the past several years.<br /><br />And thus, my recommendation is to rent, not buy, and only if you are looking for insight into filmmaking, or transformation of a play to a film, not if you would like to be entertained.Portman as the character who disguises herself as \\"Alice\\".

B000002B2T|5.0|From the first few bass notes that open the album, it's clear that this album will defy any categorizations we might want to make based on the members' other bands. It isn't Alice in Chains, it isn't Pearl Jam, it isn't Screaming Trees. It's Mad Season. <br /> <br />The lyrics are touching, Layne's vocals are in top form and hence soul-searchingly haunting while remaining just utterly beautiful. The emphasis in this album, I would say, is Layne. The rest of the band's music is interesting, but nowhere near as complex as their work in their respective big bands. That isn't to say it's bad at all--in fact, many times, playing less is what makes the music better. Layne really makes the album what it is, however. <br /> <br />Highlights are \\"Long Gone Day\\" and its creepy Latin vibe, as well as \\"X-Ray Mind\\" and Layne's amazing vocal harmonies. One of the things I love about Layne's style is how well it takes to long, drawn out words that take maybe a whole measure per syllable but are still as catchy as hell.  <br /> <br />\\"Lifeless Dead\\" isn't one of the album's best, but deserves honorable mention just for Layne's killer scream in the beginning of the chorus. Hell yes!!!  <br /> <br />\\"All Alone\\" is the song that I have been waiting to hear since I heard what Layne did to Jar Of Flies...dreamy, atmospheric music with trademark Layne minor-key harmonies and sparse lyrics. Amazing closer to the album.  <br /> <br />My favorite track, however, is \\"River of Deceit,\\" which not only displays the best musicianship on the album--just listen to what a few well-played upright bass notes bring to the verses--but the Layne's lyrics and singing are incredible. They give me chills every time. The message of the song--that pain is always real but sometimes self-imposed and that we always have a choice of what to do with it--is one that really resonates with me personally, as well. <br /> <br />In summary, one of my favorite albums for its stellar mix of the eerie and the beautiful, its simultaneous rocking and thinking, and its timeless blend of musicianship and mass appeal. If you listen to hard rock and like to chill out someimes, this album without a doubt has a place in your music library.

B0002OERI0|5.0|It really is! The most perfect thing ever written. <br />Losing the mastertape turned out to be the best thing that ever happend to Green Day. <br />This album really got me into Green Day. <br />I decided to buy it after I had seen the cool video for  <br />American Idiot. So this is what I think about the songs. <br /> <br />American Idiot: Great lyrics, good song and I love the bass <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia: This 9 and a half minute song is just perfect and I know by now all the words because it's so good and I listen to it a lot! <br /> <br />Holiday: The new single right now is great especially in the end when the bass makes your whole room vibrate. <br /> <br />Blvd of Broken Dreams: Great song but not the best ballad of this album acually... <br /> <br />Are We the Waiting: I just love Billie Joes voice in this song and it's really sad too. <br /> <br />St Jimmy: This song is really fast and just great! Took a while for me to love but no that I do I can't stop listening to it! <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine: Also a beautiful slow song about not being able to handle it all anymore. <br /> <br />She's a Rebel: In this song the music is really everything. Whithout it that song wouldn't have made it on that record. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl: Beautiful song about the love for Whatshername. <br /> <br />Letterbomb: My favorite right now. Really a big explosion of great sound and lyrics. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends: The best ballad by Green Day. Dedicated to Billie Joe's father who died in cancer when he was just 10 years old. You can tell, this song is really emotionell.  <br /> <br />Homecoming: About 10-11 minutes devided into 5 parts. Really good and I bet it's even better then Jesus of Suburbia. But that's my opinion. <br /> <br />Whatshername: Great song too and a perfect ending to a perfect album
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Tom Cruise, a bad guy? It works! Let's see more of that. What can I say about this movie. It was a thrill to behold. The action was non-stop and had you later wanting to tell your friends about the cool moves Tom pulls, especially in the dance club sequence. It was oddly humorous, in a morbid kind of way. The way Vincent, Tom's character, refers to the people he has just knocked off makes you grin a little, even though you know you shouldn't. Vincent is an assassin, and even though he is bad, is a likable guy. Jamie Foxx was marvelous as well, and makes you really feel for Max, his character. The movie ends in a show down between Max and Victor, and I was not sure whom I wanted to win. The movie leaves you with a rather poetic message, with the loser saying, \\"How long do you think it'll be befor anyone knows I'm dead.\\" This movie is a must see, trust me on this one.
B00005JMEW|3.0|this movie , though good, is probably not as good as you hope. The action is exciting, but not very realistic, a cartoonish gore. The movie has a sense of humor that fits well, but overall just fails to make the movie a star. the sequel however is  a real winner and you must see this one first.
B0007TKH66|4.0|I as a long time fan of Star Trek I feel it was a good job of casting the actors.  <br /> I as many other fans wished to see more of the missions that got the crew into sticky situation like the many times Kirk and Picard and their crews encounted the strange and unique.  <br /> War is not what the true fans want, it is true that some war like the Romulan war was to be expected.  <br /> I feel Star Trek is for the imagination and ( To boldly go were no one has gone before ) we have to much war and that is why  this series of Enterprise is not making it to the seventh season. <br /> Many all of you that at true fans of Star Trek............ LIVE LONG AND PROSPER !!
B000002UAR|5.0|I ORIGINALLY WROTE THIS WHEN I WAS ABOUT 19 AND ON A HUGE TODD RUNDGREN KICK. I HAVE SLIGHTLY REVISED IT SLIGHTLY SINCE THEN TO PULL IT MORE IN LINE WITH MY CURRENT VIEW OF THE ALBUM. THE REVIEW MAY STILL SHOW SIGNS OF IMMATURE TASTE OR YOUTHFUL OVER-ENTHUSIASM.    Now, I'm a bit hesitant to review this album.  Before I begin, let me warn you that I am in fact a die-hard Beatlemaniac.  However, if you don't share my particular zeal for the fab four, don't be scared away by my fanaticism.  I was never this way BEFORE I heard this album.  When I was about nine years old, my dad was copying some of his LPs to cassette and made me a tape with some Beatles on it.  The first thing on the tape was Revolver (albeit the American version - missing a couple of stellar Lennon tracks).  Let me just say that my developing mind was absolutely blown.  There are few albums from my youth that I can look back on and still honestly say that my taste was in the right.  This is one of the few.  From the jerky British boogie of \\"Taxman\\" to the dizzying psychedelic miasma of \\"Tomorrow Never Knows,\\" every single track on this album is a KNOCKOUT!!! (Except maybe \\"Doctor Robert\\").  This is the album where the Beatles completed the transformation from the scruffy teeny boppers to brainy rock and roll experimenters.  Though Sgt. Pepper pushed the Beatles sound in an even more unconventional direction; the lush horns, sitars, backwards guitar solos, subtle but clever drumming, and impeccable pop harmonies all gelled here in a way that not even that album could match.  From the moment I first played this album in my walkman 12 years ago, I KNEW I wanted to be a pop musician.  To this day Revolver is my favorite album of all time.  If there is an album I would recommend to ANYONE as the single most essential purchase in the realm of pop music, this would be it.  Avant garde enough at times, but still grounded in solid pop!  How did they do this?
B000005HAU|5.0|This guy is my favorite guitarist around now, he plays with the finesse of benson (without the oily smooth jazz) and with the spirit of django. In respone to the fellow above, I am an American who appreciates Bireli and I like his style best due to fact most contemporary \\"jazz\\" guitarists from america fall in to the fusion cliche or try too hard to be traditional (Howard Alden, Pizzarelli) or to hard be different(frisell,scofield, etc.).
B0002I831S|5.0|I enjoyed the show when it aired originally in the late 60's and when I watched the re-runs after Star Trek TNG in the 1980's.  I have not seen the show in nearly 15 years and it was as good as I remember it!  I do not like the fact the DVD will not play the shows straight through, rather you must re-select the play mode or return the main menu with the titles on the view screen.  Really a minor complaint that I found on all three seasons, but one I can live with!  :)  If you are worried about the high price, I was... It is worth it.  All the Star Trek shows are \\"too-high priced\\" Ouch :( and I am sure most of us agree.  Hint for you Paramount! :(
B0007TX894|5.0|If you haven't heard anything by Porcupine Tree, then this album is a great place to start.<br /><br />Following in the large footsteps of their groundbreaking 2002 release, \\"In Absentia\\", Stephen Wilson has crafted yet another masterpiece. With \\"Deadwing\\", Porcupine Tree have mastered the art of blurring the lines between genres. The album combines progressive metal's heavy guitar crunch with the warm passion of radio-friendly pop-rock, always retaining that vintage Porcupine Tree psychedelic atmosphere.<br /><br />If you think about it, it's really a daunting task. Porcupine Tree have a remarkably organic sound and they execute it almost effortlessly. Even fellow prog-rock juggernauts Spock's Beard have distilled and one-dimensional songs that never take off with imaginative fireworks. Other bands, like the hyper-progressive Magellan cram as much musical firepower as they can into every song to the point that it makes your head ache. Stephen Wilson and the `Tree keep every element in check and make \\"Deadwing\\" come alive.<br /><br />All the innovative elements of \\"In Absentia\\" are here: heavier songs, a greater focus on Wilson's guitar work and singing, and a profound emotional depth. Heavier pieces like \\"Shallow\\" and \\"Halo\\" emphasize the guitar and, surprisingly, the bass lines rather than the synthesized elements of earlier albums, giving the songs a more authentic sound and an added appeal. This convention is comforting, really. The British band's earlier recordings contained songs that were simply ambient sound with little or no apparent instrumentation.<br /><br />This is not to say that the album is heavier on the whole. Although some come close, no song ever reaches the intensity of their previous album's face scratching \\"Wedding Nails\\". The overall heaviness of the album is kept slightly lower than its predecessor by certain standout tracks. The tear jerking \\"Lazarus\\" is guided by a cheery piano, accompanied by Wilson's soft, vulnerable voice. The song's painfully melodic textures are reminiscent of mainstream artist Pete Yorn. The album's hidden track, \\"Shesmovedon\\" (a remake of an earlier song), is another classic Porcupine Tree gem - acoustic guitars layering Wilson's harmonized vocals, soft-to-angry guitars and a heartbreaking narrative (\\"She changes every time you look, By summer it was all gone - now she's moved on\\").<br /><br />The majority of \\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is led by a repeated guitar line (very reminiscent of earlier, trance-like albums), but builds in intensity until it is a straightforward rock number, ending with a beautiful vocal arrangement. Similarly, \\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" leads you across its landscapes with a slow, repeating twang, stopping occasionally to let Wilson's delicate, almost feminine voice take the spotlight. Although not a spectacular cut, it follows the format.<br /><br />But the album's truly outstanding pieces are also the longest. The title-track almost touches the 10-minute mark and exemplifies everything that makes Porcupine Tree such a noteworthy creative force. The song is framed by a repeated keyboard and a pounding bass line, joined by a reckless guitar and fast drums. Like most of the other offerings on \\"Deadwing\\", it is both catchy and technically challenging. In addition to exploring the trance-inducing textures that have characterized the band's catalogue, the song flaunts the edgy, bleak voice of Opeth's frontman Mikael &#506;kerfeldt.<br /><br />And now we come to the album's magnum opus, the song everyone's talking about - the multi-dimensional \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\". The piece is a musical feast of every Porcupine Tree element thus far, and at 12 minutes it feels more like a generous buffet. It begins with a hypnotic keyboard/synthesizer duo, which is later joined by an ominous guitar and the dual attack of Wilson's and &#506;kerfeldt's morose voices. At the 4-minute mark, the song erupts with drums and a simple but impressive guitar solo. From here, the song builds in intensity, adding layer upon layer of guitars and keyboards, coming to a maddening halt around the 9-minute mark, where &#506;kerfeldt's guitar work shines in a soothing solo. The song finishes brilliantly, fading with its original melody.<br /><br />The cynical listener may chime in by claiming that \\"Deadwing\\" is a clone of \\"In Absentia\\" with a few bonus tricks. To be perfectly honest, it's a decently accurate description. But replicating \\"In Absentia\\", a modern masterpiece in the inscrutable arena of progressive rock, would be impossible. Porcupine Tree have taken a canonical album and explored the limits in each direction. The work is truly a five-star effort and a reassuring deposit into the constantly evolving world of progressive rock.<br /><br />See also: Porcupine Tree - In Absentia, Opeth - Damnationr solo.

B0002ZDVEU|2.0|As agent Bourne runs frantically from continent to continent to escape his hunters he drops a suitcase. This is early in the film. What's in that suitcase? The plot. Some acting. Large dosages of common sense. Oh, and the script. Sadly, the suitcase and its contents never get recovered. <br /> <br />   While the first Bourne installment was one of those rare cases of action films that actually did have a plausible story, good acting and directing, this one lacks all three. And lacking on all three it even adds up some further faults to undermine the whole affair even more. <br />   The curse of the sequels? It hardly matters since as a sequel this film is simply a ghost of its predecessor, and a very unconvincing ghost at that. <br /> <br />    The director decided to employ this simple trick: seeing that he's got zero plot to work with, he manically over-edited the film creating something that looks like a hyper-extended version of a long video clip. As it is with such video clips, your interest in the film will probably last a brave 10-15 minutes and it will all go downhill from there on. <br /> <br />    There's no need to go deeper into this. Anyone who's seen it knows it has very little to do with the very succesful \\"Bourne Identity\\". That in turn is a pity because the first film had all the elements in place to keep the recipe functional in the sequel as well. <br />   Why was it all discarded then? We wont know and we wont care. <br />   At my kindest, i'd say this is worth the rental but then make sure you've got some friends over and several alternative plans on what to do when your eyes start wandering off the screen and onto other things. <br />

B00002E224|1.0|The depressiing and boring first encounter of two blathering people with bad teeth and no interesting stories to tell. This is one of the worst movies I've ever watched 20 minutes of before realizing that life is short and this was not time well spent. Even turning off the sound can't save you from the terrible pain that comes with this movie. They clearly can't get enough of themselves. If it was possible to talk, walk aimlessly, kiss and bore people to death they would do it. Mind you, they came very close. <br />If you're hoping to become depressed, or looking for an alternative to a sleeping pill, by all means, watch this movie. Otherwise, stay far away from this total abomination of a movie.

B0002YLC24|1.0|I did not like Before Sunrise and basically got this movie to see scenes of Paris. Unfortunately, the two boring talking heads of the main characters kept getting in the way. There are many tedious scenes of them just sitting and blabbering on and on. I don't know how anyone can find this sweet and romantic. I set the DVD to french to minimize the pain, but it was still unbearable to see constant close-ups of their yellowing teeth which were constantly visible with them talking about their terribly boring lives. <br /> <br />And Ethan Hawke! Are you kidding, with that shirt? Who would fall in love with a guy wearing a bowling shirt? He also needs to shave. <br /> <br />Next time I want to see Paris, I'll simply fly there. The 7-hour plane ride was a lot less boring than this movie.
B0002KPIQY|2.0|To be honest, I did not know anything about Gia Carangi when I picked this DVD up.  Now that I've seen the film, I know a bit about her life.  That is all fine & well, but I remain unmoved.<br /><br />Angelina Jolie turns in one of her finest performances in this film.  She also looks terrific minus her clothes, and the lesbian scenes are erotic.  The film is well done and the final scene is downright artistic.  Also, the makeup artists did a fantastic job making Jolie go from looking drop-dead-gorgeous to looking like death warmed over (and back again) repeatedly.<br /><br />So why only 2 stars, you ask?  Well, the problem I have with the movie is that Gia Carangi is not a particularly interesting person.  Beyond her beauty there is not a whole lot to her.  She seemed very shallow and superficial and there was very little that was genuine about her.  She does not evoke a whole lot of sympathy as her series of bad decisions leave one more apt to say \\"What is she DOING?\\" rather than \\"Wow, she is a really a victim of circumstances!\\"  Some may call her story tragic.  I call it pathetic.<br /><br />With that in mind, I would recommend this DVD to two demographics:  those who are big fans of Angelina Jolie and those who are big fans of Gia Carangi.  Other than that, most will not find a whole lot of appealing or dramatic material here.
B00005JNVS|5.0|I think Roger Ebert said it best by stating that Kung Fu Hustle (the latest from actor/director/screenwriter Stephen Chow) is a mix of Jackie Chan, Buster Keaton, Quentin Tarantino and Bugs Bunny.  If that combination makes you laugh then you will undoubtably love this movie.      The beginning brilliantly sets up the antagonists by showing how ruthless and bloodthirsty they are before going to the beginning credits and having the Axe Gang then dance to the music.  It's a wonderful beginning, showing the dichotomy of a ruthless gang that dances like they belong in a musical.  Very funny.      When the movie begins in earnest, we are introduced to Pig Sty Alley where poor people are scrambling to live day by day.  Stephen Chow populates his area with wonderful characters who are hillariously funny and different from each other.  They all have motives, sometimes hidden, and it makes watching them quite humorous.      But what Kung Fu Hustle does best is play with the martial arts conventions.  Like Wuxia films, the characters possess supernatural abilities to send swords flying by playing instruments and other plot spoiling devices.  But unlike some Wuxia films like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, they are taken to the extreme as a sort of satire of the genre while at the same time embracing everything wonderful about those films.  The martial arts are spot on, having been done by the wonderful choreographer of The Matrix and Kill Bill Woo-ping Yuen.  Yet unlike those films and again in touch with the style of the movie, the action is playful.      The violence is over the top, stylized with sequenes that remind us of the Looney Tunes cartoons.  In fact, Stephen Chow incorporates a lot of homages to American Cinema with quotes in line with Spider Man and the Matrix and even a sound sampling from the Matrix in a couple scenes.  It's funny to catch.      Overall a terrific film that incorporates Oriental cinema with Western cinema.  Brilliantly shot, written and acted,it successfully merges many totally disparate genres into a movie that satirizes, makes homages to, and transcends the martial arts genres.  Absolutely wonderful a must see for all fans.

B0007TKNL0|2.0|this is perhaps the worst musical i've ever viewed. horrible songs except the 1st song sang by the heroine on the stage, all the other songs were so horrible that almost drove me and my wife crazy. the song writers did a horrible job, all they did were either making the ugly and boring tunes repeat and repeat, again and again or, my god, making every ending tune suddenly high up, lower down, and repeat it again and again, so single-mindedly monotonus and dead-beat. the phantom's voice was the worst and most horrible voice i've ever heard, a struggling, coarse, limited and broken voice, it was so terrible. so many boring repeated again and again alley-cat-like singings, the contents of the songs were so bad, so hollow, so brain-dead, so meaningless. my ears have never been felt so uncomfortable before. the storyline was also so shallow and illgoical with lot of holes. horrible music tunes and songs. the song and music writers should change their professions as soon as possible. horrible! what a waste of production!<br />i've heard a joke before that if you want to make those life-without-parole murderers, rapists to commit suicides or hang themselves in jail, the best tender mercy way to do is to broadcast 'the sound of the music' in every cell, 24/7 non-stopping. all those convicts would become crazy in 7 days, kill themselves within 2 weeks.<br />well, folks, now, i think i've got a better one.
B0007GAERG|5.0|After reading most of the reviews here I can say this album is really universal. For ones the best songs of the cd are the worst for others, but almost all say the same is an excellent album.    My favorite songs are We Belong Together, Stay the Night, Circles, Joy Ride and I wish you knew, but everyone has different favorites.    I am very happy for Mariah, she rarely recive the recognition that she deserves, she was the first that innovates the sounds that a lot of singer use now, she is entatly to bad years after all she is human even with that voice.    If you want to read a detail description of each song you will find a lot of those here, but the only sure thing you need to know is that THIS CD IS EXCELLENT, SOMETING FOR EVERYONE, ENJOY IT!!!!!!
B0006J28BO|4.0|The purpose of this review is to encourage Amazon.com browsers to take a look at \\"The Cat Returns\\".  Filled with likeable characters and lush watercolors, this is a real charmer of a movie.   <br /> <br />Other reviewers have indicated that this film doesn't show the same polish and elan of Ghibli films by Hayao Miyazaki.  This is true, but at the same time, the film stands heads and shoulders above most of the drivel produced in both Japanese and American movie studios.  Having spent several years in Japan, the opening scene, in which we are introduced to the heroine as she fumbles her way to school (not really a spoiler) not only acts as a cute way to introduce the main character, but, fyi, is deadly accurate in terms of realism. I rewatched the scene several times just because of the nostalgia it evoked.  <br /> <br />Think of the film as \\"Ghibli Lite\\" - less filling than stuff by the Master Miyazaki, but still filled with darn great taste. <br /> <br />

B000006TRV|5.0|Don't bother comparing it with other Pink Floyd albums. Don't listen to people who don't like it because it's \\"too long\\", \\"too weird\\", \\"too depressing\\" or anything like that. This is the definitive concept album of all time. No album has used a story to convey the emotion, philosophy, and overall knowledge of its author than \\"The Wall\\". <br />Roger Waters made a masterpiece here. Some criticize him, saying that he became a control freak and forced his ideas upon the rest of the band. How can anyone blame him? His vision for \\"The Wall\\" was so perfect that he did not want it to be tarnished by other influences. Besides, the other Pink Floyd members did not have much quality material to bring to the table anyway, and what little they had (Gilmour's collaborations on \\"Comfortably Numb\\", \\"Young Lust\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\") Roger Waters gladly accepted.  <br />The album focuses on themes of alienation and the metaphorical walls that we build around ourselves to protect ourselves from the harsh realities of life. Each traumatic event in our life is a building block for this wall. Roger Waters' motifs and symbols have been interpreted by hundreds and are still analyzed to this day. The amount of complexity in the lyrics is staggering. This album has the literary effect that any classic novel can bring, along with music that rivals any band at their best.  <br />Musically, this album has no equal. It is not the dreamy, atmospheric sound of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". It is much more dark and melancholy than that album. It also tends to be more rock-oriented, shedding psycadelic tendencies for arena rock-esque riffs and rocking songs. But that shouldn't turn any \\"Dark Side\\" fans away. It's just as significant as that album was. It has production and musicianship that surpasses anything the Floyd had previously done. This album proves that Pink Floyd could work in a variety of different sounds, yet still retain their trademark sound, as \\"Dark Side\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\" and \\"Animals\\" did. <br />This album has changed my life. It's made me more aware of the effect that the past can have on our lives, and the consequences of loneliness. There's too many insights that I've gained from this album, and they're probably different for everybody else anyway. Basically, this album needs to be given a chance by everyone. It's sheer brilliance will really astound you.
B000003FPN|4.0|These are 'spot on', the lodestones for Dvorak's \\"From the New World\\" & Smetana's \\"Carnival Overture\\"  Wow&#8252;  The local classical station, KBAQ, had played \\"...'Carnival Overture'...

0316172324|5.0|Gladwell covers a broad range of topics as he studies how we make decisions in the \\"blink\\" of an eye.  He details numerous studies that shed light on how we make decisions, and how our subconscience influences those decisions.  A sampling of the applications covered: art, Coca-Cola v. Pepsi, Aeron office chairs, facial expressions, implicit race discrimination tests, police procedure, auditions for symphonies, top 40 radio, autism, market research, marital counseling and much more.  Gladwell writes a very readable, engaging book that will prompt many questions on how we view the world and the many things that affect us.  This book is one of the most unexpectedly interesting books that I have read this year and I would recommend it for anybody who is curious about how the mind works.
B0000028M7|5.0|This album is truly depressing. It's also brilliant, and it's  one of my favorite albums of all time. Layne Staley and Jerry Cantrell, in my strong opinion, put Kurt Cobain to shame in terms of honest songwriting. Maybe Kurt is remembered more as a \\"martyr\\" for the grunge movement, but these two suffered just as much as he did, wrote about it better, and were much more talented than him. It's my opinion that Alice in Chains should never be compared to any Seattle bands because they were a step ahead in terms of maturity and honesty.  <br />The songs themselves are hard rock classics. Even casual fans of Alice in Chains should know the classics \\"Angry Chair\\", \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Would?\\". But even the lesser known songs are fantastic and resonate deeply, within or outside of the context of the album.  <br />The album is not meant to be listened to often. Its themes often include death wishes, regrets, pain, addiction, and dejection. This is what pain is about. No band before or since has really captured pain so personally, nor so well, on record.  <br />The music itself is generally in the hard rock vein that was typical of the early nineties. But it goes far beyond the mundane musicianship that typifies the Grunge scene. It runs a strong range of dynamics on songs like \\"Down in a Hole\\" and \\"Rooster\\". Songs like \\"Rain When I Die\\" and \\"Would?\\" show musicianship and songwriting talent in which beauty shines through, even if the themes are dark and ugly. That is not often seen by other mainstream hard rock acts. On top of that, in order to keep the album interesting, the musicianship is fantastic. The melodies are often juxtaposed against odd time signatures and meandering song structures, and the harmonies and melodies are fantastic. Jerry Cantrell is truly man of the hour on this album, with great lead and backup vocals and fantastic guitar work not only in his solos, but his emotive rhythm playing, and expressive tone, without which the album would not have as strong an effect upon the listener.  <br />All in all, this album should be experienced by all. It is truly a revelation to witness the amount of sadness that can grow to dominate one's life. It should not be lumped in with grunge because it does not typify the scene's attitude of rebellion and slackerdom. But if it must be included, it definitely is the high-water mark for the grunge movement(not Nirvana's criminally overrated \\"Nevermind\\"). Don't let the media's neglect of this band fool you. They've created a modern masterpiece here, and I feel it's time they were given their respects.
B00000E5ES|5.0|My name is Max D. and I am 16. Most kids my age are listening to rap or that incomprehensive heavy metal, garage, screaming goobaldeegock music. Me however, love classic rock and I love U2.<br />U2 have had some good albums in their career with 'Zooropa' and 'Pop' and they have had great albums with the 'Unforgettable Fire' and 'All That You Can't Leave Behind'. But 'Achtung Baby' deserves to be up there with the 'Joshua Tree' and 'How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb'. The album starts off with Zoo Station. Even Better Then The Real Thing is a cool-feeling tune that many will enjoy. The slow One is a journey all on it's own with three levels of intensity. Bono's voice in Until The End Of The World and Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses? is superb. Then things get technical in the groovy jingle The Fly. Listen to the double chorus, will you. Bono start's his trademark wailing into the microphone for Mystery Ways. Things go back to normal in Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World. The last three songs are too genius to sum up individually, so I will let you listen and judge.
B000000HHE|4.0|Don't Get Me Wrong. I love De La Soul's brand of intelligent, humorous hip-hop. In relation to most hip-hop groups, they've always been \\"One Step ahead of it\\" (to quote Dave on their latest release \\"The Grind Date\\"). But I think that their later releases are much better than this, their debut. It may be considered a classic because it is so different than all other albums, but I think that it suffers from a lot of wasted time. <br />     Most songs on the album are great. There's too many great ones to name, but my top three are \\"Ghetto Thang\\", \\"Plug Tunin'\\", and \\"This is A Recording...\\" There's some fantastic production by Prince Paul on all of these songs, and throughout the entire album. That's the high point of the release. Also the lyrics of Posdnous and Trugoy are fantastic as they always are. Their flows sound somewhat dated compared to later releases, but at this point in time, hip-hop still had a lot of evolution to go through. The lyrics themselves are what's important here, and they're pretty solid.  <br />     The best part of this CD is the positive vibe that runs through it. There's some great hip-hop out there, and some of the good stuff is really intelligent. But even the most intelligent stuff is often depressing and discusses negative things, like violence and problems in urban america. A lot of it even talks about how bad the state of current rap is. This is the one release that really doesn't succumb to sadness. That's what is great about it.  <br />     There's just way too many skits on this. That's the only reason it's four stars instead of five. I know that skits are really popular in hip-hop and almost every album has some. But they really get annoying after awhile on this one, especially after repeated listenings. The game show concept is fun the first time through, but once the jokes get old, so do the skits. Its the main detriment of this album.  <br />     Overall, though, the album is definitely a great listen. In my opinion, it'snot as good as other De La works, such as \\"Stakes is High\\" or even \\"The Grind Date\\", but I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys hip-hop that's positive, intelligent, and fun. Even though \\"3 Feet High and Rising\\" tends to be unenjoyable on repeated listenings, it definitely deserves the amount of respect that it's garnered, and will always have its own place in hip-hop.
B0007TKNL0|1.0|Unsurprisingly, the pompous cacophony that was the film of the beautiful stage play, 'the Phantom of the Opera' was an outright failure at the box office internationally. There are several possible reasons for this : the utter lack of singing ability exhibited by its 2 leads (supposed to be musical geniuses!), the art direction which removed the Gothic from the story and replaced it with pure Disney, totally inexplicable directorial choices such as the inclusion of a horse in the underground scene during the title song (there may have been a horse in the book, but did it appear out of a sea of dry ice? Please!). <br /> <br />The play is powerful and emotive; the film is cheesier than a French fromagerie on International Cheese Day awaiting the arrival of the World Cheese Judging Panel for an all-night cheese-a-thon. <br /> <br />Hopefully, someday some-one will make a more thoughtful, imagainative, musically adept version of the play. Until then, avoid this DVD at all costs and save your money for the theatre.
0440242576|4.0|I really enjoyed this book from start to finish. It shows how the holiday season is way to much comercialized. It is very funny and it's very heartwarming. It's fun to read what the characters are doing becouse it's so true we would be doing the same as them if we were in the same situation. A christmas classic.
0060955775|4.0|This is the second novel I have read from Mr. Coelho. I found myself relating very much to the main character (Veronika) as she struggles with the pressures to conform. Being a teenager is not the only period of adjustment that people go through. I find being in my early 20's to be almost as confusing. <br /> <br />This book also gives an interesting perspective on mental institutions that I had not considered before. For example, no behavior dispalyed inside an institution is considered unusual or crazy because it is assumed that everyone is crazy anyhow. There is stability in scheduling and no need to get dressed up for work. I never viewed being institutionalized as a positive thing but this book almost makes it seem like an odd vacation. <br /> <br />Ultimately this story is about coming to face death. Witnessing Veronika living her supposed last week of life brings a sense of urgency by which the other patients question their own lives. What have they given up? What do they hope for? What is keeping them from living the way they desire? <br /> <br />This is a wonderful moralistic story and I strongly recommend it to anyone experiencing a quarter-life crisis.
0312995423|3.0|I have read all of Dan Browns books and I found this one to be his worse as of May 2005. I found the story to drag on at times and not enough action or suspence like his other novels. The characters are o.k but there not as intreging as Robert Lungdon or the main character from Deception point. Overall it was an o.k book and a must read for all Dan Brown fans but it's not his best work.
B000066F6H|4.0|When you think of Swedish music, ABBA and other embarrassments come to mind. Well, scratch that impression. In 2000, the American rock scene got its blast of Swedish punk rock from the Hives, who got attention with the raw energy and raging music of \\"Veni Vidi Vicious.\\"<br /><br />Their breakout album is a lot more assured than their relatively clumsy debut, \\"Barely Legal.\\" It kicks off with some catchy riffs, joined rapidly by some heavy percussion and unholy yells from Howlin' Pelle. That's only the first minute and a half, an explosive opener called \\"Declare Guerre Nucleaire.\\" (The meaning is pretty obvious)<br /><br />That sets the tone for the rest of the album, with its mix of hard rock and aggressive yells. Some of them, like \\"Statecontrol\\" and \\"A Get Together To Tear It Apart\\" are almost dizzyingly fast-paced, while songs like \\"Main Offender\\" are catchy enough to count as genuine singles. Fortunately, they don't sacrifice too much of the aggressive rockin' for catchiness.<br /><br />The Hives have done their homework, unlike many a whiny faux-punk band. What makes rock'n'roll like this enjoyable is not laments about how your girlfriend left you, but explosive energy and a bit of hell-raising. I don't know if the Hives hell-raise in real-life, but in \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" they sound about ready to. And love every minute, too.<br /><br />Like many popular rock bands, they have a lot of classic rock echoes -- most notably Iggy and the Stooges. Despite a lot of unfortunate hype surrounding them, here's nothing original or groundbreaking about the Hives. They simply move faster and with more energy, and their lack of pretention is what makes them entertaining.<br /><br />Howlin' Pelle is well-known now for living up to his name -- at least the \\"howlin'\\" prt. He shrieks, he yowls, he yells, he yelps, he wails. He even sings a little, in a very hammy manner, in the wickedly tongue-in-cheek \\"Find Another Girl.\\" But mostly he howls, and that gets a bit annoying after awhile -- especially since he actually has a pretty decent singing voice.<br /><br />Fast, rip-roaring and full of earthy energy, \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" is a fun rock'n'roll listen, despite the over-the-topness of Howlin Pelle.s a pretty decent singing voice.     Fast, rip-roaring and full of earthy energy, \\"Veni Vidi Vicious\\" is a fun rock'n'roll listen, despite the over-the-topness of Howlin Pelle.
1400031362|1.0|I really enjoyed the first book then the second was dissapointing and this one was really dissapointing. O.k the first one was mainly about the main character working as a detective solving crimes that people ask her to do. Then this one has hardly no detective work. It focuses more on the main characters life outside work which is o.k I ebjoed that in the first book but it's not the same in this book. It just drags on and on and on. Bring back more detective work in the series of books.
B00020PO8Q|4.0|British band Muse broke out in the US with their third album \\"Absolution,\\" and establishing them as a remarkable new rock band. They're epic, intensedark, and majestic in a proggy-Pink-Floyd-meets-Led-Zeppelin kind of way, and so it's hardly a surprise that \\"Hullabaloo\\" is a remarkably strong collection.<br /><br />No, it's not a new album. Rather, it's a collection of B-sides, rarities, and a 2001 live concert. Most bands don't sound too great in either case, but Muse does. The first disc is made up of their B-sides and rarities, which tend to be quite good actually.<br /><br />It doesn't start off promising, with the schizophrenic prog-rocker \\"Forced In,\\" which would be fine if it weren't for the endlessly cycling synth that obscures everything else. But things get stronger after that, with the explosive downward spiral that is \\"Shrinking Universe\\" (\\"There's nothing left to die for!\\"), the softer poppy \\"Recess,\\" and the surprisingly gentle acoustic ballad \\"Map Of your Head.\\"<br /><br />Most of the other songs follow those examples, either being epic and bombastic or quieter and more intimate. With, of course, some eerier songs thrown in, like the rippling sweetness of \\"Shine Acoustic.\\" Are they as good as Muse's proper albums, especially since a few B-sides sound like the lost soundtrack of the X-Files? Not really, but they are remarkably good, and still better than average.<br /><br />Which brings us to the live performance, which took place in October of 2001, in Paris's \\"Le Zenith.\\" Well, to put it simply, these guys rock. It opens with a cheering crowd, right before they kick off into a tornado of bass, drums and guitar. Unlike many rock bands, these guys lose none of their power or musical richness in live performances.<br /><br />The inevitable flaw? Well, that would probably be Matt Bellamy -- he doesn't sound too different from in the albums, but it's sometimes hard to hear him above the drums, explosive synth and spiralling bass. However, the guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing. If Muse are known for their prowess in live performances, then it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The B-sides are a minor treasure trove, while the live album is a gem in itself, bringing their concert to life as nothing -- except a DVD -- could. A must-have for Muse fans.wever, the guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing.

1400031354|2.0|After reading the first book which I loved I could not wait to read the second in the series and I was very disapointed. I found it did not have ebought mystery as the first one did. It focus's more on the main characters life I liked that in the first book but now it's just boring.I want more of her detective work. When they do have her detective work it's good and it's a page turner. Overall not as good as the first but I want to read the whole series to see what happends int he future.
B0006SKV0A|3.0|Homages, hat-tips and disco-punk are the thing in LCD Soundsystem, brainchild of James Murphy. There's nothing here to get it nominated for \\"Best album of the year,\\" but the self-titled dance album has both its good and bad sides -- the main disc is middling, while the second is marvelously weird.<br /><br />The catchy, fuzzy single \\"Daft Punk Is Playing At My House\\" kicks things off in a not-so-great note -- it's a fun song, but not one to listen to multiple times. From there on, LCD Soundsystem trips merrily off to swoony technoballads, ear-blistering electronic waves, and vaguely muffled yowls from Murphy, who sometimes sounds like he's being eaten by the drum set.<br /><br />It's a tripwire-taut, catchy collection of melodies, with that slightly jerky edge that is currently in vogue with some top-selling indierock bands. Like those bands, LCD Soundsystem has some debts owed to Brian Eno, Wire, and the Fall. It's entertaining, but it's also not terribly memorable.<br /><br />That changes with the second disc, which is a few tracks shorter but makes up for any lack of creativity in the first disc. Here the beats are less intense, the music is fringed with ambient sweeps, and everything feels more comfortable and looser. It's like wearing a broken-in sneaker, versus the new, stiff tennis shoes -- read, the first disc.<br /><br />There are slow numbers, interspersed with wild beats and filtered vocals, and tightly-wound little dance numbers, as stripped-down as a dance-punk sound can be. It ends on a surprising note, with the chaotic-sounding \\"Tired\\" and two versions of the song \\"Yeah.\\" The crass version is more openly dancey, while the pretentious version is trippy and dense.<br /><br />It takes awhile for this dancey punky swippy electroclash to really catch on -- initially it sounds like the same ol', same ol', especially in the very overrated \\"Daft Punk...\\" song. How often can we hear Murphy ending lines with \\"... at my house... MY HOUSE!\\" before wanting to go back to ours? The music has some solid basslines, beats and vaguely retro sounds, but it isn't terribly memorable.<br /><br />The first disc is too repetitive and dancey, as if made specifically for clubbing. Fortunately, it is saved by the bonus disc. This stuff is more creative, less dancey, and none of those six precious tracks is a dull one. They have stranger melodies, spoken lyrics, and even panpipes played in one song. Wild! Wicked!<br /><br />LCD Soundsystem's debut album is a fun listen, mostly because of the second disc. The basic dancepunk songs are middling to annoying, but the weirder songs are bliss.before wanting to go back to ours?

B000002UAU|5.0|This was my first Beatles album. All of the songs intrigued me in a way where I wanted to understand it more. The creativeness that went into each and every song made it a joy to listen too. My personal favorite song on the collection is Good Morning, Good Morning because of it's wittieness. Their songs have a distinct feel to them which make them classics.
B0001I562I|5.0|One of the best movies of all time!  A look back into the 80's, this time with a good movie!
B00000634J|5.0|I think that all of the songs on this CD, are even better than some of The Beatles songs. They have some of the same style, but he makes the music into his own. Imagine is probably one of the greatest songs ever written and then performed by one of the most recgnizable musicians in history. All of this leads to one hell of a CD.
B0000025T6|5.0|The thing that I find very interesting about Bruce Springsteen is that he is many things to many people. There are people who enjoy coming to his concerts to hear the flat out rocker anthems such as Born in the USA and Born to Run and there are people who come to hear beautiful ballads like Incident on 57th Street, The River, If I Should Fall Behind, etc.     After the huge commercial success of The River, Bruce followed up that album with a sparse and stripped-down record entitled Nebraska. Gone were the pounding bass,drums, and electric guitars prominent in past E Street efforts. This album was bare-bones Bruce; just the Boss alone with guitar and harmonica. To be sure, this was risky stuff. Springsteen could have followed up with another rocking commercial album and cemented his reputation right then and there. But he didn't. Instead, he released this jewel of an album filled with great lyrics and great story telling. This album is so powerful that it just grabs you by the throat and won't let go. This is Springsteen's musical essay on the decline of the American dream. Stories of desperation and despair abound. Many of the central characters in these songs have lost their way and have found themselves on the fringes of society. As one other reviewer wrote, this is not great party music and it is not intended to be. It is dark, introspective and chilling.     There are many great songs on this record to recommend it: Nebraska, Atlantic City, Johnny 99, Mansion on the Hill, Highway Patrolman, and Reason to Believe (among others).     Bruce's later efforts to attempt a stripped down record with Tom Joad and Devils & Dust unfortunately don't come close to the power of Nebraska. Why would you want lesser imitations when you can have the real thing? There will be people reading this review who will be puzzled and wonder what all the fuss is about, but this album is simply a masterpiece and is arguably one of Bruce's all time best. Give it a chance. It grows on you....
B000001EG6|5.0|This is his top work. They have great songs that not many people know about. The music is great. Another unknown thing to many is that this is his 2nd CD. It is also his best. If anyone could write music like this it would be Elton John. He doesn't add a huge rock edge like I like it, but it has a great symphony part and has words that tell you a story. GREAT! WONDERFUL! All of this describes the album.
B00005AQF7|5.0|This is one of the best hip hop albums ever. Snoop kills beats with his flow. All the songs on here are top notch, no fillers at all. His cover of Slick Rick's La Di Da Di (Lodi Dodi) is just as good as Rick's, if not better, and the beat is ill. Dre took his production to a new level on this cd. Everyone should have this album. Snoop is calm through most of the songs. This is gangsta-pimp rap. You can listen to this album while driving your car, having a barbecue, or going to bed. By the way, Deeyar's reviews are all plagiarized. Look at his review of this album below. I just looked at a bunch of his other reviews and googled them and he copied them word for word. His reviews should be deleted. Taking credit for someone else's work? What a phoney.
B00006RAKP|5.0|This CD is filled with all of the songs I grew to know and love. This isn't as good as his 2nd album, but there's no way to beat that. All of the songs made me think \\"This is one hell of a CD\\". I loved these songs with the quick wording and thought provoking lyrics. This may be one of the best CDs ever made.
B0002ZYE1Y|4.0|The blockbuster sound and totally unique and innovative sounds that this band created on albums like Wishmaster and Century Child is now a signature, and each time Nightwish puts out a new release, I always expect something earth shattering, something that pushes the envelope further.   Not so with Once, though.  It is vintage Nightwish.   Tarja has never sounded better, the woman is a miracle of modern vocal presentations.  Other than Floor Jansen, there is no one else with the range, immaculate precision, and depth of this woman; She is angelic.    This recording is well written, and performed, but not groundbreaking the way many of their earlier albums were.  Not all recordings can be as significant as some of their others, where they were clearly inventing a new sound.  My personal opinion is that the material was tailored to the more commercially acceptable side of the band's writing and performing style, and rightfully so, as they are having a commercial breakthrough, which is great for the whole genre.  They are one of the few BIG acts in symphonic metal.    It is without a doubt more metalic in its symphonic landscape, but not to the detriment of the melodious flair that they always have.      I do like this record, for me though, it does not reach out and grab me by the throat the way many of their other collections have.  I'm definitely not lamenting that \\"the earlier stuff was better\\", as I always like to follow skilled and creative musicians down a path when they are changing.  Maybe thats what's missing for me here, the growth in songwriting and outrageous sounds and passages (although it is present on 'The Siren', and to some extent in Ghost Love Score).  But despite all my ramblings, this is still vintage Nightwish, solid, beautiful, bombastic, symphonic, and nearly perfect.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I have always appreciated Green Day for what they were and represented. However, with American Idiot they have shown growth and maturity as musicians that was totally unexpected.

B00004Y6RO|3.0|Although I am not a nu metal fan, with a few exceptions I find the genre rather stale, but two DJs and multiple percussionists were a novel inovation for metal and I was curious.  What would they sound like? So I plunked down my money and bought this the first Slipnot album, and well...  They don't quite pull it off.  The simplicity of the songs don't warrant a nine member band.  While I bet these guys look great live with that many people on stage, on album there is just too much redundancy, and the sound gets cluttered.  They just don't need that many people.  The vocals are another story.  For the most part Corey is completely over-the-top and screams his lungs out.  I've got no problem with passion but the delivery gets pretty monotonous pretty fast, and the lyrics don't make it for me.  I know he's angry, but I'm not quite sure why he rants with such ferocity at some unamed \\"you\\".  Also, if you overuse a word, or constantly repeat it, the repetition eventially drains all power from said word.  Such is Corey's use of the word f*ck.  It's said so many times that it becomes meaningless.  After three songs replete with said f-word he might as well have been screaming \\"booger!\\" for all the impact it had.<br /><br />Now about the band's image.  I don't mind it, the creepy masks and jumpsuits give Slipnot a unified theme to their look.  I know many people think of it as cheesy, well I like a lot of black metal and I don't think there has ever been a cheesier look than corpsepaint and spikes.  Ultimately music is for listening and if the music is good I don't care if the people playing it are in bunny suits.<br /><br />Unfortunately Slipnot, while an interesting concept musically and visually, just didn't have the chops or writing skills to make their concept work as well as it could.  They need to make their music more complex or arrange it more effectively for all the players to be heard.  To be fair, this is their debut album, but I found it a little disappointing.
B000286RKW|5.0|In 1990, Martin Scorsese made a movie about a real life gangster by the name of Henry Hill, who rose to power inside a mafia mob family during the 1950's.  <br /> <br />Ray Liotta stars as Henry Hill, and the story revolves around him and his experiences at living at the top of his world, only to come crashing down due to drug use and illegal operations that led to his arrest by the FBI. This movie also stars  the brilliant Robert De Niro and the equally fascinating Joe Pesci as Hill's fellow mob family members. <br /> <br />The first 5 minutes of the movie guarantee that you will never know what to expect, as a regular car trip by the three friends leads to a shocking violent ending to a man in the trunk of their car. I will say that there are more violent acts just like that, but that only adds to the raw, real story of the plot, which was a true story I might add again. <br /> <br />Liotta gives a great performance, having him narrate gives us a look at what Hill might have thought as his life continued to grow better as he met the mob bosses and their families, and how he became a slick young man with a wife, a girlfriend, and 30,000 dollars in cash that he pulls right out of his pocket. <br /> <br />The movie also shows us the cruel side of the gangsters, as they repeatedly attack their victims who don't pay money owed to them. But then they are shown as a family who always looks out for their family members, even if they aren't even related. Thats where the term Goodfellas come from: That they only invite Italians to become with them, because they were \\"Good fellas\\" <br /> <br />Scorsese clearly shows just how different the families can be, going around showing the guys with their girlfriends, how the wives come together to gossip, and how just how rich Hill and his friends are when they take their girlfriends out on dates. <br /> <br />Jimmy Conway, and Tommy De Vito, played by Robert De Niro [Conway] and Joe Pesci [De Vito] are shown as Hill's best friends,it was when Hill was a kid that he first met these two and they had been unseperable ever since.  <br /> <br />De Vito was the one that grabbed my attention, he was in some of the most funny and most shockingly violent scenes in the movie. From the funniest scene in which he is telling a story to his friends at a club; to him pulling a gun on a kid who tried to stand up for himself. Definately a show stealing performance by that man. <br /> <br />Critics of mob movies say that this is the greatest mob movie ever made. Once you watch this I guarantee you will agree with them as I did.  <br /> <br />The second disk of this two disk dvd set also has some great features as well: <br /> <br />GETTING MADE: Shows the documentary on how Goodfellas was made by both cast and crew <br /> <br />MADE MEN: THE GOODFELLAS LEGACY: The filmmakers, including Joe Canahan, The Hughes Brothers, and John Favreau, comment on the movie. <br /> <br />THE WORKADAY GANSTER: This takes a detailed look on the downside of being a gangster, from taking care of people, to being stalked by the FBI. Really a great look. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of Robert De Niro [Who I almost forgot to mention was great also] Ray Liotta, Joe Pesci, or Martin Scorsese movies, this is one collecters DVD you can't afford to miss.

0156012197|3.0|I read this book as part of a requirement in English class.  Granted that I was in a hurry to finish it the night before, this book is puzzling and in retrospect I should have read the book as well as the \\"Cliff Notes\\" to the book.  There's a lot of depth and meaning that is, or is claimed to be in this story.  For me, it was just a bunch of disconnected stories that didn't come together.  When deep meaning is couched in the form of a story, that's because the values of interest are too complex to explain without such context.  The Little Prince however, doesn't seem to add much useful context to help me understand what exactly it is that the author wants to get at.  I feel like this is a book that  humanities majors like, because scientists like me have a hard time understanding its obscurities. <br /> <br />All in all, this is one of the most boring books I've read.  Perhaps my opinion will change if I read it again some time in the future.  But for now, I highly recommend it for scientists, engineers, and doctors who have trouble falling asleep.

B00005JKNF|3.0|I like things that are efficient and functional.  Gosford Park is not.  It is a long-winded tale about the servants of rich people and how they interact with their masters/mistresses.  Two vivid moments were both about how two people could have connected, but they did not because of the constraints of the service.  A mother and son were separated, and she decided not to say anything to the son who does not find out his mother is still alive.  They serve different masters.  A romance begins to sprout between a young girl and a young man, but in the end it only results in a single kiss.  Such brief moments of feelings not acted upon would be trite if not for the fact that they occur in the dull monotony of servanthood.  In such a context, the viewer is shown the power of such points of decisions in a character's life.  If you have the time, or if your girlfriend really wants to see it, it's okay.  But has my life been enriched by the Gosford experience?  Not enough to just watch it on my own.  Go learn about saving for retirement instead, I say.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 destroyed their reputation by selling out and releasing 2 of the most cheapest and commercial albums ever made: All That You Can't Leave Behind and How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. In the end, both are the same album, divided in part 1 and 2.  <br /> <br />In the 90's U2 were one of the most innovative bands out there, and they simply released their best music ever: Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop. Avant garde music is not something popular, so it's quite predictable they sold \\"just\\" 8 million copies with Zooropa and 9 million copies with Pop. You can think both albums were a smash, indeed...but if you compare its sales with Joshua Tree (23 million copies), Achtung Baby (19 million copies) or All That You Can't Leave Behind (12 million copies) both records were quite ignored. <br /> <br />Moreover, after releasing the fantastic Grammy winner Zoo TV Live From Sidney in 1994, they released one the most flat boring Pop Mart concert performed in Latin America: Live from Mexico City 1997. The VHS didn't sell well, and the band got no awards for that concert...  <br /> <br />what happened after that?... another long silence, broken in mid 2000 when they opened their first ever official site: [...] in the begining it was much more artistic than now, and they never charged you anything for listening to new songs, e-cards, reading interviews, etc. <br /> <br />The biggest hype machine in U2's history supported their \\"back to their roots\\" album: All That You Can't Leave Behind. That album was praised as \\"the new Joshua Tree\\", but that was embarrassing reverence and both the mass media and U2 missed the point entirely. Everybody sold out. Mass media sold out because they want to be a part of the U2's party, and U2 sold out to MTV, super bowl, US goverment, Grammy Awards, etc. <br /> <br />While U2 were screaming ego, Bono's long hair and an almost non existent beard, hit and miss songs and stupid MTV commercials, they muted their whole creativity.  <br /> <br />After their most unoriginal and boring tour since UF - Elevation Tour - U2 just had to rest on their laurels for almost 4 years. Then they just had to market every new album album by licensing the tracks to commercials and soundtracks - yes, I'm talking about the corporate sellout iPod bulls***; relying on the power of corporate synergy and the \\"U2\\" trademark name alone. <br /> <br />Their 2000 \\"music\\" is just an insult to their 80's and 90's stuff. And this \\"Bomb\\" is the most dull and unoriginal album they've done. U2's music is absolutely vacant, but they'll always have tons of \\"fans\\" whom will buy any crap credited as \\"U2\\", Rolling Stone magazine, Grammy Awards, US arenas, Bono's face and the U2 name, no matter how vanilla corporate sellout its used.
0684857219|5.0|Initially, I thought this was another celebrity booklet written by a ghostwriter, but to my surprise Arnold actually has a lot of wisdom and knowledge to impart.  He attains credibility through his records in bodybuilding competitions.  Arnold goes beyond the hype of such competitions and describes events from behind-the-scenes perspectives.  From this book I wrote down a condensed set of figures on which I've depended on for the past two years in a gym.
1400032717|5.0|What a great book.  I couldn't put it down.  Fortunately, it is also very easy to read, so one can read it in a day, or less.  It is a very moving book, but the part near the end where Christopher travels to London by train is hilarious.  Everyone must read it!
0451191153|4.0|This book felt thick at first and I was concerned that I would soon tire of it, as I did with Dickens' Pickwick Papers.  But Rand proved to be successful at engaging my mind and heart.  I felt anger at the way merit was disregarded and hollow, \\"shell\\" echoes of old ideas were taken up by the masses.  After I put down the book one part still brings me to deep thought.  A woman has thrown herself into the world of charity and humanitarian efforts.  Rand asks however, what good are such efforts for the individual if that individual ends up denying the self?  Such apparently altruistic actions might actually cause one to lose oneself, and such blindly selfless individuals risk missing one's calling in life.  The ending didn't make sense to me, and I'm still puzzled by it.  However, Rand somehow makes me more curious than confused about the way the book ended.  In short, Rand was able to emotionally and intellectually engage the reviewer.  This is the kind of book that is worth buying, because more intellectual insights remain to be uncovered in the second reading.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Richard Matheson wrote the novel on which this movie is loosely based.

B0000399WI|5.0|This review refers to the one disc DVD edition of the film. <br /> <br />THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Tim Robbins, Morgan Freeman, Bob Gunton, William Sadler, Clancy Brown, Gil Bellows, Mark Rolston, Jeffrey DeMunn, Larry Brandenburg, Brian Libby, Neil Giuntoli, David Proval, Joseph Ragno, Paul McCrane, Jude Ciccolella, James Whitmore. Score Composed By Thomas Newman. Director of Photography Roger Deakins (B.S.C.). Based on the Short Novel \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" Written By Stephen King. Screenplay Written and Directed By Frank Darabont. This Film is Rated (R) For Violence, Profanity, Very Brief Nudity, Sexual Content and Suggested Rape; 142m. 1994. <br /> <br />WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Not surprisingly, this is a very powerful drama which has been adapted from the pen of Maine author Stephen King. I say not surprisingly, because this came from the same collected works which brought us the equally stunning \\"Stand By Me\\". King is not only a legendary horror novelist, he's also a staggeringly prolific writer of human drama, capturing each nuance perfectly and precisely and leaving room to bring those nuances easily to film. Director Frank Darabont pieced all the right elements into place to bring a faithful rendition of King's work to the screen (he would later do the same thing for \\"The Green Mile\\"). The central premise is that of honest, forthright banker Andy Dufresne (Robbins) going to the Shawshank penitentiary after being convicted of murdering his wife. Protesting his innocence all the way, he remains determined to not let prison life crush his soul. He soon acquires a small group of friends on the inside, using them to support his idea of hope. Andy's inner light manages to touch everyone in different ways, not only fellow prisoners, but the guards and warden as well. His list of feats include (without giving away any real spoilers to the film) arranging a beer break for his friends while they tar a roof, building a better library at Shawshank, helping prisoners to earn their high school diplomas, doing taxes for Shawshank's guards and briefly (but memorably) bringing music into the lives of the inmates. The entire film has a tone of its own that closely captures the period between the 1940's and the 1960's. Adding to that tone is the sumptuous musical score by the always reliable Thomas Newman (\\"American Beauty\\", \\"Meet Joe Black\\") and the stark cinematography by frequent Coen Brothers' collaborator Roger Deakins. The exemplary cast includes Morgan Freeman who not only brings his charm in front of the camera, but to the voiced over narration as well. Freeman turns in one of the best performances of his career (and that's certainly saying something) playing \\"the only guilty man in Shawshank\\", Ellis Boyd \\"Red\\" Redding. Even though this film came out a mere three years after \\"Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves\\" (in which he starred alongside Kevin Costner), Freeman appears to have aged twenty years...a necessary adjustment to make his character more believable. Tim Robbins, on the other hand, underplays his Andy Dufresne character in the early reels of the film, opening up only when one becomes convinced he's not going to show any true emotion in the entire movie. In some respects, that makes his character more enjoyable to watch as we uncover each separate layer of a very complex individual. Clancy Brown gives a wonderfully understated performance as prison guard Byron Hadley, a refreshing change from the outrageously over the top performance he gave in the original \\"Highlander\\" film eight years prior. The sleeper performance of the film comes from aging screen veteran James Whitmore as Brooks Hatlin. He can tell his character's whole story (fifty years of being institutionalized) merely with his haunted, sallow eyes. Still, the best moments of this movie come in the scenes shared by Robbins and Freeman. These two consummate professionals play off each other so beautifully that it's easy to forget this is only a movie and not an actual historical snapshot of two convicted prisoners. Ultimately this is a story of immense hope in a place where normally none is found. A genuine feel good film that will stick with you long after you've watched it. <br /> <br />THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: This DVD contains a fair, relatively clean 1.85:1 widescreen transfer. A minimal amount of grain pops up from time to time but nothing overtly distracting. The grey, hollow tones of the film are accentuated, while the brighter moments tend to be slightly dust-colored. A fairly pointless 5.1 Dolby surround sound has been added which fails to fully immerse the viewer in its depths. The majority of the audio (with the exception of a briefly fascinating lightning storm) is reserved for the score, which tends to be a bit overwhelming in a few spots. The dialogue, however, is crisp and evenly separated while gunshots are upfront and brilliant to the ear. The background speakers are rarely utilzed, even where the score is concerned. There's also a French Dolby 2.0 surround sound as well as English and French subtitles, both of which are presented in drab coloring to match the feel of the film. The package itself is a wonderful recreation of the original video release cover, although it has been issued in an atypical Warner Bros. paper case. The disc has been painted with a display that features the lower half of the front cover, brought closer into view. The nearly two and a half hour movie has been broken up into forty chapter stops, a generous amount for a drama-oriented, slightly slow-paced film such as this. Bonus features for this disc include an enjoyable cast and crew information section which gives brief histories for Robbins, Freeman and director Frank Darabont. There's also a minimally entertaining production stills gallery, which showcases thirty behind-the-scenes photographs, and notations for the awards this film won upon its initial release. The only really meaty special feature is the original theatrical trailer (2:12). It's a neatly arranged presentation which spotlights the film's best virtues and captures the potential viewer's interest. <br /> <br />THE YOLK'S ON YOU: Sorry guys, this is an early Warner Bros. DVD release. There aren't any hidden easter eggs I've ever heard about on this one. <br /> <br />THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: For the raunchier viewer interested in the seamy underbelly of Hollywood's grand cavalcade, there's some slight nudity but none of it's the right kind. The only remotely interesting piece of sexuality comes during the opening credits of this movie when Andy Dufresne's wife (Renee Blaine) has her panties removed by her illicit lover. <br /> <br />THE GORE REPORT: For fans who follow the cinematic blood trail Hollywood has left behind through the years, Tim Robbins gets a realistic bloody lip and the last gunshot wound inflicted in the movie leaves an interesting trace of blood, but that hardly qualifies as gore. <br /> <br />SAY AGAIN: \\"I guess it comes down to a simple choice really. Get busy living...or get busy dying.\\" - Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins) <br /> <br />THE FINAL SAY: No, I don't recommend buying this DVD. Warner Bros. finally got on the ball in late 2004 when they released a two-disc special edition of \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\". It contains a commentary track with director Frank Darabont, two documentaries, interviews from \\"The Charlie Rose Show\\" and more. That effectively makes this one disc release of the movie irrelevant. <br /> <br />PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: \\"If I Didn't Care\\" Performed By the Ink Spots. \\"The Marriage of Figaro/Duettino - Sull'Aria\\" Performed By Deutsch Oper Berlin/Karl Bohm. \\"Lovesick Blues\\" Performed By Hank Williams. \\"Willie and the Hand Jive\\" Performed By the Johnny Otis Show. Soundtrack Available on Sony Compact Discs and Cassettes.
B0000797IO|2.0|I didn't like 'the good girl' - it should have been titled, 'i use people for my own good.'  Justine makes Tom/Holden think she's in love with him and wants to be with him and then suddenly decides she wants to go back to her husband.  She knew up front Holden was disturbed and only pushed him over the edge anyway.  She won in the end with the baby and her husband's forgiveness.   <br /> <br />I only like some of the references and/or similarities to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and the movie felt a lot like the Cohen brothers film (which I love), but overall I was disappointed with it.  Glad it was on TV for free.
B00008S2VG|4.0|I wonder how these sorry sods look like. If she's no longer relevant then why are you wasting your time writing reviews for an artist that you deem too old, too muscular and a has been. Even with all your lives put together (critics included) you can never reach the same magnitude as this woman has. Show a little respect.And  may I remind you that those bubblegum pop artists that rule the charts at the moment will be gone as fast as  they came. I give this woman credit for her longevity and I only wish other artist could say the same for their careers.    I may not have liked this album as much as her other releases but I gotta hand it to this woman  - she's not afraid to fail and it makes following her music even more interesting. She's had hits and misses but at the end of the day what really matters is that she achieved what she set out to do which is to express herself no matter how self-absorbed it may seem to others. She is an artist after all.    Get back to me and b**ch all you want after you sell at least a million albums but before you do I suggest you shut up and take pointers from Madonna. It may do you some good.
0671027573|5.0|I have to say, that I had avoided reading this book for a lonnnnnnnnng time because the title turned me off. It sounded too damn fluffy to me. But when I finally did, my faith in Linda Howard was renewed and I loved the book. Think Sex in the City meets suspense. It was witty and fun. youll love it.
B000001DWG|5.0|This was the CD released at the height of the Pearl Jam craze, but thats just fine me, becasue i love both bands, but as i said on my Apple review, this album is truly timeless with all the tracks from Apple plus demo's that never made the final cut, all of which are fantastic regardless, Andrew Wood was an excellent song writer who would have made it HUGE with Mother Love Bone, sadly Wood did not live to see the release of Apple due to dying of a heroin overdose just before MLB's first national tour, every song is excellent on Stardog Champion and it is highly recommended for any fan of 90's rock, grunge, glam, etc. RIP Andrew Wood 1966-1990
0448060191|5.0|Four young women struggling to overcome their personal weaknesses and emerge as competent adults-- isn't this something all of us have grappled with?   <br /> <br />The four main characters-- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy-- are so vividly described they could have only been written by someone who knew them intimately.  And indeed Louisa May Alcott was the irascible Jo, describing her own family.   <br /> <br />One of the things few people comment on-- this book is incredibly FUNNY.  I just about die laughing every time I read about Jo's going calling with Amy and telling the ladies of society she practices horsemanship by putting a saddle in a tree and bouncing!  Or when poor flustered Mr. Brooke can't decide whether he came by the March house to retrieve his umbrella or see Mr. March.  (Jo, knowing full well Mr. Brooke came by to court her sister Meg, responds, \\"It's very well, he's in the umbrella-stand, I'll get him, and tell it you're here.\\")   Or when it dawns on Jo that Mr. Bhaer might be interested in her, she is retrieving an errant ball of yarn under the table.  The thought so surprises her, she hits her head on the underside of the table!  <br /> <br />And of course the chapter where Beth dies is the saddest and most beautifully written piece of literature ever composed...   <br /> <br />
B00005R87Q|5.0|I was only 11 when this film hit the cinemas, but i've got it on DVD and its one of my favourites. <br />Sure, the plot's a bit messed up but there are some good cars and racing scenes. <br />Dominic Torretto (the sexy Vin Diesel) and his car-crazy team just race around in cars and fix them. <br />His team are his girlfriend Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) his sister Mia (Jordanna Brewster) a dude named Jesse and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) <br />Michelle Rodriguez's \\"bad-ass bitch\\" attitude can get on your nerves in some parts but she acts good. <br />I'd never heard of Paul Walker before I saw this film, but it takes a while for you to figure out that he's an undercover cop. <br />Oh yeah, Ja Rule's also in it, but not for that long.. <br />Some of the lines these people had to deliver were awful - Vin Diesel \\" I live my life a quarter mile at a time\\" Michelle Rodriguez - \\" Growwl...I can smell skanks\\" WTF??  <br />All in all, it's a great film, the odd swear word here and there but good entertainment.
B0002RQ2T4|4.0|I've watched Ghost in the Shell several times and have never gotten bored with it. The heroine, the Major is an ususal character. She's a tough girl, whose body is entirely machine. Her life is all business. She solves crimes and saves Japan everyday and yet because this is a Japanese movie she's not happy. Although her brain and soul are still human there's something missing and when she's not kicking butt she goes into these marvelous long soliloquies about the nature of individuality and the state of mankind. Her huge partner, Batou who is also 90% cyborg acts as sort of a stand in for the audience. He's the one who breaks into her speeches and moodiness and he's the one who points out that being super strong with parts that can just be replaced with a quick trip to a hardware store is pretty cool. Batou is smart, just as tough as the Major and he's the character that the audience comes to care about the most.  <br /> <br />Out of the blue comes a character named the Puppet Master who might be a hacker, or a virus or AI or something else who is extremely interested in the Major.  The final scenes are beautifully done. You have action, you have sacrifice, you have suffering and beautiful, dreamy music. Another reviewer compared Ghost to Blade Runner and that's a good comparison except the future depicted in Ghost is far more dark. There's no happy ending in Ghost. Innocents get hurt, the bad guys get away with it in part and the Major is required to make a decision that changes her life forever.  <br /> <br />It's a gorgeous film. Even if you're one of those people who would never look at anime check this one out. It's a classic.
0679411585|5.0|Hal Moore and Joe Galloway's account of the battle in the Ia Drang Valley is truly one of the most riveting accounts of men in battle that's ever been published. It is, at times, gut-wrenching. When the men who were there come forward to say, \\"Yeah, that's exactly how it was,\\" then the reader should take notice. It's best for the reader not to dally on the decades-after-the-fact second-guessing by armchair tacticians ... they simply have a theoretical, perfect-world view that's less affected by bullets whizzing over their heads -- and through their buddies' faces -- than by textbook strategy and tactics.<br /><br />Better, if you want some idea of the fear and confusion our boys in Iraq might be facing right now, read Moore and Galloway's account. It's a different war, a different enemy, a different place, a different time ... but boy's hearts don't change.
B00000DQWT|5.0|Before listening to this soundtrack, I would have never expected it to so accuratly depict such a broad range of emotion. From the pop classic \\"This is Not America\\" with David Bowie to its instrumental counterpart \\"Chris\\", to the stirring \\"Daulton Lee\\", Metheny provides an emotional soundtrack to an emotional film about how two kids who seemingly had it all threw it away at such early ages. <br /> <br />The soundtrack alone captures the feel of the entire movie, and that's what a movie soundtrack is susposed to do.
B0007XT87G|5.0|I can't wait until I will see Porcupine Tree live for the first time in Minneapolis this spring.  I am a new fan but cannot shake them.  This is the first band I have been really excited about in more than 20 years. <br /> <br />I agree with the comparisons to Pink Floyd, etc. and cannot fathom the irony of one of their significant influences, Robert Fripp of King Crimson, opening for them on a few dates of their upcoming US tour. <br /> <br />\\"In Absentia\\" was the album to catch me first, but I am quickly catching up.  \\"Lightbulb Sun\\", \\"Signify\\", etc. all have great merit and show continued growth in a band that reminds me of the Beatles' progress during their time. <br /> <br />\\"Deadwing\\" is the latest step in that journey.  Catchy and accessible, it still has enough experimental or alternative feel to warrant praise from longtime fans.  It may lack the sheer perfection of \\"In Absentia,\\" but shows great progress and holds up incredibly well against that gold standard.  It also doesn't have that one shimmering track that only comes along every once in a great while (like \\"In Absentia's\\" gem, \\"Heartattack In A Layby\\") but it can't happen every time. <br /> <br />\\"Shallow\\" is an obvious choice for the first single, guitar driven and has a great hook.  \\"Lazarus\\" will make a great second for the US.  The sleeper track for me is \\"Open Car,\\" full of power.  And speaking of power, \\"Arriving Somewhere (But Not Here)\\" would make a great closer live. <br /> <br />It has been fun trying to spread the word about a mature band that is still very much an unknown in the States.  There have been a lot of very good and great bands that never hit the big time.  These guys are poised for it, earned it and deserve the recognition.  Here's hoping success only makes them better.
B00004XONN|4.0|First of all, Kid A is my favourite Radiohead record. I've heard three including this. Please note, Kid A will not influence your thinking or change how you feel about yourself. \\"Everything in it's right place\\" with its alien sound causes oblivious unfamiliar yet known heartache. It's decievement of reality in a way. What the music and the mood tries and manages to do is recreate everything around me by placing them three feet in the air and down. I know it sounds crazy but if you're the kind who raises an eyebrow at everything remotely involving your attention then I suggest you try some Bon Jovi instead. I cannot pass a judgement on this album since it has no boundaries,it's unlimited.<br /><br />\\"How To Disappear Completely\\" makes me feel like my mind is pacing with itself but somehow the prize is a feeling of being doomed. Kid A is an album that will bring out many un-monotonous reviews from the listeners and that is where it's strength lies in. I hope and pray I grow to listen to this absolute almost perfect energy more. Had I given it's due listen of around 150 listens , I would've given it 5 stars but then reason isn't of any consequence.<br /><br />There are two colors in my head<br /><br />There are two colors in my head
B0007TX894|5.0|\\"In Absentia\\" was an impossible act to follow, one of those once-in-a-lifetime events that an artist almost has to overcome in order to be allowed the freedom to move on. \\"Deadwing\\" is up to the task. It is a brilliant piece of work, a powerful and very compelling next chapter in Porcupine Tree's ascent to stardom. Keep listening, these guys are going places.
B00002SSKI|5.0|I have seen this movie a long time ago and owned it on VHS for a while. When it came out I was estatic, this movie is one of the best movies made. With such an amazing and touching storyline and fantastic cast its well worth the money. I'm a huge fan of all cast members outside of this movie and they all work amazingly together. <br />If your going to buy this movie, you'll feel the passion and love for it just like I have, you cannot help but fall in love with this movie. <br /> <br />thanks for reading my review, I hope it helped you with your purchase. <br /> <br />
B00000K3CM|4.0|Sequels are almost never as good as the first one. The only one that is better than the first one is \\"Mission Impossible 2\\". There are some like \\"American Pie\\", \\"American Wedding\\", \\"The Godfather Part II\\" and \\"National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation\\", that are as great as the first ones, but then there are others like \\"The Godfather Part III\\", \\"Wayne's World 2\\" and \\"Vegas Vacation\\" that kill an entire series. \\"Home Alone 2: Lost In New York\\" straddles the field. It's nowhere near as good as the first one, but it's really a very good movie nonetheless.<br /><br />In it, Macaulay Culkin returns as Kevin. After two years of being treated kindly by his parents as an apology for leaving him home alone, he has become the alleged source of problems once again.<br /><br />The film is different in that Kevin actually isn't \\"home alone\\" so to speak. He makes it to the airport for the family's Florida vacation. However, it's the wrong plane he boards. Kevin winds up in New York. Nervous at first, he realizes he brought his dad's luggage with him, and buys his way through Manhattan with his credit card, including an ill fated stay at the plaza hotel. (I find it interesting since I too had an unpleasant stay at the plaza last year, when they lost my only luggage, which was filled with thousands of dollars worth of cds). However, Marv (Daniel Stern) and Harry (Joe Pesci) are back on the streets, also in New York, and soon run into Kevin. You can basically tell what happens in here.<br /><br />Overall, this film is very good. However, there is one reason this film doesn't get five stars or even four point five. That is because it does not have the warm holiday feeling the first one had. In fact, this film is darker than the first one. One good example is the confrontation at the abandoned house with Marv and Harry. It is much more violent than the first one. Marv is nearly killed when he gets electrocuted. How's that for a family film? Plus, there is one rather disturbing sequence where Kevin is nerrvous because he's alone in the dead of night and meets to really seedy and weird hookers. Then he gets into a cab with a really spooky driver. This may actually frighten the younger fans of the first film. Another sticking point is that I never got into Brenda Fricker's pigeon character (this film's version of the much more enjoyable shovel character from the first film).<br /><br />However, there are some strong qualities. Catherine O'Hara turns in another strong performance as Kevin's put - upon mother, while the small roles by Donald O'Connor, Tim Curry, Rob Schneider (still a cast member on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" at this point) and Donald Trump liven things up. This is nowhere near as good as part one, but definitely worth it.because he's alone in the dead of night and meets to really seedy and weird hookers.

B0007GAERG|4.0|This album is really good. My personal favorites are \\"We Belong Together\\", \\"I Wish You Knew\\" , \\"Circles\\", & \\"One & Only\\". Before I purchased this album I listened to it at a Winamp Listening Party & I just had to buy it. I recommend that you all buy this. This is the first Mariah CD I have purchased, the very first Mariah CD was a gift to me, but I actually bought this one, I am a certified Mariah fan now, I LOVE YOU MARIAH!!!!
B00005BJ2O|4.0|This soundtrack has not left my cd player since I bought it. I loved the movie and I love the soudntrack. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is becuase it didn't have all the songs from the movie.
B00000583F|4.0|This is the second album from the San Jose weed worshipers. Released in 1993, this album is noteable for the facts that  guitarist Justin Marler left the band to join a monastery, and Luke Cisneros decided that everyone should now call him Al Cisneros (Spanish for 'towards those who work with swans'). Did the absence of guitar interplay between Justin and Matt Pike have an adverse effect on this recording? Did Luke's literal taking of Paul Simon's request to \\"just call me Al\\" turn his bass playing soft?  Here are my reviews of the songs based out of 5 *****:<br /><br />\\"Dragonaught\\" - A fuzzed-out guitar introduces the theme while a super-heavy, pounding rhythm from the bass and drums sets the stage. There are plenty of proficient drum fills while the tempo suddenly downshifts to a very heavy, doomish, fuzzed guitar rhythm and echoed vocals that crawl from out of a tunnel..\\"Ride the dragon toward the crimson eye ...\\" Very Sabbath like. The tempo slows even further during the vocals, giving the listener the feeling of treading through foot-high snow drifts. The rhythm is VERY HEAVY throughout. Great bass playing and drumming! The guitar solo is right out of 'How To Play Iommi 101'. Bass gets a quick solo and then the main, thick theme closes out the tune.  ABSOLUTLEY Mind Bending! The best of Black Sabbath rolled into a super-kind joint of Northern Lights! Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"The Druid\\" - A super-thick, chugging, fuzzed-out guitar opens with the main theme as drum cymbals and bass thump their way into the mix. The singing has a punkish vibe to it, but the music is pure DOOM! There are nice bass fills that proceed some \\"War Pigs\\" style riffage. The music jolts to a halt...quick bass lines followed by jazzy/prog drumming clears the way for a blazing guitar solo. The bass and drums lay down a very heavy, jazzed-out backing. The solo ends, and some uber-thick bass/drums return to the main theme and close out the song. Pure molten lava metal at it's DOOMISH finest! FANTASTIC! Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Evil Gypsy/Solomon's Theme\\" - Guitar feedback squeels out and then plays the main theme as the drums and bass slowly creep to the forefront. VERY HEAVY, dense, bass and drums. Alot of feedback and distortion from the guitar.  The vocals change from  screaming/punkish to Ozzy..\\"Glass village lies below. Castle of sleet with magic glow.\\" The melody abruptly changes as drums lay down a tribal rhythm which the bass and guitar echo. Some fine drumming on display by Chris Hakius! Guitar solo uses alot of echo effects while the bass and drums lay down another heavy, jazzish background. The thick, voluminous rhythm returns and the feeling of \\"Kill 'Em All\\" era Metallica is vibed as a very thick,chugging rhythm crushes the ears. The metal onslaught ends with some guitar feedback and drum crashing! Another masterpiece of molten metal sludge! Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Some Grass\\" - A quick bluegrass, fingerpicked guitar instrumental that showcases another musical reference. Nice and short.  Rating - **<br /><br />\\"Aquarian\\" - Chugging Guitar and THUMPING bass and drums with a SLOOOW tempo. The feeling of being underwater (or more like being drowned in tar) lays the mood as Al sings...\\"Trapped in a world under leagues of ocean. The clergy arrives with the magic potion.\\" Give me some of that! VERY sloow, viscous tempo with some awesome bass fills. The mulit-layered guitar solo is scorching! The solo fades out, and the bass and drum take center stage and then halt...The guitar and bass re-introduce the theme and the sludgefest resumes to the end. Damn! Sabbath better than Sabbath!  Rating - *****<br /><br />\\"Holy Mountain\\" - The titular track begins with fuzzed power chord and main rhythm. The tempo is slow as the bass and drums crash in with the vocals....\\"Slumber killed by rays of the new red sun arising.\\" Damn sun! The mood and melody is droning, slow, creepish, thick. Thumping bass and heavy guitar during the bridge threatens to crush the bridge under the sheer weight of the playing! Very Thick! The song fades out and a low/light bass shines out of the mountain, to be greeted by some light guitar.  The bass and guitar slowly make their out of the mountain and the volume and tempo increases.  The guitar reaches the opening first and has a multi-layered solo, while the bass and drum continue their rhythm and hike. The solo fades out and is replaced with a even heavier rhythm that builds and rejoins the main theme as vocals rejoice..\\"Look onto the rays of the new stoner sun rising.\\" YEAH BABY! The song has an abrupt ending as its time to go to work. Bummer! Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"Inside The Sun\\" - Starts with some uptempo drumming and guitar feedback.  The vocals have a punkesque quality. The tempo is fast and ambient with some fine drumming. A tempo/rhythm change into a SLOOOW, pounding  bass and drum with the constant guitar fuzz and feedback. Guitar solo uses alot of distortion and echo. A stream of feedback ends the tune. Rating - ***<br /><br />\\"From Beyond\\" - Low, moody, light and slow bass with minimal guitar. Bluesy but real slow. The volume builds and then explodes as the fuzzed guitar, drums and bass play a repeating, hypnotic melody. This ends, and a thick, pummeling bass, drums, guitar pave way for the vocals..\\"Choir of the sun chants inside the anti moon.\\" The tempo downshifts during the last phrase as drums and bass play without guitar. The guitar rejoins and the volume thickens as echo effected vocals add a spacey feel to the song. Another multi-layered guiatr solo that is absolutely killer! This is a pretty long tune that clock in at about 10 minutes. Rating - ****<br /><br />\\"Raja's Baptism\\" - An instrumental with just bass and drum. Slow and doomy as a baptism is wont to be. Rating - **<br /><br />The departure of second guitarist Justin Marler actually made the band heavier and denser! The fist half of this album is staggering in it's sonic onslaught. The fist half is the BEST \\"doom\\" material I have heard. The second half is good to above average but kind of boring. This is a masterpiece of an album that encapsules the band at their sonic apex. This album is pure molten doom, and something Sabbath should have been doing. If you like heavy, \\"Into The Void\\" \\"Sweet Leaf\\" Black Sabbath, this is for you! BUY THIS NOW!Very Thick!

B00001PE4D|5.0|i am going to have to say that this is one of the best movies that i have seen. all the drama that builds up until the end to where all the truth comes out.  <br />i recommend this movie to anyone that enjoys sexy, seductive, drama
0151008116|5.0|India is one part of the world I have never been to, but thanks to Yann Martel's description in his novel Life of Pi,  I feel as though I had been there taking in the country and its culture.  It is essentially the tale of the life of Pi from an early age until he is well into manhood.  Most of the book is written in the perspective of Pi reflecting on his early life after he has grown up.   <br /> <br />Previous to my reading this book I felt that zoo animals had horrible lives and must truly hate living in a confined area instead their natural habitat.  However, after reading what Pi's explanation of how zoo animals most likely enjoy staying in a constant habitat for themselves, I have reconsidered my view of zoos and how they treat animals.   <br /> <br />The incredible story of Pi's battle with the ocean to stay alive is incredible.  The description is slow and meticulous, but not boring.  You can feel the joy that Pi feels when he catches a large fish which he knows will feed him and his life boat mate Richard Parker, a 450 lb Bengal tiger, for another week.  You are also awed at the physical power and ingenuity of this small Indian boy when he is forced to fend for himself and his tiger.   <br /> <br />The aspect of faith and religion are also sown throughout the book.  Early in the book you watch as he discovers Christianity and Muslim, adding to his own Hinduism.  He sees the merit in each religion and against the will of his parents and the leaders of each holy place he practices each religion.  He also wrestles with the reasoning for God putting him on the life boat with Richard Parker. <br /> <br />Mr. Martel also is able to add in a nice blend of intelligent comedy throughout the book.  One great part is when Pi argues with his parents and the leaders of a mosque, a church, and a temple about what religion he should follow.  It is funny to watch Pi silence all five adults with his reasoning behind practicing all three.   <br /> <br />This book is defiantly a worth while read for anyone interested in animals, religion, or survival.  The shocking ending of the book which gives you two different explanations for what happened on the life boat spins you head, and leads you to search for someone to talk to about the book and try to find out what really happened.  Life of Pi is with out a doubt one of the best recent books in terms of story, intellectual issues, and writing style.   <br />
B00003CWPL|5.0|Eraserhead is the most disturbing, warped, and surreal films possibly ever made. The movie is very well made, good acting, incredible cinematography and special effects (i.e. the baby) so well done it will make your skin crawl as you wonder \\"Is that thing real?\\" The baby is so hideous, it's slight off pitch cry is the only thing that is even remotely human about it. Would I recommend this movie? It depends. To most, I would strongy encourage them NOT to watch, it's too bizarre, it's too weird. But then, to some who can take it, I would highly recommend it. In terms of bizarreness, Pi is the only other movie that even comes close, but even that looks like Mr. Rogers Neighborhood in comparison to Eraserhead.<br /><br />The \\"Eraserhead 2000\\" DVD features the following:<br /><br />Digitally Remastered 1.85:1 Anamorphic NTSC Transfer of the film<br /><br />English Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo<br /><br />\\"Stories\\" featurette - An hour and a half of David Lynch discussing various aspects of the film.<br /><br />Theatrical trailer<br /><br />The video optimizer from the \\"Short Films of David Lynch\\" DVD<br /><br />18 page booklet with cast and crew photos, storyboard sketches, part of Lynch's original outline for the film, promotional materials, and a page on restoring Eraserhead for DVD<br /><br />The DVD's menus are animated with an outtake from the film.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Thanks to this website I found out about the beautiful sounds of The Arcade Fire. So many \\"new breed\\" bands are coming out now, people sometimes slotted The Arcade Fire into this catergory. That personally sucks because what I hear in their music is something that not even Bjork is doing. This band herald from Montreal and are now my favourite Canadians.<br /><br />10 beautiful tracks make up this album<br /><br />\\"Neighborhood #1 (Tunnels)\\" starts off  with the lushest of piano imagery ever, this beautiful ballad shows off what The Arcade Fire do best. They mix up the tempo, play with the beat and use masses of instruments. The lyrics are fully flourished as well, sending across a powerful message.<br /><br />\\"Neighborhood #2 (Laika)\\" is a cool rock song that makes me happy with the indie scene at the moment, pure rock isn't doing so well at the moment so indie has taken over. Why should the mother name her kid Laika?<br /><br />\\"Une annee sans lumiere\\" is a nice mix of The Arcade Fire drawing on the heritage for lyrics. This is the first of two tracks where the lyrics are half French and half English. Translated the title means - a year without light-.<br /><br />\\"Neighborhood #3 (Power Out)\\" this is a cool grunge rock track, how come Win's voice sounds like a cross between Thom Yorke's and Chris Martin's (of coldplay?). This track has great guitars.<br /><br />\\" Neighborhood #4 (7 Kettles)\\" this track has a cool sound that actually sounds like kettles boiling. Again a nice track.<br /><br />\\"Crown Of Love\\" again The Arcade Fire draw on their trademark tempo-beat play mix. A cool track that is hugely powerful. 80's at the end.<br /><br />\\"Wake Up\\" same as -Crown Of Love- in the sense of their trademarks. Actually leads well into the next track. The strings on this song rock.<br /><br />\\"Haiti\\" Regine's turn for the lead vocals. This track is so danceable and has huge chunks of reggae implanted in it. Last song with 1/2 and 1/2 lyrics.<br /><br />\\"Rebellion(Lies)\\" is possibly the best track on the album. Very powerful to me, again a beautiful piano part, the best song on the album.<br /><br />\\"In the backseat\\" is Regine on lead vox again. This track is very peaceful and the perfect end to the album.<br /><br />Overall this is quite possibly the strongest debut album ever and I love it.llion(Lies)\\" is possibly the best track on the album.
