1933633867|5.0|The key difference between modern debt and ancient debt is the presence of economic growth. When there is growth, debts can often be paid back with interest. When there is no growth, debt with interest just redistributes wealth, often from working people to the lords and ladies, hence the rebellions over debt slavery from biblical times and the religious prohibitions against usury.<br /><br />Graeber misses this point, which is why his book is weaker when it gets into the modern era. Nevertheless it is a great book, a fascinating read, a real eye-opener. It is also extremely timely, as the modern era is now reaching its limits to growth, so his recommendation for jubilee year type debt forgiveness is dead on. In fact there is far more debt in today's world than will ever be paid back due to the imminent end of economic growth caused by ecological and resource overshoot, most notably peak oil.<br /><br />The recent partial bond default by Greece is but a foretaste of much bigger debt crises to come. This debt will be resolved by some combination of inflation, austerity, and debt forgiveness. The latter is to be much preferred for practical economic and social reasons, not just moral reasons. Namely, debt forgiveness gives working people the chance to work more for themselves and their fellow workers than to work to support the unproductive, affluent life styles of the bondholders.<br /><br />After a short period of turmoil if there is a sudden default, a more prosperous and egalitarian economy follows. The 2001 default by Argentina is a good example. Today in the US principle reduction for underwater mortgages would be highly beneficial to the economy, as would debt forgiveness on student loans as middle class jobs become scarcer. The Occupy movement is a sign of the growing political rebellion over such debt, with Graeber himself playing a key role in educating the youth on debt and governance.<br /><br />In the future as the era of economic growth transitions to contraction, the entire landscape of money and debt will be transformed. Graeber's book is an invaluable guide to how historical societies sought to prevent debt servitude and the consequent economic and social weakness. It wasn't just jubilee years. The Chinese empires were largely governed by Confucian scholar / bureaucrats on day to day matters, and they learned to keep a tight reign on the debt practices of merchants and aristocrats. In the Islamic world, merchants were actually honored by the imams because usury was prohibited. Also the imams helped keep the merchants at arm's length from the rulers. Lesson: the modern world needs to find a way to build a fire wall between politicians and financiers and to keep the latter on a tight leash.ntraction, the entire landscape of money and debt will be transformed.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I really liked this book. In fact I could not put it down and I read it on over a weekend. After I finished the book, my husband and I went to see the movie at the theater. Like most books, I find them much better then the movie. There's so many details they just can't get right in a movie. Very suspenseful with a good story line. I also purchased book two, \\"Catching Fire\\" and the third, \\"The Mocking Jay.  I can't wait  to read those too.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|The world around us can be such an ugly place.<br />Thanks to movies like this, we get a reminder that our planet is indeed a place of wonder and beauty.<br />I'm not sure why I even decided to rent this but I'm glad I did.<br />I'll be buying the blu ray shortly as I'm sure it will look absolutely fab on my tv.<br />Every shot is like a gorgeous screen saver.<br />Excellent pacing, narration and score.<br />If you like shows about our planet then I highly recommend this series.<br />It's one of the best out there.
0345803485|5.0|I personally found this story to be fantastic, but I enjoy reading romance, erotica and various other forms of chic lit. The main reason I liked this story was because I could relate. Not necessarily to the wealth, consuming love or S&M portions but because the characters had issues, questions and various underlying themes that I see women deal with daily. How far are you willing to go for love? How much of yourself are you willing to change? When do dominating characteristics become total domination? I'm a vanilla girl no matter how much erotica I read, but unlike other erotica I felt emotionally moved by this trilogy. As a matter of fact I was almost overly distracted by the two main characters. Work sufferred the week I read these books!<br /><br />I liked the characters although I did find Christian to be too perfectly made (despite his hang-ups he was really the ideal male lead). The consummate successful bad boy, Ana get's to \\"fix him\\" and yet still keep all the perks. Yes that is a bit over the top but I'm reading it for the fantasy not the realism. And despite all the reviews I also found the writing to be just fine. She may have said his mouth went into a hard line on more than one occasion but the descriptions were never forced. I'm an English major and I found no issues with Ms. James writing style.<br /><br />All I can say is if you read it, read it for what it is, erotica. Perhaps you can find something compelling to relate too much like I did....
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a seriously terrible book. The characters are annoying. The writing style is about as sophisticated as a teenager's text messages. Its far too cheesy to be sexy - full of expressions like \\"I glanced up at him through my lashes\\". Really? Through your lashes? Nobody says that. Ana spends the entire book flushing, thinking \\"holy crap!\\", and rambling on about her \\"inner goddess stamping her foot\\". And Christian is just plain creepy. Who cares how rich or good-looking he supposedly is? The S&M stuff is just the top layer of that crazy parfait. But if you've already bought it, I recommend reading it with a funny accent in mind to make it somewhat entertaining.
B00295UBTO|5.0|I love how this book expands upon details of Arda, Eä, and Middle-earth. Well worth reading. Please buy this, fellow Tolkien fans! Lacho calad, drego morn! (Flee night! Flame light!)

B0012K1ILW|2.0|I am hesitant to write this review because Erykah has this ill way of growing on you, regardless of how crazy/strange one of her songs might seem at first. After listening to it a couple of times, the song then becomes hot ish and you're wondering how you lived without it before. I consider most of Erykah's albums to be indispensable in my life but I have been listening to New Amerykah Part One for some years and it hasn't grown on me yet. I will say that I play the heck out of \\"Soldier\\" and I love \\"Honey\\" as well. This album does mellow me out (as do all Erykah albums) but I haven't been able to connect with her songs like I have with the other albums...in part because I don't know what she's saying on some of the tracks! It's a lil too technoish for my likings at some parts.
B000VUCIZE|5.0|This book is informative and an intensive examination of the fallacy of religious belief and the magic of transcendent belief of eastern religions.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I completely adored this book and the way it spanned the past and the future at the same time.  I found it to be interesting, fun, well written, and engaging.  I heartily recommend it!
B005UBNL0A|5.0|Let's just start by saying that this is not the CPU to buy if you're building a serious gaming rig. There are a number of other AMD CPUs better suited for gaming, including the FX-8100/8120, the Phenom II Black Edition 4, 6 & 8 core CPUs, etc. But if you're building a system for a home office, general use or even light to moderate gaming, I think the FX-4100 is a very good value. I have it installed in an ASRock Extreme4 mobo w/8GB of RAM and a Crucial M4 SSD that I use for photo editing, home office, etc., and it is more than enough CPU. Lightroom 4 and Photoshop Elements 10 open in seconds, batch processing of several hundred photos in LR4 is just as fast and layers in PE 10 open and close in a blink. I am very satisfied with this CPU.
0345803507|5.0|I don't normally review books but this series grabbed me instantly. It is just what you need if you are looking for a book with romance and hot sex scenes to make you blush! It could be seen as raunchy but I prefer to think of it as a great way to spice up your love life!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I was turned on to David Baldacci by a friend,and I thought oh no \\"not a politcal novel\\" but as most pepole should know you never judge a book by it'cover, so reluctantly I read The First Family and now I read every novel I can by David Baldacci.He has not disapointed me yet his latest novel The Innocent was a great page turner for me and I hope we read more about this hero. Keep up the great work.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|There are only 6 episodes to this collection so it is a bit pricey if you ask me but oy is is worth it.  The over the top sex and violence you have come to expect is there but there is something more, history..... we learn about the start of the house of Batiatus, the hardships this house had to endure as they tried to become a great house.  There is so much backstabbing and manipulating to keep the greatest detective spinning. In the end we know the beginnings that we were unsure of, ooooohhhh that's why they act like that! A GREAT PREQUEL!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|Maybe this will get us a Fix???? under product info, scroll down and it says report an issue. hopefully this will help!!  when it works, it is so much fun.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|A terrific plot about two walking wounded struggling for a meaningful relationship as a couple....plus hot sex!  The devil is in the details, and I cared about these characters from the get-go, even if the initial limo scene was a stretch (*wink*). Her past is revealed earlier and his is painstakingly slowly revealed, and by the end of this book, his past is still fairly shrouded in mystery.  There's a sequel coming, and I hope to learn more about Gideon, Eva and especially Eva's self-destructive friend Cary.  Three hundred per cent better-written than the trashy Fifty Shades, and Ms. Day's spelling and grammar was a treat to behold by this beta.  She obviously took pains to read the e-book prior to release.  Highly recommended!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a fun simple version of solitaire where you can just play a quick game or play for hours!!
B0029XFN8A|5.0|When I first saw this movie with my Cousin, I kinda thought that this would be like many other Teen Type Movies, with a little bit of comedy with a few Raunchy Scenes and that would be all. That's the Impression we might get by looking that the Picture on the DVD/Blu ray Box of the movie.<br /><br />But when the movie started, I was looking at a completely new concept. It was actually a story of a Young Boy, with a Goal in Mind regarding his Education & His Life. And as the Movie progresses, You will see so many different things that we see in our regular life.<br /><br />Every Little Part of the movie has a little thought behind. And the Best of all was, \\"Don't Judge a Person By The Looks and Profession of His/Her. There might be a Reason and A Pure Soul behind it.\\" And, TRUE LOVE doesn't see anything except for the other person's Heart.<br /><br />Emile Hirsch & Elisha Cuthbert were really good for their roles in the Movie. Even the two friends of Emile were really good. They really made a Fantastic Tripod together. The Background Score, Songs and all were too good. And when the Movie will end, You will always say one last thing, \\"Well, The Juice was Worth The Squeeze indeed\\"<br /><br />Totally Recommended to all of You, Especially if you're looking for a Love Comedy Type of Movie, this is the One you would like to get. Enjoy The Movie, Cause its AWESOME.
B005L38QK2|3.0|This is a good mouse its comfortable to use (and the shape is good for lefties), tracks well and fast. I bought it to play Diablo 3 on my Mac book air, because it seems to be one of the few gaming mice with MacOS X drivers.<br /><br />However I do not like it as much as my Logitech G400 that I use on my PC, that only cost $37. The G400 moves more smoothly over my Steel Series 4HD mouse pad, the Diablo mouse feet/pads seem more \\"scratchy\\". The G400 is more comfortable to hold and it just feels more solid, especially the buttons. The buttons on the Diablo mouse feel cheaper.<br /><br />SteelSeries claim this mouse can handle more clicks than most, and the laser sensor is the best. The sensor accuracy seems no better than the G400, and only time will tell about which will last longer.<br /><br />The other problem I had with this mouse is that \\"out of the box\\" the dpi switch did not work. To get it to work I had to update the firmware on the mouse which is not easy. First you have to download the program from the Steel Series Website.  It's a PC-only application. I tried it on a Windows VMware on my Mac and it kept generating an error. Even using my PC it had trouble updating and failed a couple of times! If running a 64bit Windows make sure you run the firmware updater as an Administrator!<br /><br />So honestly its a good mouse but for $65 I expect a better feel and more \\"polish\\" with the firmware and updater software, and a fully functioning mouse right out of the box! This is a premium price so we want a premium product SteelSeries!
B007IQX1G4|1.0|This is one of the worse movies I have ever tried to sit through. I only made it halfway through before I turned it off. Boring, boring, boring. Did I mention it was BORING?! Charlize Theron made another bomb of a movie. She is the female version of Hugh Grant. Thankfully I only spent 1.99 to rent it but that was 1.98 too much!

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I love this series. I think Conan Doyle would be astounded at the enduring popularity of this classic character. I have always been a Holmes fan. I enjoyed the victorian setting,and in the past when movie versions tried to put Sherlock in the future I thought it was lame. (Sherlock hunting the Nazi's). This version the writing , acting, and the city of London itself humming with life brings this character full circle. I enjoy the light touch , the humour with the dark drama just under the surface. This is very difficult to do well and all the people involved in this series have done an amazing job at bringing the characters to life. I even love the music. I have a son with Asperger's syndrome which is just beginning to be portrayed much more accurately in the media. Before all we had was \\"Rain Man\\", which shows a rather pathetic one dimensional character. I see my son in Sherlock so I admit to being a little in love with Benedict Cumberbach's interpretation of this character.I laughed at the Christmas scene at 221b, it was as if I caught a glimpse of my son in his future life.  Watson, is not a bumbling idiot but brings a much needed depth to his personality, he is a kind very competant doctor with a great sense of humor. He finds Holmes when his life is rather adrift,and has the insight to see beyond Holmes antisocial exterior to his humanity. Watson may not have the genius of Holmes, but he fills in the gaps of Holmes personality with his emotional intelligence, which Holmes slowly discovers he needs a bit in order to survive. Alot of people of been discussing Irene Adler who I thought was completely outrageous and fun to watch, albiet a little sexist. I think if Holmes ever decided to have a romance, I would choose Molly. I like her characterization. Like Watson, she is a kind , well educated and can overlook Holmes outrageous behavior. I could definitely identify with her. I am glad the weirdo's are getting some more insightful treatment by the media. As my older neurotypical son would say, he is \\"weird\\", but in a good way.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|you should get this APP is so cool and it never freezes or anything like that. its my favorite App
B002ZG97LK|1.0|This remake is not good as original one. Poor actors, boring, more violent and less country than original one. Don't buy, just rent it.
0061801313|5.0|When I bought this book a few days ago, the cashier took one look at it and said, \\"You started on the TV show and now you need to read the books, right??\\" and when I admitted that I'd never seen/read the show OR the books, she looked at me like I was completely insane and shook her head and said I was, \\"really late to the game.\\" LOL, rude but true.<br /><br />So this book was really hyped up and I was expecting a lot of it going in.  And it delivered -- every storyline was completely addicting and I personally like the flashbacks a lot.  It's really fun to see how the girls change over the years from middle school to high school and all the character development feels really natural/realistic.  Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer all seem like girls that you know, and their secrets that the mysterious \\"A\\" knows about are all so juicy and scandalous but somehow feels believable for girls who are in high school.<br /><br />I'm not going to write about each of their storylines because I'll totally give aways spoilers, but I'd recommend PLL for anyone who enjoys a quick but good read and simple writing that manages to say a lot (unlike that rambling, unnecessarily detailed, annoying writing).  JUST BUY IT! I already bought the sequel for my Kindle.
B00005JKYI|5.0|This movie is alot better than remake. It has alot of good actors & actress like Kevin Bacon & Sarah Jessica Parker. It also has awesome dance. I like small town places and alot of cowboys where I grew up. Great memories.

My favorites are \\"Underneath\\", \\"Outlaws of Love\\", \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\", \\"Broken English\\", \\"Chokehold\\", \\"Runnin'\\", \\"Nirvana\\". I also love dance tracks.  The vocal is incredible. I'm sure even Adam's non fans would enjoy this album. Very well done and must have!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|The most interesting aspect of this chick-flick story is the main female character's viewpoint, which is somewhat unique for a porn novel. It's a very easy read, and will make the author a millionaire. My first thought was that it's a rewrite of the classic S & M novel called \\"The Story of O\\", but this new one is different in several ways. One fallout from this is that husbands and boy friends will benefit and see a huge change in their companions' attitudes towards a little S & M with oral sex, which can't be too bad for the American male id.<br /><br />The more gals who read this, the better our sexual lives will be!<br /><br />I completely endorse these novels.<br /><br />Thank you, E.L. James!
B001E45XT4|5.0|I purchased this headset with the usb sound card for use with the PS3.  I am not a big fan of the Turtle Beaches, already had to replace two pair.  This headset is very comfortable, but do heat up the ears like other reviews say.  The bass is not as good as the Turtle Beaches, but I find that as a good thing.  The more bass you get, the more you are distracted from the enemy footsteps.  I have already recommended these to my friends and have no regrets on moving on.

B006GHA9QQ|3.0|I struggled to figure out how many stars to award this.  The book/story is awful, the characters are completely unlikeable (everyone is drunk or angry, or both, except for the kid, who's just confused), and much the music is forgettable, with the title track being among the most uninspired stuff I've heard in a while.  Normally, I'd give this production one star.<br /><br />But.<br /><br />The way this production came together, it was SO bad, it was fabulous, and for that, I'd give it five stars. So, averaging the one and five, you get the three.<br /><br />Anyway, PatsFan's review from April 3rd is spot-on with all that is wrong with this production, but I choose to laugh rather than cry.  In fact, it was a struggle for me to contain myself when I saw it in the theater this past February.  As absurdly hilarious as I found many parts, I couldn't assume the few other patrons felt the same way, so I stifled my laughter, only to burst out in fits of it as I shopped in a supermarket after the show.  Good thing it was late at night with few other shoppers around.  (Apparently, a bunch of folks at a screening in NYC didn't restrain themselves and things got heated after the movie.  Go to the blog The Craptacular, do a search using the words Love Never Dies Crazy, and enjoy the post.)<br /><br />The death scene was absolutely priceless and an excellent example of the horrible writing.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />So, after the Phantom, apparently a better composer than psychologist,  fails in his attempt at hostage negotiation with Meg, Christine is shot by Meg.  Gustave, already traumatized by his mother being shot, finds out that the Phantom, of whom he is frightened and from whom he ran away screaming previously, is his real father.  Fabulous timing!<br /><br />Then, Gustave runs off to find his \\"father\\" Raoul, who supposedly has taken off for Europe.  Did Gustave even know that Raoul had left and where he was going?  Come on, now.  Miraculously, Gustave finds Raoul and brings him back, just in time, to Christine's side, where, when Christine gasps her last breath, the Phantom cries, \\"NOOOOOOOOOOO!\\" eerily similar to that of Darth Vader in \\"Revenge of the Sith\\" when Padme dies.<br /><br />Oh, I almost forgot - there was NO blood on Christine.  So she was lying there in her death throes, and there was no wound from the gunshot.<br /><br />I did like Ben Lewis' voice, though.  It's deeper, darker and older in sound than Ramin Karimloo's and much more as I'd expect the Phantom's voice to sound.  I'd like to see Mr. Lewis in another production with a good plot and better direction.  I do like Ramin Karimloo and his Phantom interpretation from what I've seen of it, but the Phantom is not supposed to be a hot young dude; it takes away from the tragedy of the Phantom's life.  As fantastic as Ramin's voice is, its youth came through so clearly in anniversary performance and was a bit jarring for me, and as the Phantom in LND, he's supposed to be 10 years older than he was in the original show.<br /><br />Bottom line, watch this without taking it too seriously and you might enjoy it, even if not in the way ALW would have wanted you to do so.
0761169253|4.0|A colleague gifted this book to me quite unexpectedly one morning. Perhaps he thought I needed a reminder that my creativity was lagging lately, who knows. I leafed through the pages and found a comment by Jessica Hische \\"The work you do while you procrastinate is probably the work you should be doing for the rest of your life\\"...wow moment.<br /><br />Many of his comments and advice I had learned along my journey as an artist before some professors \\"knifed my muse\\" [metaphorically speaking] in college and the corporate world finished it off.<br /><br />While I didn't find Kleon's words new, he is correct, no one tells you the little bits of wisdom contained within, you learn it for yourself the hard way.<br /><br />Basically, harken back to your time as a child, when your creative juices were flowing and there was no limit to your imagination; embrace your inner child, go forth and CREATE! Create something everyday, be it a doodle while talking on the phone, making a journal a work of outsider art, or grabbing some clay, paint, or what have you and create. Just do it!<br /><br />Like he says, there's nothing new under the sun. The book gives you license to steal what is worth stealing \\"artistically\\" and then placing your own spin on it to make it something more.<br /><br />So, go forth and Steal Like an Artist.

B0033B5XCS|5.0|This dvd collection is incredible, I was absolutely pleased above and beyond my expectations! I was very excited to see that all of the dvd's were in one wider case as well that makes them easy to store and less likely to lose as well! I also found another reviewer's comments helpful for giving me an idea of what to expect from each movie.<br />1,3,4,and 5 were great quality movies,2 stunk as I've heard it did, but the dvd itself was in great shape and I had no problem viewing it!  Havent seen wes cravens nightmare yet and havent watched Freddy vs jason yet but I have seen that before and am sure both of them work just fine!I wish the other collections of slasher movies came in such  convenient and beneficial packaging!

B007Q2N0HA|2.0|Overall Rating 2.5 Out of 5 Stars.<br /><br />When some overly graphic-action-packed-shoot-em-up movies are rated and reviewed, viewers will occasionally be privy to an overall bullet or explosion count.  After reading Bared to You, I would be extremely curious to get my hands and/or eyes on the same type of statistics - tailored to fit this book.  Although there might have been mention of one or two guns, I'm not talking about getting the count of bullets being fired or buildings blown to smithereens.  I want to know how many sexual encounters were in  and how many orgasms were had (let alone how many MULTIPLES were had by both male and females), and not just between Eva and Gideon (the main characters).  It seemed that EVERYONE but the two chauffeurs was getting some action; and hey, you never know - they could have been getting some while they were waiting for Gideon and Eva. I'm just saying, it was probably happening and not detailed in the story... You never know...  ;)<br /><br />Leading with that, yes, there was A LOT of sex... A LOT.  That is to be expected when reading an erotic novel.  To not expect a plethora of heart pounding, blood warming love scenes would be like watching a pornographic movie and expecting an actual story line.  And some of the scenes written in Bared to You would probably have Dr. Ruth applauding and/or blushing, I'm sure.<br /><br />It was a given, I knew that I was diving into an erotic book and that Dr. Ruth would more than likely be impressed, so why the 2.5 star rating?  Well, let's explore my reasons.  By the end, who knows - maybe I'll change my mind; being a woman, that does happen from time to time, doesn't it?<br /><br />1) Main Characters - Gideon is \\"Dark and Dangerous\\" and the readers are reminded of it all too often.  Every woman known to man, as well as every gay and bisexual man, is attracted to him.  He is perfection personified.  This constant reminder became too much and my mind began to rebel against this idea after so many times of being told how perfect, admired, and wanted he was by everyone.  His personality, though sweet and charming on rare occasion, was off the deep end creepy, stalker'ish, and too overly domineering for my tastes.  This might work for many women, and that's great for them, but I found it a major turn off.<br />Eva is struggling to become a strong and independent woman while unknowingly looking for a stronger man to control her without her feeling that she is out of control (confusing, I know).  She's beautiful and intelligent and caring and naive.<br /><br />2) Story/Plot - One word sums it up = Baggage.  Everyone has baggage.  Some more than others.  Some keep theirs hidden in big expensive vaults while others are forced to carry theirs on their backs for all to see.  However carried or hidden, again, we all have baggage and have to deal with the contents sooner or later.  But wow, the tip of the ice burg baggage that was unveiled in Bared to You was simply mind blowing!  I know that there is MUCH more to come in future installments and I can fully admit that I am not woman enough to handle more.  The amount of dysfunction and the amount of pain that I feel is slogging down the pipe will be gritty and painful and will be for the tough minded and I know I won't be able to handle it.  I fear for Gideon's baggage and anyone else's readers would be exposed to since everyone in the web of characters truly is traumatized in one way or another.<br /><br />3) How many orgasms is too many for one \\"love\\" scene?  I say this out of curiosity really...  I want to say that I counted up to 3 or 4 orgasms in usual scene (all Eva's) and a usual 2 for Gideon?  I don't know if I've ever really come across a reading where the woman has had more than two orgasms in one sexual encounter?  Or at least it didn't make an impression on me, but oh my goodness!  And for a man to have more than one orgasm?  Really?  And on a repeated and consistent basis?  Like every time, notjust a, \\"Hey! that was a lucky time, huh?\\"  It just kind of got boring after a while...  And, really, how sad is that...  I just started skipping over some of the \\"love making\\", thinking \\"okay, there's her first one... there's two...  three... okay, he's growling now...  one...  etc... done!\\"  It's like that old adage of what a married woman says during sex, \\"beige, I think I want to paint the kitchen beige.\\"  Again, pretty sad...  Sorry!  :(<br /><br />In the endless search for love in life, have Gideon and Eva found it in each other?  What does it mean to love?  Love is something that I am still trying to define, still trying to find myself...  Yes, they have very sweet and tender moments.  Though they have never had a slow and gentle love making session (sorry, is that considered a spoiler?), Gideon categorizes each of their \\"experiences\\" love making.  But still trying to define \\"love\\", I know acceptance is part of it and Gideon and Eva have a hit and miss on acceptance.  They both have a monstrosity of a jealous streak, which is insecurity (both within themselves and with each other).  They both have a need to mark each other as property.  They are quick to jump to conclusions without listening to one another.  They have an almost painful need to be around each other; which says more that they are obsessed with one another.  To me, this is more tragedy than love story...  But maybe that's just my mindset?  Maybe I'm reading the words wrong.<br /><br />Read the book and be your own judge...  That is the beautiful thing about books - everyone's movie changes depending on the mood and the internal narration.<br /><br />I wish Ms. Day all the luck in the world with the Crossfire series - hopefully her characters receive the absolution they so desperately need to become whole.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I am giving this three stars because it did keep my interest about half way through the book. After that, well, it seemed to turn into a skipping record, repeating itself over and over and over. I am a fan of erotica, especially when well executed, but this is more like Twilight meets soft porn, without the action and interesting twists. Christian Grey was the only intriguing character, but even he can't pull this book along. They only conflict I seen was whether she should sign the contract or not. After that, well, I couldn't force myself to read any further. If you would want passion and a great storyline, then I would recommend Anne Rice's \\"Claiming of Sleeping Beauty\\".
B001NLL93W|5.0|Oh Ms. Clare, what are you doing to me? This book was, FANTASTIC! I could not put it down. I was sneaking in peeks whenever I could! I stayed up late last night determined to finish it and see it through to the end. I just had to see what happened. And I was not disappointed.<br />City of Glass is the continuation of The Mortal Instruments Series. Valentine has two of the three Mortal Instruments and is set to procure the third so that he can build a new army of Shadowhunters. Clary, Jace and gang are bound and determined to not let that happen. So they go to Idris, the home of all Shadowhunters, to make sure that doesn't happen! The adventure they have introduces us to new characters and sheds light on Jace and Clary's life as brother and sister.<br />There is not a dull moment in this book. Once again, Clare captures your imagination and your heart with her descriptions and characters. You're able to picture in your mind exactly where the characters are. It is done in such detail that you really feel like you are there with them. You love the good guys and you can't help but want to read what the bad guys have to say!<br />And the characters. they are so well described and they grow so much. You watch the transformation as they learn more about themselves, especially Clary and Jace. They are strong characters who care about each other as well as their friends. They believe in what they are doing and are determined to make sure all those around them are safe. They are even willing to sacrifice themselves to do it.<br />It was great to see the minor characters really come into themselves. Simon, accepting that he is a vampire and learning how that can actually help him rather than hinder him. Alec finally realizing that it's ok for him to love Mangus, and for everyone (even Jace) to know! Luke and Jocelyn finally professing their love for each other so they can live \\"happily ever after.\\"<br />I have to say I would have liked to see a bit more from Isabelle. Althoughwe did get to see her more emotional side when Jace leaves and she explains to Clary how seeing him so distraught has torn her heart apart.<br />I have to admit that there were some things that I had predicted, thought I wasn't sure how Clare would go about rectifying them. But she did it, and in a way that wasn't confusing. And in a way that kept me interested and wanting to read more.<br />I can see how this series could end right here at this book. The characters accomplished what they set out to do and, in the end, everyone is happy. Although, you do get a sneak peek at how things might turn around at the end of the book. I hope Clare does not break my heart!<br />I am excited to go on and read the next one. I don't want this series to end!!!!<br />I am very stingy with my 5 start ratings. I rarely give them because a book has to capture my heart and mind so much that it takes me completely by surprise; that it takes me away to another world where I can get lost in the characters and scenery. Like is predecessor, this book does that! Holy Cow! 5/5 star rating from me!
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I'm 16 and have been a fan of Linkin Park since I was very young. I originally liked them only because my older brother liked them. Now, I like them because I enjoy their music. The first album I heard was Hybrid Theory, and many of you will agree, it's a masterpiece. I did heard maybe about 1 or 2 songs from Meteora (I hadn't owned it yet), so I had an idea of how they sounded. I bought this album when I was 13. I'm one of those people who buys a CD knowing about only one or two songs on it and likes to get suprised. I bought it because of What I've Done, and listened to the whole album on my CD player (yeah, I didn't have an iPod). One of the first things I noticed is how alot of their songs were more of Chester doing them and not involving Mike's rapping (such as track 2, Given Up). This album had songs that were soft (Leave out all the Rest, Shadow of the Day, Valentine's Day) and heavy (Given Up, Bleed it Out, No More Sorrow). But I enjoy them all. Now many people say that this album is bad because it's nothing like their previous two. But Linkin Park didn't just want to rehash something they already did. They did something completely new. I'm sure no one was expecting the style they took up, and neither was I. I did hear from my older brother (the same one I heard about them from) that they had changed, having different music and all wearing black. I don't care if they've changed. I still love them. From sitting on my bed in my old house when I was a little boy listening to them on a CD player, to today as I am a young man learning to drive and expecting their fifth album to come on June 26, I always liked them, and I doubt I will ever stop. Many people claim to be fans of Linkin Park, but when I hear them rant about how they suck now, I just think to myself, \\"These people are stabbing Chester, Mike, Brad, Joe, Rob, and Phoenix in the back and using the same knife to cut apart their album releases.\\" Those people are not true fans at all, just people expectingthe exact same album, just with different artwork and song titles. So I'm just gonna turn up the volume on my iPod and listen to Linkin Park while all those hypocrites waste their time.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Ok, I need some time to think on this one, my head is SPINNING!<br />Ok, I've had a bit to think on it and I still don't know where to start.<br />I love Clare's writing, that's the first place. I haven't read a book by her yet that I didn't like. Her characters are so well described and interesting. And her descriptive ability leaves me speechless.<br />In this story we once again meet up with Clary, Jace and the gang. They fight off Valentine as he tries to gather all the mortal instruments and create a demon army to take down the Clave.<br />One thing I loved about this book is that Clare did not hold back from taking chances. The love relationship between Clary and Jace still exists, despite the fact that we were told they are brother and sister (although I am pretty sure this is somehow going to be resolved at a later date). Simon is turned into a vampire, what? I was surprised Clare took this chance, but it worked. Jace remains aloof, although you do get the sense that he really feels this is somehow protecting everyone around him. Alec and Mangus' relationship and alluded to, but Jace remains in the dark (although I can't see how). It's all these things that just lend to making this such a great story.<br />And, despite the badness of some characters, you just can't help but love them all. Ok, so I'm not out there waving my pom-pons for Valentine, but there is something about him that makes me want to like him. Why is that? Is it because there seems to be something underlying his infatuation with taking down the Clave? Like there is something evil there that we just don't know about and will be revealed at a later date!<br />The book keeps you guessing, keeps you wanting more. Really, I had a hard time putting it down. I didn't feel this way so much with the first book. I liked this one better, to be honest.<br />I really can't find anything bad to say about this book. It swept me away and I've already started reading City of Glass!!! I can't wait to see howmuch more the characters continue to develop!
B0081GWXPA|1.0|Despite being named Patrick Griffith, it is apparent that the person who translated this edition was not an anglophone at birth.  This translation is choppy and difficult to read.  It takes away from the magic of Le Petit Prince.<br /><br />Many parts of this translation are an almost literal translation from french to english, which makes this text quite hard to read.<br /><br />I recommend finding the previous translation by Richard Howard which was copyright in 2000 (you can find it in the Google Play Bookstore).  This 2012 translation isn't worth a dime and I cannot recommend it.
B003G4W49C|2.0|Finally, I am done with this monstrosity! UGH!<br />I have to say that I really did love the premise of this book: taking children and preparing them to be the fighters for world peace. It's a great concept. And it utilized science fiction as the back drop: outer space, aliens, space ships, no gravity.<br />But all in all I really didn't like this book. It was slow to read. The children characters were not believable to me. They were supposed to be truly smart, but they were still children. Yet, nowhere in this book did they ever act like children. And their speech was always so adult. They communicated with the adults just as other adults would have. To me, it was totally unrealistic and unreal. I could not connect with the main character, Ender, because I could not see how a child of 6 (12 by the end of the book) could think as he did, act as he did, communicate as he did. It was frustrating.<br />I can say that the last 20% of the book was the most interesting and held my attention enough to get me through the end.<br />I can also say that there is no way on this earth that I will be reading any more books in this series.<br />I give this book 2 star, because it is well written, but barely kept my interest.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|Most of the good points of this TV show has been discussed in many reviews here. The sets are wonderful and very original. The costumes are worthy of any Hollywood movie. (They beat out the terrible sets and costumes of a movie such as Mirror, Mirror by more points than I can count.) And the humorous lines and original ideas of the storylines are much fun to watch.<br /><br />And as for me, I am thrilled by this: My 18 year old son is a trial and teenage tribulation to me much of the time... but he makes me sit down with him every Monday so we can watch the latest episode of Once Upon a Time together. Not much in the world is able to make that happen :-)
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Review to come later when I have computer access. I can say that I really liked it and can't wait to read the next one!<br />Ok, so what can I say about this book. I just love Cassandra Clare's writing style. I think what made this book more interesting for me is the fact that I read Infernal Devices before starting this series. So I had some background about Shadow Hunters and also some information about the history of the families (although I am still trying to connect it a bit in my mind since it was not all laid out, I'm sure it will come together in future books).<br />I really loved Jace's character. He does remind me very much of Will from ID and I am wondering if there will be some kind of connection there in the future. I am looking forward to more of an expansion on the characters other than Clary and Jace. I'd like to see where the whole homosexual thing goes with Alec. And now that I know that Jace is Clary's brother, I am interested to see where her relationship with Simon goes and if Clare introduces another love interest.<br />I have to say that the one thing I did not like about the book is that Clary is supposed to be 15, almost 16, but she thinks and acts/speaks like an adult at times. That kind of bothered me. She is wise beyond her years for someone who has not been introduced to the Shadow Hunter world until this point.<br />Other than that I really enjoyed reading this, although it took me longer than anticipated with my vacation and all (no time to read with all the wedding stuff going on!).<br />I look forward to seeing what they will do with the movie.<br />I gave this book a 4/5.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of Muse, there latest stuff is OK but overrated in my opinion. However Absolution is an excellent album and similar to Radiohead but harder rock, less electronic and much more progressive. It even sounds similar to Dream Theater in parts because of the progressive roots. Stockholm Syndrome is my favorite track but all of them are good. Endlessly, Sing For Absolution and Time is Running Out are some of my favorites. Album's great for fans of Radiohead or if you're into any progressive or alternative rock.

B002WWKZJK|5.0|This was the first Georgette Heyer book I ever read when I was 13 years old.  It started a lifelong passion for her novels. It is a hilarious book with great romance woven throughout! I have lost track of how many times I have read it over the years. Admittedly, Horry is clueless because she is so young and naive.  However, her heart is so good and the idea that Rule would fall in love with her instantly for her selfless sacrifice to help her sister have her true love works for me. I think in the past 47 years I have read all of Georgette's romance novels and she is brilliant. Probably my next favorite is Devil's Cub but I always go back to A Convenient Marriage.  When Horry asks Rule to put her in his heart and he says she is already there, it is truly a romantic moment.

B004HWT6DO|5.0|So this week was a big week for Facebook: Zuckerberg turned 28, Facebook went public with an IPO and Zuckerberg got married to his college sweetheart, Priscilla Chan, who just graduated from Med school with a degree in pediatrics. Happened to have this film SOCIAL NETWORK film in the house and watched it with my son who joined Facebook in 2004 when he was a student at NYU. It is fun to recall how it first entered out lives. Myspace was just so junky looking, my son commented. And when you're in college you really want to know people's status.<br /><br />This is a fascinating look at the company's origins--did Zuckerberg really steal the idea from some Harvard twins?<br /><br />And cheat his partner by diluting his stock? One more good reason for Eduardo to move to Singapore and avoid hundreds of millions on his taxes when Facebook went public.<br /><br />It was hard to tell the hype from the honest story and you were so entertained by the film, you really don't care. You are willing to watch the suspenseful unfolding of the success. The script by Sorkin is masterful. You hang onto the repartee. It's fun to watch smart people interact--too bad their character doesn't always keep up with their intellect.<br /><br />My son commented he wanted to know how the ideas came up for some of the features of Facebook and wished the film had featured that more. And show how use of Facebook has evolved. We'll probably need another film--perhaps a documentary--on that. It is reported that Facebook created their own film when it went public that is more interesting than this one. Truth is often more interesting than fiction, if stranger. But in the meantime, this fictional film regarding Facebook's origins is worth watching.<br /><br />I heard Zuckerberg say after seeing this film that he doesn't remember partying as much as the film indicated they did--they were working most of the time. But he agreed it was an entertaining film.<br /><br />I loved it and am looking forward to Aaron Sorkin, the screenwriter, take on Steve Jobs in an upcoming film, based on Walter Isaacson's biography. If you're fascinated by Facebook and social networking, you should enjoy this film.on Sorkin, the screenwriter, take on Steve Jobs in an upcoming film, based on Walter Isaacson's biography.

0062101897|3.0|This is a great book. It's well-designed, and there was obviously a lot of thought put into the writing and layout. I'm giving it three stars because I don't think it's been made entirely clear who the audience is.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the series who wants anecdotes from the set, snippets of interviews from many who worked on the films (actors, directors, and others), and some great art and pictures then you will love this. It's especially great for people who aren't so familiar with film. However even for those who are, if that's what you're looking for, then you won't find a better book.<br /><br />However if you know film pretty well already, and are looking for an in-depth look into the process for creating these films, then this probably won't tell you much you don't already know. A great deal of text is spent rehashing things that an attentive observer could get from watching the films themselves. For instance the entirety of the art section (which comprises the second half of the book) is mostly descriptions of what's in the film with a little bit of the reasoning behind it.<br /><br />That's great if you're a fan of the films and not looking for heavy filmmaking insight, but the content of this book isn't going to do much for those who are. The accounts of on-set experiences mostly talk about the making of the film in chronological order. There are small snippets of a few sentences of a director talking about an issue or an actor talking about shooting a particular scene, but this is not a book to get insight into the creative process of any of these individuals.<br /><br />If books on design, acting, and film theory already occupy your bookshelf, and you're looking at this book for insight into artists putting those theories (or their own) into action, then this won't be of much use to you. If you're a fan of the films, and don't know too much about film or aren't looking at this book for that reason, then you will most likely love it. This reviewis really written for those who are involved in film and are wondering how in-depth any of this goes.<br /><br />There are some interesting short anecdotes (all the anecdotes in the book are very short) about a challenging scene, the design of a particular element, or how they pulled off shooting Hagrid in the early films, however it's nothing that will be a surprise to anyone who studies film. From the perspective of an inside look at the creative process, the text actually remains fairly shallow in order to remain entertaining, keep a wide audience, and pack everything into what isn't as long a book as it looks. This is definitely a book for the fans or collectors of \\"making-of\\" books. It certainly deserves the five-star reviews. Just keep in mind what you're looking for.
B007JRU2UK|5.0|George Clooney is phenomenal in this movie. The storyline is very real, and the emotions are ones that we face everyday in our lives. A must watch!

IM BEING REAL PICKY HERE BUT IVE ALLWAYS BEEN LOOKING FOR A GOOD RADAR THAT PICKS UP THE STREETS BLOCK BY BLOCK. This fails to do that but the radar is quite good especially if you like a us or world view. Zooms in real close but takes too much time.

B005Q1W10A|5.0|This Second Series contains full episodes as seen in Britain, yet is designed for USA DVD players. This set also includes the 2-hour Christmas Finale. These mesmerizing episodes continue exploring the lives of those close to the Earl of Grantham in Yorkshire -- both his aristocratic relatives and his \\"family\\" of servants and village workers below stairs.  The first season began in 1912, with the sinking of the Titanic. This second series covers all the tragedies and wartime romances occuring during the First World War, 1914-1919. \\"London Seasons\\" for wealthy young women were obviously cancelled: all British & Commonwealth men were away at war; many died; and some returned home with grievous injuries.  So, young ladies threw themselves into nursing and community support work; some even learned to drive or follow elections.  Maids also took on new duties, serving as Footmen in the evenings. Even Daisy sought promotion from Dogsbody to proper Assistant Cook.  By the end of so many disruptive and grief-filled years of war, none of the women could imagine going back to a silly life of changing clothes, not being allowed to vote, or marrying for family duty instead of for love.  The most heroic men -- the Earl's heir Matthew and his own trusted valet, Bates -- suffered unbelievable travails.  One eventually returns to full physical health, but is too depressed to take positive action in his personal life, while the other thinks he has successfully divorced his evil wife, only to find himself framed for her murder.  Everything is not resolved by the end of this season; we will have to wait for Season 3 to learn the fates of most of our favorite characters.  What's great about owning the DVD is, you see new things in every episode because you have the opportunity for more than one viewing.  The non-fiction Special Features and cast bio's are very enlightening.  Maggie Smith's Dowager Duchess has all the best lines; her performance is not to be missed.

0312360258|3.0|Marked is the first book in the House of Night series by P.C. Cast & Kristen Cast. It is about a teenage girl named Zoey Redbird, who is 'marked' by the goddess Nyx like many teens. She enters a school just for fledglings like herself. She has four years to train before she either dies or turns into an adult vampyre.<br /><br />The goddess Nyx has chosen Zoey to bring back the balance between good & evil. This young priestess in training wears special tattoos, placed there by the vampyre Goddess Nyx. Nyx has given Zoey the affinity of air, water, fire, earth, & spirit; spirit being her most prominent. However, she is not the only fledgling with an affinity at this school called, the \\"House of Night.\\"<br /><br />Now, as I have stated before, placing my imagination back in my high school years with all that teen angst was difficult at first. This story is takes place in a high school. In this story, Zoey seems like kind of the odd ball at first. However, in a very short time she hooks up with other fledglings that show her the ropes. She then discovers that Aphrodite, the leader of the school's most elite club named the Dark Daughters, is misusing her Goddess-given gifts. Zoey must look deep within herself for the courage to embrace the destiny put before her and bring the Dark Daughters back into Nyx's covering. Of course, she can only do this with help from her new vampyre fledgling friends.<br /><br />What I truly find fascinating here is that these kids are vampyre fledglings. They are not full vampyres yet. What this means is that they can go out in the daylight, they can eat regular food, they don't need blood, but they live with the idea that within 4-years, they will either die or mature into a full vampyre. Now, they don't usually go out in the daylight, because they are marked with a tattoo on their foreheads. Yeah, strange... and as they mature as fledglings, this tattoo some how magically grows.<br /><br />This book did start out slowly and seemed to be for a younger crowd. However, about two-thirds of the way through, the plot irons itself out and I became engrossed in the story. I can't wait to get into the next book, Betrayed.<br /><br />If you enjoy vampire stories, this is a good one. However, it is not like your typical vampire story. I think that is why I thoroughly enjoyed it.

B003F3FJQO|2.0|Before I get into the negative, let me share some praise. Yes, this book was exciting and there was a hefty amount of action, death, and suspense. There, that's about all of the positive.<br />Now for the criticism. This book does not move the story forward. It is basically a story where the Gladers are told they are part of an experiment (which they already knew) and are tortured some more. That's about it.<br />The introduction of a couple other characters could easily have been done at the end of the first book or at the beginning of the third. This book could mostly be eliminated and the overall story would not have been much affected.

B004JN1CW4|3.0|This is a series that I really wanted to enjoy and get into, but I wasn't able to get much out of it. I almost quit reading during the second book, but decided to plow through just in case. If I had to do it over again, I probably would have just stopped. That being said, this book was a fitting ending to a fairly good series. It was fast-paced and kept momentum. There was a ton of action - almost too much - like the grievers' attack at the end (what was WICKED's motive for that?) Some of the main questions get answered - about the variables and the search for a cure. In this book the reader finally gets to see the outside world and the damage the Flare has inflicted. All of that is the good stuff.<br /><br />Now for the bad. First, let me claim my bias. I enjoy when an author has some kind of agenda - some type of theme running throughout the text, something a reader can glean about life, society, themselves. In this series, there are some philosophical musings - mainly Machiavellian in nature about ends and means, and some super revved-up engineered Darwinism. But, I didn't really get anything out of this other than a bit of entertainment. There isn't much connection that the reader can make to these characters or philosophical ideas for one main reason - a severe lack of character depth and meaningful interpersonal interaction between characters. So many tragic things happen to these characters, paving the way for many interpersonal dynamics which could have played out, but the emotional connections between the characters seemed really stale. The love triangle, a juicy opportunity to infuse some emotion into any story, was completely lost. I understand that survival usually trumps sex-drive, but I wanted a little more than what the author gave us here. The two women in the story seemed placed there primarily for the purpose of sexual tension, but the author did nothing with it. Not to mention that none of the other Gladers had a hint of jealousy that these two beautiful women were both, shockingly, in love with Thomas. Minho was completely unreadable and didn't seem to have any motive other than lashing out at other people (though he is somewhat likeable for being a complete tough guy, at least, but it got old fast). The reason for the main characters' refusal to have their memories back was completely lost on me. I understand that they were sick of being manipulated, but seeing that they were going to be held captive regardless, and that the others from the maze who did get their memories back later came to the same conclusion about WICKED, just made it seem like Thomas and his gang were the obstinate little boys that WICKED said they were. In the end, I found myself not caring much about many of the characters. Sure I wanted them to survive, but was equally surprised that so many of them did, especially given what the author threw their way.<br /><br />Finally, the most impressive strength of this book ends up being a criticism of the series as a whole - the author should have made this trilogy a two book series. The Scorch Trials was a fairly pointless book, save for the introduction of some key characters and a scene or two. The Death Cure is much better than the second. The series in general lacks in terms of character development and interpersonal interaction. It attempts at some philosophy, but doesn't really seem to hit the mark. But, but it scores a huge A if you are in the mood for a mindless, over-the-top adrenaline rush.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|The game wasn't as much fun as I hoped it would be. The card play takes some getting used to. Uno is more fun with real people.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This could potentially be a really good game but it does have a lot of problems. I even suggested it to some friends to download and they have the same problems.. It crashes when you try to visit neighbors (while trying to ADD neighbors,) sometimes when it crashes you can lose your energy and other progress. Now the game won't even load unless the kindle is connected to the internet and sometimes when it IS connected it says it is not and to try again. Also there is a glitch in collecting from the houses, businesses and crops.. it gives them 100's of hours before you can collect again ( which is several days) and by that time the goal you are trying to complete or the person that is sick (which is timed) ends up dieing ( I have 5 tombstones one my land!)<br /><br />  If the developer makes an effort to fix these issues I could see this game really take off and be popular because it is a variation of the old school game, Oregon Trail, which a lot of us played in grade school. The graphics are decent and the lingo is hilarious. I really hope it starts to work right soon!
0071762345|5.0|I bought this book because it was the most popular social media book out there and I was not disappointed. This book really is worth every penny. If you want to understand the basics of social media and how to use social media for your brand, this is the book to buy. Brilliant. It covers various platforms like FB, Twitter, LinkedIn and Blogs but focusses more on the first two. It also contains examples and cases to help us understand how to apply the principles taught in the book. A must buy if you want to learn how to market your brand on social media.

B0059XTTW8|1.0|The Alec Guinness version is so much better there is no comparison possible. This shortened version of the novel is next to impossible to follow. It is merely random bits and pieces of the story with no continuity or context. Oldman's acting is almost non-existent. At the end you find out who the mole is, but you have no idea whatsoever of how he was identified.

James writing.. and i must say I was  impressed!!.. I haven't been this excited over a book and the characters since L.A. Banks vampire-hunter series!!!! and that was a few years ago!!..<br /> Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey were the total opposites. She was a hard-working average college girl (geek) and he was a super-gorgeous hunk who owned his own company with lots of money to spend!<br /> I've heard some negative feed back about this series, such as it being banned from some library's ...why? you mean to tell me there is no graphic  or sensually erotic books in the library except 50 shades of grey? .....As far as the porn comments...PUL-LEEZZ!!...this is not...i am a paranormal reader and my vamps, weres, fae, are all sexual beings it was almost like reading one of my paranormal books!.....Come on People if its that demeaning, or tramatizing DON'T READ THE BOOK!...its just that simple.<br /> If you have an open mind, and or looking for a few pointers in spicing up ur relationship or marriage...this is what ..Mz Billie (me) recommends!..*smile*....im off to read book 2!....Happy Reading!!!
0345803485|1.0|This is hands-down the worst book I have ever read.  And this is coming from someone who loved the Twilight Series.  The writing in 50 Shades is downright moronic.  The author uses the same descriptive phrases over, and over, and over, and over again.  Pick up a thesaurus lady!  I thought this would be a light, easy, silly read, but the writing is so atrocious I just couldn't stand it.  For the life of me I don't understand why this book has gotten so popular.  Yes, the sex scenes are pretty graphic, but again - the writing style ruins it!  And there is essentially no plot.  The relationship between the characters is poorly developed and quite honestly makes no sense.  I was not expecting fine literature, but this book was the bottom of the barrel.  Save your $9 and read something else.  I hated it!
B006Z7Z3S6|2.0|Honestly, I wanted to like this movie but it did not even come close to making use of all the rich possibilities inherent in the production.  The desk clerks were interesting characters with good chemistry, the Inn was intriguing and much could have been made of the premise.  Instead, what the viewer gets feels like a meandering mix of Reality TV (by the way of some low-budget/inept paranormal investigation and incidental/unrelated dialogue/action) and uninspired Urban Legend/Ghost Story (other similar tales exist of jilted lovers haunting the scene of their suicides, etc.)<br /><br />I'm all for building up characters, setting the mood, pacing the scene and developing the plot, but truly, there is a difference between leaving interpretations up to the viewer and just leaving them out entirely; the director needs to provide tangible clues and bits of evidence that build on one another and are ultimately quantifiable.  A little misdirection can also be a good thing...<br /><br />It's not enough to just swing a crystal, slam a door and suggest that something horrible happened in the basement. (Is revenge the only motive behind the phenomena; can't some other tantalizing historical tidbit make itself known?)  And it's also not enough to just give us snippets of issues/angst, as experienced by the characters, without making them an integral part of the mystery (such as helping Eleanor \\"come home\\" in \\"The Haunting\\" and revealing to Jack that he's \\"always been the caretaker\\" in \\"The Shining.\\")<br /><br />\\"The Innkeepers\\" plays something like a feature length \\"Scooby Doo\\" episode that got tweaked by Tobe Hooper in the last quarter. The vague outcome of this film isn't a reflection of style, but one of laziness and/or a lack of craft.
0374203032|5.0|Michael Sandel is one of the most well-known intellectuals in the United States today.  He is fresh off the well-deserved success of his book _Justice_ (sure to become a classic in political philosophy).  His latest book _What Money Can't Buy_ is actually quite connected to his previous book _Justice_.  In short, whereas in _Justice_ Sandel argues secular citizens in modern societies have a personal responsibility and social obligation to think through moral issues and to carefully and thoughtfully arrive at the best judgment of justice in any personal circumstance or social situation, in _What Money Can't Buy_ Sandel convincingly argues _and_ demonstrates how market relations impede efforts to arrive at the best judgment of justice and morality.  In other words, the overarching argument of _What Money Can't Buy_ is that markets often corrupt our _judgment_ of justice and our _doing_ of good action.<br /><br />It is very important here to underscores the qualifier \\"markets often\\", because Sandel does not offer any blanket condemnation of markets, but heeds warning to \\"the moral limits of markets.\\"  Markets certainly help accomplish lots of good, but at other times tend to undermine moral behavior and generate moral corruption (e.g. pp. 34-5).  According to Sandel this corruptive effect of markets is not external to markets, but a deep part of what constitutes \\"market relationships\\" (e.g. buying and selling commodities and services, in contrast to non-market relationships, e.g. family, friendships, non-monetary reciprocal actions, etc.).<br /><br />What is most impressive about Sandel's style is how non-polemic he is throughout.  Indeed in this book he is often non-philosophical, or at least he stops short of moral philosophy.  Sandel presents the reader with dozens and dozens of moral dilemmas, and instead of offering moral reasoning, he attempts to unfold the logic of why we sense a dilemma at all.<br /><br />For example, suppose a wealthy hiker decides it is worththe $100 fine to litter in the Grand Canyon (p. 65) why would most of us still find this offensive?  Because, says Sandel the wealthy hiker \\"has failed to appreciate [the Grand Canyon] in an appropriate way.\\"  Thus, when we get to other circumstances, for example, China's one-child policy, tradable pollution permits, etc., etc., etc. are fines, or the purchase of pollution rights, treating the object in the right way, or have we moved beyond the ability of markets to tackle the question and solve the problem?<br /><br />The pinnacle of Sandel's book is his discussion and presentation of life insurance.  Sandel tells his reader about Michael Rice, a 48-year-old employee of Walmart.  While helping a customer carry a television set to her care, Rice collapsed and died of a heart attack.  An insurance policy had been taken out with a $300,000 payout to the beneficiary.  The purchaser and beneficiary was not Rice's family, but his employer Walmart.  Neither Rice nor his family had known of this insurance policy taken out by Walmart, and his family was deeply offended and emotional hurt by the policy and benefit (p. 131ff).  Rice's family sued, and the lawsuit revealed Walmart had hundreds of thousands of such (\\"janitors insurance\\") policies; and so do 10,000s of other companies.  It is a type of investment, or gamble on how long employees will live.<br /><br />Insurance polices also exist for people dying of a terminal illness (such as aids, cancer, etc.), or \\"viaticals\\" (pp. 136 - 41).  \\"Unlike janitors insurance, the viatical business serves a clear social good - financing the final days of people with terminal illnesses. [...] The moral problem with viaticals is not that they lack consent.  It's that they are wagers on death that give investors a rooting interest in the prompt passing of the people whose polices they buy\\" (pp. 138 - 9).  A viatical company President shockingly captures the moral dilemma when he says \\"There have been some phenomenal returns, and therehave been some horror stories where people live longer\\" (p. 137).<br /><br />The question here is much like our wealthy hiker, are we (as a society of civilized citizens) treating the Grand Canyon and people dying of a terminal illness in the \\"appropriate ways.\\"  Should institutions exist whereby no one need to profit so that terminal ill people have funds for dying?<br /><br />Sandel's helps us think about the morality of selling the naming rights of buildings, stadiums, etc. (p. 163ff); advertising on individual person's bodies (p. 4) advertising in public schools, on Channel One, and on public school buses (pp. 196 - 201).  In his dozens and dozens of moral dilemmas, Sandel _demonstrates_ there is a limit to what we can expect markets to achieve for us, and there seems to be a wide and deep role for philosophy to contribute to social well-being.<br /><br />Finally, there has been wide criticism of this book for being superficial.  There is some warrant to this criticism, but it is warrant that completely misses the mark.  Sandel knows his audience, but more importantly he knows his purpose.  Sandel's book appears to be written for a popular audience, in part this is true.  However, it seems more accurate to say Sandel's intended audience is economists and those who teach economics, but written in such a way that a popular audience can listen in.  Sandel's purpose is quite simple, markets and the `science of economics' rarely, if ever, are independent of moral philosophy (indeed the first economists, including Adam Smith, were moral philosophers).  In this sense this book is an immanent critique of economic reasoning and the shallowness and absence of moral reasoning in economic textbooks.<br /><br />In this sense, this book is deeply philosophical, indeed sophisticated philosophy of immanent critique.  Immanent critique employs the logic and language of its subject and demonstrates its limitations and contradictions.  Thus, this book is riddled with economic language and lingo.  The book is a triumph in immanent critique of economics as a discipline; and a successful and important follow-up to Sandel's _Justice_.  If this book is a successful work of immanent critique, hopefully Sandel will put forth the effort to argue for the construction of institutions and incentives to supersede the moral limitations of markets.

This is a new band and it's great.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I found this novel deeply moving about family relationships and family disappointments after you've adopted a child from a different country and the trials all parties go through in the process of living life and forever wondering where you came from.  The desire to find out never leaves you.  A story well worth being told.
B007UXTG8M|5.0|This movie SHAME was a well written/directed/acted movie. Micheal Fassbender has truly proven that he is a brilliant actor, his performance is stunning, just as it is scary. Fassbender could possibly be a much underated talent in the waiting; his other roles were solid, however, SHAME is probably his most complex role to date. It truly took courage and talent to pull off such a complicated character. The main topic which is explored here is sexual addiction, and it's damaging effects within and without the soul of an individual. The director truly went dark with this tale, there is a lot of nudity and promiscuity, hence the NC-17 rating; but don't be turned off by the rating, this film is not about sexual exploits, it explores sexual addiction, and delivers a great movie. Sexual addiction is serious, and it can be just as destructive as other addictions such as; alcohol, drugs, etc. Again, Micheal Fassbender does a convincingly dynamic job of delivering a struggling, tortured soul. If you like drama, trust me, don't miss the movie.
B0084YAU86|5.0|The cliffhanger that this episode ends on couldn't be cliffier if we had actually seen Holmes and Watson going over the falls to their death. Instead we get that nasty little ponce, Moriarty, causing trouble and wreaking the ultimate havoc in the lives of Holmes and Watson. Moriarty isn't out to steal anything, though Mycroft claims that he already has computer code that will grant him access to anything in the world, Moriarty is out to ruin and kill Holmes, the only entertainment left to him.<br /><br />He does this by discrediting Holmes and the fall is far and dark indeed as it always is when it begins at the pinnacle. Holmes is shown as a narcissistic neurotic who faked all of his cases, at times even commiting the crimes for public adulation. How will Holmes escape the trap and will it be as ingenious as the original? We won't know until next season. The writing in the episode is fluent and fast-paced and the acting is as always superb. I have enjoyed this update of Holmes and will definitely tune in for the Season 3 when PBS airs them. As all episodes stand on their own, there is no need to see Season 1 before viewing Season 2 except for the utter enjoyment of watching all episodes of this update of a classic. Recommended not only to fans of the original Doyle stories and novels but to fans of the PBS Mystery series and mysteries in general. No untoward sex or violence in this episode.

B0084YC5UC|5.0|Mad Men is one of the best shows in the medium for conveying unspoken emotion, in the acting, the writing, the tone, the music and the setting. Things that people are feeling and thinking but not actually saying are conveyed just as strongly as those that are spoken.<br /><br />A lot happens in this episode. Lane is in trouble with the In Land Revenue in England and is fiddling the company books (no doubt momentarily) and robbing Peter to pay Paul to take care of it. This is an obvious set-up for a longer arc, but of all the things that happened in this episode, this was my least favorite. I like Lane and I believe he would act more honorably from what we have seen thus far. Pete continues to chase the Jaguar account, but as everyone knows, Jaguars were temperamental cars until Ford took them over, decades later. Late sixties flavor is mixed in with a throw-away sub-plot involving the Hari Krishnas.<br /><br />Don's resentment of Megan's decision to leave advertising continues to simmer and burn, though Megan largely ignores it, and Joan's estranged husband moves to make the estrangement permanent, which leads to the most powerful scene of the episode and possibly one of the most powerful of the series. Joan throws a temper tantrum in the outer office after being served and Don rescues her and takes her out. Viewers have always wanted to see Don and Joan interact more - not only are they the two most beautiful people on the show, they seem to be eerie mirror images of each other, a fact that is beautifully conveyed in the scene that follows. Joan and Don sit drinking in a mid-town bar, cynically surveying the talent. They are both scarred veterans of the battle between the sexes. They have both sought love and they have both manipulated to take the best on offer when love wasn't available. They are both weary and neither is sure they can pick up their guns and soldier on again. They stoically acknowledge each other in the old, old dance but know they are too much alike to be together and Don still has something to lose, though I suspect his fidelity is going to take a hit soon, rationalized by Megan's departure into the world of acting. The scene between Don and Joan is achingly beautiful, all the more so because viewers have been unconsciously waiting for it the entire run of the show. And it is pitch perfect. I cannot say enough about the acting and the writing in this scene or the perfection of it for these two characters.<br /><br />A five star episode.ike to be together and Don still has something to lose, though I suspect his fidelity is going to take a hit soon, rationalized by Megan's departure into the world of acting.

B007OAAK0O|3.0|Waited all these years and I got exactly what I assumed I would get. Thankful to have a copy on DVD, but was hoping for all the footage. Yes, all. What? Didn't know there was more? Don't remember more? Whomever Shout Factory purchased or licensed this video from, whether it was Anaid, Showtime, or the diva herself; this is the re-broadcast edit. Showtime had edited Friday's concert to add previous day's footage, in order to fit a two hour time slot. I remember the entire show because it was a milestone. Not to mention, I recorded the entire original live airing. There is at least 15 minutes missing including, \\"Pieces of Ice\\". Which was my favorite performance of the whole show! Therefore, I give it three stars for DVD release, a huge moment in history, and Ms. Ross' unforgettable energy and ability to keep her promise.

0307352145|4.0|As an introvert, I have been asked how come I don't talk much and people naturally assume I am shy.  I come from a family of introverts who value a calm environment and avoid public speaking like the plague!  In a world full of outgoing people, sometimes it is difficult to feel important.<br /><br />However, Susan Cain's new book, Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World that Can't Stop Talking, is an excellent book that explains why introverts are the way they are, how to connect with introverts, and how to become \\"pretend extrovert.\\"  If you aren't sure if you are an introvert, there is a helpful quiz in the beginning of the book to see just how introverted/extroverted you might be.<br /><br />Susan Cain wonderfully describes the powerful aspects of the introvert's personality and provides real life examples of successful introverts.  Interestingly, the American ideal of leadership is the extrovert, and the introvert often gets overlooked.<br /><br />The great part about this book is that while it can get quite technical, it is written in a conversational, layman style.  Even if you just skim through, I'm positive you will gain some insight into yourself or your introverted friends and family.<br /><br />*I received this book from the publisher in exchange for my honest review.  I was not compensated in any way.*
B0056FMNYA|4.0|I've been on a quest to find a secure way to mount my Canon 5D mkII (usually attached with the kit 24-105 f/4.0 L lens) to my body with the ability to easily grab and use it while chasing after my 20 month old son!  This camera and lens combo easily weigh in at a hefty 3.7 pounds.  So far the B-Grip is exactly what I needed.<br /><br />Pro:<br />-light weight, and very sturdy build.<br />-strong belt material (almost ballistic duty webbing)<br />-mounting plate well constructed<br />-thoughtful design elements<br />-safety latch<br />-Cost! Alot less than the other models from Spider or Peak Design...<br /><br />Cons:<br />-all the components are made of plastic.  Though I wouldn't really put this as a con because the material is rather VERY sturdy and strong.  Only time will tell exactly how well this plastic material will hold up.  I would imagine these components could survive a 4-story drop onto concrete! (please do not try this, I'm not liable if you do!)<br />-price.  It's technically constructed like a tripod mount, but attaches around your waist.<br />-NO way to safely attach a hand-strap plate/accessory/etc.<br /><br />Wishful part:<br />-An adapter or another plate design so I can attach a hand-strap.<br />-For this cost, some sort of safety lanyard to be included with this kit would have been nice.  Though I constructed my own using a few carabiner's and these attachments [[ASIN:B000IN3RUE OP/TECH USA 1301222 System Connectors (Utility Loop) (no QD) - Small Connectors to use with OP/TECH USA Straps with Swivel Hooks]]<br /><br />The way I use it:<br />I've attached it to my leather belt (1.25\\" wide) but it didn't feel secure enough.  So I use it with the included webbing belt.  I'm able to \\"slow run\\" and the camera doesn't flop around like some of the other holster models from Spider or Peak Design.<br /><br />It does require 2-hand operation to remove the camera but is very quick once you get the hang of it.<br />-Right hand flips the red safety lever, then grips camera.<br />-Left hand lifts release lever.<br />Haven't timed myself but I'd estimate 3-4 seconds worth of time?<br />Seating the camera is just as quick, all done in reverse.<br /><br />I'll hopefully update in the coming months if anything changes!
B004EPYZU8|2.0|Seriously, who gets paid to green light dreck this awful? 2 stars because the production quality is excellent and the acting decent at a minimum [clearly, one cannot expect actresses cast based solely upon their appearance to establish new standards for thespianism...] Can't fault the direction or the CG guys: they had a manga comic book script to work with, and did a bang up job! It's just... GIGO. You can't fix stupid!

B003YL4LYI|4.0|The first three books were amazing.  A Feast for Crows unfortunately broke that streak.  It was incredibly boring and read more like a history lesson than a story.  So I was very worried that A Dance with Dragons would be more of the same.  It really isn't.  Sure there are parts that drag but I think Martin manages to keep even the side stories interesting this time...most of them at least.  Maybe it's just that A Feast for Crows left out most of my favorite characters and A Dance with Dragons  focuses on the ones that I like.  Sure I would have liked to hear more about Bran and Arya but I don't think there's any denying that the story itself is just much better, despite the slow spots.<br /><br />I think the majority of reviewers have it right however when they say that both AFFC and ADWD could have been edited down quite a bit.  In truth I think they could have been whittled down to a single book that could have rivaled if not exceeded the first three.  But a thousand pages of fat between the two is enough to make any reader unhappy.  AFFC forced me to read and learn about characters that I had no interest in, perhaps for the sake of fully fleshing out all the ancillary characters.  But it was at the great expense of pace and story and I just ended up skimming most of it anyway.<br /><br />Cutting out the tedious Dorn saga could have saved a few hundred pages.  I also could have done without the elaborate Greyjoy side story.  The direction Martin chose to go with Sansa in AFFC also made for stale reading so it was nice that she was left out in ADWD.  To be honest once Joff left the story I felt like I had no one left to truly despise, which is why all the goings on in King's Landing were so dry and one of the reasons why I think AFFC sucked so much.  Too much Jaime and Cercei.  The comeuppance for Cercei was admittedly sweet in ADWD, but it would have been sweeter had it come earlier.<br /><br />I'm just hoping that in the next book Martin chooses to focus on thecharacters that I've grown to care about and refrains from delving into any more tedious side stories.  Let's finish this thing already...tie up the loose ends and give us a satisfying ending.  I don't care about the Tattered Prince's second cousin twice removed or how the Meereenese used to choose their kings 8000 years ago.  Tolkein managed to cram an amazing amount of detail into three books, but the story always moved forward and kept apace.  And for those who wanted more of the history of Middle Earth, there was the Silmarillion.<br /><br />But in the end this is a solid book.  If you can make it through AFFC, ADWD is a much more satisfying and engrossing read.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|When I ordered this item, everybody around me was talking about it as being a wonderful show. Obviously I didn't want to trust them until I managed to make my own opinion... ;) So I patiently waited for it to come into my mailbox and started watching. And, believe me: THIS SHOW IS AMAZING.<br />Moreover, the bluray quality is definitely a good way to catch every moment of the show and thus become almost one of the characters!!! So here is my advice: order it and enjoy!
1439153663|5.0|The Kitchen House is up there with one of the best books I've read. I got so involved with the story and the people, I didn't want the book to end. The Kitchen House not only told a compelling story, but taught me things I never knew about slavery. Kathleen Grissom paints a vivid picture of each character. Many of the events that occurred were emotional and some, extremely disturbing. The author told about the strong family bonds between slaves, as well as the horrific ways in which they were treated by their owners. I came out of this reading experience with a greater compassion for the families of former slaves.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Yea, I like this book. I might even love it by the time I'm finished reading it. It isn't for everyone but it's for me.

0345803485|4.0|If you are looking for brilliance and romance like you would find in Pride and Prejudice you will not get it in this book. It is by no means classic literature, however, if you are looking for a juicy read this is your book. It is simply written with words redundantly used...but what are catching aren't just the spicy scenes or infamous \\"Play Room\\", but a story about a 21 year old girl who knows nothing about life or relationships and is forced to make decisions based on lust and ignorance. The author is the first to tell you that she wrote it out of boredom and midlife crisis mode. It is the feminist controversy that has brought it so much attention. The idea that a man would be controlling and the woman even thinking about bowing to him (nothing new). The author intended to create a possibility of what could be for two very different people. As an adult with life experience you read the book and become angry with the main character or the punk guy who seems to be a dominate freak. Take the perspective of naive girl who falls in love for the first time and is overwhelmed with emotions and feelings she has never had and a guy who is effed up based on his early childhood. Anyone could tell her stay away, but she is lost in a world of blissful stupidity. It's a world of fantasy...one most don't see; but isn't that the beauty of literature even when it is simply written? The fantasy is intended to be interpreted by the reader. It will make you question your limits; both good and bad.<br />The feminist came out and I was ready to take out the claws. For this you will appreciate it because it does make you question many things; especially the idea of a woman being made to feel inferior, dehumanized, or belittled. The question then becomes...\\"How would you react if your husband presented you with a ROOM?\\" Perhaps you would have said, \\"Hell NO!\\" but would you have run or would you rationalize like Ana did? What most people seem to be forgetting is Ana's character is an adult and she is making her own decisions. I can honestly say that at 21 I was willing to put up with a lot more nonsense than I ever would today. The first book you will hate the male character and by the second you will be provided insight to why he is the way his is. Not making it okay, but a better understanding of his shenanigans. The fact is he is upfront and honest about what he wants from her. No matter if you agree or disagree he never came into the relationship with false pretenses. She is attempting to come into her own...and foolery is all a part of growing up.
0345803507|4.0|OK, OK, OK, I have read all three books in a little less than a week! However, I'm not at all ashamed of myself for not being able to put the series down! I really wanted to know what was going to happen next in this co-dependent relationship. Little Miss Ana goes from a mousey virginal girl in every way to a outspoken well sexed woman in a couple of months. Mr. Grey goes from the strong, self contained, dominating, ruling all he surveys to a more softer almost fragile man, no longer the demi-god she originally met. I don't mind the mind blowing sexcapades but it does become a little too much after a while, it came to a point for me that I craved more from the characters, I really wanted more story line. I did not care for the ending, it felt to short and lacking for me. I wanted to know what happened to the character's next, like Linc if he's secretly behind some aspects of the attacks its hard to see him taking Christian's final assualt on his company lying down with no retaliation at all, and Jack he's not going to be in prison forever, also Ana's pregnancy. Christian is so afraid of losing his new wife and being a parent it would have been nice to know how it played out and not the rushed version. I sincerly hope she decides to finish a book on Christian's point of view, being that he's entertaining in him self. I am glad a read this series, its so far from my usual reads like, Laurell K. Hamilton.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to commend Joss Whedon for his ridiculously fantastic space western show, but what really surprised me was the sheer toughness of the series. I had just received the series in the mail when a group of space pirates descended from the heavens, hellbent on snatching my brand new purchase. They pulled out their rifles and began to fire at me. With only underwear and Firefly to protect me, I thought I was a goner. Lucky for me, Firefly, through sheer badass, began to act on its own, blocking every shot fired and ricocheting the bullets back at the pirates just like in Star Wars. Truly, this is a magnificent series, capably of the most amazing feats of badassery.

0071762345|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It includes lots of real-world examples, how-to's and action items. I already know quite a bit on \\"how to be likeable online\\" but this put everything into better perspective and gave me some new ideas. An awesome book for business people or just anyone interested in having a great social presence. I'd absolutely read another book by Dave Kerpen the instant it's published!
B005723JSQ|1.0|I'm starting to wish that white authors just wouldn't even include black characters because every time I've read one in a book lately, it's been a complete caricature or stereotype.  Why was Ruby, the only black woman in the book, the motherly chunky mammy shoulder to lean on who called this chick MISSUS?  what the everlasting eff?  what year is this?  and Ruby's the BOSS so why would she be calling her missus?  I just can't<br /><br />\\"Ruby is the opposite. She's got smooth latte-colored skin, a huge motherly bust, and is packed so full of common sense it's practically wafting out of her ears.  The minute you're in her company, you feel saner, calmer, jollier, and stronger.\\"  Ladies and gentlemen, that is what we like to call a caricature.  Black folks are the sage advisors, especially chunky black female ones. come lay on her bosom, Poppy, and tell big mama your problems.  blech<br /><br />The rest of the book has been detailed enough in these other reviews so I just wanted to point this out as it didn't sit well with me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|'Books' like Twilight and Fifty Shades of Grey scare the living daylights out of me.<br /><br />Basically, this 'book' has all the problems that Twilight has (after all, FSoG was originally written as Twilight fan fiction).<br /><br />No, FSoG doesn't have sparkly vampires and there's the \\"BDSM-lens\\" element to give the story a bit of edge. Yes, some people will find \\"Christian's stalker tendencies\\" (self-described by the female protagonist, BellAna--oops, I mean, Ana--on page 418) to be the definition of \\"hot,\\" and will be awed by E L James' portrayal of Christian's \\"emotional intensity.\\" Reading is a personal affair and what constitutes \\"good writing\\" can be a very subjective thing.<br /><br />That being said...<br /><br />If you enjoyed the erotic elements of FSoG, I would like to recommend and encourage you to try the REAL erotic classic works that have stood the test of time (Anais Nin, Henry Miller, D.H. Lawrence, Marquis de Sade, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, to name a few). Classic works are classic works for a reason: they have substance and quality, something which seems to be lacking in our era which celebrates hype/image/packaging > true substance.<br /><br />I've gotten a headache from the amount of times \\"Holy crap!\\" has appeared in the text of FSoG, but that's another story for another day...<br /><br />I'm still reading FSoG and combing through the text, though this passage caught my eye the other day.<br /><br />* * * (Page 418):<br /><br />[Christian] turns to greet my mom. \\"Mrs. Adams, I am delighted to meet you.\\"<br /><br />How does he know her name? He gives her the heart-stopping, Christian Grey-patented, full-blown, no-prisoners smile. She doesn't have a hope. My mother's lower jaw practically hits the table. Jeez, get a grip, Mom. She takes his proffered hand, and they shake. My mother hasn't replied. Oh, complete dumbfounded speechlessness is genetic--I had no idea.<br /><br />* * *<br /><br />Holy crap. Can we say, 'like mother, like daughter'? That in and of itself in this context, is far more horrifying than the \\"spluttering guts and gore\\" that features in the average horror novel.<br /><br />Yes, I can see the \\"addictive\\" (for goodness sake, it's 'addictive', not 'addicting'!!) quality in the prose style of TL and FsoG.<br /><br />But I will choose to stay on my diet of quality books. After all, we are what we consume.<br /><br />\\"Mommy porn\\" is just like any other type of porn--it's an adult fantasy that's designed to titillate and/or arouse the reader/customer (and generate profits for the supplier).<br /><br />Is porn really how we should define our sex lives?? That in and of itself in this context, is far more horrifying than the \\"spluttering guts and gore\\" that features in the average horror novel.<br /><br />Yes, I can see the \\"addictive\\" (for goodness sake, it's 'addictive', not 'addicting'!!) quality in the prose style of TL and FsoG.<br /><br />But I will choose to stay on my diet of quality books.

B0072N4PD6|1.0|I keep an open mind when it comes to spiritual topics and can accept that we can develop more awareness with the Universe.  This book, however, is not what I expected with all the meditations, visualizations, cocoons of light, etc. that are repeated over and over in a slightly different context. Plus, the ideas are too far out there for me. Wish I could get my money back from this one.
B007AMMHSY|3.0|Firstly, I saw nothing that said the movie had English subtitles and I'm not at all fond of reading movies, but that being said this movie does have a mesmerizing quality.  Antonio Banderas is intense, charming, and brutal.<br /><br />I do agree that it is best to go into this movie knowing nothing about it, but I didn't find it as shocking as a few other reviewers, nor did I find the plot twists all that surprising.  Maybe because from early on I felt this was much like a fantasy - like Edward Scissorhands without the comedy.  In fact, Johnny Depp could have played this role with the same charming intensity.<br /><br />Now don't read further because the rest will contain spoilers that I found so completely absurd.  So absurd, in fact, that it really should have been pushed further and been made a dark comedy.<br /><br />******************************************************************************************************************<br /><br />Adam's apple, cleft chin, hips??  All without hormones?  Nose job, lip enhancement, permanent lip dye??  Higher, softer voice??  Oh, please!  And why was she ever bald?  Giving someone a vagina does not make them a woman any more then me having Ben-wah balls makes me a man.<br /><br />Is this one of these 'You had to read the book' - then if I would have read the book I would've thought the movie was a total dud and angry I spent even a nickle on it?<br /><br />Anyway, as I said, would have been much better pushed a bit further into the dark comedy genre.  As for the 'thought provoking' the only thought I'm entertaining is how nice it would be to have skin that repelled bugs.

0307352145|4.0|Quiet-The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking delves into the history and differences between introverts and extroverts. I personally do not like labels, however, Quiet is eye-opening.<br /><br />This book is neither pro or con introvert verses extroverts which I applaud. If the reader is an extrovert, I firmly believe the extrovert will understand those of us who are introverts. And, visa versa. If you know me personally, you may not think I'm an introvert. There are many different levels of introverts and extroverts, I've learned.<br /><br />Don't know if you are an introvert or extrovert? The author provides a handy quiz. There are different levels of introversion. Author Susan Cain informs us not everyone is the same level. One can actually be in the middle of an introvert and extrovert, called ambivert.<br /><br />Reading Quiet opened my eyes to see how our country really does regard extroverts as leaders. Should we conform or as the saying goes, 'come out of our shell'? In a world that is blaring \\"be yourself\\", it seems as though it is saying, \\"be yourself....as long as you are a leader, a go-getter, a social butterfly...\\". Quiet is full of introvert leaders. These leaders just have to pretend to be extroverts to get out there publicly.<br /><br />Author Susan Cain does have quite a bit of history and studies in her book. Did the book drag on and on? In some sections, yes. In other sections, no. I would assume it all depends on how much information of a particular study you'd find interesting.<br /><br />Quiet is full of so much information. It makes it hard to write a thorough review. I do recommend Quiet to employers, parents and anyone in leadership positions at church. Quiet will definitely help us all understand people--extroverts, ambiverts and introverts. Just think, if God made everyone the same what a boring world this would be.<br /><br />I received this book free from Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing through their Blogging for Books program. I am not required to write a favorable review, only an honest review.

B001P9EQH8|4.0|I was shopping for some headphones because my last pair broke on me.  I ended up ordering the AKG K 272 HD High-Definition Headphones with this headphone amp.  The reviews I came across said they were a little weak on bass and portable devices could use the extra umph from an amp.  It was fairly cheap and looked cool so I bought this one.  Works and looks great.  I use it on my PC, laptop, Ipod, and in the car.  No complaints so far, but I've only had 1 weekend to try it out.  Sleek looking, great battery life, and great sound. (Edit: There is a hissing sound when its plugged into usb which is annoying but the battery life is good so it's not that big of a problem.)

0345803493|5.0|I honestly had to force myself to read the first book ,it was dull... but the more I read the more captivating it was o.O.As for Fifty Shades Darker-I couldn't put the book down ! The captivating part of it wasn't the way it was written ,that's for sure ...it was the story,you connect with the characters.I didn't think I would enjoy reading it to this extent since I don't read these kinds of books but I got sucked into all the hype.For the regular Romance/Erotics Novel readers.. I know many that say oh well the writing is terrible , the story isn't all that great and that they have read better but in my opinion I think it was overall a good read.Now, I'm off to find my own Christian Grey ;)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you are looking for a fast and entertaining summer book, you will not be disappointed. Buy the trilogy rather then one book at a time, because you will want to get into the next book right away. Just remember when you are reading, that this is pure fantasy. It is nice to get lost in this fantasy world though, so don't be squeamish when reading the synopsis, because it is not as intense as it sounds.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|\\"Beware Spoiler ahead\\"<br />If you read the book, this is the version you have to watch, because it's most faithful to the book unlike \\"let me in\\". I don't mean by that Let me in is inferior. It's just different; more like an adaptation of the movie \\"let the right on in\\" instead. If you watch both movie you'll notice that even the shots are similar, but like mirrored.<br />Let's talk about the differences:<br />1. ELI/ ABBY<br />Let's talk about gender. In the book, Eli is a boy and Let the right one in \\"shows\\" that Eli is a boy.<br />Abby in Let me in, you never get to know that she is a boy. She only says that she is not a girl, but it goes more into letting the audience know that she is a vampire creature. We have to conclude that she is in fact a girl.<br />Eli is sad, looking for someone, a companion to his loneliness.<br />In let me in, Abby is definitely looking for a blood provider. Abby's blood providers hate what his doing,<br />On the other hand, Eli's Blood provider Hackan loves Eli. He asks for forgiveness as he fails to provide blood.<br />Abby's one don't. He just complains about being sloppy and getting tired of it. He wants to get caught.<br />Vampire look: Eli is described as the book and Abby looks \\"EVIL\\", a demonic face.<br />When Eli kills her first victim and snaps his neck, she feels sad. Abby just snaps it and goes away.<br />Abby mostly walks bare foot in the snow. Eli walks bare foot only once. I had problems with that because that would raise suspicious if anyone could see Abby at night walking.<br /><br />2. OSKAR /OWEN<br />Oskar and Eli's relationship are more believable. Oskar is a bullied boy, just like Owen.<br />The thing is that you can see that Oskar likes collecting pieces of newspaper with murderers, crimes...When he hits Jonny with a stick; he enjoys it if you look at his face expression. Owen is petrified after hitting Jimmy.<br />When Lacke goes into Eli's Apartment to kill him, Oskar pull his knife, he was about to perform his first kill. Owen on the other hand again, scared. Oskar just close the door, Owen walks away covers his ears, afraid.<br />In Let Me In,Lacke and the other drunks were replaced by a cop.<br />Lacke was going to get Revenge against Eli for biting Virginia's Neck. Let me in, the cop goes in without a warrant, breaking in Abby's apartment.<br />Virginia's was replaced by a random woman that lives' in Owen's block.<br />3. Blood Provider.<br />Hackan in Let the right one in is a Pedophile, that part was avoided in the film and in Let Me in too. I can understand why it was left out.<br />It is not described how Hackan and Eli ended up together but you can probably think he was looking for boys/girls.<br />Abby's blood provider can be seeing in the picture in her apartment. Abby in the picture look exactly the same and his blood provider around 12 years old. You can deduct that Owen will replace him.<br /><br />That is were the biggest difference between both movies, Eli looking for companionship in his loneliness. Abby looking for a replacement.<br />I still don't understand why this movie needed to be remade so soon. It was already perfect. The pace is better in Let The right one in. It gives mystery to the whole situation. In let me in, fast forward to the Blood Provider being transported to the hospital. I mean Let Me In jumped straight into the action. To me, Matt Reeves looked like he didn't read the book or didn't understand it while filming Let Me In.<br /><br />This movie is a masterpiece, among my all time favorite movies.

And the horrible ways he devises to do it...!<br />I love \\"listening\\" to Reacher deduce.

The answer is simple: because it's so deliciously bad that it's achieved an almost Ed Wood quality.<br /><br />Put quite frankly, the writing is atrocious. You have an overabundance and overkill of scenes where we're told how gorgeous Christian is, how much Ana lusts after him, and other things that are quite unnecessary. We're given so much abdominal quivering and convulsing that I'm convinced that the whole reason Ana refuses to eat through most of the book is because she's an IBS sufferer and cannot eat many items for fear that she'll get a case of the trots. Yet this is all written with such hilariously bad lines that I kept shoving the book under the noses of some of my coworkers and telling them \\"read this part!\\" By the by, if you ever want to watch reaction shots, turn the book to page 430 and have them read the tampon scene. It's pretty easy to see when they get to that part.<br /><br />As far as the sex goes, it's a little monotonous at times and not really as sizzling as many would have you believe. There are some nice spots, but generally this is rather tame as far as erotica goes. James will never overtake Zane as far as gratuitous overly detailed sex scenes go, although she'll probably be better known to the average person. It's just hard to see the sizzle in this, and not because the media has taken to calling this \\"mommy prawn\\". (Word censored for Amazon.) However I will say that the sex scenes are the most entertaining parts of the book, as James leaps into them with gusto. The non-sexual scenes are just a little dull, to be honest.<br /><br />But the bottom line remains: should you read this? I have to say... why not? It's bad, it's probably one of the least challenging books that you'll ever read in your life (and this is including the Archie comics you flip through at the register), but there's just this cheerful energy in this book that I can't deny. James certainly had fun writing this and her own admission that the writing is terrible helps make it that much easier to poke fun at it. I wouldn't necessarily recommend purchasing it, but if you can get it then it's worth flipping through.ok that I can't deny.

0143120530|3.0|This was an interesting read about the author's year at learning how to memorize things and competing in the US Memory Championship.  The book does not help you to remember where you left your car keys or the name of that cute coed you were just introduced to.
1933633867|5.0|Concepts like savings, thrift, and living within your means are beaten down at every opportunity by the financial and government agencies in our daily lives. \\"Old-Time\\" wisdom and advice such as the quote from Poor Richards Almanac in the title, are incredibly marginalized in today's modern world. In Debt, the author systematically goes over the history of finanace and money, showing that the last stage of every great society is the push by the autorities that be for its citizens to acquire more debt, and inevitable accompanying decay in the stability of the existing currency. The comparison to modern western society is too close to miss. In fact, as difficult as it may be for most to comprehend, the end stages of this government and bank run Ponzi-scheme may already be upon us. And, just as the passangers on the Titanic continued to dance and frolic for nearly an hour after the titanic hit the iceberg, we too may be having our last dance before the party's over. I won't turn this into an politico-economic thesis, but I will merely say that this book can be profound in its implications for those willing to look far into the future. Although the author is reported to be an anarchist of sorts, the book stands on its own, not as a condemnation of government, but as a critique on the monetary system that weeds its way into every society, ultimately taking over and choking out the garden.
B000002OX7|5.0|My first Who CD and this really is a terrific album that grows on you more and more. Great song writing.<br />Sound Quality is really excellent.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I want MORE MORE MORE! I can't believe this is over already! :( It's been forever since I was this enthusiastic about science fiction...if you can call it that. This isn't much more science fiction than \\"Divergent\\" - but I am loath to make this comparison because these books are as far away in quality as one end of the universe to another. You want to read dystopian literature with a post-apocalyptic twist? This omnibus containing five novels is all you need on the subject, except for perhaps \\"1984\\". Hugh Howey can really write, his characters and believable and loveable, his atmosphere well set, his world thoroughly realistic. I'm almost unable to resist the urge to shake my kindle in case a continuation might magically appear. I'm even considering re-reading all of it immediately. YES, it was that good!<br /><br />In a world on earth, set sometime in the future, the outside is filled with poison and unliveable. The people live in a silo, functioning something like an underground beehive with many levels for different things. There is a level for agriculture, one for IT, for a hospital, mechanical in the bottom and so on. These people have no idea of the world there once was, there is even a myth that God created the silo with everything they would need. There are some children's books still around, but their content is hard to decipher. The people who go mad from living underground and insist on going out are \\"sent cleaning\\". This means that they are sent out in austronat-like costume to clean the lenses of cameras on the outside. The suits don't last long and neither do the people.<br /><br />Enter sheriff Holston. His wife Allison was one of the ones who went mad, who went out and died. This after she had stumbled across some interesting deleted information on the silo's servers. Holston can't live without her, so he too goes cleaning, resulting in the need for a new sheriff. The deputy Marnes doesn't want the job. Mayor Jahns wants a woman from mechanical on the job, Juliette. This woman had helped on a case before and proven useful. So Mayor Jahns decends into the bowels of the silo to rectruit. She stops by IT on the way down, where she receives firm resistance from the powerful Bernard who's intent on seing another on the job instead.<br /><br />The mayor dies, Marnes dies, Juliette gets the job but she won't let old things lie - such as the murder of the mayor - and the question is how much longer she can resist. Her quest becomes unusually gruelling, particularly as the nasty Bernard from IT takes over the position as mayor. Juliette gets help from Lukas, a guy from IT, who likes to study stars on cloudless nights. Tries to record their movements. All the history of staregazing and knowledge of the universe is unknown, closely guarded. The silo is run with manipulation, misinformation and no information. The people who find this out are not happy about it, but resistance agains the system is kept firmly in check. Until now.<br /><br />This is a riveting story. The first two books deal mostly with Holston and then the Mayor Jahns, but the last three are about Juliette and her struggle for truth, to make sense of the world they live in. There are many shocks and surprises along the way and I think I've quite succesfully managed to not reveal any spoilers. READ THIS. You won't regret it. I'm a picky reader and I gobbled this in an insatiable frenzy, loving every crumb.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|While I loved the first two books as well, this one promoted the series from \\"latest YA mania\\" to \\"serious distopian story\\" for me.<br />There are political intrigues, hypocrisy, hidden agendas and many surprising turns of events. All major characters had an interesting personal development and there were many new ones that I liked. And, very real-life-like, many events happened outside of the character's control and they had no choice but to figure it out as they went.<br />What I loved most was the ending. I don't want to spoil anyone, but for me it was realistic and highly satisfying :)<br />Highly recommended trilogy!
B003Y5H5EW|3.0|As it is, I have a problem believing humans can overpower supernatural creatures like vamps and werewolves. But these vampires seem to be very weak. They've come off weak from the very first movie. It would appear that the only strong vampire in existence is Selena. Having said that, without giving too much away...<br /><br />Spoiler:<br /><br />It made more sense to me that this was actually a movie that kept with its tradition of vampire vs. werewolves and not both vs. humans. It was interesting to see the werewolves in control, getting the upper hand, but the story lacked a substance. There was hardly any meat on these offered bones. I would have liked to seen more vampire/werewolf interaction, instead of the story revolving solely around Selene and the \\"special vampire\\" child. I think an additional 30 mins added to flesh out the story more would have did this movie some good.

I could not attend the lecture, but liked what I read, so I checked reviews -- good ones -- and ordered Season One.  It came on time and packaged well.  I had a ball watching it, chuckling and enjoying its writing (very clever), as well as the acting and the scenes of London.  A very fine production with no foul language, which I am beginning to disike in my entertainment.  Watson is a real \\"character\\" and not flashy.  Holmes is terrifically flashy!  The dialogue requires attention, so stop the DVD when you get up for a moment.  Overall, I kind of just loved it!

0439023513|4.0|Collins is a good writer. She created a world in which her characters lived, and it's a very flawed world. The excess in the Capitol stands out against the hunger and need in the districts. The hint of the past rebellion, the current Hunger Games system, and the growing unrest in the districts are a fabulous plot and create a high level of action. The superb creation of that world and the engaging plot, however, cost the reader in lack of character development.<br /><br />Peeta and Gale don't grow or change at all. Now, things happen to them, and they are part of the love triangle that creates such conflict for Katniss, but overall, they are who they are--like all of the characters in the book. Even Katniss doesn't change that much from beginning to end. After reading all three books, I would say Haymitch is probably my favorite. He doesn't change either, but he does surprise the reader from time to time. Everyone else is predictable. Katniss and Prim's mother is so little part of this series, it's almost like she shouldn't exist at all. Could the writer have done more with her?<br /><br />In Mockingjay, Collins creates an action-packed thriller of a story. The reader gets rewarded for all the tension of the previous books and sees how everything up to this point has impacted Katniss. Perhaps this is also a strength of the book. No, Katniss doesn't go through a major life change, but everything that has happened so far, and a discussion with a pivotal character, leads her to take certain actions, which turn into a thrilling conclusion; a conclusion I saw coming before it happened.<br /><br />I have a few wishes for this book, most are that some characters wouldn't die; but my greatest wish would be that the author did not include an epilogue. I didn't have an issue with the content of the epilogue. It would be strange for someone as emotionally scarred as Katniss to move on and have a totally happy ever after. It's more because I felt the ending was so perfect and strong that it was a shame to bring the reader twenty years into the future. I would have liked Collins to let the reader draw her own conclusions regarding Katniss's future.trong that it was a shame to bring the reader twenty years into the future.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is everything that made Mario such a classic.  Cute but challenging enough to keep you playing, simple controls, and lots things to jump on/over/for.  Bottom line it's just fun.
0439023491|5.0|In this highly anticipated sequel to The Hunger Games, readers revisit Panem along with Katniss, as she tells the story of the Victory Tour and the unrest her actions in the Hunger Games caused. Collins's impressive writing captures the reader's attention and there are enough twists and turns to keep her engaged.<br /><br />The largest challenge with Catching Fire' is that Katniss is turned into an unlikeable, whiny character without direction. In amongst the glimpses of the growing rebellion, she shares bits and pieces of the Hunger Games as she experienced them; the tension between her and Gale because of her relationship with Peeta; her fear of what Snow could do to her family unless she can convince all of Panem she is deeply in love the the bread maker/artist. And while the reader sympathizes with all the Games have cost her, they don't feel Katniss has grown or learned much of anything.<br /><br />A Quarter Quell is announced and its rules shock everyone. The reader sees more violence and more death. Tributes are going to have to make decisions. They are going to have to form alliances if they wish to survive.<br /><br />Yes, this book has a fabulous cliffhanger ending that will leave the reader eager to pick up the final book of the trilogy, but Catching Fire didn't have as much meat as I was looking for. I didn't want to rehash so much of what happened in the first book. I wanted Gale to play a more pivotal role in Catching Fire. I wanted Katniss to make decisions instead of complaining about her circumstances. My daughter, who read the books with me, liked it, but she preferred the first and third books as well.
B002RI9M2U|5.0|This book is excellent and a must read for young teenagers although my son is a little younger he still loved this book. It makes you aware of your actions and how they effect people.

B005N4F48Q|3.0|Acting wasn't too deep.  More like a TV drama which I think this might have been at one time.  Lots of heavy handed speech making and soap boxing contrived to present morality to the audience in a way so as to make them not have to think too hard.  I'm no civil war buff, but was curious to watch this movie after watching Ken Burn's CIVIL WAR documentary which was a far far better use of my time in every way.  To sum it up, this film wasn't nearly as deep or interesting as it tried to be, but if TV-level drama is what you like then this is worth a watch.  Civil War buff would like it, but it really was made for folks who really don't know much about the civil war and probably will never show a deep interest.

B00753MBHA|5.0|After their \\"comeback\\" album in 2010 Blood Of The Nations blew the wider metal world away Accept had really set themselves a difficult task to follow it up with their next album.  But with Andy Sneap back on board again producing, mixing, mastering and engineering the new album, they've proved that BOTN was no one-off, and Accept have confirmed that they are back as a real metal force once again.<br /><br />Initially this album didn't really hit home with me though, and it took about half a dozen listens before it clicked.  But when it did click with me, it did in a big way!  I think the reason for my initial impression is because I was probably hoping/expecting more of the same that we got with BOTN. But this album isn't BOTN II and that is a good thing.  Attempting to make another version of that album would have been a big mistake.  What Accept have done is to take all that which was good about BOTN but come up with something different and completely original.  Yet at the same time they have made an album here which has much in common with their classic albums from the early to mid 1980's, which will no doubt please both their long time and newer fans alike.<br /><br />Production wise this album is first class and Andy Sneap must surely now be one of the most sought after producers for any band that has their head screwed on right.  But what shines through loud and clear on Stalingrad is how good these guys are as musicians, and even more, how much they seem to be enjoying themselves.  Not only are they on top of their game, they all play their arses off!  Also, Mark Tornillo sounds very comfortable in the vocalist role, leaving no doubt that he has nothing to prove, he is the voice of Accept now.  The highlight to me though is undoubtedly Wolf Hoffmann.  No wonder he is such a highly regarded and respected guitarist by the guitar community, he is all over this album.  Stalingrad really is a guitar album, and on it Wolf shines.  It is his lead guitar work, his solos and his melody which lift a lot of these songs to a whole other level.  And I also think that dabbling with the axe myself these last 3-4 years has led me to appreciate even more just how good this guy really is.<br /><br />As an album Stalingrad really hits you like a thunderous barrage of Stalin organs.  The pace of the songs is frequently high (more so than on BOTN), and their sonic power is immense.  There are some moments where the pace slows down to provide some respite, but much like the famous battle for the city itself, Stalingrad for the most part never lets up in intensity.  This isn't BOTN, but it's damn near almost as good.<br /><br />Preferred Tracks:<br />Stalingrad - This song is awesome.  It has a rhythm that sounds like a continuous rapid fire burst from an MG-42, and a lead guitar melody that pleads for a live audience to sing along with it \\"whoa oh oh\\" style.  Be prepared for this melody to infest your brain and don't be surprised if (like me) you suddenly out of the blue find yourself whistling it, or doing the whole \\"whoa oh oh\\" thing! The guitar solo is excellent, and just when you think the song is finishing it cranks up again.<br />Hellfire (Dresden) - Along with the title track, this is my favourite song.  In fact I can't separate these two, they're both great.  Hellfire is about another World War II catastrophe, during which deliberate continuous, sustained allied bombing of a beautiful and historic German city resulted in death of innocent civilians on a massive scale.  The fact that this was done at a time when the war was already won, Germany was on the brink of surrendering and the city itself was of no military value has caused the Germans to justifiably consider this a war crime.  But how often are the victors of war charged with war crimes or made to account for their actions?  Anyway, subject matter aside, the song is an absolute cracker.  Great head-banging rhythm, fabulous guitar work, cool chorus.  There's nice change of pace just over half way through in the guitar solo before it cranks up the pace again, leading into another change of pace with a melodic refrain, before the final fury.<br /><br />Other top songs are Twist Of Fate, Hung Drawn And Quartered, The Quick And The Dead, Shadow Soldiers (with an acoustic intro that has a sound which reminds me of their song The King from the 1980 album I'm A Rebel), and Flash To Bang Time which I could also go on about but will spare you.  Even one of the weaker tracks The Galley has some ultra-cool bits like the driving bass in the first verse and the melodic guitar reprise to end it, and the other songs still aren't bad, including the bonus track Never Forget.<br /><br />This is definitely another A-Grade quality heavy metal album from Accept.  Hopefully they will release a live DVD & double live album soon!e just over half way through in the guitar solo before it cranks up the pace again, leading into another change of pace with a melodic refrain, before the final fury.<br /><br />Other top songs are Twist Of Fate, Hung Drawn And Quartered, The Quick And The Dead, Shadow Soldiers (with an acoustic intro that has a sound which reminds me of their song The King from the 1980 album I'm A Rebel), and Flash To Bang Time which I could also go on about but will spare you.

B00127RAJY|4.0|First off JIllian is a good trainer and this workout delivers in strength and cardio.  I usually do this workout level 2 or 3 after I finish running 3 to 4 miles which is perfect for me.  For a 20 minute workout it delivers the goods and in no time you'll have many of the exercises memorized and you can do them without even turning on this video.  It's a little frustrating that you have go through her spiel every time you turn on the video and she does not usually do all the exercises during the video but refers to her \\"two best girls\\" doing the exercises at a beginner and advanced level.  She does however throughly show you how to do the moves and in no time you will be much leaner so just go for it as it's fairly inexpensive and a great video to add to your workout collection.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I've used three different styluses one of which is the Jot Pro.  The Jot Pro affords a lot of precision and comes closest to a 'pen' for the tablet screens, but it makes quite a bit of noise when writing because it has a metal 'nib' holding the plastic disc that comes in contact with the screen.  The Cosmonaut on the other hand is very smooth to write with.  It is clear that the pen/writing resolution on the iPad is nowhere near a real paper, and so a stylus that tries to be more like a pen does not seem natural.  The Cosmonaut, on the other hand, feels surprisingly natural to hold with it's wide body.  Additionally, compared to other styluses, it is very robust (mostly because of it's ridiculously simple construction), and feels great in the hand because of the rubber grip and good weight from of the aluminum rod.<br /><br />Another interesting thing about the Cosmonaut is that you have to apply a bit of pressure for the touch to get recognized, so you can more the stylus around the screen without any pressure and the touch will not be recognized.  This is very handy when sketching.
B00476Q8KO|5.0|Some of my family really enjoyed the action in this movie, including two of my grandchildren.  I am thinking of buying this one.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'll start by saying I didn't like Twilight, because I think liking it would be a huge factor in whether or not you like this book. It's no surprise considering this book started out it's life as BDSM tinged Twilight fan fiction. Maybe you've never read Twilight and want to know why this book is only worth 2 stars and how it holds up on it's own. Well...<br /><br />No variety in actions.<br />Ana spends most of her time biting her lip and refusing to eat. Flip to any page and I can almost guarantee Ana will be biting her lip, not eating, flushing, talking to her \\"Inner Goddess\\", or musing about how perfect Christian is but oh no he wants to hurt me. Bella/Edward anyone? Christian takes an interest in her for absolutely no reason, and if I have to read about him telling her not to bite her lip because it turns him on one more time I will rage. The author spends way too much time obsessing about Ana not eating and Christian playing dad asking her to constantly eat. There is never a purpose for this! We get that she needs to be strong or whatever but it's way over done. I don't care what Ana feels about eating pot roast or chicken caesar salad because it doesn't matter. Christian comes off as whiny and possessive at times, and gives into Ana far too easily. He doesn't come off as a convincing dom at all. Which leads us to..<br /><br />Not particularly erotic.<br />You don't even get to the first real \\"red room of pain\\" entries until about half way through the book, and no, they aren't good. Most scenes last about a half page and are basically \\"he thrusts into me harder until he comes\\". Yawn. The sex itself is so utterly boring, and for a book people are raving about because of the sex I was left wanting way more. I can't relate to a \\"heroine\\" that climaxes after 2 minutes of vanilla intercourse (something only 27% of women do), and I laugh at Christian being able to rebound and go again after a staying period of about 5 minutes. I don't need to read about \\"the tearing of foil\\" that accompanies EVERY SINGLE SEX SCENE. Find another way to describe putting a condom on for craps sake, this IS a book right? I basically wanted to throw the book away when in the first real BDSM scene Ana is being gently whipped with a riding crop and climaxes from being hit on the vagina 3 times. This woman would climax from being looked at the wrong way. She'd climax from a strong gust of wind. It's just so boring and unrelateable. Another point that I really wanted to put the book down again after reading the scene where he had sex with her on her period. I was expecting Ana to talk about what it felt like to have him climax inside her without a condom, being this is the first time this happens in the book but the author completely glosses over this. What was the point of period sex then!? It made no sense and frankly was pretty gross. If this is what passes for erotic literature I think I can make a fortune. Which sums up...<br /><br />Doesn't stand up as a love story OR sex fluff.<br />If you took out the sex scenes and made them into a book, no story, no nothing, just pure fluff, it wouldn't stand up. The sex is BORING. If you took out the story and just had it about a man who is afraid to love you'd also have nothing. The story itself is very ho hum...boring catalyst woman you can project yourself into, rich/handsome man wants every piece of you for no conceivable reason, it's been done. Where's the story?<br /><br />So the fact that this book holds up as neither a good love story nor pure erotic fun is the biggest reason I think it deserves 2 stars. If you're looking to read it for either of those reasons you're going to be sorely disappointed. Probably more sore then Ana got in the entire book. And for a book about BDSM that's just sad.of foil\\" that accompanies EVERY SINGLE SEX SCENE. Find another way to describe putting a condom on for craps sake, this IS a book right? I basically wanted to throw the book away when in the first real BDSM scene Ana is being gently whipped with a riding crop and climaxes from being hit on the vagina 3 times. This woman would climax from being looked at the wrong way. She'd climax from a strong gust of wind. It's just so boring and unrelateable. Another point that I really wanted to put the book down again after reading the scene where he had sex with her on her period. I was expecting Ana to talk about what it felt like to have him climax inside her without a condom, being this is the first time this happens in the book but the author completely glosses over this. What was the point of period sex then!? It made no sense and frankly was pretty gross. If this is what passes for erotic literature I think I can make a fortune. Which sums up...<br /><br />Doesn't stand up as a love story OR sex fluff.<br />If you took out the sex scenes and made them into a book, no story, no nothing, just pure fluff, it wouldn't stand up. The sex is BORING. If you took out the story and just had it about a man who is afraid to love you'd also have nothing. The story itself is very ho hum...boring catalyst woman you can project yourself into, rich/handsome man wants every piece of you for no conceivable reason, it's been done.

B002KEDQJQ|3.0|A couple scenes are missing. 1) Rorschach explanation of why he is the way he is. 2) Adrian Veidt's explanation of his past life. I was disappointed that these scenes were not included.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|The game is really fun...when it works.  When I stop playiing the game for a while then play it again it checks for updates and says that my Internet doesn't work ashen it clearly does. I will have 5 bars of Internet and itwill still say it. please fix!!!
B0083GPDBO|1.0|Well...highly rated and that is why I paid to see this. Disapointment from the start. Camflicks not my bag for one and this is sssslow moving. Some action but certainly not worth the $$$. Juvenile with no decent continuity and novice plot.
B0037VIBGY|5.0|Very interesting movie, charming character if not for everyone. Tom Hardy is a great actor, fascinating performance, entertaining as well.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|Excellent app that allows a combination of sounds with variable volume. If you hear a gap in sounds when the track repeats, it is because of your particular version of android (most ics high end devices), not because of a problem with the app.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|Even though some of the premise stretches incredulity, the actual sentiment is grand and the delivery is great.<br /><br />If you're at all a fan of psychological science fiction, the kind that's more interested with what's going on inside people's heads than with hard science, then you'll be well at home here.<br /><br />If you're a fan of headstrong characters that buck authority, even in the face of ridiculous hardships, you'll be at home here.<br /><br />If you're a fan of watching a good writer find his legs in a story, and work his way through the conclusion of one idea into a legitimately bigger story, then you'll really like it here.<br /><br />Skip trying out the waters with the first short story and just grab this whole omnibus chunk and treat it as a single novel. I guarantee you'll end up getting part 6 right after, and stick part 7 on your must read when it comes out list.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I give this book a good rating.It was hard to put the book down once I started reading it. If you are a parent you would sympathize with Jacob's parents as they strongly defend their son against charges of Murder.The ending completly took me by surprise. It was unexpected. The parents emotions were real and raw.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like this game.  variety of backgrounds and card backs available for changing the looks.  absolutely hate the commercials between games.  especially the videos. Still, I understand the need for it.
B007D5DUBG|5.0|The Pretty Reckless have a great bluessy sound lead by Taylors vocals and great guitar riffs. I love \\"Cold Blooded\\" it's my favorite song on this EP.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|I enjoyed the book and found once I got into it was hard to put down.  It was like reading 3 stories at the same time so took a little concentration to remember which time period the story was in.  Overall a good book.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Hooked by the preview to read more. Brilliantly presented view of what makes us do those things we love to do. Great narrative with real world case examples. Pleasantly surprised how I was compelled to read more, it might even be a new habit I have developed due to some cue and reward.<br /><br />Makes you look at the things you routinely do in a different way. Not overly heavy and scientific, so you don't need to be a brain surgeon to understand what the author is presenting.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book was one of the best I've read. It stirred so many emotions and I cried like a baby at the end. Brilliant.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|One reason I absolutly love this game is because one thing I think when I am bored is &quot;What do I want to play on my kindle fire?&quot; and then I am jumping off the walls because I cant wait to play Lep's World. Best game ever!!
B007X15GRQ|4.0|There's nothing really new in this movie, it's not mind blowing, it's marginally suspenseful in moments, much of it is unbelievable & too good to be true, but it's not bad.  I'd recommend watching it on a boring day.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|okay just doing this for points okay thanks please ignore this. okay okay okay please help me is this game real
B004JN1CW4|3.0|I have to say I generally like distopians, and originally I think Dashners idea was great. However the ending didn't seem as well put together as the  first book. I still enjoyed it though.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A great game for all ages. I love it.  I could play ALL day and night.  My Kindergartener even loves this game
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This is a great little game with many games in one. I like how you can play again and again and still have something new.
0345803485|1.0|what a complete waste of ten dollars!!!! the similaities between this book and twilight makes me nauseous. the characters are the same, down to the copper colored hair and the pretty girl who describes herself as plain. the author actually uses the word \\"dazzle\\" and makes ana stop breathing because her man is just so gorgeous. the first person references of her \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" is so repetive and trite that i could almost predict when i'd see them next. the one thing that this book has that twilight does not is sex, but even the sex scenes are not that hot, and they definitely do not make up for how poorly this book was written and so obviously copied from stephanie meyers. it's a shame that this author will make so much money on these books and movies when all she did was copy.
B00003JRCQ|4.0|Others have already given excellent reviews, so really, my only 2 cents to add is that I think this is enjoyable from the first viewing, and enjoyment increases from there. I have seen 3 different film versions of Persuasion, and I enjoy them all, but this one may become my favorite.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|I ordered this movie for my grandson's birthday and he totally loves it! I had no problem with this seller and it arrived earlier than expected. Can't go wrong with this movie in any way!
B00004Z459|4.0|The same awesome music, inspiring lyrics and good fun that I expect from Linkin Park. There is a nice blend of popular and heavier music to bop along to.
B0045JEPXK|5.0|I love this singer and her concert live in London was amazing! I love listening the cd in my car and also watch the concert at home. Leona has amazing voice!
B003X5UFWW|5.0|This was a great movie. It has lots of action and the message of loyalty, discipline and strength was well displayed.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|A good quick read to bring closure to the series.  I recommend reading all three of the Hunger Games Trilogy.
1612680011|1.0|I struggled with rating Rich Dad, Poor Dad.  The author makes many good points, like becoming a business owner rather than an employee.  He also provides some insight into the benefits of being an entrepreneur rather than a worker.  But the book fails to show/tell how to reach this goal.  Besides \\"buying assets\\" that produce cash flow, there is little actual investment advice.  The book is very folksy and its pretty clear the author is getting rich off of millions of Americans that want some incremental financial advice, rather than just buying mutual funds.<br /><br />However, many of the strategies in this book are VERY dangerous for the average investor/entrepreneur.  Buying rental properties with borrowed money has bankrupted millions of people this decade.  Sure, it sounded great and easy when financing was cheap, real estate always went up, and banks would lend to anyone.  But that has all changed.  Rental properties are high maintenance, low yield investments.  The annual return on a rental properties can disappear overnight if the tenant skips a monthly payment and leaves town.  The cost of re-cupping the money or evicting is expensive.  Unexpected repairs, maintenance can be much higher than anticipated, and regular refurbishing ruins cash flow.  Then try to sell the property and you lose 7% to the realtor, another year worth of lost cash flow. If the asset has fallen in value, like most real estate over the last 10 years, the bank gets their money first and you're left holding the entire loss. In many cases it can be more the your original investment and through the investment you've had insurance, maintenance, and property taxes to pay.  The book also fails to discuss the cost of all the suggested investment strategies.  Accountants can be expensive, business interest has taxation issues that are ignored, and real estate also gets taxed both annually and upon sale.<br /><br />Its pretty clear this book was written before the housing bubble collapsed.  Itcapitalized on the fact so many people lost money in stocks and needed a new outlet.  This book sounded great, but simply benefited from what was working at the time.<br />Today, the real estate market is much more crowded and competitive.  Return on rental properties are 6-8% per year, if nothing goes wrong.  Banks are much more frugal with their capital.  That makes financing for non-primary resident properties expensive and keeps property prices down by limiting buyers.<br /><br />All readers show avoid serial financial authors.  Its pretty clear his business is writing vague inspirational financial education books, again and again and again, while you don't get richer.<br /><br />I do recommend, the Millionaire Next Door, and Malcomb Gladwell's, Outliers.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I bought this book because I was curious. There is a A LOT of hype around this book and I got swept on to it's bandwagon. The book/ story is a fast mildly entertaining read( thats why i gave it three stars: its the kind of book that you read if you were stuck in an elevator or mine shaft and had no choice but sit tight and wait for an undetermined amount of time) It is not complex it's far from brilliant it's a hyped up story that's has a really great publicist? The \\"racy\\" sex scenes are like the kind you would find in those \\" fabio\\" romance novels. Ok so the main guy is into different stuff.... Yeah.. And?<br />The love story point of view was lost on me!!!<br />Overall i really I didn't get what was so appealing... I don't get it?!?<br />The whole story is implausible and rather poorly strung together<br />There is so much repetition , like an incredible amount of repetition, the author repeats and repeats and repeats repeatedly!!!!<br /><br />Don't waste your money on this book; borrow it or read a book spoiler on line. Really a waste of time<br />So much so I couldn't be bothered to finish it or skip to the end ...<br />Minutes of my life wasted... Sigh
B000002LMK|5.0|Great music, classic level! If ye love Neil's work, It's a \\"must have\\"!! It has more than three or four of my favorite songs ever!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Fun games. Great time killer. Fun to try and unlock different levels. Lots of games to play. Good for a free game.
B004EPZ08E|4.0|You know, this movie isn't perfect but it is damned funny! I feel that overall the casting was great! The three main characters in the movie are honest, hard-working guys who only want what's fair and right. Unfortunately, they all have one thing in common: Horrible Bosses who make their jobs living hell!<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was just so deliciously evil in his role as the company president. The scheming tactics he uses to set up Jason Bateman's character for failure are just insidiously funny! Jennifer Aniston's role in this movie is such a drastic departure from the wholesome, \\"good girl\\" roles I've seen her in over the years that it was almost a shock watching this character brazenly putting unwelcome moves on her male assistant in the office right under her sedated patients' noses! Colin Farrell plays a self-involved scumbag dope-head who just inherited a thriving business from his recently deceased father. He is hell-bent on using the company as his personal ATM machine until he runs it into the ground, employees not withstanding!<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie because it has a good, fast pace, the characters are outrageous and we can all share in the frustration these three guys have with their bosses and how they are pushed to the breaking point. What really works in this movie is how one off-the-cuff suggestion made in a moment of frustration and despair eventually snowballs into a series of events that takes our heroes down a path of crazy mistakes, dangerous alliances and moments of sheer hilarious chaos. I feel this movie should be considered a worthy companion piece to any collection that includes the original \\"Nine to Five\\" movie and \\"Office Space\\", another funny movie that also happens to feature Jennifer Aniston.<br /><br />Thank you for reading!
B0065AR71E|5.0|I bought this book for my son, it is very detailed and helpful. As anyone who plays this game knows it is huge and long. The book helps you find some answers.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this is my review. I s an interesting game. I just do not think the food should spoil if I cannot get back to the game in time. exspeacially the items which take a day to make. I am a single mom and when this happens I just do not want to play the game anymore.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Has all the features of a basic caluclator. Is full screen, which is really nice. Easy to use and view computations. Great feature that allows you to see the equation just entered and allows editing of the number on screen rsther than starting over. and if you realize you entered theverong number,  no problem cluck on the equation and you history pops up. select where yoy want to start over from. great for balancing checkbook or adding a sting of numbers.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I am a huge history fan and love period films. My favorites are usually set during Victorian age and Edwardian age. Emily Blunt gives a wonderful performance as Queen Victoria. The story tells of Her Majesty growing up and falling in love. Fabulous!
B007MDB71O|5.0|This is a wonderful adaptation of ERB's book. Every fan of his should own this. Disney gave Andrew Stanton the shaft!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|the game is so fun I never get to far from my kindle to check for updates.you should get this game if you see it
0792839749|5.0|I received it very quickly.  One of my favorite movies as a child.  Having lived in Europe as a child it brought back many memories of visiting the castle.  Great movie for kids imaginations.
0375842209|5.0|This historical fiction novel is narrated by none other than death itself. This book has its moments of happiness and joy but the majority of this book is filled with pain and suffering. Its a very depressing book that could make one feel like he was actually there. Liesel Miminger is put into a very sad situation early on in the book. Due to the painful experience she goes through she is sent to live with a german family on the street of Molching. Franz and Hanz Hubermann are now Liesel's new parents and on her new street is a boy named Rudy Stiener. Intended for readers of ages 13 and up, this is a phenomenal book. It kept my attention throughout the entire story and no matter what turn the book took, it was unexpected. I do agree with this books theme. In the midst of pain, distress, and death, there is always some sort of hope. No matter what form or fashion, it is there. I really like the character Max Vandenburg because of his character and morals. max is the kind of person i connect with in a book and I like the fact that he lives. the author did a fantastic job with his approach on such a touchy subject. The way the book is brought forth by death is fantastically displayed in this novel. I think the only thing that could have improved this book would be if Hanz Hubermann had lived, I think that this would have helped with the emotional aspect of the book. This is overall a fantastic book.
076781326X|5.0|It came in quickly.  This is my all time favorite movie as a child.  Loved watching it with my kids
B003Y5H5EW|2.0|This movie, while well produced, feels like a rehash of all the other Underworld movies. You could almost interchange some of the scenes with the last two Underworld movies and it wouldn't show. Perhaps the director for the next installment can just piece together moments from all the movies and call it \\"Underworld Recollections.\\"
B002CLBJPK|5.0|received the item in a timely manner. New condition.  loved the movie as a child and it was so much fun to watch it with my children.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Having recently become a fan of the AMC show \\"The Walking Dead\\", I thought I would pick up some literature in the zombie genre to help me ease into the end of the television season. I really enjoyed this book despite the interview format which many seem to dislike. I liked the format because it provided for natural breaks in reading for when I needed to put the book down. However, it was a real page-turner!<br /><br />I am not going to give any details on the story itself (I hate spoiler-laden reviews), but will say that the format of the book is a collection of post-war interviews with survivors of the zombie apocalypse. The stories are quite varied and told from the perspective of a diverse collection of people. Some were on the front lines of the fight with the military, others are just civilians in different parts of the world. One was an elderly blind man, another a shut-in internet addict, and others more or less just normal people struggling to survive the horror.<br /><br />I will say also that this book is not explicitly gory like one would expect a zombie novel to be. So for those of you with queasy stomachs, there are no lengthy descriptions of people being eaten alive.<br /><br />Overall a very enjoyable read! I've read about the film rights being purchased by Brad Pitt, so perhaps this will become a good movie some day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book! Couldn't put it down! I stayed up for an entire night and read the whole thing. I think everyone should read about the sexy Christian Grey. :)
B0055SWM08|5.0|fun and challenging puzzle game, many variations to keep it interesting, i would recommend this game for all puzzle game lovers and help keep your mind sharp
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I'm only rating to get the coins. its ok I guess. the games could be better though, and way to many ads
B004EPYZSK|1.0|Made the mistake of watching this \\"film\\" last night. Haven't seen anything this bad in years. Lifeless acting, unbelievable plot twists (even for Sci-Fi), convoluted story line, obscene violence and torture, and the kind of character development that makes bread mold watchable. In unleashing this steaming pile upon the world, the director, writers, and cast clearly have no respect for their viewers. I think I would rather be trapped in the spaceship staring at that weird light for two hours than watch this film again. I wish I could give it negative stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A must have app. More correct than Weather Channel. And faster to. Radar is great. Very accurate. Love the long range forecast.
B004UB9SKS|5.0|Well i like this app because i am deaf and im just learning sign language and this app really helped and yea
B003RS5JNA|5.0|It's the quickening and things building up to an epic and amazing climax on you way to the end of Season 4, it's just brilliant, I loved it! One of the best television episodes I can remember.
0345803485|5.0|Loved the book, it's a little x rated in the beginning, but does change and become more normal.  The second was my favorie, and loved the 3rd also.  highly recommend
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the Bible plans ... very insightful. I love this !! the plans are very helpful . For parents I think the parent plans is very good.
0345803485|4.0|This is a good book to read at home alone.  The sex was somewhat overrated (yawn)  at times but overall a good page turner.
B0068ZZ6CI|5.0|I have not had the pleasure of owning any Rammstein albums until today. I was stuck barrowing, hitting up youtube or getting coppies and I am so excited to have this set for myself. That being said, I can see why someone that has collected the records may find this redundant. Even so, this is an album that is just so good. The remixes are very well done and just having this is a testament to your fandom for this group. To be fair though, I just saw them in concert and I am just a little star-struck.
0345803493|5.0|This 2nd book of the Fifty Shades series seemed to have more of a story line. The sex is just a little overkill for me...good reading though!
B0059XTV4Y|4.0|I just watched W.E. and this film was well written, giving anyone who isn't famliar with this story good details. What intrigued me most about this film was after watching \\"The King's Speech\\" we were given a follow up on the romance between Wallis and King Edward. Wallis's character made you dislike her at times for interferring with a romance that was already in place and yet loved her for being herself which commanded King Edwards attention at all times, unlike his beautiful female companion whom he known for sometime. I like how Madonna showed the similaraties between the modern Wallis with the original Wallis S.It felt like Madonna wanted movie watcher to see how the lives of the two woman would interwine through feelings of understanding real love conquers, even if one must go through some tragic events to smell a bit of roses. I give this movie four and a half stars, because I would have liked to have seen more of the story line played out.
0374203032|1.0|This book is a superficial, cheap imitation of earlier books that were written by authors much more knowledgeable and insightful about the topic than Michael Sandel.  For example, Robert Kuttner's book, EVERYTHING FOR SALE:  THE VIRTUES AND LIMITS OF MARKETS, was a far more substantive and eloquent work, on the same topic, published 15 years ago.<br /><br />The general topic of Sandel's book, along with many of his specific subtopics (citizens vs. consumers, terrorism markets, brand placements, concierge medicine, commercial sponsorships within public schools, etc.) and even some of Sandel's specific examples, were already covered in my 2005 book, THE FEEL-GOOD SOCIETY:  HOW THE \\"CUSTOMER\\" METAPHOR IS UNDERMINING AMERICAN EDUCATION, RELIGION, MEDIA AND HEALTHCARE.<br /><br />Perhaps I just missed it, but I did not see any citations of these two books in Sandel's hundreds of references, nor did he appear to cite any of the other seminal works on this topic.  Especially for an academic, that is inexcusable.  Not to acknowledge the authors who were the true thought leaders on this topic is intellectually dishonest, especially when Sandel makes little or no substantive contribution to the discussion, himself, other than to add a few more examples.<br /><br />So don't be impressed by the affiliation with Harvard or Larry Summers, or by a puff-piece column written by NEW YORK TIMES columnist Thomas Friedman (a childhood friend of the author) that promoted this book.  It is feather-weight, and quite deceptive in its failure to acknowledge the true thought leaders on the topic of markets and morality.  I'd give this book a \\"zero\\" rating if that were one of my options.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story that weaved through ages and spoke with different voices. Really came together upon reflection a few weeks after finishing novel.
014312093X|5.0|This is a good example of a LeCarre spy story from the Cold War era. The recent movie is okay on its own but you won't get much of it if you haven't read the book before viewing the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|played this on my iPod and was happy to find it for Android when I changed phones. I like the touch to move cards rather than drag and drop. it's much faster. I play often.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was an enthralling book that definitely kept me guessing until the very end!  I would recomment this product to anyone who enjoys a mystery or story with a twist.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This is gonna be very short.<br />Since I cant add anymore that has not already been said.<br />But for me this is the album of the year so far and im sure it still will be in the end of the year.<br /><br />New fave songs for me are:<br />Underneath  : what a beautyfull heartfell song<br />Outlaws of love: another beautyfull song<br /><br />But all in all Adam managed to top his first album which I also loved a lot.<br /><br />Way to go Adam :)
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Lambert does it again! A beautifully engineered album with great vocals and excellent songs. The ballads are smooth and moving, and the upbeat stuff will keep your head and feet moving. And, of course, you've got Lambert's incredible voice behind it all.<br /><br />Like the first album, this one is best enjoyed under the headphones where you can really hear what's going on.<br /><br />The additional 3 songs on the deluxe version are worth it. Good stuff!<br /><br />A 5 star album, no doubt about it! Platinum number 2, for sure!
B004EPYZV2|5.0|I have watched one or two mission impossible movies in the past, I don't remember exactly what ones. This one blew all of them out of the water. Most of Tom Cruise's stunts were real.<br /><br />Please!!! Watch the behind the scenes special features. You will be amazed! Also, the scenery they shot in Dubai is just breath taking. Yes he was really climbing on the side of the hotel in Dubai! Watch the special features to see him in action and find out how they did it.<br /><br />I don't write movie reviews, but I highly recommend this movie for action lovers. It also had quirky and comical moments too which is always a plus.
B000NIVJEU|2.0|This movie was so disappointing and I was shocked that so much of the story was either changed or just left out. The raz-ak monsters were killed inside Helgrind; not the forest. There was so many facts changed I'm surprised permission was given to make this movie. The books are awesome. A LONG miniseries would be appropriate or at least 4 three hour long movies to include the MANY interesting and beautiful details of the books would have better captured the great story of Eragon. The Urgals in the movie looked like dirty, greasy body builders with crooked teeth. No horns, no monster-like appearance described in the book. Roran just walked off in the movie and he was a huge part of the actual story. Sorry, but do not waste your time with the movie.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I should have sampled this book before I bought the Kindle version.  It takes reading only a few pages to realize that the writing is simply awful.  The technique is matched, maybe surpassed, by the narrative.  I am 22 percent through the book and can't go on.  Save me!
B000VZJM8U|5.0|This was great, heartfelt music. Music that healed.<br />And it still so remains.<br />I don't know why there aren't multitudes of covers of \\"Just Now\\" and \\"Back Down the River;\\" maybe no one wants to compete with the original.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I first started to read this book, I was embarrased at how much I was blushing! I am a 21 year old college student, so it was HOT to put myself in this situation. I loved every part of this book, but I am so glad that I kept reading on to the second and third book. I loved it so much that as soon as I finished, I picked it up and started all over. I felt such compassion for Christian just as Anastasia did. This is definitely a must read to anyone who loves a good romance!!
B000I8G5B2|5.0|So true to the times we now live in and seem to move closer and closer too in the very near future.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I would really recommened this app if you like games that are a little challenging but fun, and very addicting.<br /><br />.............So I would give it a try if I were you.......besides........it's FREE!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;!&iexcl;<br />Plus you can get points for more games in the app!!&iexcl;!!&iexcl;!!&iexcl;
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have an expensive sound machine with multiple cartridges that is not nearly as good as this app.  I esp liked the cat purring.  the ocean waves were also much more believable / realistic than my stand alone machine. I wish the dryer didn't have something clunky in it, but overall I'm really pleased.  haven't tried the timer feature yet, but am pleased it is there.
B007FH9GT2|2.0|First off, F word David Fincher.  He sold his soul the day he put out the pandering \\"Social Network\\".  Secondly, say all that you will, the film here is a remake of an adaptation.  More money dumped into a garbage can does not change the garbage can into something other than a garbage can.  Now, I like Daniel Craig.  I do.  He's cool.  But as for the other actors, I don't really know of them.  I'm sure they're cool, too.  But I refuse to take exception everytime a bunch of people rave about something being good.  I'll not watch this, and have no interest in changing my perception towards the original movie(s).  I bet if advertised and angled right, chugging bleach would get consumers all lathered up to try.  There.  I actually feel better having said what was on my mind.<br /><br />By the way, take every last bit of this with a grain of salt.  Watch the movie or don't whatever.  I just had a burning need to express my opinion.  It happens.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|These books were absolutely amazing! They have a very suspenseful plot with many sudden shifts. They were all well written and highly addictive to read. Definately worth the money.
B007ZCQJOM|5.0|As good as their earlier Teen Dream (2010) album was, this album I think is better. The melodies are just more captivating, the mood more romantic and it is somehow even more dreamy than TD - if that is possible. I hate it when people who don't really listen to the album, or the melodies or the lyrics, just judge it based on the type of 'sound' and conclude it's the same as before. If you can appreciate music with all its nuances and in all its dimensions, then this is an excellent album that stands on its own.
B006PTL1QM|1.0|The subject at hand was one with great potential.<br />Unfortunately the great two masters were dealt with in an extremely superficial matter..<br />And on the other hand Keira Kneightly over acted every scene. leaving nothing to be internalized.<br />If you want to watch a movie about the human psychosis watch any of Lars Von trier's
0345803493|5.0|I have read a lot of books, and I don't think I have ever been as obsessed with a series as the \\"50 Shades\\" trilogy.  I wanted to see what all the hype was about and I am soooo glad I did not listen to the negative reviews!  I have read the first two in the series and I have the third one waiting!  As a psych major I love to anaylze things, and I wonder why are so many gravitating towards these books?  Does it mean that we secretly want a BDSM relationship? I don't think so.  Does it mean we secretly want a man that is so F'd up we think we can save him? I don't think so.  For me, the attraction to these books is the \\"intense\\" and \\"gut-wrenching\\" love and connection that Ana and Christian have for each other.  You can \\"feel\\" their emotions jump off the page!  I guarantee these books will stay with you long after you read them!

B004UID2LC|3.0|This app worked fine until I scanned my kindle fire with my anti virus app. It said that the app is malicious and it also slowed down my kindle. I would advise anyone with a kindle fire to add an anti virus app before downloading.

B000002B1M|5.0|Great lyrics and beats. A must have for any real hip hop lover. One of Nas best albums. For me the best track of this album is If I ruled the world, featuring Lauryn Hill (hip hop icon). I gave you power and shootouts, songs you can play over and over. A classic!
B005M4K94G|2.0|MSFL has some grudge against quad\multichannel. this disc could have included the quad mix, which is very fun, the opening saxophone travels around all four speakers.  Abraxas, Santana III and Caravanserai are are made for quad, 2 channel listening is a waste of time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had SO much fun reading this book and that's because it dared to go deep and get totally innapropriate. People who have issues with this book need to realize that it's not meant to be read as a work of art from a literary perspective. The writing isn't all that great-but that's not why I kept reading. I kept reading because it was fun and explicit! THis is definiitely a good book to read if you've just finished a heavy slow reading book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book because of all these amazing reviews...and I am delighted to report them all to be accurate!  Great writing, great story - thought-provoking and active - - and nicely long.  I kept turning pages at the end, bummed that it was over - and found the epilogue after the q&a (which q&a you need to read). I immediately bought part 6 and gearing up to read tonight.
B006PKV2QU|5.0|I bought this book for my children s and, i found it is very good and also the title is very interesting, since it exactly resembled with the type of stories that my children s generally enjoys. They both are very fond of bedtime stories, without listening stories from me during their bedtime it's very hard to make them sleep.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I hope you enjoy the origanal game cause this is great.  there are way to many other ways that are to confusing so its nice to have a classic  to turn to.
1612130283|5.0|I bought Fifty shades of grey in an airport when my flight was very delayed, in desperation to find something to entertain me (I had just finished latest book in the first flight), and boy was I surprised. I couldnt put it away. It is written in such a simple, smart and alluring language its impossible not to be involved in the plot.<br />I do acknowledge is a book targeted fore a female audience but it's definetly a breath of fresh air!
B004EIZCPM|4.0|I was hesitant to watch this movie at first, but I'm glad I did! It is so funny and I guarantee you will laugh your way through it :) Emma Stone plays the perfect \\"awkward teenager\\" and I'm particularly fond of Stanley Tucci playing her father. It's even got a little bit of a moral too - don't lie, else you face the consequences.<br /><br />Like I said - great movie. I don't want to give too much away in case you haven't seen it.<br /><br />Warnings: There are a few scenes with cursing in them, there is use of the phrase \\"big tits\\" if you happen to have small children. I would say this movie fits the rating of \\"PG-13\\" to a tee.
B00319ECC4|5.0|Geeeeeeez.... I had written these guys off for dead after Digimortal.  It happens..the band you love and listen to for hours and hours suddenly doesn't have it anymore.  I put in hundreds of hours on Demanufacture and Obsolete.  Well 12 years later here I am looking for a new metal CD to buy, and I see Mechanize has 4.5 stars.  I am willing to give them another chance, especially after seeing Dino and Burton are back.  Man... I am blown away, transported to 1998 all over again.  What a surprise.  Good for these guys man, I am really happy to hear them hitting on all cylinders again.

B004YM6JK0|5.0|Supernatural is a fantastic series, but most shows start to lose their edge and dip in quality after 3 or 4 seasons. Not Supernatural. It is still going strong after 7 seasons and almost 150 episodes. Season 7 maintained the amazingly high quality and entertainment value of the previous seasons.<br /><br />I highly doubt anyone is going to buy this who hasn't watched the rest, so this review is for fans of the show. And to them I'd say \\"buy this season. If you have loved the rest you will love this\\".<br /><br />Specifically to any fans out there who were disappointed in season 6 (which had a more mixed response than previous seasons) I'd say that s7 is a return to form.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
0345803485|5.0|I don't understand why there are so many bad reviews on this book. People need to understand that the reason there is repetitiveness is to enunciate the characters personalities. DUH. If i wrote down every time I rolled my eyes in real life, it would be similar to how often Ana rolls her eyes. It doesn't make the book bad or \\"poorly written\\" because there's repetition, it  shows their character. And as far as Christian being the \\"made up dream guy\\"... that's the point. He's supposed to be someone that you fall in love with and that you get hot and bothered over! To those of you saying he doesn't work.. he is constantly working. There were several references to him being on the phone or e-mailing on his phone. (How did you even miss this???? i.e.: He leaves GA because of a work emergency) Oh and let's think about the reason why it is so easy for Ana to have orgasms.. she was a virgin before she met him, therefore, she's not used to having sex so I understand why it's so easy for her to finish. And let's be honest ladies, it's not THAT hard when you are with a guy who knows what he's doing.<br /><br />I absolutely LOVED the book. Within reading the first six chapters (which I finished in a few hours) I was ordering the second and third book. I never buy books, and I bought these because I know I will be reading them over and over again. I have started a 50 shades epidemic because everyone in my office and all my friends are now reading the book and falling in love as well. I can't understand the poor reviews. I guess if you are not into the fantasy, perfected sex-god man or the sex in this book, then erotica novels aren't for you in the first place.
0345803485|5.0|I started reading this upon recommendation from a co-worker and absolutely couldn't put it down. I had all three books read in about two weeks, and I work two jobs & have a horse that I compete regularly.<br />I agree with some that the writing was child-like to a point, and some of the over-used terms were frustrating, but I was too engrossed in the plot to care that much.<br />Loved them all!
0596005903|4.0|The book talks about creating a linux source tree but fails to describe how to do that. It is very complicated topic but interesting, the examples didnt compile when I tried them but that maybe becuase my linux setup isn't set up right.

B000JQU1VS|5.0|I had never before read any of the Sherlock Holmes books but wanted to. With Kindle for Android and Amazon's free classics, I finally had the chance to read this book, and now I am hooked and want to read the others. This book is entertaining; once you get started on a story, you want to finish it. By the end of the book you will notice that you too start to see things in a more analytical way... or not.
B000FBGBPC|5.0|Got to me very fast and the CD and CD case were in perfect condition. The CD wasn't scratched at all and it plays perfectly. A must buy if you don't have it already!

0439023521|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, and cannot wait to see the movie and read the other two in the series!
B006RED4GA|1.0|Do NOT bother renting this film if you are a looking for a movie even remotely scary, entertaining, exciting, interesting, unique or captivating. Wow, I quit watching, then went back fininshed it because, well, I paid for it. My wife, who scares easily, went to bed. If you like really, really boring attempts at \\"art school drop out\\" horror movies, you may like it. I do not.<br /><br />It has no redeeming quality, and any review saying otherwise I think is friends with the film crew.
B00005JKNF|5.0|Julian Fellowes has written a superb thriller that keeps you guessing and has many twists and turns to the plot.  A first-rate cast makes this movie a classic that can be watched many times over. You can't beat the Brits for mystery.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book is a real page turner.  So friggen good!  I'm really excited to read the next book in the series.
0345529057|5.0|I have to tell you that I knew nothing of George R.R. Martin before the release of the now very famous HBO TV series: Game of Thrones. After watching the first season of the TV series I had to have these books. I am entirely conscious that books are better than whatever great efforts are made on the big or small screen and the TV-series was amazing so I had the feelings the books were going to be mind blowing.<br />I bough the books at the end of last year but for one thing or another I started reading them until a couple of months ago. Yesterday I finished with this book set and let me tell you: it is very hard to describe how good these books are so I better start from the  beginning, right?<br /><br />About the set as such... This is a great purchase. I bought the paperback box set and the price was great since each book ended up being around $5. Five dollars a book with around 1000 printed pages is a very sweet deal for a book worm such as I. The type big enough to be read comfortably without problems, the paper is your regular paperback quality, the covers are simple though I must add I like the color combination since it makes it easier for me to differentiate every book at a distance. The box is of course (I mean think about the price) not sturdy at all but it helps to keep the books organized and it has these great pictures from the characters of Eddard Stark and Daenerys Targaryen that anyone who has watched the TV series would love. The package was delivered promptly and very well packed so I received it in perfect condition.<br /><br />Now about the books. I which I was as eloquent as the author but unfortunately I am not so I am going to keep it simple. All the books are written with a fractured narrative. We get to know different things from the point of view of each different major character since all of them have a narrative voice (this changes a bit with book four because the characters are not exactly major ones but they are needed for the development of the story). This is actually pretty cool because of two things:<br />First, it makes the chapters short so there is really no way to get bored with what a character in particular is facing which is very good because each character has its own speed.<br />Second, it helps impatient people. Sometimes I get distracted when books are long and so what I tend to do is to read about three books at the same time. When I get bored of one I switch to one of the others. Nevertheless that did not happen with these books. I think because when I was getting anxious about a character and was left hanging (this happens a lot with i.e. Arya, I like her character a lot and she goes through a variety of adventures very quickly) to follow a slower pace character (such as i.e. Catelyn, as a mother and a highborn lady her life usually is more about waiting and supporting) I could simply jump some chapters to look for the same character and keep reading. I am sure the books were not meant to be read like that but hey! It did not interfere one bit with the development of the plot to my eye and it kept me interested so much that I read this books all by themselves. Only some new manga releases got in between.<br /><br />For the ones who like me came to these books due to the TV series, you need to start reading ASAP. The first book was in fact adapted very closely by the scrip writers of \\"Game of Thrones\\", there are some details left out in the series as expected but this second season now airing starts to change quite a lot of things and in my opinion you are better off going farther ahead with books than the TV series.<br /><br />I think it would be a bit ridiculous to talk about the plot here. I bet there must be tons of forums for that -to be truthful there are other many reviews focusing on that- so I am not gonna do it. I am going to say only that I think if you liked the first two books, you will like the other two. Book three is quite difficult, not because the narrative pacechanges but because the things that happen broke my heart. Halfway through that book I was really upset by what was going on but everything was achieved so masterfully that I have no word of complain towards the writing. I read a review before purchasing book 5 which I think hits the the bull's eye perfectly: Even if we do not like how things develop for each character and what happens to them, that does not mean the writer is not a great writer.<br />I think the less predictable a book is the more you will enjoy it so give these books a change because you will not regret it.<br /><br />I ABSOLUTELY RECOMMEND THIS PURCHASE.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|If you have Kindle Fire, you have to get one of these. This case protects Kindle, let you use it as a stand and looks awesome while doing all that. Just bought one along with the Kindle Fire for my wife and she just loves it.
B001NYU23C|5.0|I keep going back and listening to this album over and over again...it just doesn't get old. I just love Chris' voice and the guitar work on this album. You just don't hear quality rock music like this anymore, and it's a real shame.
0345803485|2.0|After hearing all the hype about 50 Shades of Grey I decided to see what all the talk shows were gossiping about.  I felt that the story line was good enough to hold me but all the sexual descriptions were carried on and on, page after page.  And it wasn't just a few encounters but it seemed like one third of the book!  Let our imaginations figure things out without detailed descriptions.  It got to the point of boredom.  I doubt that I will read volume two.
1594744769|5.0|The photography lends a degree of authenticity to the otherwise fantastic story.  The characters are engaging and the monsters are not at all disappointing.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.
1401207529|4.0|It's a relief to confirm I wasn't just imagining that Frank Miller was once upon a time one of the best writers working in comix. I was beginning to doubt my memory in light of his execrable recent work. \\"Batman: Year One\\" shows signs of the self-parody Miller was to become: His portrayals of tortured supercop Jim Gordon and dominatrix whore Selina Kyle are over the top, but otherwise this miniseries fits in his revolutionary oeuvre. It's a back-to-basics Batman darkened with a noirish grit that may be commonplace now but wasn't back when Miller revamped the character. David Mazzucchelli's sketchy artwork perfectly complements the moody action. Perhaps Miller should go back and reread this to reacquaint himself with the vibrant artist he once was.

B00112GVFO|1.0|If I were not a Dirk Pitt/Clive Cussler fan, I might have thought otherwise, but this movie does not portray the characters as they are in the Dirk Pitt novels. A great deal of the book has been eliminated entirely, and what has been left has been altered to the point that it might as well have been left out. The only things the book and movie have in common are the name and the names of the characters. It's an adequate adventure-type movie if that's all you are looking for, but for fans of Dirk Pitt, prepare to be disappointed.
B005LAIHPE|4.0|I went to this movie not expecting too much, just a lot of big explosions and alien action and for the most part that's what I got.  I have to say that I liked this movie a lot.  After my ears stopped bleeding and they confronted the aliens for the first time, the initial 45 minutes passed to obscurity.  And when they brought out the Mighty Mo, I could feel a chill run up my spine, particularly when they let loose with a full barrage; I felt it was a nice tribute to the old girl.<br /><br />Some people seem to be bothered by the non-professional cast in the movie, but I thought that was one of the movie's best parts. In particular, the old, gruff sailors who stepped up to do their duty one more time was a refreshing twist that one rarely sees these days.  They, and the Missouri, made the movie for me.<br /><br />I did have a couple of problems with the movie, things that couldn't be dismissed with suspension of disbelief.  The first was the way in which the aliens reacted to non-combatants.  It happened in enough places and to such a pronounced degree that I thought the writers were going to make a bigger thing about it.  \\"Oh, you broke through our perimeter and are running off with some piece of equipment?  Well, carry on, have a nice day.\\"  \\"Gee, you're here in your ship, defending the engine room.  Guess I'll just turn my back on you and start breaking your stuff.\\"  The other plot thread was when the alien transferred a mental projection into the main character's head of a massive invasion.  Not only was it not explained, he didn't even mention it to anyone else.
0439023521|5.0|Read this book in a matter of hours.  Have no idea why I waited so long to read it. Would def recommend this book to anyone.
0345803485|2.0|I really wanted to like this considering all the hype.  I was surprised at how boring it is.  The male character has absolutely no personality which makes all the sexual encounters seem very robotic and without emotion.  I guess I'm the type who needs a little cerebral stimulation to make it seem real.  I didn't even get half way through it before sending it off to the Goodwill.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was a good book, It has a plot, that continues through all 3 books.  If you are not at all into romance with a submissive or dominant Characters, then this would not be for you. However for those of you that keep an open mind and enjoy reading a good book, this is a great one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book, couldn't put it down. As soon as I finished, I started with the second and then the third. Loved them all, they kept getting better and better. It is VERY different from anything I have ever read and I was hesitant after some of the reviews but I'm so glad I took a chance, great book!

B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 Shades of Grey has to be one of the best books I have ever read. It was more than what I expected.  Now I know why my older niece whose 23 years old said I would never read it.  That is how sexual and kinky it is.  Therefore I have to say I am in ways like Ana Steele who has never been in a relationship nor has she ever had any sexual relations.  She is also very bright and quite a hardworker in school.  Moving on, in the novel as the sypnosis states, young Anastatia Steel, Ana as she prefers, goes to interview the sexy and multi rich CEO of a large coporation, Chritian Grey.  When she sets her sights on him, Ana is in shock and relizes she wants to be around him al the time.  He is like a drug.  Eventually things go the way she wants and they start a sexual relationship.  Niether one can get enough of the other. Ana also finds out that Christian is into all this kinky Dom/Sub crap and she decides to try it for him.  But his secret runs even deeper than that.  Their is a reason he is so cold at times and that she can't be allowed to ever be too close him. And that is hard because she realizes she can't just be in a dom/sub relationship, she wants a real one.  All I can say is this book had me both extremely happy and at certan times sad.  It is a great read and I think that many of you readers will enjoy it.  I am already on the second and I loveit.  Have fun readers and definitely read this book!

What a beautiful soul!! He is definitely the musical find of a decade, maybe a lifetime. My heart aches and is mysteriously filled with bliss and happiness at the same time. His soft sweet voice, the lyrics, and the group's musical contributions are hypnotic and beautiful. I'm utterly speechless. Thank you Antony, and may God bless you. I hope you come to Colorado someday.

1439170916|5.0|This book was recommended to me and before I started it I was expecting a text book version of yet another research paper on cancer with a lot of footnotes and technical terms that would make my eyes glaze over.  Surprisingly this author is very well versed in prose and uses a lot of literary phrases to describe his field of oncology.  He starts out by talking about a patient with leukemia, her symptoms, and what she has to endure in a long treatment regimen.  Her story is repeated throughout the book as an example of someone who survived not only the chemotherapy which is grueling and toxic to say the least but also the disease itself.  The book really is a \\"biography\\" of cancer, and I think the title was well chosen because that is exactly what it is.  It's been around for centuries but no one really understood the science of how cancer cells exist and how they are formed.  The history of how cancer was treated in the early days, especially referring to breast cancer and the pioneer of the surgical procedure, Dr. Halsted was touched on.  But what really struck me was how Dr. Mukherjee was able to list and credit all the people involved in the research which really pin pointed the way cancer cells developed and ultimately how the treatments are now more focused on particular cell components and not just trying to eradicate the cancer along with healthy tissue.  I know people always wonder why there isn't a \\"magic bullet\\" to \\"cure\\" cancer.  If one reads this book the answer will be evident.  It's not a one sized fits all treatment because every cancer is different.

B000FC10MU|2.0|Being a staunch scifi aficionada, I know the place this book has in the canon, and wanted to like it.  Instead, I found it overly long, full of obscure references, and not really that original.  Let me take those one by one.<br /><br />Overly long: I did not feel that all the characters were necessary to my understanding of the book, nor was all the travelling around the country, the dreams, etc.  There was a lot that did not add to my understanding of either the plot or the protagonist, so cutting these bits out would not have hurt.  On the other hand, I freely admit that I did not completely understand the ending of the book (more on that later) so would be willing to concede this point if I could find someone with whom I could discuss it.<br /><br />Obscure references.  I have rather more knowledge of world religions than the average person, but unless you are an expert on African, Norse, American Indian, and other pantheons even less well-known than these, you will quickly get lost in the references and cross-references.  I do not mind learning new information in a book, but I do think that any work that is going to have major characters and plot points dependent on an intimate understanding of such entities as Slavic deities needs to do a better job of explaining them within the context of the story.  And I felt like I had one up on many readers, since I live in Wisconsin and have actually visited House on the Rock, a major location in the book (which Gaiman equates with the afterlife, quite appropriately in my mind).<br /><br />Not very original:  The concept of gods that only survive as long as there are people left to worship them is so pervasive in comic books and scifi novels that I have no idea where it first appeared, but I am pretty sure Gaiman didn't invent this idea.  The book got a bit more interesting toward the end, when the protagonist was asked to make a sacrifice (which I won't describe in detail here to keep from spoiling things for anyone who hasn't yet read the book) but then I really didn't understand the ending.<br /><br />I have a feeling I might have appreciated this book more if I had read it with my book club, but on my own, I was not able to discern why this is considered such an important book in the scifi canon.hasn't yet read the book) but then I really didn't understand the ending.<br /><br />I have a feeling I might have appreciated this book more if I had read it with my book club, but on my own, I was not able to discern why this is considered such an important book in the scifi canon.
B006UG90RM|5.0|My first listen to A Different Kind Of Truth brought back references to the entire VH past. Eddie and Alex definitely still have their chops and Wolfgang works great with Dad and Uncle Alex but what makes this album great is that Diamond Dave is back! The wit, the humor, the sharp insight and the sheer craziness that is David Lee Roth is in full force along with the swagger and a voice that sounds terrific especially after so many years.<br /><br />I found that the more I listen to this record the better it gets. The band is tight, the guitar work is as good as ever and the band still has everything it ever had but there is some maturity, a heavier intensity and a little reflection now that I really appreciate. I listen to the Van Hagar records now and Sammy, who definitely has his own vibe and time-tested rock niche, was no Diamond Dave. The humor fell flat, the wild man vocal attempts and showmanship, no offense Sammy fans but forget it, Dave has no rival. I do think that Sammy grew more into the band as it went along and made some great music but just not what I would call, VAN HALEN. Van Hagar was really a better representation and truly not a slam, though obviously the name was never adopted.<br /><br />The truth is, however, that Dave never could carry the show or the load outside of the VH brothers. At times, he had some good music of his own but the sum is definitely greater than the individual parts. Frankly, this group is also better together as a unit than their other attempts combined at least as far as Van Halen is concerned, in my opinion. In a sense I put this album in its own class, different from the past yet rocking, fun and unique in some positive ways despite opinions to the contrary.<br /><br />My two favorite tracks are Stay Frosty and Big River. Amusing, insightful and powerful. China Town, Bullethead and Outta Space are Van Halen at their fast and high-powered best. \\"As Is\\" is vintage VH in the Hot For Teacher mode. The more you listen, the better it gets. The only thing I would have changed would have been to release \\"You and Your Blues\\" as the first single, if that is still what they call it these days. Also, on the included DVD, they should have done Stay Frosty. It was made to do \\"unplugged\\". If you're a Van Halen fan, you'll love it, even if it takes a few listens. If you're not, that's what Lady Gaga is for. Like Dave says, Advice is free for a reason, so take this review at face value and enjoy a good record.
B008469DGY|5.0|This is a really simple, fun little golf game.  The core mechanics of flicking to hit your shot and then spinning the ball in flight to control it are easy to get into, but still allow for enough difficulty to make working your way through the courses entertaining.<br /><br />I really enjoy this game on my phone, so it's great to see it make it the Amazon store.  I didn't mind paying for it again to get it working on my Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I actually like another of Full Fat's games a whole bunch as well--this gives me hope that their flick football title will be on the way soon as well, and that game is a really awesome casual football game.<br /><br />In short, I enjoyed this game enough to happily pay for it twice, and can't wait to pay a second time for the football game as well soon, hopefully.

B007R41E8O|1.0|I am addicted to these mystery games and this is the first one I didn't even want to finish. I uninstalled it before I got to the end which Wasn't even in sight as far as I could tell. There is no sense of your progress, I don't understand the storyline (ghosts, fog, old newspapers, appraising the value of some of the items you come across - I thought I was supposed to be looking for my wife) . The worst thing about this game is that I don't have a sense of where I should be going and why. I am completely relying on the hint feature to tell me where to go next. I have never had to do that on similar games. Being lead around a haunted island searching for things on a list is not my idea of fun.

B002QP145C|5.0|gday, i'm getting right into these foreign (non hollywood/western country).  this movie goes for a long time and i don't know how much of the country side/bush got destroyed as there are a lot of bombs droppin and trees etc.(greenies look away) getting blown down by explosions.  covers the hardships of the Finns as they fought in bloody freezing conditions against a force far greater in numbers/equipment.  ya get attached to a few characters during this movie, who one thinks are the main roles, but no one seems to live for long at the front. getting killed one at a time, which is probably more realistic than our western style hero movies. any way it's got a high body count and ****loads of ammo being expended. so if ya like that sort of war movie then you'll like this.  cheers.
B00006DEF9|5.0|Have been using your DVD with my pre-k students practicing the song \\"Singing in the Rain\\" which they will sing and dance to on their stepping up day.

B004J4WKUQ|4.0|4.5 stars.<br /><br />full of silly pop-culture references and one-off name drops, Cline's debut novel kicks off as a lighthearted, silly, adventure quest into a realm where you better be able to recite the dialogue of every episode of 'family ties', in order. in the OASIS version of pop-culture notstalgia, though, it's not all smurfs & voltron; a good bit of it is neuromancer & blade runner...<br /><br />teenager Wade has lived all of his life with the internet subsumed by the OASIS, a global full-sensory reality substitute, where your online avatar is for many people the sole way of interacting with the world. the creator of this electronic universe has just died, and his final system-wide email promises that anyone who can figure out the secret clues embedded within the game world will find a hidden easter egg and so inherit his massive fortune. Wade is only one of a whole new generation that will devote their entire lives to being the winner of this most epic video game battle of all time, and just like everyone else, he's convinced the route to success involves an encyclopedic knowledge of the old man's fave 80s media - everything from ac/dc to the dark crystal to rush to ultraman. a large chunk of the global economy is at stake, and there's plenty of corporate predators out to make sure that they come out on top instead of some rotten kid...<br /><br />and yes, that does in fact read like a snippet of a scooby doo episode, or some movie where the misfit underdog kids have to battle the cool suit-types to prevent the closure of their beloved summer camp. most of the first half is very much an homage to exactly what it's riffing on - 80s underdog flicks - until the grit and decay of this future post-collapse world really starts to trickle in to the story. there's a very good reason that so many would choose to not interact with the real world of concrete and synthetic food when online is so much more compelling. in many ways, it's an answer to Neuromancer 25 years later, with an equally sassy protagonist sprinting off on an equally impossible data-run. recommended to anyone born somewhen in the 70s, any aficionado of video or role-playing games, and anyone who could win a game of 80s trivial pursuit and love it.rs later, with an equally sassy protagonist sprinting off on an equally impossible data-run. recommended to anyone born somewhen in the 70s, any aficionado of video or role-playing games, and anyone who could win a game of 80s trivial pursuit and love it.

0060936223|4.0|Reading Patti Smith's memoir is like sticking your head under water in an aquarium of New York in the late sixties and early seventies. You see plenty of starving artists, art galleries and museums, but you also have a rare glance at Andy Warhol, a glimpse at Grace Slick or Jimi Hendrix. The book is compelling in its complete immersion into the artist/music/writer scene in New York. Smith gives you a clear view of how that life worked, the interactions, the social webs, the commerce in drugs, barter, clothes. While there was fame and fortune to be had, you also get to feel the desperation of the times, its edginess, and the constant hustle and looming shadows. The pages almost smell of stale cigarette smoke, New York sidewalks, and coffee. I always imagine \\"Jungleland\\" playing in the background.<br /><br />But more than a memoir of her life and New York in this era, its a love story between to people who are hopelessly tangled in one another. The power in this book comes from it's rawness, the stark light that Smith shines down on her relationship with Robert Mapplethorpe. There is very little hidden, prettied up or glossed over - it is out for everyone to see. They collide, almost as children, and their relationship grows, splits, and grows together over the years. It's simple at it's roots, which makes it hopelessly complex as they grow older, and yet you can always feel the love between the two of them wind through the entire book.<br /><br />While I'd agree with some other readers that the writing is not always consistent and sharp, it's honest. And for me, that's more important than anything else. It's a daring, heart-breaking, and beautiful story that I would recommend to anyone.
0142501123|5.0|I am always on the lookout for great kids books....and this one is a winner. This book is an excellent new addition to our storytime library.
1904994679|3.0|My children enjoyed reading the book (young teenager and under 11).  It has nice picture and is more of a coffee table book than a dictionary style book that I remembered.  I'm not sure if there is another book out there that is more Webster Thesaurus style with indexed records and paperback size, but would like one if it exists.<br /><br />It also seemed like there were a lot of 'World Records\\" missing in this version.  again, its a rather large book with lots of pictures, but lacking the informational substance or number of records that I'm sure are out there and not listed in this book.<br /><br />Pretty book, but disappointing - style over substance.<br /><br />.
0525478817|5.0|This book left me bawling my eyes out and speechless. I couldn't think clearly until I had sat back and cried for a good thirty minutes. And let me just say, i'm not usually a crier when it comes to books. This story really opened my eyes to the terrible diseases people really have and made me think about life in a different way. I'm having a really hard time writing this review because there are just no words to describe how brilliant it was.<br /><br />I felt so connected to the characters and by the end of the book John Green had me convinced Hazel and Augustus were real people and i was a part of their beautiful, heart-wrenching tragedy. I loved the ending and how Green left Hazel's story hanging for us to finish for ourselves. I think we were all meant to follow the lead of Augustus Waters and write our own epilogues.<br /><br />I know I have.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Very well written.  One of my favorite about Nazi Germany.  Would DEFINITELY recommend to anybody.  For those not interested in Nazi Germany, they still build a relationship with the character.  Those that are interested get a genuine feel for the times.  Loved this book!
B0074V3712|5.0|Wilson is, undoubtedly, one of the most brilliant thinkers of his day. Based, to a large degree on his lifelong study of ants and other 'social insects, he has come to understand the whole process of the evolution of life on earth. As a geologist, I have had a deep interest in these processes. Wilson puts in focus, the whole picture. This book will retain a central place in my library. For those with an interest in religion, his chapter on that subject is a 'must read'. For non-scientists, it is understandable and should be a good way to gain insight into who we are,and how we came to be.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|***This review may contain spoilers.***<br /><br />Personally, I prefer superhero soloists to superhero teams, perhaps because it is easier to delve into and devote more time to a single superhero's characteristics, psychological motivations, and objectives.  Also, I think, by their very nature, superheroes tend to be defiant, isolated loners - they are different from, and surpass the abilities of, common people.  Therefore, I was particularly pleased by director Joss Whedon's triple accomplishment in \\"The Avengers\\".  He faced the challenge of plausibly uniting, and coalescing several different actors with different acting qualities - especially when only one of them, Robert Downey, Jr. as Iron Man, has any national recognizability (no knock against the rest of the ensemble group, of course). Whedon faced the challenge of combining and meshing several wildly disparate superheroes resolutely used to being \\"lone wolves\\" and functioning solo.  Finally, Whedon faced the challenge of giving each hero equal substantial time to strut their stuff in the spotlight, even the deceptively ordinary, non-superpowered Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner).  I think Whedon admirably succeeds on all three counts.<br /><br />I also admire Whedon's deliberate, deft restraint in plotting \\"The Avengers\\".  Much as it might chafe adrenaline addicts impatiently waiting for the cataclysmic New York smackdown, the movie takes its time to establish the god of mischief and evil Loki's (Tom Hiddleston') nefarious partnership with the Predator-like aliens the Chitari and their unholy contract (Chitauri, in exchange for the Tesseract's (or Cosmic Cube's) improbably infinite power, send an endless horde of warriors through a space portal to help Loki conquer Earth).  There's a lot of necessary exposition in this first half of the movie. \\"The Avengers\\" not only has to gradually reveal Loki's ultimate motives and introduce (and reintroduce) each superhero's personality and conflicts. The movie must also surmount various obstacles (including slam-bang infighting and S.H.I.E.L.D.'s latent exploitation of the Tesseract to develop extraterrestial pre-emptive strike weaponry) to the Avengers becoming a cohesive fighting unit. With the commanding, no-nonsense guidance of unflappable S.H.I.E.L.D. commander Nick Fury (Samuel Jackson), the Avengers grudgingly but steadily get their act together.  They realize that saving the Earth takes priority over petty squabbles, disagreements, and even betrayals (including the one Black Widow uses to bring and unleash Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) into the fold).  Yes, that's a lot of exposition to keep straight, but Whedon handles this mammoth task well.<br /><br />Eventually, we get to the global battle, and what a colossal battle royale it is!  Again, Whedon displays his juggling skills as all the Avengers make their unique contributions towards fighting the Chitauri threat.  The director modulates the rousing fight scenes well enough so you don't eventually feel overwhelmed and worn out.  The only three critical observations I have about the conflict are these: 1) the Chitauri, gliding in on their aerial cycles, seemed to serve the same purpose as the battle droids in the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels: gun fodder.  In other words, they seemed to go down much too easily.  Their only advantage was sheer weight of numbers, 2) it's a major miracle no citizens get killed, and 3) who's going to pay for the clean-up afterwards?  Wait, there may be a fourth, shouldn't it occurred to the Avengers earlier that closing the portal was the solution? Ahh, whatever!  It's a stupendous spectacle!<br /><br />Beside's the spectacle, there's much to savor in \\"The Avengers\\".  Whedon, especially through the smartaleck banter of the self-absorbed Iron Man/Tony Stark, provides several hilarious one-liners and dialogue that keep this enterprise from sinking into ponderous self-importance.  However, ironically, the wrathful Hulk provides the movie's three funniest scenes, especially when he confronts the vainglorious Loki at Stark's phallic tower and dismisses him as a \\"Puny god!\\"  Downey and Ruffalo engage in inspired techno-speak when attempting to locate the Tesseract.  Even the \\"non-superheroes\\", especially Fury's self-sacrificing man Friday Phil Coulson, demonstrate their heroism.  Of course, the CGI special effects, including the way the Hulk resembles a pumped-up Mark Ruffalo and the undulating Chitauri spaceships resembling ancient whale skeletons, are mind-boggling but convincing.<br /><br />I could ramble on and not begin to cover all the facets of this successful production.  If you like Marvel, the Avengers, balanced ensemble work, and/or full-throated action thrillers, I think you'll love this movie.  If you prefer cerebral, contemplative movies, I think you may find something to like about \\"The Avengers\\".  The Dark Knight and any future adaptation of The Justice League of America should tremble at the high standard they have to reach. So be it!<br /><br />P.S.:  If you have the patience to wade through the end credits, you will see a post-scene midway which sets up the sequel, where the Avengers will encounter the embodiment of death itself.  At the very end, you will see our beloved superheroes enjoying shawarma in a deli.

B006C45CFG|4.0|OK, I knew going in that the story line would be off a bit.  But even with that, it was still a pretty good movies.  Suitable for all ages, almost.  I do have to admit that some of the graphics were well done.  Think I'd like to have the bracelet.  Enjoy!
B004AFFZNI|5.0|This housing is great.  It allows the memory card to be swapped while the camera is in the housing and allows the battery to be charged while recording.  It works as advertised.<br /><br />It does improve sound quality quite a bit.<br /><br />The GoPro camera system is great for the special purposes it is designed for, mainly, long hands-free recording in environments not so friendly to electronics.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Pretty good film for all ages.  The story line is a bit different, but that was the purpose of the film.  Is it believable?  On a far out reach, it could be.  More important it deals with estranged parents and kids.  Watch it, enjoy it, and wonder at the drive of the human spirit.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Had watched the video, read the eBook and enjoyed it as it explained more of the story line. Great story.
B005KAH7QU|4.0|Grab the popcorn, be patient with the first few minutes.  Action, story line, and an attention grabber.  Once it starts moving, you will not want a bathroom break, you will not want to get a snack.  It will hold you in your seat to the very end.

But, sometimes I'm just cranky.  Good film for most family members, no gratuitous sex or profanity.  Some of the action shots were really well done.  There may be a time or two you will forget to eat the popcorn.  Enjoy!
1400052181|5.0|Absolutely Amazing Book.  Non-fiction with everything you could want from fiction.  Some science knowledge of cells would be helpful to understand the details, but not needed to enjoy.  Anyone who has had a vaccine will be amazed by the story of what one woman unknowingly did for science and medical research.  At times it was hard to believe every bit of it was true, no names were changed and in a section at the end titled Notes states where all the facts came from.  It also has a Reading Group Guide; which would be a great idea, because I could not stop talking about this book as I read details that simply amazed me, upset me, or surprised me.
B006W0QOF2|2.0|You will enjoy the popcorn more than the movie, even if it is microwave popcorn.  The movie attempts to glorify lousy choices and life behaviors.  Not something I would want to share with children who are attempting to learn some moral lessons. Save your money, and just buy more popcorn.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|I thought this film was great.  It didn't end the way I thought it would but it was still a good flick. I really enjoyed it.  I am not one for all the violence that you see in films.  This rated right up there with the Notebook.
B006O5XYWG|2.0|Folks, you'll have ample opportunity to get popcorn, drinks, bathroom breaks, read the newspaper, and maybe even take a nap or two.  Not as well done as the original, or for that matter, even the sequel.  The graphics were pretty good, but even the acting/text/lines were stilted.  Not something I'd see again.

B0072GPQNG|5.0|This was an excellent film.  I would recommend it.  It showed what a life horses had to put up with in time of war, which no animal or human should have to experience.  Life during time of war is something that was more than terrible for all who had to experience it.  But this film showed how the will to live was stronger than ever.  Good flick in my eyes.
B006NXIO0Q|4.0|Pretty good for kids 12 and up, the adults will like it as well.  The good part was there was a plot and a reason for the story line, which it seemed to follow pretty well.  Got real interesting in a few spots.  Enjoy!

B005LJITS0|4.0|This is popcorn movie.  Silly and certainly not the best sic-fi I have seen lately.  Four stars because it can be viewed by the family, it does have a story line, and it does kind of follow the original comic book.  Don't expect great graphics, but do expect a fun movie.

Nothing major, but it would've been nice not to bother shaving off some metal!  Hope it doesn't rust fast.

0307950689|3.0|The Lost Symbol is the third installment in what I had not realized at the time, was a series. Did anyone ever mention that Harvard professor of religious iconology and symbology was going to come back at us over and over? I guess I should have figured it out when he showed up in The Da Vinci Code but I was really surprised to see him back after that. I mean, how much trouble can an academic get into? Wait, don't answer that!<br />So where we had these previous little incidents at the Vatican and then in Paris...Langdon is now running around the streets and tunnels of Washington DC, explaining along the way in great detail about the history of the city, and probably more information about the Masons than you thought you wanted to know. Do I sound cynical? Well yeah....<br />Look is it a good book? Of course, it's a thriller. And just like [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]] (which I thought was the best) and [[ASIN:B005DIB5AI Angels & Demons Special Illustrated Edition: A Novel (Robert Langdon)]], you have Professor Langdon working diligently to solve the riddles and uncover the truth behind the myths of our nation's capital. Meanwhile, he's matching wits against the obligatory mad, evil genius - a heavily tattooed guy who calls himself Mal'akh, the obligatory vulnerable female, Kathryn Solomon, the sister of high ranking Mason Peter Solomon - who is a longtime friend and mentor of Langdon.<br />Mal'akh has an agenda to take over the world, bwahahahaha - and he uses Robert via Peter to get what he needs - which is to find both the Mason's Pyramid, which is believed to be hidden somewhere in DC and the Mason's \\"word\\" which will complete the task that the kidnapper has given himself.  And with a host of other equally strange and mysterious side characters, you along with Robert Langdon, have a 528-page puzzle to solve. By using wit, knowledge and a healthy dose of luck, Langdon manages again, to save the world.<br />Now I enjoyed the reading and it goes pretty quick- you'll find yourself saying, wow! I'm already at Chapter 40 or Holy cow! I'm at Chapter 100 and it's only 9:30 at night? And while I didn't have any problem focusing on the story, I did do some skipping, ummm..maybe a lot - and here's where my dings start. Maybe more dings than usual.<br />This is book three, and you quickly pick up the rhythm of the previous two which makes me start to wonder, is Brown becoming a template writer? Is he the love child of James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell? After awhile, the exposition - or info-dump in the book just takes over and by Chapter 20 you just want one of the characters to turn to Langdon and say, \\"do you mind? We're trying to solve a crime here!\\" In fact, if you look up exposition on Wikipedia - Dan Brown is at the top of the list for information dumping - um...that's not a good thing, that's what we call a \\"dubious honor\\". I used to think Michael Crichton was king of exposition hill, not anymore. Luckily, these parts are easy to skip over. But if you REALLY want to get into the minutiae of Masonic history - by all means, slog through it.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Not a Clooney fan, but I liked the film and the role he played.  A good film for the whole family.  No gratuitous sex or explicit language, but it did have a good story line.  Pretty good shots of our 50th state's beauty, also a short history of the monarchy.  Overall a pretty good movie.  Enjoy!

It is a little deceiving when Amazon offers you a \\"discount\\" with the purchase of \\"Razor\\" because you think that it is not included. Oh well!
B0063IH60K|5.0|My first downloaded game.  Great for killing time in an airport.  Love the way it deals the cards.  It's fun and enjoyable.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|amazing a book of erotic is on everyones lips, TV shows, and #1 on best seller list, it will improve sex lives everywhere, so what is wrong with that!! NOTHING
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|As far as the glitches resetting the times. So far I have been lucky. If it happens just wait for the various disasters to occur and then repair the damage and it will reset. My problem is I can not invite any friends from my Kindle Fire. I tried thrum Facebook and Game Loft. Any advice???
B007V5CF5K|2.0|I wish when people review hidden objects games they would tell me if the game has me looking for a object or if l an looking for a part of an object.  I do not like game. that have you looking for parts of items so l am not loving this game. Also every time I touch it shows me the phone. 12 x in a row (Not much help)
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I have to hand it to the author. She nailed me hook, line and sinker with the first book.  I devoured in less than 24 hours and was hungry for more. Fifty Shades Darker, book #2, was good but not as as good as the first.<br /><br />And then there was Fifty Shades - Freed.<br /><br />Long story short: Book #3 is Stephenie Meyer's Twilight: Breaking Dawn, except for the SMBD and no vampires. Throughout the series there are several areas where you can spot references to Pretty Woman (the concept of wanting \\"more\\").  9-1/2 Weeks - well... the coincidences are pretty easy to spot if you've ever seen the movie. And, of course, Cinderella had to be an influence in the writing.  It's as if the author didn't have an original thought.<br /><br />The ending was ridiculously campy, contrived and went on forever.  James could have easily lopped off about 75-100 pages and it wouldn't have made any difference.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: Read Book 1 to the end, read Book 2 to the first ten chapters and stop.  Do not proceed to Book 3 unless you enjoy wasting your time and money.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game for time wasting especially when waiting for a flight or doctor! Graphics are lower quality but it is a free game!
0345803485|2.0|I bought 'Fifty Shades of Grey' because it's become a cultural phenomenon and I wanted to see what all the fuss is about.  First, I see why the fuss - there is a lot of graphic sex. Women (and men) looking to read soft porn will not be disappointed. On the other hand, if you're looking for sophisticated erotica with complex characters and plausible situations, this is most definitely not the book for you. In fact, you may well be annoyed that you can't get back the time you spend reading it. I like to finish what I start, so I plodded through, thinking that it might get better, but no, the characters remained paper-thin, the dialogue repetitive and trite and the sex scenes tedious. Yes, tedious. And the dialogue during the sex scenes? I rolled my eyes even more than the character Ana does (and she does, a lot). Further, it took all of ten pages for me to figure out that the writer was British, not American, and that she quite possibly has never been to the United States. I wondered at her or her editor's failure to edit for obvious telltale lapses in the lingo where it became clear that these are not Americans talking. (What 28-year old American man uses the word 'shall'?)In terms of the mood of the book and it's texture, there are unexpected and seemingly random spurts of detail (like the description of the interior of the helicopter Christian Grey pilots) coupled with a lack of information where more would make sense (the main protagonist's physical appearance is vague - flyaway hair, pale skin and blue eyes is all we get) Christian Grey is described as \\"hot\\" more times than I care to count and every appearance he makes is accompanied by the heroine remarking on that fact. Every scene that does not involve sex reads like filler - something the author inserted just so she could get to the next sex scene. There is no effort to show the reader why the two main characters are drawn to each other, we are just repeatedly told that they are and that invariably leads to more sex. Apart from the fact that this book involves bondage, it reads like a very bad romance novel.ore sex. Apart from the fact that this book involves bondage, it reads like a very bad romance novel.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|All three books became very repetitive re the sexual activity and ultimately boring<br />in that respect. The only reason I bought the three books was to see whether the<br />protagonist was able to complete her task of 'taming' Mr. Fifty Shades to somewhere<br />near 'normalcy' by the end.
0553381407|4.0|I thought this was a very helpful book in understanding your parents behavior and your response to it as an adult.<br /><br />I did agree with most of the author's plan for addressing the issue.<br /><br />I think you have to accept that you cannot change other's behavior, only your response to it and there were some great suggestions on how to do that in this book.
B0060ZJ7BC|1.0|This movie was so boring. the only thing i can say what i liked about this movie was brad pitt's acting. but other than that i found it boring. thats because i really don't know much about baseball. it was just not my type of film. if you are a hardcore baseball fan then this movie is for you. if not then i don't recommend this movie.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely loved the Hunger Games series they are wonderful. I couldn't stop reading them because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.
B0062EKXKK|5.0|It was pretty cool liked the fact that it  looked like mini-albums. You have almost all the old music expect for the album departure. But at least you have all the music in a box set.
B002KDSBGA|5.0|It has been years since Ive seen this movie and it is still a great movie. Nice clear picture, glad they didnt colorize it. Disappointed that this wasnt one of the Prime movies.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|50 shades is a great story that will make you addicted!! if you haven't read the trilogy yet, go out and get!! it is so worth the money!!
0751505641|5.0|great book . i love danielle steel books and waiting for more. each one is about differnt people and years and someone elses life. will take your mind off sad and your own life.
B005OOSPZO|5.0|I received this purchase promptly and was pleased to see that this purchase was exactly as I imagined it would be.  The \\"booklet\\" case that the movie disc comes in is creative and unique.  It offers to stand out nicely from all the blue plastic cases for other Blu-Ray discs.<br /><br />The movie plays well and the offering of the American and Japanese versions is great.  The available special features also add to the experience since such a movie took so much to produce and direct.  It is amazing to see some of the behind the scenes photos and video.
B006TX276C|4.0|this cd is pretty straight up...a collection of Davids' work...I like the images that accompany this double set...as well as the construction of the packaged product....so eveything was quite straight up as far as a cd goes...arrived in good shape...and quite speedy in delivery....thanks
B005UG542S|5.0|Potter fans will Not be disappointed with this last entry!  There is rough language and violence so judge for younger fans.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I think its great. its so awesome because its like every level you unlock something new. I also like the idea of plachinko. yupm that's wwhy I like it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a great app I love playing the games and so do my kids. I love the competition of everyone trying to beat the high scores.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Gripping novel - raises many questions and debate .... stayed with me for days after the final page ... read like an autobiography
B007MNV5WU|4.0|with the gravity elements, I think Rovio has taken this series to the next level. I just wish that since we paid more for the kindle version, we could get the latest levels.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|The book was outstanding.  Very informative on what actually happens in dangerous assignments.  Educational - insight into Afghan people and customs.  I actually met the author just days after finishing reading the book.  He was a motivational speaker at a convention in FL.  You feel the agony of all the men and especially the author, the pain of the parents and brothers, and the caring of the everyday American people.  Renewed appreciation for those who are willing to go to battle and risk their lives for the rest of us. Thanks for a heartfelt book.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is good because it saves Gb for free games and other stuff in the appstore.some are lame and others are just<br />awesome.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I have used several stylus pens on iPad but this one is definitely my favorite. iPad is sensitive, but no-where near as sensitive as a Wacom for fine detail-work and note-taking. A lot of stylus pens try to be very pinpoint accurate, but it simply doesn't work on iPad. Since iPad is a device calibrated for finger-gestures, the point of contact is supposed to be larger than that of a pen.<br /><br />This product is perfect for broad-stroke sketches, charts, reference designs, concept artwork, and the like. It's thick and hefty, so writing with it feels just like using a solid market on a white-board, exactly what iPad is built for. I've drawn many user interfaces, display concepts, and even packaging designs with this stylus and my iPad.<br /><br />Combine this stylus with Paper by FiftyThree, and you have a great tool for drawing, designing, and really extending your device's capabilities. The rubberized tip glides nicely across the screen and the strokes are very predictable, unlike many other stylus pens out there.
B0062P332Y|3.0|At first glance, Killer Elite appears to be little more than a vehicle for action star Jason Statham, and by all means that's pretty much what it is, just with the luxury of having Robert De Niro and Clive Owen in supporting roles.  Statham plays Danny, a retired contract killer in the early 80s that gets drawn back into the game when his mentor and friend (De Niro) gets kidnapped and soon enough Danny finds himself on a reluctant mission, and eventually on the run from another pro (Owen) that's just as driven as he is.  While Killer Elite manages to pack enough nicely orchestrated action set pieces, there isn't anything here you haven't seen before.  Not to mention that were it not for the star power of Statham, Owen, and De Niro; not many would probably pay much attention to it in the first place.  That aside, Killer Elite offers enough standard action and solid performances from everyone involved to warrant it getting a look at the very least.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A captivating book, follows the movie, but with greater detail. I shared this with my daughter and we made it an experience
B000JIHP88|3.0|So there are a LOT of reviews on this thing, good and bad. I thought I would throw mine into the loop as well.<br />Firstly, my daughter loves this, she plays with it and watches it and overall really enjoys it.<br />Many people complain that this is too quiet, here is my thoughts on it. The low volume is pretty quiet, especially the nature sounds, however it is definitely loud enough for baby. The high volume is loud, but not too loud. I can hear it in the hall, but with the door closed, I really have to listen for it. My daughter is use to a lot of noise, so the loud setting works well when she is just playing with it, the low volume for when she is trying to sleep.<br />Many people also claimed it does not fit on a convertible crib, I have a convertible crib and it fits fine. If you want it on the head/ foot board of the crib, it will not fit most cribs as they have a solid top these days. It is meant to go on the side of the crib- it fits well there if you have a straight edged crib. Essentially it has a big plastic bolt and washer- you put the bolt through the slats and spin on the washer until it's tight.<br />I have had this for about three weeks and I have not had any problems with any of the leaves as others have complained about, nor has the motor caused any problems. I am thinking those people just got a bad one, it happens but I don't think it should stop anyone from buying this. It is a great product!<br />My almost 3 month old use to hate being in her crib, awake or asleep, it was too big and open for her. Now that she has this mobile, she loves to watch it and play with it in her crib. She has started taking naps in her crib because of this mobile, it is now a friendly place for her (I am sure that would have happened over time, but it is great to have that happen now as she is outgrowing where she sleeps in now). My only complaint is I wish it had a continuous play mode as sometimes she wakes up when it turns off.<br /><br />***EDIT*** The motor justdied. We didn't even have it for a full month. Very disappointing, my daughter really liked this. At least it helped her learn to enjoy her crib. I was sad to return it, but at least Amazon makes it easy to return. Upon reading other mobile reviews it seems that Fisher Price motors die frequently.
B000EXZI0K|5.0|I remember asking for money to buy this album when it came out. I eventually got it on a day it snowed so hard that after waiting 2 hours for a ride that never arrived, I caught a cab, yet I had to walk part of the way home because the roads were so bad. The album was worth it, it was warm listening to. Subway is my favorite. I still have the album but not a record player so I will purchase the CD.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Works great... Had 1 bar on my signal, now I have 5... Great fro picking up wifi in the neighborhood :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game it is like real solitaire and the game doesn't cheat. it is one of my favorite games to play and is so simple and easy to use.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I just finished the whole trilogy and this book was one of the best out of the 3, even though I loved them all for different reasons. Don't let the \\"graphic, dominatrix-type sex scenes from the first few chapters distract you from reading the entire trilogy. These scenes are needed to understand why Christian is the way he is. These books were well thought out and such great reads. I loved it -- highly recommend! I can't wait until the books from Christian's point of view come out!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|lot of fun even if its the same view on every level. id recommend it to anyone with time to kill.
B004LWZW42|4.0|i finaly got to see this movie.i thought it was going to be a continuation of the wolverine movie,which it wasnt.although he did make a cameo appearance long enough to make me laugh really really hard.it was difficult for me to follow the movie because the characters used thier human names for most of the movie.i had to keep a mental list of which characters had which abilities abnd which comic book characters they were.the real thing that bothered me was,once again,the movie makers tossed the real story right out the freaking window .professer x as an english hipster?the messed up original line up was all screwy too.i believe it was professer x,cyclops[not his brother havoc],angel[the boy one not a stripper girl who wasnt even the same race],beast,jean grey,and ice man.only half of them were in this movie.and dont go quoting the other x men movies because they are all messed up too.<br />  but,messed up facts aside,the movie was great!there was a lot of cool mutant stuff going on,a lot of questions answered,a huge amount of action and it was awesome.it was the \\"revenge of the sith\\" of the x-men movies.of which there are 5.i'd place this one 4th over all.but,i really like them all.so,4th is still spectacular.<br />  the characters they DO USE are a hipster professer X,beast,magneto[good guy],mystique[good girl],havoc,darwin,a girl angel,banshee,and a few others im probably forgetting.the movie focuses around magneto and professor X when they were still erik and charles.the bad guys were a blonde teklekinet ive never heard of,a red nightcrawler type guy,a unamed guy with the same powers of skull fire and some more.the original brotherhood of evil mutant members in the comics were magneto,blob,quicksilver,pyro,scarlet witch and toad.once again,not even close.<br />  HOWEVER,like i said,the movie is still an awesome movie.and i WOULD recomend you buy it.especialy if you are a comic book or action fan.it does have a lot of great scenes and it does answer tons of questions about how things happened.i mentioned \\"revenge of the sith\\" earlier.well,much in the same way as \\"rots\\" answered questioned about star wars,this movie answeres questions about the x-men trilogy and xmen in general.<br />  there are a lot of action scenes and military stuff going on that bridge between WW2 and the bay of pigs[1940's to 1962].so be ready for that.there are also a bunch of science scenes but not so much that it gets old like in \\"the hulk\\" and \\"iron man\\".as far as the actors and actresses go,i can only remember seeing one of them in any other movie.the CO on a battleship is a CO on the movie \\"starship troopers\\".but,i will admit i have trouble telling one blonde skank from another.they all look the same to me.plastic like a barbie doll and bottom feeders.so maybe theyve been around.and chances are they have.i think this one chick who i ended up hating in the movie may have been a girl i hated in \\"batman begins\\" now that i think about it.<br />  go get it!
B0009VSB06|1.0|We thought it would be fun to take up metal detecting, having 2 boys who love the idea of treasure hunting. But sadly this metal detector gives nothing but false readings. It is very erratic. I even changed the new batteries, thinking they may be the problem, but just got the same from this product. Buy something else. Not this one. I don't know if we'll buy something better or not. I would hate to keep spending money on metal detectors, but I'm sure they're not all this bad.
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|DOA. Didn't work straight out of the box. I decided to give it a try even though this happened to quite a few people, and I got the same thing. Straight to trash, wasn't even worth the hassle of trying to return it.<br />Save yourself the cash!!!!
B007PS0X0W|2.0|Wow horrible sequel; almost stopped watching but, I will watch anything so I finished it. Plus I did pay to rent from amazon. The first was the best but even the second was leaps and bounds over this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I could not put the book down and then I had to continue reading the next two books to find out where this Mr. Grey's \\"person\\" came from.  It was differenct reading for me, but I enjoyed it thoroughly !!  Most women I have spoken with that are reading the trilogy  -- are really enjoying themselves  -- I highly suggest you read it....
1401233791|4.0|That was one chunky book.<br /><br />Having recently ordered and read through both of the re-released \\"Batman: No Man's Land\\" volumes presently available, I expected the re-release of \\"Batman: Knightfall\\" to have a relatively similar look and feel.  Boy, was I wrong.  \\"Batman: Knightfall\\" is nearly twice as thick as each of the NML volumes, and will likely chew up quite a bit of real estate on my bookshelf.<br /><br />Now, reviewing the book's dimensions may seem a bit petty, and I suppose it is; but the thickness of the volume makes portability difficult, and for someone who likes to throw a trade paperback in his luggage when he travels, that's a big deal.  The information is available on the product information page, but I rarely heed that stuff. I will from now on.<br /><br />Now, to the fun stuff: the content.  Any fan of Batman really should read this story; it marks a significant season in the hero's journey, a time when Batman was stretched so thin for so long that he was simply unable to function.  It is a compelling tale, one that begins in the dank darkness of Pena Dura on Santa Prisca, and ends in blood on the streets of Gotham.  Seeing Bruce Wayne's response to the traps set by his arch nemeses and marking the fatigue as it spreads wider and deeper across his features is a remarkable experience, and will likely make for a faster read than anticipated.  This is a book written and drawn by some true masters of the craft: Alan Grant, Doug Moench, Norm Breyfogle, Graham Nolan, and a host of others knock it out of the park on nearly every page.<br /><br />This volume is a reprint, and I mean that in every sense of the word: DC even used the same kind of paper on which the original comics were printed, so it feels (and smells!) like those originals; it was truly a nostalgic experience for me, and I savored every minute of it.<br /><br />Take, read...and enjoy. You won't regret it.
B005ZUR724|4.0|You get what you pay for.  WoW lite.  No mounts or organized PvP.  Has a lot of bugged quests.  luckily they can be skipped.  High level gear must be purchased with actual money.
044024630X|1.0|I have read many mysteries--some great, some good, most of them formulaic and mediocre.  I  have read all of the Jack Reacher books.  I shall not be reading any new ones.  This novel is beyond bad and predictable.  Someone said a high school student could have written it.  I'll go one better and say an elementary school student could have written it.  How many Reacher books have page after page of filler which goes something like this:  It was hot (or cold.) There were lots of trees (or it was barren.) The road stretched ahead, empty.  There were no people around.  For miles ahead, there were trees (or not) and no people and no cars.  Reacher was hot (cold, tired, hungry, thirsty, disgusted.)  Reacher walked 500 miles and stopped in a dumpy diner to eat a greasy meal and in a loser store to buy another flannel shirt.  He was on the lookout for bad guy types.<br />You get the idea.  If you have read even two Reacher novels you know exactly what I am talking about.  This book was so bad that I threw it on the floor when I finished it.  And I have never done that (even on a lonely stretch of road with no trees and no cars.)  Seriously, the Hardy Boys and Nancy Drew mysteries are far superior to this.  At least they are not filled with boring description and have a plausible plot.
0817439390|5.0|I am not a pro by any means, but many friends and family like my pictures and ask how they can get better pictures.  This is always my first recommendation to anyone.  Particularly if you have a DSLR or another camera with some manual modes.  Mr. Peterson breaks down the elements that make up an exposure and teaches you, through example, what impact changing each variable will have on the final picture.  He also preaches there is no \\"right\\" or \\"wrong\\" method.  Photography is and art and thus, the value of the images captured is in the eye of the person taking the picture and producing the final image.  His approach allows you to develop your own style by giving you all the tools and vocabulary you need.<br /><br />I think anyone would find this book valuable, whether trying to get better snapshots or trying to dive deep into the world of photography.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This is a well-crafted book.  The quality of the writing allows me to truly empathize with the protagonist and kept me engrossed until the end.  I guess I'm a dumb reader as I rarely guess the endings of books, but in this case I did, but I was still interested to see how the story played out.<br /><br />It's an interesting construct to imagine a person whose memory only builds for one day, who wakes every morning not knowing who she is nor who the man in bed next to her is.  The author does an amazing job developing this theme, and I highly recommend the book.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I won't say it's perfect, but it is damn good. The author's descriptions can get a little repetitive, but overall it is refreshingly unique, incredibly well-crafted, and SO entertaining. The build-up is great, but the ending left me wanting a little more.
055380684X|2.0|Not a lot of depth.  Author harps on the same point over and over again.  Having a hard time finishing this book.  I highly recommend the book \\"Outliers\\".  Similar topic, but much better content
B005OCFGTO|5.0|product arrived before it was promised. arrived in mint condition, and movies were as good as advertised. movies were not as good as the books in my opinion, but movies rarely are
B002BWP49C|5.0|I received this DVD on time and really liked all of the extras on the 2nd DVD, especially the special effects.
B0083GQKQG|3.0|The way this movie was done frustrated us because it could have been a really good movie but it was so back and forth and scenes shown out of order, that it distracted from our ability to fully get into it and enjoy it.  It also felt too artsy for us.<br />The acting was really convincing, especially by the son, both young and older. He was so good that we felt the extreme dislike for him. There were many conversation-starters that happened...Why didn't the Mom just set up a hidden camera to capture how the son treated her when the Dad wasn't watching since he had such a hard time believing her.  What would we do if we had a kid that was that easy to dislike, etc.<br />I am going to read the book now and see if it gives me more insight into the relationships between the parents and the kid and if it answers a lot of the questions that the film didn't.<br />It was a good movie and still worth the rental amount, but I felt it could have been told in a more organized way.
0385737955|4.0|This book took me a while to get into but once I did I flew through it. What imagination. Cannot wait to read the second book.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I love being able to access my desktop through my Kindle Fire. It is extremely helpful to be able to use my desktop through my Kindle Fire. It is a quick and easy when I do not have my netbook handy.
B005HSGB6W|2.0|Chances are that you have already seen the Stanly Kubrik adaptation of this novel and are looking for the full experience that inspired the (half-hazardly done) film.<br /><br />Anthony Burgess takes a unique look into the world of the dark and depraved aspect of humanity, from the point of view of an exceptionally dark and depraved individual.<br /><br />This version of the novel is as it was written originally, including a final chapter that was not included in the American prints, nor touched upon in the film.<br /><br />As for my 2 stars: the language in this novel is extremely hard to keep up with in this novel due to the excessive use of Cockney slang and odd usage of other words and phrases (even foreign and entirely fictional ones), most of which gives no hint whatsoever to their meaning or definition.<br /><br />I do not mean that you have to be able to read Chaucer or Dante Alghieri to follow this, but you will probably need a pad and paper for notes unless there is a \\"Clockwork Orange Word Key\\" on some website. If there is a more \\"Americanized\\" version in PRINT, I would suggest that first, since there isn't one for Kindle.<br /><br />Read a sample and you will see what I mean.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey was a wonderfully captivating book. It was very hard to put it down. Definitely adult content. Be prepared to be a little shocked by some of the content but also be ready to enjoy a very good love story. What most people only dream about. A little extreme on the sexual end but has reasons for being so and is well explained throughout. I have already purchased book 2 and finished it and am reading the third book now. Definitely holds your attention and interest.
B0000017CA|5.0|My mother used to have this album until it either was stolen or went missing as we moved a lot and mentioned that to me not long ago, but for Mother's Day I decided to get this album for her again and she was so happy to hear Scream of the Butterfly, Finger Paintings of the Insane, Cassie Eats Cockroaches and especially Bones of Baby Dolls. The disk and case were in perfect condition (although the sticker on the top of the case opening which left that sticky stuff, oh well) and other than that, just perfect! :)
B0013F1D02|5.0|I really was not going to watch this but so many good reviews.  I am glad I tried it.  I was hooked in the first few minutes and it maybe on my top 25 list.  Really had a great storyline.  Good action, comedy, romance.  Unsure why this did not do better at the box office.  i think it is the name.  Give it a try you will like it.

Ssssssss-nnnnnnn-ooooo-rrrr-eeeee. I wanted to take them BOTH over my knee by the end if it all.
B007Q2N0HA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and am sorely disappointed that the sequel won't be out until October. I'm disappointed that we didn't get Gideon's story but I guess I can understand her keeping something back to keep us on the edge of our seats (to mix metaphors) waiting on the sequel. Eva rocks - I love her spirit. Cary ticks me off, though. Hopefully he'll get his act together in the sequel and Trey will give him another chance. I want them to work badly.<br /><br />This is a \\"must read\\" book. Seriously.
B000U0O9FM|4.0|I'm going to make a quick assumption that if you sought this book out for reading, you may have also read (or will eventually read) Hunter S. Thompson's \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\". If you've already read that one, than you will likely have appreciated how the movie followed the book almost to the letter, especially the pace!<br /><br />Fight Club is no different. Although the placement of some scenes is different from the book, this is almost a play-by-play. I appreciate when film makers do that, especially when you were one of the individuals that saw the movie first, than found the book out of love for the film.<br /><br />The nameless hero suffers from insomnia every night, paging through catalogs of furniture, lamps and wall accents for his small apartment when he can't sleep. In the pursuit of a solution, fate sends him to various support group meetings for terminally ill and those in sickness recovery. It is here he meets Marla Singer, another 'tourist and faker' who like him, pretends to be sick or dying at the support meetings.<br /><br />On a beach, he runs into curious man who has a very free and liberating disposition. His name is Tyler Durden.<br /><br />With Tyler Durden and Marla Singer in his life, our character's life begins to twist and turn into an unrecognizable mess of beauty and brutality, truth and deception, death and rebirth.<br /><br />Fast paced, and refreshingly original, this is a great piece that won't make you feel cheated when you burn through it so quickly. Like the movie, read the book, then you will love both.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a great app for us busy moms that are looking to spend a little bit of me time at the end of the day. When I finally get all the kids in bed I get to play a few games while snuggled up in my comfy bed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game. it is slightly addicting great for kids.  levels are easy to reach with great rewards which is a good incentive to continue playing
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Movie is fit for juvenile audience.  Mature movie go'ers beware. Ending was really really bad in every way. Juvenile. Good filming, bad plot and script. Lots of 'dark' scenes, (just noise, growls, and movement).
1400069289|5.0|I found this book to be fascinating and can be related to so many areas of our lives.  I have recommended it to many people from all walks of life.
0545425115|4.0|I'm loving this book.  The writing captivated me from the get go and I'm finding it hard to put it down.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. It was AWESOME!! I would recommend this book to anyone of age ((definitely not for kids or even young adults)! Made me feel like I was in the moment!!
B004SDEP38|4.0|This product is the best as far as editing and creating documents doing what you have to do with them on mobile devices I have had documents to go since I have had my Centro phone then I moved to a Treo then the Palm Pre now I have the HTC Evo and I have loved it since my Centro!!!
B00006CXSS|5.0|This product arrived in a timely matter and in excellent condition. This is an amazing mini-series, and I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|The Kane Chronicles follows the lives of two siblings who couldn't be more different from each other both physically and with their personalities.  Their lives get turned upside down when their father unleashes the ancient gods of Egypt into the modern world and is captured by the chaos god Seth.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I was happy with all the games. A variety of games in one spot!  Some easier than others. Worth the download.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game so much. its so easy to use not complicated at all. I also love all personalizing you can do with it as well.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|Visually, this is a stunning application.  But it eats a ton of Kindle Fire resources.  It takes a long time to launch.  Once you start a tournament, it never lets you progress past that tournament.  And it will not 'time out' on the screen, meaning it consumes battery like crazy.<br /><br />Did I say it eats a lot of Kindle Fire resources?<br /><br />I'd say unless you are an Uno addict...and I mean a 24 hour a day, 7 days a week kind of Uno addict...I would pass on this one.
B004G600A4|5.0|Being a severe critic you don't see me writing many cartoon reviews, but having watched Tangled for the first and second time, I am compelled.<br />In the age of re-writes upon rewrites this version of a classic is so unique and fresh and well written it is a brand new fairytale entirely.<br />The most surprising of all is the absolute absence of a single off-color joke, adult innuendo, confrontational-moral agenda pushing situation, or subversive undertone; this is an honest to goodness plain-old superb animation in the most amazing graphical stunning presentation I have ever seen.<br />Every song was written and performed to perfection as if it was the signature piece, the voice actors chosen were impeccable in their performances, and the refreshingly few sidekick-animals of the horse and \\"frog\\" were laugh-out-loud funny without detracting from the ingenious plot and creative storyline.<br />Last but certainly not least was the paper lantern presentation that was utterly stunning. It is difficult to comprehend that animation has reached this level of perfection but for the first time ever I feel able without reservation to praise a work with my five star rating.<br />Disney blew the doors off with this one, Well done guys! Keep it up.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The footage on these dvds is awesome and breathtaking. I bought it to show my children (and myself!) as well as my students in school. Absolutely amazing!!
1609613937|5.0|Absolutly love this book. Couldn't put it down until I was done with it. Looking forwarding to trying many of the recipes in the book. Want to buy a copy and give to all my loved ones, but figure first I'll show them the results ... then when they ask me how I did it, give them their copy of the book...Thank you Dr. McDougall for another great book!

B005MMY5RK|3.0|I watched Citizen Kane again last night after several years.  It struck me as not being as great as the hype.  If you pay attention at the beginning of the film, when Kane is a boy, it is obvious what is going to happen and what Rosebud means.  Other than that, it is not a great film.  If you are a man who identifies with the psychological aspects of the film, and this is your first time watching it, then ok, it is shocking in it's great insights.  But once you have seen it, then, what is the appeal?
0345803485|2.0|I like erotic stories sometimes, but this one is for women, not men.  The love interest (Christian) is described in excruciating detail, while the main character, a young woman named Anastasia, isn't described physically other than her annoying habit of biting her lip or blushing every page or so...which inexplicably drives Christian wild.  She goes from untouched (even by herself) virgin to multi-orgasmic S&M participant quicker than a fake \\"amateur\\" porn star, and her first few encounters were actually pretty sexy. But I quickly tired of reading how \\"hot\\" Christian's feet or jeans are, or how he \\"cocked his head sideways\\", without any corresponding attributes of Anastasia.  I never knew cocking ones head sideways drove the ladies crazy; I figured it made you look like dope...but I digress.  I was more interested in young Anastasia's best friend, because the author at least takes a swing at describing her physically.  Leaving Anastasia's physical description out is clearly a tool to allow female readers to feel as though they are in her shoes (our out of them...and everything else), and it clearly worked, as these three books were the top three paperbacks last time I looked.  But as a guy, I had all the Christian I could take after about 1/4 of the thing.<br /><br />Anyway, 50 shades of grey is superficial, repetitive garbage, but I can see how it might be fun for the ladies.  For male readers....not so much.  You'd be better off reading those stupid Penthouse Forum stories.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|I greatly enjoyed this short novel, my first experience with Camus.  I believe it works on multiple levels.<br /><br />It is great on a pure storytelling level.  Camus's detached and cold style of writing really works here; it creates an interesting and unsettling mood.  And the story, while short, is highly entertaining.<br /><br />The novel also works as a reflection of the legal system.  The flaws that are allowed in the protagonist's trial are flaws that, while perhaps exaggerated, can often creep in the American and other legal systems.  The second half of the novel serves as an apt demonstration as to why criminal defendants should be judged on the merits of their cases -- not on their personalities and histories.<br /><br />Finally, the novel works on a philosophical level.  Much in the same way that I find a Dostoevsky novel intellectually stimulating and satisfying, the existential questions raised (and answered) by this novel serve as a springboard toward discussion and deep thought.<br /><br />Overall, highly rewarding and easy to recommend.
B00783NWB6|5.0|I'm not going to review the movie (that's what my Rotten Tomatoes account is), but the thing is that people who have seen past Underworld movies know exactly what you're getting. This time though, it's just in spectacular 3D. Filmed with RED Epic 3D cameras, I can honestly say that this ranks with some of the best 3D I've ever seen before. As a Film student, I can tell you that it looks spectacular. The clean digital photography added to the fact that the film was actually SHOT in 3D rather than post converted makes a massive amount of difference.<br /><br />A lot of people have been complaining about the 3D blu-ray because apparently it doesn't play in 2D. Well, when I bought mine from Wal-Mart, it said on the case that it DOES play in 2D as well. If you have a 3D TV, then that means your TV has the ability to convert to 3D as well. All you have to do is turn the 3D off on your TV, and voila! Crystal clear 1080p picture in 2D. The only thing I was rather disappointed with was the fact that there weren't many special features. Being a film student, I was curious to know how it was filmed and how it differed from shooting in 2D. But other than that, I love this movie, and if you're a fan of the Underworld franchise, you will too. Plus, it's Kate Beckinsale in tight leather in 3D. That alone is enough to justify the price xD
B00505470O|5.0|I agree with the positive reviews on this disc.  An ethereal sound, mellow - something that enables me to be very productive (as I listen to this at my desk)!<br /><br />Highly recommended - for any purpose!<br /><br />I rate this disc...5 stars!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun app, I really enjoy playing this game. I hate waiting for coins though. I recommend this game for anyone.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />When the evil Loki threatens Earth; Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D, must assemble a team of extraordinary individuals known as `The Avengers' to stop the coming alien invasion.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Believe the hype, Marvel fans will not be disappointed. Written and directed by Joss Whedon was there ever any doubt that this movie would be awesome; after all he is the King of geekdom. `The Avengers' packs plenty of pulse pounding action, sharp humor and some of the most incredible special effects you will ever see. The real highlight of this movie isn't just in the action, it is Whedon's amazing script. The razor sharp wit is thrown in with perfect comic timing and our heroes are given enough depth to show their vulnerable human sides; they all clash well together as they battle egos and brawn. Mark Ruffalo is the only new guy and does an excellent job as Bruce `Hulk' Banner, Scarlett Johansson brings sexy back as `Black Widow' but it is Robert Downey Jr. who steals the show as egotistical Tony `Iron Man' Stark. If you haven't seen `The Avengers' yet, then I suggest you strap your undies on the outside of your pants and join Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye in this super hero slog-fest!<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Thor and Hulk punch on while on board the `Helicarrier'; S.H.I.E.L.D.S. headquarters.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Edward Norton was set to reprise his role as the Hulk but negotiations between him and Marvel Studios severed.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Set in a magical wonderland with a darker twist this book definetly was worth my time. I actually lingered on reading it because I wanted to be able to savor it.  Delicious :)
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I kept going back and forth between the MicroShell and the Leather cover and finally decided on the the MicroShell because it was cheaper.  I didn't want to spend a lot on a cover.  I read some of the reviews but despite the negative reviews, I went ahead and ordered it anyway.  I am very paticular about what I buy ( I always want the best ) so when I recieved my cover today I was really excited to see what it looked like.  Let me just say that I am not disappointed at all!!  I love it!  Fits my Kindle like a glove!  It was so easy to install.  I ordered the case in pink and I was expecting a dull pink but it is a beautiful, bright pink...so happy!!  The case has a rubbery feel to it which makes it easy to grasp.  The flap may be a tad flimsy but I guess it needs to be in order for it to bend and turn into a stand, which by the way works great!  The elastic strap is not glued on like I had read on some of the reviews.  Both sides are tucked into the case.  It does not look cheap.  I just wish they came in animal print!
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|Fantastic Album, really Surprise how good this album is a must buy for any killers fan!!!<br />Can't stop listening to Magdalena great song 5\5,only the young another great song!!! Their so many Gems in this. Overall Flamingo Gets a 5/5 would recommend this album to killers fans =)
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I first heard a song from this CD on television and loved it, so I looked on itunes and purchased two songs off of the CD.  I enjoyed so much, I purchased two CDs off of Amazn and gave them as gifts.  All loved it.  Nice relaxing music.
B004UXUX7S|5.0|What's it about?<br /><br />George Clooney plays a husband stricken by the grief of his comatose wife, only to find out she was having an affair.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Alexander Payne of Sideways fame has crafted another brilliant character driven piece, where you don't know whether you want to laugh or cry...or both. George Clooney is amazing as the highly strung man, dealing with not only his wife, but his dysfunctional family. His performance was very worthy of an Oscar Nomination and probably should have won. With so many formulaic films now days, it is certainly refreshing to watch something that is original and genuinely uncertain as to how it would end. It's ironic that initially the film baulks at showing Hawaii only as the `tourist mecca' we have all seen, but by the end it returns to scenery we all know and love, painting a picture of paradise. This is arguably the best film of 2011.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />George travels to a douchebag real estate mogul's holiday home to confront him about his relationship with his wife.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Having been nominated for 5 Academy Awards, the film only managed to win Best Adapted Screenplay.
006097625X|5.0|I had this book recommended to me by a colleague as it related to business strategy.  It sounds odd that a book on comics would be a support structure for strategy documents, but the core of the book sets up well for the translation.  By understanding the core 6 step process of creating comics and connecting it with the closure of each comic panel, it's a strong basis for strategic writing.  I gained a huge amount of insight from the book and am happy that it was an easy read and an easy transition.  I definitely recommend it as a base for writing and pictorial integration for any communication document.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Fast read.  Keeps you spellbound.  I downloaded the trilogy and did not even really know when I was done with one book and reading the next.  Glad I waited for the trilogy.  Don't like waiting for the next book to be written.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|Confusing plot. Paper thin characters. Seems like they finished shooting and realized they didn't have anything usable so they made up a whole new movie in the editing suite.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I received this on my Kindle as a gift from a friend that really had no idea of my reading taste... And honestly I had never read \\"this type\\" of book before; I'm more of a Dean Koontz, Stephen King, and Frank Peretti (I know even Frank doesn't fit in with the previous 2 but bare with me here, they all write thrillers).<br /><br />So when I first heard about this book it was from that friend and I thought nothing more of it, hadn't heard the hype on TV or read any of the articles being written about it. I truly had very little of a clue what I was getting myself into. But I loved it! I didn't think I would but now that my eyes have been opened to this genre I really love it.<br /><br />I have since read the following 2 and enjoyed them just the same. I think since I had no preconceived notion about the book or the genre in general I was able to really take the book at face value and appreciate the entertainment (even with the repetitive words/phrases that were annoying and now incorporated into my every day vocabulary with the friend that bought me the book LOL).<br /><br />All in all, I felt like it was a good read. I think a lot of the negative reviews that I have read are taking the book too seriously. It's entertainment! I realize BDSM is a lifestyle for some but there are a number of books and movies out that I'm certain most people can relate to and are based on others lifestyles as well and they don't get offended by the book or movie. You're supposed to read it, enjoy it (or not) and move on to the next book.<br /><br />I felt like this was a good series, I actually read it twice and felt a little guilty for doing so until I read a couple other posters say they had read it 3 or 4 times! :)
B005LAIIS0|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />Liam Neeson has a fly in/ fly out job in the Alaskan wilderness, but on his return home his plane crashes and miraculously survives, along with a number of others onboard. Now they are being hunted by a pack of rabid wolves, and boy, are they relentless. Who knew surviving a plane crash would be the easy part?<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />This is the type of movie that could have been very cheesy in less than capable hands, fortunately though this isn't the case. The film is a wonderfully crafted visual film, interspersed with memorable actions scenes, and fantastic character driven performances. Seriously, who doesn't love Liam Neeson? He could make a kids home movie feel intense. Here he lends the film credibility which could have been lost with a completely different cast. The CGI wolves are very well done (i.e. not fake looking), with one scene in particular a stand out, as the gold eyes of the wolves cast down on the survivors in the night. Joe Carnahan is director you can rely on for a quality film, and in this case, he has more than delivered.<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Liam Neeson and his buddy try to escape a wolf through a raging river, which will be sure to take your breath away. Yes, pun intended.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Bradley Cooper was originally cast, but was replaced with Liam Neeson.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book series was great! I recommend it, I did notice the font problems that everyone is talking about, but I wouldn't have noticed them if they hadn't mentioned it. Overall it was a great trilogy I'm sure to read again!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|really nice game and you. should enjoyed.  easy to play.  easy to additives .  have fun<br />personally I will play for many hours on my bed.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Works great love it highly recommend.  Great graphics. A little slow on reaction time though. Overall great game app and product
B005L38QK2|3.0|Overall it's a good mouse but maybe a bit expensive considering the following.  The mouse seems very light and tends to move around unintended.  This is a problem for me because the programmable buttons are kind of a stretch for me to use.  I  think this is best suited for people that have pretty large hands.
B00846WWVM|5.0|bought on the play store and absolutely loved playing it. Woot Woot. Woot Woot Woot Woot Woot Woot Woot Woot.
B005LAIIS0|2.0|I giving the movie 2 stars I'm really contemplating 1 star. I decided on 2 stars because there were a couple of one-liners I liked<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br />For almost 2 hours, I watched this and at the end, I realized I would've been better off spending that time trying to figure out why water is wet. After crashing and taking refuge in the wreckage where they at least had some sort of cover, they live it behind for a destination unknown and unprotected - THE WOODS. It was kinda obvious someone was always about to die as they were picked off 1 by 1. A couple of the standoff scenes were a bit far-fetched in my eyes. On one side, there are a group of unarmed and unprepared me visibly shaken and on the other side are about 8 sets of wolf eyes and the wolves don't attack. One could only wish that would really happen.<br /><br />What probably bothered me the most was the end or lack of ending. There's so much time spent showing the other crap but when there's a chance for a big finish and/or action sequence, the credit roll. Are you kidding me? Who wins? If stick around after the credit, there's a post scene that implies Nesson wins. Assuming this is true, what happened after that? Did the other wolves back off? Was Nesson ever rescued? Maybe I want too much that ending was just lackluster at best.
B007P6VM04|3.0|This was a sensational series - one of the only ones I have become attached to on TV in ages.  And with a finale like the last episode was, that they could put together a CD and exclude \\"Don't Forget Me\\" is just a travesty, particularly when they decided to include Nick Jonas (?) performing a Michael Buble track.  Katherine McPhee blows away the audience with her final curtain call in the last episode. And with the focus in that episode on needing a revised ending, selecting an understudy to perform, and the songwriters cramming to create a new song, this disc would have been a real \\"SMASH\\" by including it!
0385737947|5.0|I Bought this book and it is so so so so sooo GOOD! some people says that they didn't liked the characters, really I LOVE EM ALL, I think this a great book, my son prefer this to the HUNGER GAMES SAGA, and it0s prettu good tooo! it has PLOT, CHARACTERS YOU'LL FELL IN LOVE wiTH, MYSTERY, so if u like THG, you'll love these, MAZE RUNNER TRILOGY A MUST HAVE FOR EVERY PEOPLE IN THE WORLD! just SHUCK-IT and buy this masterpiece by J.

B003IODNJA|4.0|For those already familiar with the Propaganda style and sound, there is nothing to be said, with the exception that this \\"25th Anniversary\\" edition brings a lot of hidden treasures and tracks unavailable anywhere else. For those who are not, the discovery of this band, \\"excentric\\" some people might say, is worth the price of having this double CD, as the bonuses are really exciting and fresh.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I usually love Liam films but Dont waste your time on this one. The plot is terrible. bad character development.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works great on my EVO 4G, I never had any issues with the app,&amp; it is very accurate. I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I enjoy this game just because it has several different types of games. some of the games are a little challenging, but that is what makes it worth it,cant wait to unlock more levels.
B0067R0APK|5.0|I've yet to find a more accurate weather app.  As most people I really have to know what's coming BEFORE something fouls me up.  Being disabled means knowingwhat kind of mobility assistance I will plan for.  This app has never given incorrect WX info.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I played this game for four or five days and then it suddenly quit working and have been unable to play or get help to fix issues since. Do not waste your time it will only end in frustration.
B005OOSPZO|4.0|The picture quality is excellent on this release. The quality of the image is very far removed from the blurry broadcast image I last saw many years ago on tv. The pin sharp picture and great colour depth gave a feeling of watching a modern reconstruction of events.<br /><br />Occasionally the use of models is evident but this did not spoil my viewing experience. This is a slow moving end to end account of events from both the American and the Japanese point of view. If you prefer fast paced action movies than I would not recommend this movie to you.<br /><br />The quality of acting is very high throughout the film without any distracting or unbelievable \\"star\\" actors.<br /><br />The booklet style of packaging offers a decent amount of information about the movie and its making as well as many behind the scenes photos.<br /><br />The Japanese actors speak in Japanese which neither surprised or annoyed me personally. I know that some people prefer a dubbed movie over subtitles so I considered it worthy of mention.<br /><br />This movie gave my teenage son a chance to understand what happend at Pearl Harbor in a much broader historical context without the blanket of wartime propaganda that seems to still linger over many peoples perception of the event.<br /><br />A beautifully shot movie with breath taking aerial footage. A slow burning pace leading up to many great action sequences and the revelation of why and how this came to pass.<br /><br />If this is your kind of movie I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.<br />If it is not I hope I saved you a chunk of your time and a little of your money.
B007SGM084|1.0|I can not figure out what all the hype is about this book. I kept hoping it would get better but it became more and more boring as I read. I did finish the trilogy and still can't understand the other great reviews. The writing was so poor and it seemed that in every other paragraph the same context and wording was repeated over and over and over again (her inner goddess, don't bite your lip etc.). Don't waste your money on this \\"wanna be\\" erotic novel.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Fox delivered the motherlode for Blu-Ray owners, and Alien fans, with their utterly spectacular, six-disc ALIEN ANTHOLOGY box-set. While Fox's 2003 \\"Alien Quadrilogy\\" DVD release set standards in the format for its wealth of supplemental content as well as its picture and sound quality, those attributes that have been matched, surpassed, and then some by this high-def package, which offers all the goodies from that release, piles on new content, offers never-before-seen footage and wraps it all up with some of the Blu-Ray format's most impressive transfers produced for catalog content.<br /><br />As Ridley Scott mentions in his liner notes, this long-gestating project was the culmination of two years of hard work by Charlie de Lauzirika and the folks at Scott Free. It's hard to heap enough superlatives on top of this release because from its presentation on down to its massive extra features (the majority of which are exclusive to the box-set), the \\"Alien Anthology\\" is like opening up the ultimate Christmas present for fans of the series.<br /><br />The mammoth package includes all four \\"Alien\\" films in both their theatrical release versions and extended Special Edition edits, with a pair of supplemental discs jammed with content from the 2003 documentaries, the \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens\\" laserdisc box-sets, never-before-seen deleted materials and plenty (and I do mean plenty) more.<br /><br />Because most of us are more than familiar with the four films, I'm not going to spend a great deal of time critically analyzing the pictures.<br /><br />Suffice to say, ALIEN rode the sci-fi wave that \\"Star Wars\\" ignited and became a classic in its own right thanks to Ridley Scott's direction, the film's evocative production design and striking H.R. Giger creature effects. The story may be simple and derivative (and methodically paced), but everything about the execution of \\"Alien\\" is elegant and eerie. Both the film's theatrical version and the more recent, so-called \\"Director's Cut\\" are included -- as Ridley Scott states about the latter, it's not really a \\"Director's Cut\\" but an alternate version with extra footage. It's also a bit faster-paced, as evidenced by the shorter running time, adding a couple of extra glimpses of the alien and the infamous cocoon scene at the end (which thankfully has been trimmed from its unexpurgated outtake state on previous laser/DVD editions). No matter which way you go, \\"Alien\\" is still a classic of the genre, regardless of the many shameless imitations that followed in the wake of its release.<br /><br />Its belated 1986 follow-up, ALIENS deservedly ranks as one of the great sequels of all-time, with James Cameron's brilliant reworking of the franchise opening up the story and characterizations of its predecessor. Sigourney Weaver rightly copped an Oscar nomination for her work as Ripley here, and the supporting performances (especially Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) add depth to a rollercoaster ride of a movie that's bigger and quite different than its predecessor, upping the amount of scares and enhancing the material with plenty of action. Though fans again have their preference between the two versions of the picture, I find the theatrical version to be the superior one, faster-paced and more satisfying than the \\"Director's Cut.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Aliens\\" improved in many ways on its predecessor, the ill-fated ALIEN 3 wrote the text-book on how not to make a sequel. This unrelentingly grim and tedious film was a disastrous way for David Fincher to start his career in features, the messy result of a handful of writers and filmmakers having been previously attached to the long-in-development project. What ended up being made was not only an unsatisfying follow-up to \\"Aliens,\\" but a movie that generates almost no legitimate scares, being dull and derivative of what came before. Fincher chose not to participate in the Special Edition's creation, but a longer preview assembly - adding some 30 minutes of previously excised footage - that debuted in the Quadrilogy release returns here and improves somewhat on the original theatrical version, especially in clarifying who the prisoners actually are (which we all know was a problem in the theatrical cut).<br /><br />After the calamity of the third movie, one might have assumed that ALIEN RESURRECTION would have been an appreciable improvement on its immediate predecessor. Joss Whedon (\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\") came on-board to write the script for French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but the end result was a tiresome and gory freak show variant on the earlier movies, with more colorful characters than \\"Alien 3\\" but less visual style. The theatrical version of the movie is included here along with a new \\"alternate\\" Special Edition (like Scott, Jeunet states that his original edit is the \\"Director's Cut\\"), which adds an unnecessary epilogue to the picture and minor character extensions.<br /><br />While I'm obviously not a fan of the third and fourth films in the franchise, the \\"Anthology\\" BD box-set is nevertheless essential for its supplements and behind-the-scenes chronicle of the series -- a strikingly honest assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each picture. (If only most DVD/BD supplements were as comprehensive as this.)<br /><br />Technically, the new AVC-encoded transfers are nothing short of revelations. \\"Alien\\" looked phenomenal on DVD and appears even more detailed and more satisfying here, yet \\"Aliens\\" - long a problematic title for standard-definition given its inherent grain and low-light cinematography - is the title that's truly glorious to behold, managing to retain its inherent grain and crispness while looking brilliantly detailed. \\"Alien 3\\"'s garish color scheme is more suited for high-definition as well, and even the visuals of \\"Alien Resurrection\\" receive a boost from the move to Blu-Ray. DTS Master Audio soundtracks are also outstanding in their sonic rendering of effects, dialogue and music, while purists can select the original stereo mixes for the earlier films in the series as well.<br /><br />Each \\"main\\" movie disc offers commentaries, isolated score tracks and deleted scenes, the latter of which have been remastered for HD and look nearly as good as the movies themselves. There's also a \\"Mu-Th-Ur Mode\\" on each movie wherein on-screen prompts tell you what's happening on the various audio tracks (i.e. what the commentary is discussing; what cue is playing on the isolated score mix, etc.), as well as on-screen trivia and information on what \\"Enhancement Pod\\" materials (more on that in a moment) are available on supplemental discs 5 and 6 pertaining to what you're watching. You can then make a bookmark (\\"data tag\\") so that this material instantly pops up when you insert the special features discs - yet while this feature is meant to make navigating the vast amount of extras more manageable, truth be told I found it's almost like reading a road map because there's just so much here!<br /><br />The vast majority of the extra features are housed on Discs 5 and 6 (presented in 480p) - from the comprehensive 2003 documentaries to separate archival sections for each film, offering more deleted materials, laserdisc archives for \\"Alien\\" and \\"Aliens,\\" vintage promo segments, previously released featurettes, trailers and more. Thus, even if fans would prefer to wait for a standalone release of, say, \\"Alien\\" or \\"Aliens,\\" they'll likely be missing out on most of the great extras housed exclusively in the Anthology box-set.<br /><br />From a sheer musical standpoint, the \\"Anthology\\" BD adds even more content (namely, isolated score tracks for every film) on top of an already-abundant collection of riches.<br /><br />In terms of commentary, we learn that Jerry Goldsmith never recovered from having his opening and closing credit themes removed from \\"Alien.\\" James Horner says he was nearly fired by the producers of \\"Aliens\\" because he couldn't compose the score's climactic cue in the short time frame they desired. And Elliot Goldenthal says the sound mix of \\"Alien 3\\" was a muddled mess, in a flawed movie he stills calls \\"incomplete.\\"<br /><br />The candid comments of Goldsmith are just one of the highlights of the \\"Alien\\" extras, which include the 1999 \\"Alien Legacy\\" retrospective plus the three-hour 2003 documentary, produced for the Quadrilogy release, on Disc 5. This is a smart, expertly-crafted Making Of that treads over ground other laser and DVD supplements first charted, but does so even more comprehensively. All the major players are interviewed, from Sigourney Weaver to Ridley Scott, David Giler and writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett among others.<br /><br />As you'd anticipate, every facet of the movie is covered - including the score. Goldsmith notes his disappointment at the removal of his music for the end credits, how the \\"alternate\\" main credit theme he composed in a matter of minutes was used instead of his original (preferred) piece, and how Scott failed to communicate with him about the direction of the score. Also interesting are editor Terry Rawlings' comments about using Howard Hanson (it was better than Goldsmith's work, which \\"wasn't his best\\" in Rawlings' mind), and David Giler's bizarre description of Goldsmith's music being too overbearing, \\"like 'Patton'\\" (umm - ok, Mr. Giler!).<br /><br />A multi-angle view of the chestbuster scene, storyboards, stills, two different edits of Mark Kermode's \\"Alien Evolution\\" doc, an archival promo featurette, Sigourney Weaver's screen tests, and more deleted scenes are included in the supplements on Disc 6 - and the \\"Anthology\\" makes amends for the Quadrilogy's lack of isolated scores by including not just one but two different isolated score tracks, one featuring Goldsmith's intended, original score (with pop-up cue information) as well as another for the final soundtrack.<br /><br />The supplements on \\"Aliens\\" are likewise comprehensive, starting with the addition of two new isolated score tracks - one for the soundtrack as featured in the film (where Horner's score was heavily reworked), and another offering Horner's intended compositions as best they can be presented. In the 2003 Making Of, Horner recounts his trouble writing for a movie that was still being re-cut and re-filmed once the recording sessions began. Despite the troubles, the composer seems to be diplomatic about the countless alterations Cameron made to his score in post-production, but dives into full frustration about how Gale Anne Hurd threatened to fire Horner from the movie when he needed more time to write the movie's (classic) climactic cue. Horner claims that he told them to go ahead and try and find a \\"more experienced\\" composer than he - a fiery exchange that proves more honest than anything you'll typically find in a DVD supplement, and the 180-minute Making Of is again filled with great production anecdotes and a thorough history of the production.<br /><br />The Anthology's supplemental disc 6 houses all the additional \\"Aliens\\" behind-the-scenes materials you'd expect, along with the long-coveted deleted scene where Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) meets his fate - a moment previously seen only in still photos, and shown here for the very first time. There's even all the footage from the \\"Aliens\\" mid `90s motion simulator amusement park ride (which I remember going on at the now-defunct Spooky World in Berlin, Mass. when I was at Boston College).<br /><br />\\"Alien 3\\" may have the tastiest supplement of all, and even better, de Lauzirika's original 2003 documentary - now re-christened under its intended title \\"Wreckage and Rage: Making Alien 3\\" - is presented here uncut for the first time. Some of it was reportedly discarded because it was \\"too honest\\" for DVD, but even with the edits, it was a gripping account of a movie that never should have began shooting in the first place. Now, restored to its original tell-all form, it's a spellbinding piece that's far more compelling for me than the movie that ended up on-screen.<br /><br />Renny Harlin and Vincent Ward are on-hand to discuss their earlier versions of the third movie's premise, which sounded far more intriguing in Harlin's version (which was supposed to have been set on the alien's home planet) and Ward's illogical but visually audacious conception (Ripley crash-lands on a wooden planet run by monks!). Both discuss their departure from the movie and how director Fincher had to deal with a script worked on by \\"too many cooks\\" that was being constantly rewritten during shooting.<br /><br />The program is rich with honest comments from the cast and crew, including cinematographer Alex Thomson and composer Elliot Goldenthal. Thomson notes that not even he could tell the difference between some of the characters at a pre-release screening, while Goldenthal engages in a fascinating dissection of the movie's unappealing sound mix. The composer's comments are refreshingly direct and pinpoint the movie's weaknesses, though it's equally interesting to hear the sound effects editors say that Goldenthal's music was too loud and overbearing - and how the filmmakers initially considered using no music at all!<br /><br />Whether or not you like \\"Alien 3,\\" there's no doubt this documentary is a must for all movie buffs, both for pointing out the failings of the finished movie and the more interesting directions that original versions of the story might have produced.<br /><br />\\"Alien Resurrection\\"'s special features include one more mammoth documentary - running a few minutes under three hours - featuring interviews with the principal filmmakers (including Jeunet) and a substantial look at the disappointing score by John Frizzell, which is easily the weakest of the series.<br /><br />There are also four additional \\"Enhancement Pods\\" contained on the fifth disc, created exclusively for the Blu-Ray, which feature additional outtakes from de Lauzirika's 2003 documentaries(from Renny Harlin's decision to quit \\"Alien 3\\" and more of Fincher's turmoil shooting the sequel), raw outtakes, dialies and more. Among the gems are Goldsmith talking about how he found the \\"Alien\\" characters \\"disgusting\\" and originally was rooting for the monster!<br /><br />All the discs are housed in a gorgeous, functional, small hardbound book with a guide to the disc contents and liner notes from Scott, who notes that the Anthology Blu-Ray serves a primer for PROMETHEUS, his own, upcoming return to the series \\"filled with Aliens, Space Jockeys and...something even more dangerous you haven't seen yet.\\" After watching this outstanding box-set, it's hard to imagine viewers won't be excited by returning to that universe all over again.
B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I have read the 50 Shades of Grey series and when I first read this book I thought that there were alot of similarities, but the more I read, I found that there were alot of differences too.  Yes, the main characters have alot of issues to get over, that is what makes the story interesting.  This is really not a BDSM book.  The sex scenes, while hot were not overly done. This book is definately about the story line.  You can see the attraction between the main characters and it gets you involved. If you liked 50 Shades of Grey, you will definately like this series.
1594744769|1.0|i can honestly say after 62 years on this planet,and reading at least a book a week this was the worst!!!!but then again if you want a story encompassing the holocast,teenage angst,wales,rappers,freaks,nazi submarines,shoot outs,groundhog day,and dreadful composition, then go ahead waste four or five days of your life!!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The actual purchase was great. Instant on my kindle on the iPhone.<br />I'm not through the book yet, it got a bit redundant. I guess I didn't realize it was an erotic novel. I just thought it was another series similar to twilight, or hunger games.
B00023B1LC|4.0|A handsome young man (Matt Damon) is pulled out of the Mediterranean Sea by a fishing boat, unconscious. The man who digs a couple of bullets out of his back finds something else beneath the skin of his bottom: a small capsule with a laser that displays the name of a Swiss bank and an account number. It was the flashing of another laser embedded in his wet suit that had alerted the crew of the fishing boat to his presence in the water.<br /><br />He does not know who he is. Thus begins one of the most amazing adventure and chase stories in 21st century films. Even for someone who read the book, it is thrilling. There are enough differences (although the sense of it is maintained) that even though I remembered the book pretty well, I didn't always know what was going on here. When Jason Bourne discovers his passport in the lock box which was connected to that bank account number, he discovers another half dozen, some with the name Bourne and some with at least one other name. The pictures are all of the face he has been seeing in the mirror. There is also a great deal of money in several currencies (the setting is apparently pre-Euro), a gun or two, and some communications devices.<br /><br />So is he a spy? For whom? He clearly has incredible fighting skill, as he discovers when a couple of Zurich police hassle him for sleeping in the park. And a trip to the U.S. Embassy makes it clear there's something very fishy about all of this. He escapes with his life, but only just, and bribes a young woman to give him a ride to Paris.<br /><br />The entire story is really one long chase, but the little red car zipping through all obstacles in Paris is probably the most amazing car chase scene I have ever seen in any movie. (Well, until the next film; I seem to remember there's a pretty amazing one there, too. Bourne tops Bourne?)<br /><br />I'm not going to spoil it for you, but I will warn you that you may have to play this one two or three times to follow everything; the pace is just that rapid and the tale that convoluted. Much high-tech spy equipment, much ado about plenty. I defy anyone to predict what's coming next if they have not read the book, and half of those will get it wrong.<br /><br />Four stars for the non-stop adrenalin rush.ace is just that rapid and the tale that convoluted.

0525425764|5.0|I have read a couple of these books and I like them. They are a bit different than the usual boy mysteries or detective stories. There is usually a lot of action and suspense in these books keeping even younger readers glued to the book.<br /><br />This time Theodore is trying to find out evidence for a big murder case and also find out what really happened when his friend was abudcted.<br /><br />If you have not read these books, then you should try this one.<br />It's great for tweens and teens, and why not also for adults.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I will not rehash the story line, as so many other people have already described it so very well, but I will say that I really enjoyed this book.  It was well written, the characters were well developed.  I was a little flumoxed at the end and as I do not want to spoil the plot or the story line, I will not tell you why but, lets just say it is impetuous.  Overall, I will give the story 4 stars and say that I would recommend the book to anyone looking for some heartfelt entertainment. I liked this story line enough that the possbility of further stories, maybe about Travis's brothers, would not be unwelcome.  Great story, recommended buy.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I have always loved this movie growing up and had it in VHS, DVD and finally now in Blu-Ray. The BD quality is excellent and far better than the regular DVD. If you are a fan then this is a Must-Have for your collection.
0345803485|1.0|Really wanted to enjoy reading this book but honestly, it was a real disappointment. Certain lines were repeated so often it was tantamount to beating your head over and over again with a stick. You knew when they were coming and all you wanted to do is duck! The sex was redundant as well. Nothing exciting here. You could pretty much anticipate what the next chapter was going to be about. It just seemed that it went on and on forever. Inner goddess, biting your lip, I don't get to touch him, why is he allowed to roll his eyes and I'm not, were written into every chapter. Will she submit or will she not went on for about 75% of the book. That's pretty much the whole story here.  Ugh! Just plain horrible. I refuse to read the others...my \\"inner goddess\\" is telling me it would be a real waste of my time.
159562015X|1.0|Maybe it is my fault (this book was a suggested read) and I did not know each book is supposed to come with an individual code/ID to go online for an online quiz...the book I purchased was missing this page..and it is the result of the website quiz which the book applies to...so, basically the book is now a worthless read.<br /><br />So, I guess it was my fault for not knowing each book has it's own unique registration number. now you know.
0439023513|1.0|This book was not what I thought it would be...I felt led on only to be disappointed with the ending. I don't understand how it all leads up to a great climatic point and then feel so rushed. I mean come on! I love a great book, but this was ridiculous. It took almost 150 pages for it to start getting good and once it did..I'm so ready for a finish I'm sure will be awesome and it's a complete let down. Do not waste your money on this book just get it from the library...better yet read the chapter summaries online...you'd be better off!!!
0345803493|1.0|Truly disappointed but mostly amazed by all the noise about this book!  Poorly written. Didnt provide anything new. Make me laught now when I hear women talking about the book.
0345803507|5.0|These books are in my top favorite of all time! Sexy, thrilling love story. A must Read! This is the final book and it definitely leaves you satisfied but also wanting more. Hope E.L. James gets started on a new book soon :)
B00112ASYO|5.0|Schleich toys are all so well made and durable. This crocodile is no exception-- it is incredibly detailed and beautifully made.<br /><br />The figure is sized perfectly for little toddler hands and the quality is superb. My little one has been playing with this for weeks and not a single scratch. There are so many great details on this-- very helpful in guiding children in disussions about animals and the different parts to identify (ears, eyes, nose, etc. are all detailed).<br /><br />Also-- the Schleich animals all stand solidly. No wobbles so little ones can play without frustration. Fantastic, educational, and very fun toy!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Rate: 4.5 Lots of dialogue during deposition, grand jury and court room prodeedings. Always a degree of doubt as to innocence of defendant and an unexpected twist in the end. Held my interest throughout. Really good book.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|OK, it didn't earn any Oscars, but this is a delightful movie.  The deeper message is delivered in a light-hearted tone, making it easier to swallow.  I watched the film with my teen-aged daughter, enabling us to discuss the timeless topic of remaining true to oneself rather than trying to impress one's peers in the pursuit of elusive popularity.<br /><br />Emma Stone really shines in this cute film.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|I'm usually all over blow 'em up alien sci fi.  But when I start looking for reasons to get up and walk around while the movie's playing, something's wrong. For Battleship, it was the complete lack of realism in how the Navy was portrayed. I'm retired Navy and from an accuracy perspective, this was junk. Here's why:<br /><br />Screw-ups like Alex Hopper would NOT be assigned as Tactical Action Officer (TAO) on an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. The level of responsibility is too great. (Aegis ships are breeding grounds for type A personalities.)<br /><br />CIWS does not make a 'wee wee' sound when it fires. When CIWS fires, IT SHAKES THE WHOLE SHIP. (And CIWS, as I recall, was being phased-out for the Rolling Airframe Missile system.)<br /><br />You can't light off seven boilers on a steam-propelled battleship and expect to be underway in less than two hours (by the movie's timeline)...not happening.<br /><br />There is NO (ZERO, ZIP, NADA, ZILCH) live 16-inch ammunition on the MO (USS Missouri) in Pearl Harbor. Maybe a couple of de-militarized and highly polished rounds for show purposes on the Quarterdeck, but that's it. (The Navy doesn't leave high-explosives just lying around...sorry...)<br /><br />Zodiac boats (Z boats) are not 'lifeboats'.<br /><br />The TAO and scope operator on watch in the Combat Information Center (CIC, aka 'Combat') would not be pulled away from their watch for a boat detail. Stupid.<br /><br />I know I'm nitpicking. And most of the time, I can overlook stuff like this if the story is engaging and it seems like the movie makers were at least trying. Not this one. The acting was fine and the cinematography was great. But Battleship is not only mindless from an entertainment perspective, it's mindless from a credibility perspective, as well. If you're going to make a movie named Battleship and center it on the Navy in Pearl Harbor (where I served for five years), you need to do your due diligence to understand the culture you're writing about. Disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Smoking Hot!!! I heard about this book from a friend and figured why not. I was not disappointed! Definitely x-rated. Tho whole time I am reading all I kept thinking about was the song \\"Whatta Man\\" by Salt N Pepa. I am looking forward to the next in this series. It is really impressive as I believe this is Mrs. James first novel. My only complaint is the repeating phrase \\" my inner goddess \\". *****5stars
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was another score for Baldacci.  I had been missing the Camel Club series but was glad that I read both of his recent books.  Well worth the reading!
0486282112|5.0|Everyone has heard of Frankenstein's monster... or at least the Hollywood version, with green skin, boxy head and bolts in his neck.<br /><br />But the original creature is quite different in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" which starts off rather slow but builds into a tragic, darkly hypnotic tale about tampering in God's domain, and the terrible consequences that come from it. Also: if you create a new creature out of dead body parts, don't disown him or he'll kill your family.<br /><br />During a trip across the Arctic, a ship picks up a starved, half-frozen man named Victor Frankenstein. As he recovers, Frankenstein tells them his life story -- especially about how he became fascinated with science, and developed a process to reanimate dead tissue. Eventually he constructs a new creature out of dead body parts, and brings him to life.<br /><br />But while the creature is intelligent and articulate, he's also hideously ugly. Horrified that he's not beautiful, Frankenstein flees... and has a nervous breakdown. Wimp.<br /><br />But months later, the murder of his little brother brings Victor back to his home, where he figures out that the creature was involved. And to his horror, the creature now wants a mate. But the loathing between them -- caused by Frankenstein's disgust and the creature's increasing bitterness -- leads to even more tragedy...<br /><br />\\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those rare novels that is almost beyond classification -- it's gothic horror, it's sci-fi, it's a tragedy about scientific ambition that goes where it shouldn't go. Mary Shelley was only eighteen years old when she began writing this book, but she interwove religion, science and a fiercely intelligent knowledge of human nature into it.<br /><br />Her writing is a bit stuffy at times (\\"All praises bestowed on her I received as made to a possession of my own\\"), but that's because it was written in the early 1800s. Despite this, Shelley's writing skills shine in the more horrific moments of the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work. Victor is actually a pretty horrible person -- while he's a tragic figure whose unnatural ambitions end up destroying his wife, brother and father, he's also incredibly cruel and callous to the creature because... he's ugly.<br /><br />The creature, on the other hand, instantly gets our sympathy. He's intelligent and childlike at first, but his ugliness causes everyone to immediately hate and fear him. When him becomes embittered and eventually murderous, you still feel sorry for him.<br /><br />Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" is one of those few, rare horror books -- it adds a little more of that scientific gothic atmosphere to a classic tale of horror, slime and sorrow.the story (\\"I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open; it breathed hard, and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs\\"), and she imbues it with a sense of painful, grimy suspense.<br /><br />But the complicated characters of Victor and the creature are what really make the story work.

B000ZINGIK|5.0|I enjoyed the Metal Opera series by Avantasia, but this trilogy is 100% great from top to bottom and beginning to end - there is no other album that I could do this with, and this is three albums of straight ahead metal opera, which is a misnomer in my opinion - this is a huge Concept Album, without any real opera elements in the vocals or the music - The Scarecrow is perfection through and through ... (to be continued on Angel of Babylon)
B007H7XJD4|2.0|Plenty of action, just not that great of a film. The sound level was inconsistent and the picture a bit too dark to make out certain scenes. Thumbs down.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|Amazing film.  I am not really an Emily Blunt fan, but she is great in the role of Victoria.  She makes her very strong and likable, but isn't afraid to make her annoying at times as is called for by the story. I cheered at some points, and cried out in dismay at other times (A good thing- it was suspenseful and engrossing).
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Solid white noise app, many sounds to choose from and well worth the price. You will not regret purchasing this app if you like being able to sleep soundly. Much cheaper than melatonin or buying a separate sound screen. I love how you can set it to turn off after a set period of time as well.
B007PS0X0W|1.0|The plot is extremely shallow which is fine for an action movie, but you get an hour in and you are wondering why they even made this crap movie.  Also, in every Underworld movie for something that is supposed to be more powerful than both vampire and lycans, Michael is always getting hurt/saved like a wuss (So annoying). Seriously, I had low expectations of this movie, and it sucks. I know he is your husband Kate Beckinsale, but tell him no already. Put a stake in the Underworld movies they are officially done.

B005LAIGPU|5.0|I know that that movie was not really shot in Seattle (but the shot of the space needle is a really nice touch).<br />I enjoyed this movie, I saw it in theaters and I loved the characters and though the storyline was pretty much predictable I still was highly entertained nevertheless.<br />This movie is a must own for any movie buff<br />5/5 stars!
0375428232|3.0|I give this book--Cracking the TOEFL iBT, 2008 Edition, by Douglas Pierce and Sean Kinsell, 3 stars here as someone familiar with the various tasks that the TOEFL iBT requires of its test-takers.  Having taught how to master this test to students for more than a year, I have gone through all of the available books and CDs on the market to see what works best.  The reality is that I cannot recommend any one book to cover everything.  Some are great at providing sample questions, or multiple practice tests, while others offer some good information that teaches how to answer certain questions.  No book covers everything, though, which means that students must take a regular course in addition to self-practice.  If you had to choose one book, though, this might do it because it has a fair amount of good instruction that can familiarize you with what you would see on test day.<br /><br />Specifically, let me mention a few items here that I think stand out in this book.  First, the organization of the book is good.  The introduction gives the basic facts that familiarize the reader with the test and some general information.  Then, it gets moving with a part called \\"Core Concepts,\\" which takes a look at some basics for each of the four sections.  Following that, we have Part III, \\"Cracking Each Section of the TOEFL,\\" which goes into basic principles and basic approaches and then unleashes the reader on practice drills.<br /><br />On thing that I can say is critical about this book's quality is that it mentions the \\"Process of Elimination (POE)\\" as a method to help increase your odds at choosing the best answer (page 13).  This is embedded into a smaller section on improving your score and increasing your odds on individual multiple-choice questions.  Rather than tell you to guess, this says that there is a logic and you can increase your odds on choosing the best answer by eliminating as many clearly wrong choices as you can.  With four answers choices, you have a 25 percent chance, which is low.  Eliminate one answer, and you have a 33 percent chance, and eliminate two, and your chance increases to 50 percent.  If you must guess this is the only way to do it, by eliminating something and improving your odds at success.  There is never an excuse to guess at random.<br /><br />The best aspect of this book is the explanation and focus on structure within the Speaking Section.  Students are typically scared of this section because they have to perform in a number of different tasks, within a short amount of time.  Added to that, concerns about accent or poor grammar, and students can freeze up without answering the questions.  In fact, while this section concerns many students as something subjective and difficult, it also has a series of rules to follow that make it easy.  First, students must take note of the scoring rubric, which outlines in objective terms the procedure for how graders evaluate each speaking task.  Did the student answer the question, speak employing reasonable grammar and adequate vocabulary, have connection words and phrases, not have long pauses, speak in English, and answer using a logical structure.  This book helps you answer the questions by using deliberate template that take you step-by-step.  For instance, page 324 lists a question and sample response for the personal preference question (Speaking Task #1).  The question is similar to what an ETS test might ask: If you had an entire month to do whatever you would like to do, what would it be?  Include details and examples to support your selection.\\" The response is set out into categories and placed in a table form.<br /><br /> State personal preference: If I had that much time, I would like to travel around the world.<br /> Reason #1: I would choose this because I am curious about other places in the world.<br /> Specific detail for reason #1: So far, I have visited four different countries, but there are many more I would like to visit.<br /> Reason #2:Another reason I would like to travel around the world is so I can meet many interesting people.<br /> Specific detail for reason #2: I enjoy meeting new people and I am especially interested in meeting people from different<br />  cultures.<br /> Reason #3: A final reason I would like to travel is because I plan to study international business.<br /> Specific detail for reason #3: I think that traveling around the world would help me in the field of international business.<br /><br />So, this is a good outlined answer to the question and would score high.  I like how this takes the reader through each step in a logical order and shows the simplicity of the structure.  Students who try to talk above their level or put in too many ideas often fail.  Keep things simple and giving a structure like this is a positive thing.  Moreover, the bolded words are there to show some keywords that give your sentences connections or direction.<br /><br />While this is a great tool for readers, it fails to take that extra step and teach students how to take these notes.  When preparation time is only 15 seconds, how can a test-taker think of those things AND write down all of those words?  It is, of course, virtually impossible.  So, this book should tell students that this template is a great way to structure your answers but if a reader tries to duplicate it, s/he will run out of time and score low because improvisation will lead to errors.  Notes should be taken in keyword form only, directing the test-taker to the larger thought.  You do not have time to write complete sentences in your notes but you do have the time to write down keywords that will drive your response.  One more trick that should be in this book is that you can prepare a list of connection and direction words/phrases in advance and write them down beforehand so you can simply reference those particular words, such as \\"moreover,\\" in \\"addition,\\" and \\"finally.\\"<br /><br />Overall, this book is nice for tackling the test one piece at a time.  For the 2008 edition, the sample questions for the reading are outdated (perhaps the 2011 book has revised this), but the real strength is the speaking templates.  These can help you organize your thoughts and show you just how easily you can score on the Speaking Section.  Though this book provides a lot of information, it falls short in providing a complete tutorial experience.  People trying to study for this at home will find it difficult because not only is the material hard to comprehend, but the TOEFL itself is not a normal test.  The TOEFL iBT is designed based on a set of rules and has specific procedures that you must follow to master it.  Each section tests a slightly different skill yet one common item is that it mimics the common academic structure used in the United States.  I did not realize how basic this structure was when I taught history at Boston-area universities, but when I understood how the TOEFL works, it struck me as obvious.  The Reading Section is deliberate in its structure, the Listening Section follows a logic of introducing the main topic or problem and then providing details, organized in expected ways.  Finally, the answers you create for the Speaking and Writing Sections must conform to that structure--introduction, supported by reasons  and details, and then perhaps a conclusion that restates your thesis/position.  Failing to conform to this structure will not bode well for your score. Good luck with your studies and check out my profile for more helpful advice.Another reason I would like to travel around the world is so I can meet many interesting people.<br /> Specific detail for reason #2: I enjoy meeting new people and I am especially interested in meeting people from different<br />  cultures.<br /> Reason #3: A final reason I would like to travel is because I plan to study international business.<br /> Specific detail for reason #3: I think that traveling around the world would help me in the field of international business.<br /><br />So, this is a good outlined answer to the question and would score high.  I like how this takes the reader through each step in a logical order and shows the simplicity of the structure.  Students who try to talk above their level or put in too many ideas often fail.  Keep things simple and giving a structure like this is a positive thing.  Moreover, the bolded words are there to show some keywords that give your sentences connections or direction.<br /><br />While this is a great tool for readers, it fails to take that extra step and teach students how to take these notes.  When preparation time is only 15 seconds, how can a test-taker think of those things AND write down all of those words?  It is, of course, virtually impossible.  So, this book should tell students that this template is a great way to structure your answers but if a reader tries to duplicate it, s/he will run out of time and score low because improvisation will lead to errors.  Notes should be taken in keyword form only, directing the test-taker to the larger thought.  You do not have time to write complete sentences in your notes but you do have the time to write down keywords that will drive your response.

B005LAIHPE|4.0|THE GOOD<br /><br />1. The battle sequences are fun, watching Navy ships strategize and duke it out with superior alien vessels.<br />2. The acting is pretty good.<br />3. The special effects and explosions.<br /><br />THE SILLY<br /><br />1. Some of the dialogue is clunky.<br />2. There are some issues with time, such as how quickly the aliens get to Earth (faster than light?), and how quickly the main character goes from drifter to naval officer.<br />3. Naval procedural issues, like sending key CIC staff out on boat detail, and making a World War 2 museum piece battleworthy in a few hours time.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATION<br /><br />If you're looking for a mindless, \\"war\\" movie with a good dose of explosions and naval battles pitting the Earth vs. aliens, AND if you can look past some of the silly stuff, then you'll probably have a good time watching this fun, popcorn flick.<br /><br />However, if you get hung up on some of the silly stuff, OR if you're expecting an Academy Award winning movie, then you might want to pass on this one, or at least wait until you can watch it as a rental.<br /><br />Dads with young sons will probably enjoy this movie.  I went and saw this with my 8-year-old son, and we both had a fun time.
0071624058|2.0|When preparing for the TOEFL iBT, there are many choices that you need to sift through.  Some of the key questions you will need to ask yourself include: What books do I buy; do I search for online courses, should I enroll in a course taught by a professional?  Not all books or courses are created equal and there can be a lot of variation in the material.  Some books have practice tests that are easier than what the ETS-designed test will actually have.  Such practice questions should be used to master the procedures and to gain confidence in taking the test.  The TOEFL iBT is a stressful exam and test-takers will need to remain focused, positive, and confident throughout the entire 4-hr test period.  That said, what I do in the courses that I teach is use my own materials combined with some practice tests from various other books, including the Longman book by Deborah Philips.  But, at the end of each section and as the capstone to my course, I give my students this official ETS test so they see exactly the kind of questions and format that they will see on test day.<br /><br />This is not a traditional book review because frankly there is no book--when you buy this ETS Official Guide to the TOEFL Test (Third Edition)--you receive a booklet and a CD-ROM for installation on the computer.  The CD-ROM program includes two full-length tests, which, as I said, are valuable tools to familiarize yourself with the actual difficulty level and format of the test.  The CD-ROM only has the practice tests, with the answer key, and sample answers for the speaking and writing tests, along with rater's comments.  In contrast, the book has some basic information about the TOEFL test, includes some very general tips that are more in line with improving your English, and some frequently asked questions.  Those sections are helpful but do little to teach--in fact, the rest of the book goes through each section with some explanations and practice questions but there is no explanation of how to learn the methods.  The authors give information but this does little, in my experience, to show students what they need to do to master the TOEFL.  For instance, here is a segment from the Listening Section describing Pragmatic Understanding Questions:<br /><br /> Pragmatic Understanding questions test understanding of certain features of spoken English that go beyond basic<br />  comprehension.  Generally speaking, these types of questions test how well you  understand the function of an utterance or<br />  the stance, or attitude, that the speaker expresses. . . . Some Pragmatic Understanding questions involve a replay of part of<br />  the listening passage in order to focus your attention on the relevant portion of the spoken text.  Two question types test<br />  pragmatic understanding: Understanding the Function of What Is Said questions and Understanding the Speaker's Attitude<br />  questions.\\" (page 132).<br /><br />While this makes sense to me as an instructor, it typically does little to help any of my students.  What does pragmatic mean?  What about utterances?  Thankfully, the book has some example questions that relate to this type (for instance, \\"What does the professor imply when he says this: (replay from audio)), but this too can leave students wondering about what they need to do to answer this.  In essence, this book tells you some explanation but treats this test as if it were a normal test where you reason our your answers--that is precisely why I do not use this book at all, but instead let the students take the practice tests following my detailed tutorials.  Instead, you need to follow rules and specific procedures and while this helps and serves a distinct purpose, you cannot just use this and hope to improve your score.  While important, this guide cannot stand alone and should be treated simply as a way to gain experience with actual test questions.f how to learn the methods.

B000F0UV0E|5.0|The first track on the CD is my favorite.  These two musicians put together some very good listening and foot tapping music.
B000E33W1C|4.0|This story is easier to grasp than it is to follow. But basically, a gang of jewel thieves double, triple and quad-triple cross each other, after twenty million dollars worth of jewels have been successfully lifted. It is not clear where the jewels are but not to worry. Kevin Kline eats every fish in the fish bowl as a form of torture to gain the missing information.<br /><br />The film is definitely a comedy but seriously acted. John Cleese, best known for \\"Monty Python\\" and especially the \\"Faulty Towers\\" series, is a serious barrister charged with getting the gang's leader off the hook. Until Jamie Lee Curtis' character enters, all seems to be going well. She wants the jewels for herself but needs to learn where there are. But wait, there is a witness. Watch out!<br /><br />And so it goes with plenty of serious laughs.<br /><br />Well worth seeing.

B007FH9GT2|4.0|There are a lot of reviews here, much to read or consider.<br />If you think that watching a new level of graphicly-bloody,-sexual violence  against women, or any victim in this sort of crime,- is part of a great movie, then skip this, because \\"its a SPOILER.\\"<br />After watching this movie I wish I saw a MUCH MORE CONCISE warning, any spoiler effect would have been greatly appreciated. I wish the warning said:<br />\\"This movie contains violent, bloody, life-threatening torturous rape. The scenes are at a level that will be shocking to most observers. (based on comments by those who did not read the book, and were asked if the movie was 'cool' or 'intense' or had parts that were disturbing, etc., etc.)<br />The screams alone are so difficult to hear. The most violent level of rape is enough to cause a physical revulsion not exactly common in R-rated movies to date.. I think I am not alone.  Gratuitous sex is a silly matter, after you see this horrid level of violence.<br />A warning of 'Rape and Murder\\" means little, after you must observe torture like this.<br />Also I would like to have been offered,<br />-\\"If you wish to SKIP this 'segment' of the movie, the actual minutes of this murderous-level of rape run From __?_(minute-time) To __?__Minute-time, should be avoided.<br />I am sorry, but I did not write down which minutes are the horrid minutes involved. I could not go back to look again. As it began, I turned the volume off, tried to not look, letting silent tape run, and waited for it to end, and waited, for the ACTUAL MOVIE to continue.<br />(This murder by rape easily 'could' result in a horribly, drawn-out death).<br />For once, I think a squealer is not a bad thing, not here.<br />I realize, that I am probably asking someone who is doubltless paid only to SELL THE MOVIE. That is not relevant to their 'title' or job description. The \\"R- Rating' is a watered-down rating here. This is alone in its own, NEW field of vile violence.<br />Angelina Jolie's incredible movie touched down on sex-crime violence, this one slams into it. I am pretty sure Dragon Tattoo, takes the 'gone way past what we need to see' {SICK PRIZE}.<br />The drawn-out scene takes viewers into the highly illegal sextrade level of cruelty, where MURDER BY RAPE is sold on dvd's, to sell to the few who want to see this, and the victim indeed does- die.<br />Is that what movie watchers expect or want? I think not.  I pray not.<br />I truly doubt any one signs on to see this crap, and recall, many have NOT read the book. Many read the hype and dont see this crap coming.<br />Maybe this type of torture is a 'common form of rape,'  but I have only heard of this level of violence.<br />Still the movie does a tremendous job of drawing out WHAT RAPE REALLY IS.  If anyone can allow themselves to recall the horror they 'get' to observe here. Yes, maybe, rape will be taken more seriously by the many sharp viewers, and someday the punishment will meet the horrors of such crime.<br />Stiil, I have a beyond-vivid imagination and know enough-without pictures, enactment. The whole drawn out rage and destruction enforced against a female, or any victim of violent sex crime. The victim is instantly an obvious survivor, from the start of the movie.  We know something really bad has happened to her. We care deeply for her, its immediate. But, this drawn-out nauseating offense is just not integral to the movie. Maybe the younger crowd will show their bravery by discussing it. That is what may be 'hip.'<br />But I hope all viewers are sickened and horrified, as we are humans, we have too much humanity to want to sit thru this. Its not an thrill ride for me. Its far beyond, and below, horrid.<br />50 million copies sold, in 48 countries.  How many loved reading it? Most, and I think I would.  How many looked forward to SEEING that scene?  Maybe some, in small doses.<br />I wonder how many wanted this sent to be SEEN,  by unknown viewers, all over the world?  - For ALL ages to'stumble into.' - We know that Ratings dont protect young people.  We do, or we try to.  We dont succeed always.<br />Our votes for what is ok to include, still can be spoken out,-for, or against. Freedom (artistic, like this) can hurt our young people, and the rest of us too. Its a big world, many opionions. And many want to prove they are open to 'anything on screen.' I just might be the one who is not /hip/.'stumble into.' - We know that Ratings dont protect young people.  We do, or we try to.

0345803485|1.0|For those of you who are not in the know, FSOG started as a Twilight fan faction. Same characters, different plot. James got lots of complaints about her fiction, so she had to move it to its own site. Then...she decided to re-publish it and change the characters names.<br /><br />You might be expecting a Twilight now. Well, I can assure you that Gray's plot acrually has little in common with the plot of Twilight. I am not much of a fan of Twilight, but it beats Gray hands down in every aspect. James has traded the supernatural element for porn.<br /><br />The porn is really annoying, actually. It is not at all amusing how many of the fangirls pretend that it is not. And badly written at that! Now, I know sex can be a theme in stories, but JHames has chosen to substitute character for looks.<br /><br />Possible the worst thing outside of the porn element about thsi book would be the whole rich guy againts poor guy thing. Rich guy wins, of course. Could we ever expect anything else from a shallow series like this?<br /><br />It is saddening to see how many people like this book. I am actually starting to think that there are a bunch of fangirls making several five star reviews so as to counter the one star reviews.
0321543726|5.0|This is an excellent book and highly recommended for the student programmer. For such a huge book it is one you will probably read from cover to cover.
0739366408|5.0|I wasn't paying attention and ordered the audio book instead of the book.  It worked out for the better because of the way it is performed.  Made it very entertaining.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|If you like gruesome slasher flicks with endless violence and gore then DEVIL is not for you.  To me, if a film can create goose-bumping terror that stimulates the qsyche instead of graphic visuals, it has achieved true horror status; after all, it's our own minds where fear is manifested and compounded--cerebral over physical.  And when a person is terrified, and is in mortal peril and danger, it's the imagination that feeds this terror until all rational thought is exhausted and reptilian survival instincts take over.  Such is the case when five strangers are trapped in an elevator with an unseen (mostly) demonic force, while two security guards and a couple of police detectives are helpless bystanders watching terror conquer via a security camera.  It's a fantastic device, and works amazingly well in DEVIL; not to mention the story, acting, visuals, and pacing are all orchestrated to facilitate terror to the max in this very finely crafted movie.<br /><br />I knew next to nothing about the cast in DEVIL, yet they all deliver exceptional roles, from Chris Messina as a detective plagued by a tragic past, to Logan Marshall-Green as one of the victims with a dark past of his own, to Bojana Novakovic as a frightened young woman with some dysfunctional skeletons in her closet, too.  And only one word can be used to describe Jenny O'Hara's performance:  disturbing.  No, DEVIL does not have relentless, gratuitous violence and gore, nor disfigured, killing-machine monsters; what it does have is cerebral terror that begins early and escalates to powerful dimensions that mesmerize.  This is one very good horror movie.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
0345803485|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  The ending left alot to be desired.  Although, it makes you want to continue with the series, which, I suppose was the point of the bad ending.
B007Z9RAX4|1.0|The best scenes were shown in the trailer.<br />For a movie with some big name actors, the cinematography and dialogue made the movie awful.<br />Often times, it felt like the movie was low budget and just used one camera and shot from one angle way too long.<br />A decision was made to shoot the fight scenes from a distance. Why? So we can see the sunset on the beach?<br /><br />Too bad - it could have been better.<br />I wished Gina's character was as smooth as Matt Damon's character in the Bourne Identity series.<br />Her fight scenes were outstanding.

B005ZUR724|5.0|Great learning curve, good if you come from consoles, not too demanding. If you want to dip your feet into an online rpg then this is it.
0345803485|5.0|The author, E L James is clearly an ardent believer in the central lesson of The Little Prince.  This trilogy is a modern day, very sensual version of that process.  It is the saga of two strong-willed, but flawed, lovers from opposite poles who gradually discover the courage of surrender to the emotional, spiritual, psychological and physical aspects of taming and being tamed.  High risk.  High reward.  A delight!

B0036EH3U2|4.0|I really took to this series. This was especially true since I did not have TV access when it was on.<br /><br />BSG is my favorite TV SciFi .<br /><br />But, there are too many ?unnecessary?  \\"extras\\" in this set. Leave out the extended versions and cut the number of disks. Leave out the commentary, that drives me nuts when I am starting a new episode, and though I did NOT select to hear it, it comes on. But not on all disks!<br /><br />When viewing the \\"setup\\" procedure, commentary is NOT selected by ME. I must be the Cylons!<br /><br />What \\"ruined\\" the BluRay version for me, having seen the DVD, was \\"The Plan.\\" It revealed many of the \\"secrets\\" about humans and Cylons that you had to wait and anticipate by watching the entire series. Now the miniseries did some of that but it wasn't as detailed as \\"The Plan.\\" And, I watched the miniseries after viewing the entire series, though they recommended that one watch it first.<br /><br />Do I regret buying it? There have been just three series that I rewatch each year. Sometimes two or three times every few months!  This is my absolute favorite.<br /><br />Not at all. The performances were stellar. I cannot imaging anyone else playing the role of Adama and Starbuck. [What a refreshing idea for her part!] And then there was Caprica 6 [Tricia Helfer] Thought my TV was going to melt!<br /><br />Nough said!<br /><br />The sets, the CGI and the live action were incredible. Can you imagine building that immense \\"hall\\" on Galactica to scale!!!<br /><br />All in all it was about being human and the differences with peoples' cultures and racial conflict. What is a human? What is humanity? Who were the real aliens? Who were the true aggressors? How much space and junk do we need? If you want to know, just look around you with open eyes and mind.<br /><br />The four stars label is for the disk problems,  etc. The actual series is worth more!<br /><br />Great production!!!!

B007MJ9LA2|2.0|As a fan of Carlos, Devadip, and of the Band Santana for the past fourty years, I have heard all the good, the bad and the masterful compositions of one of my musical CHAMPIONs and HERO! I was so looking forward to hearing this new release, becuase for the last 5 years Carlos has been trapped in a Clive Davis Blackhole of desparity. Carlos, you once said that if your music end up sounding like elevator music, you would call it a career. Where has your FIRE,SOUL and Passion gone. You playing is so predictable with the same Riffs, licks and tone in each of your compositions. You were pulling melodies from some of your old compositions, and even an old spanish song 'POR AMOR' Really?I hate to write such a harsh review, but you are better than that,your real musical fan deserve better. Get off your Mountain top and come down to earth amongst the living. Si Se Puede! Si Se Puede! Si Se Puede! Santana Fans if you truly want to get this new release for your archives do so, for you new fans, there is no 'Supernatural' pop stuff this time around. Carlos if you have not heard Jeff Beck's Emotion in Commotion, you need to to see what it means to fly without a net!!!!!!

B005LAIGPU|1.0|hate hand held type recorded movies. that just ruins any chance of a good movie.<br />first half was just showing peoples faces. really!<br />last part was ok.
1840220554|5.0|I love Jane Austen. But this edition is full of spelling and text errors. Words that run together. Context that was not checked. These are annoying. The editor clearly didn't do his or her job. I was very disappointed.
B0002ADY1A|5.0|Not much to add to the other reviews except why no mention of the japanese language used.  The sound is fantastic and everything is printed in english.  Then when you rip or play the cd everything is in japanese on the computer from the release title to the song names.  Consequently my computer will not recognize it as Uriah Heep so it gets it's own special place as an unknown cd.
B00005AXEL|5.0|So many good songs. So soulful. It's probably her best album except it would need Rhiannon, Annabel Lee, & Nightbird on it to make it even better.  My favs are It's Only Love, I Miss You, Every Day, and Candlebright.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: Book 1 is a perfect beach read.  Several others thought so, too.  While on vacation recently, enjoying the beach, I got up from my lounge chair to walk over to the pool.  This was a distance of about 10 lounge chairs.  Along the way, I counted 4 paperback copies of Fifty Shades of Grey!  There may have been more, but it's hard to know what people are reading on their electronic devices.  My sister was reading it on her Kindle but I didn't know it for two days! What discussions we had after that!  This book is sexy, steamy, kinky, may things at once.  I even found myself thinking about my boyfriend and what I oould do to improve our relationship (not just in THAT way, of course.)  A great read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the word. The word is awesome. I love the word. The word is nothing but the truth. The word is Gods word
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This book is a sexed up version of Mills & Boons only a lot more manipulative.  The writing is very poor and repetitive.  I found myself going blah, blah, blah and skim reading which is a shame.  In terms of plot it works.  You really want to know what happens next and in that sense it is a success but please...why does the main protagonist have to be a nubile 21 year old just out of college and a virgin to boot and wait for it...the object of her affection is a 30 year old billionaire who is a control freak with a sad and tragic past.  I accept that ideas and themes get recycled but this was unbelievable.  I cannot see how a  virgin can go from hardly kissing anyone to full on S&M sex.  However, even if that was the case, what I found disappointing was not a woman entering a sexual journey of discovery but the same old rhetoric of a woman trying to change a man through 'love'.  It feeds into that namby pamby idealised romantic turd inducing stuff that is pedaled year in, year out.<br /><br />As I said earlier the plot works, I wanted to know what happens next but the ending of this book was manipulative to the extreme.  It cuts abruptly with the promise to reveal all in the next book.  Now don't get me wrong serials and cliff hanger endings have been around since Dickens started penning novels but this ending drops off through the middle of a scene.  I found this was rude and it is for this reason that I refused to buy the second book, or third for that matter.  I'm glad I resisted as apparently the next two books descend into the tired old 'will he, won't he change' and almost all traces of kinkiness are removed.<br /><br />I would not recommend this book.  The bookshops and online stores are full of fantastic, well written books and stories that care for the reader.  Life is too short to read Fifty Shades of Cliches...I mean Fifty Shades of Grey.

B007Q2N0HA|5.0|This is an amazing story about two lost souls, that are completely broken. They are so emotionally screwed up that it hurts, and i freaking LOVE them!<br />This book is being compared to Fifty,and i love Fifty, BUT this book OWNS it's self.<br />Cant not wait for the next one!
0345803485|1.0|After reading this I will continue with my Zane books...erotica is much more exciting in Zane than this preschooler series. When a library refuses to stock this book due to being \\"too erotic\\" you can pretty much guess its...NOT!!!
B0042RJWTC|3.0|I purchased this amazing television series for a friend who I knew would enjoy as much as I had.  Unfortunately two of the DVDs that the seller sent were unable to play and my friend missed many episodes including the finale.  Very disappointed with the seller.
B005LAIGPA|1.0|Dumb premise of some sinkhole easily accessible to anyone which just happens to have a mysterious colored light and large fake plastic quartz like gem that gives superman like powers to whomever is exposed. Cheap storyline. Lots of bad acting and equally bad hand held camera bouncing around as a first person journaling of the transformation of three teens as they discover how power enhances whatever mental state they started with. Good, bad or indifferent. A heavy reliance on 37 songs and CGI to keep from falling asleep.<br /><br />The science and intelligence shown could only have come from writers who flunked their middle school science courses. Won't even try to bring up high school anything.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|I read the first book of this extravaganza with my book club, and haven't quit! Not much of a fantasy reader in general, but these books have really grabbed my attention and I will be waiting for Six and Seven to wrap up the many loose ends/characters!  I especially appreciate how the author has continued to surprise me with the many plot twists and turns, and how my feelings about specific characters have changed from Book One to Book Five - I'm now rooting for people I dispised.  As all of these books are such tomes, it is something of a relief to take a break and read something else, work in my gardens, etc.
B004JMRDQE|4.0|The video itself was terrific.  It was a movie a saw years ago and had been in search of for a while.  I decided to just get it through Amazon and quit my searching.  It is different with a Thai and English version, especially coming from Canada where everything is French and English.  But everything was just fine.
B007AMMHSY|4.0|The movie is very interesting, different from the Almodovar style but with the same talent behind the camera and the same talent for the crew and actors.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|It's about time they did a sequel to Tron. There are things about both movies I love. I love the graphics of Legacy, but the de-rezzing of the original. There is a rather interesting story to each. Each is a product of the times. I think if one were to think how one would do a follow up to the original Tron, one would at least take some of the basics from Legacy. Kevin would have re-booted the Grid. He would have created a Clu type character. The system would have ended up pretty close to what we see in the movie.  The ISOs? Sure, why not? Every system has its anomoly or anomolies. Would the Codified Likeness Utility ended up how it did? Sure, why not? It would be a mirror of its creator at the time of its creation. I like the choices for each of the characters. I think this keeps in the spirit of the original as well as creating a new mythos for the Tron universe. As to the ending...if there is a sequel to this, I could come up with a handful of reasons either way why Flynn could survive or not. I mean, really, the greatest code writer of that universes decade creates a digital frontier and doesn't create a fail-safe for if/when something goes wrong? As someone who at least comprehends the extreme basics of code writing (at least from roughly the same time), one would always have a backup. Kevin Flynn, at least in theory, could have survived. Whether or not he did, that would remain to be seen. Great movie. Great concept. Hope to see part 3.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|no one seems to have bothered writing up any kind of review of owning the DVD so here it goes.<br /><br />the DVD case is strong and sturdy, and the DVD front cover shows Diana Ross as you can see in the photos, and in the back shows a little bit of the concert, I've already uploaded photos of the back, inside with DVD and insert, and without the DVD and insert. the DVD cover case art is dual sided, where on the inside you see a group shot of several thousand fans in central park.<br /><br />its really a great cover.<br /><br />now I've already seen the rain shortened concert. there's a nice opening scene in the beginning of new York's central park and the busy streets of NYC, than we're brought into teens doing a sort of African dance and than comes miss Diana Ross.<br /><br />the shortened version is the entire shortened concert in full, and ends with Diana Ross asking the fans to please leave slowly and safely. by this point the rain is coming down in buckets. so much rain is seen falling its amazing she lasted that long.<br /><br />in the full version of the concert where I've already seen the first 15min pretty much recaps the original, previous night and throws in news commentators of that nite talking about all the people who went, the storm coming and how Diana Ross promised to be back the next night. some newspaper clippings and actual of the evening news are shown in the recap where it than leads to Diana Ross running out of her trailer to the stage as the cameraman follows her.<br /><br />i would totally recommend buying this DVD, as it is a part of NYC history. I'm surprised at how well the tape was kept in great condition for the transfer they used. i don't know for sure if this was at all remastered, or if it was in digital format, but it looks great after all these years. please pick this up.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B007OAAK0O Diana Ross:Live in Central Park]]
0345803485|2.0|I have read this book and the second one in the trilogy and am not sure if I can stomach reading the third book. Pure Smut. I could only take so much of the main two characters making love/(f....ing). Ana is always biting her lip. Christian is always telling her to eat and telling her to stop biting her lip. She is a naive woman with low self esteem. He is a controlling jealous possessive man with deviant sexual desires. I am sure if my horny 15 year old self was reading this book, I would enjoy it very much in my bed with one hand on the book and the other one masturbating. Since I am 33 now and my taste in literature has evolved, I would like to say, don't waste your time and money unless you are a glutton for punishment.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book, loved the series. If you're looking for an escape and want to read something that is obviously fiction, go ahead.  If you're more concerned over \\"proper\\" writing and are looking for some literary masterpiece, then read something else.  It's meant to fun and exciting.  Maybe the author isn't the greatest writer in the world but if we're entertained by the story, then isn't that the point?  A lot of these negative reviews are just to flat out insult those who actually liked the book. If you didn't like the book, fine, that's you.  But just because I did doesn't make me a lonely housewife, an idiot, or anything else.  It just makes me someone who, like many others, enjoyed reading a fictional love story.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read - I was laughing the whole way through (which neither my husband or the folks on the bus appreciated). Just like on 30 Rock, Tina Fey has a witty sense of humour that will leave you loving her even more!
0062183591|5.0|Dan Ariely is a behavioral economist and author of 2 previous books popularizing the field, [[ASIN:0061353248 Predictably Irrational, Revised and Expanded Edition: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions]] and [[ASIN:B003JBHVZY The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic at Work and at Home (P.S.)]].  He is a skilled communicator, translating academic experiments into tangible stores that deliver keen insight into how and why we do what we do.<br /><br />Ariely best summarizes this book when he writes on the last page \\"there are rational forces that we think drive our dishonest behavior - but don't. And there are irrational forces that we think don't drive our dishonest behavior - but do.\\"  Indeed, we learn that everyone lies a little all the time.  This is not, of course, shocking.  What is surprising, is that we are lie even when we think we are being honest.  Our default seems to be just a little bit of dishonesty, which lets us push boundaries, hype our resumes, and feel better about ourselves.  However, circumstances can influence to go into deeper levels of dishonesty, or push us into higher levels of truthfulness.<br /><br />In this entertaining romp, Ariely takes us through a journey that is simultaneously entertaining and educating. The latter purpose is important because one of Ariely's themes is that by understanding these irrational forces, we won't conquer and become Mr. Spok-like, but rather we can harness them and modify our behavior (and others) for the better.<br /><br />Ariely discusses both his own research and that of others in the field of behavioral economics.  His facility in translating academic writing into a common vernacular with a liberal scattering of humor enliven this book.  For example, in what other book will you see side comments like \\"though I have discovered that students don't like to be told that they are not real people\\" and to call \\"PhD students (a slightly different sort of prisoner).\\"<br /><br />All is not completely serious.  Ariely explains research into a phenomenon well known in the professorial world.  That of the sudden death of grandparents around test time.  Well, sure enough a study of these grandchild reporting the deaths of their forebears, and the researchers found that grandmothers are 10 times more likely to die before a midterm, and 19 times more likely before a final. This number increases to 50 times more likely for students who are failing.  Ariely then launches into an explanation of this phenomenon that elicited from me howls of laughter.All is not completely serious.

0743455967|1.0|As you can see on my 1 star, I truly do not see the hype about this book.<br />I have read a lot of books on the craft of writing and often this work was mentioned, so I thought I gave it a try. I have to say the title is misleading, and the work is a failed attempt to be both a biography and a book on writing. Sorry to say, but I do not think his life is worth a biography, so I really wanted it for tips on the craft. As other reviews have pointed out, true, there are some interesting thoughts on writing in this book, which is reason enough to read it - even though you might already have many books on the craft. We can always learn more and there are some nuggets here<br />* King writes his first draft with the door closed to boost creativity (the second one with the door open to get suggestions) and<br />* King envisions an ideal reader (for the second and later drafts) when writing the story, thus bypassing the need to please all the readers.<br />That's all, folks. Sad but true. The rest of the tips on writing were all clich&eacute;s, intertwined with his biography. I hoped for more advice on writing, and what I got was statements like: work hard, the magic will come later, or not. And more 'tips' that we have all read dozens of times elsewhere: show versus tell (which he gets even wrong, claiming it is always better to show - it is not if you want to speed up your story). Others are: 1) do not use expressions like \\"he said, enthusiastically\\", 2) you have to read a lot, 3) writing classes are ok but, et cetera.  One thing irritated me especially though; King himself is unforgiving on these basic writing mistakes (he uses the f-word to stress this - telling the reader something he cannot express otherwise apparently), like putting background story to the foreground and what do we get? Page after page lamenting his near death story after he got hit by a hillbilly in 1999, which had nothing to do with the writing at all, and which I simply did not find interesting.<br /><br />With a title On Writing, what I expected was a book that would show the craft and maybe my expectations were wrong.<br />If you want books on writing, read all the Readers Digest series on Writing that you can find. They are concise, they specialize on one topic per book (characters, setting, dialogue etc) and are full of examples on how to, and how not to. Indispensable, unlike King's book.<br />If you want a biography that is truly about a life of books and writing (and beautiful remarks about the craft), read the magnificent knockout \\"The Words\\" (Les Mots) from Jean Paul Sartre, which won him the Nobel Prize (which he refused of course). It was for a reason that Hemingway called him the general.br />With a title On Writing, what I expected was a book that would show the craft and maybe my expectations were wrong.<br />If you want books on writing, read all the Readers Digest series on Writing that you can find.

B007B8EX9I|2.0|What a disappointment in comparison with the truly deliciously immoral connivings of season one! It is as if everyone has been brushed by TV goody-goody dust. O'Brien, Thomas, Edith, Mary....all rendered sweet and sympathetic. The only villains are characters that enter and exit from the periphery, never shaking the moral high ground of the central cast of the high born and servant classes. And I get that the Great War is supposed to be viewed as the Great Equalizer, but the level of intimacy  between the servants and the Earl of Grantham's family is SO unrealistic for the period (although slightly later, just look to Julian Fellowes' own Gosford Park for verification). No one is truly concerned for anyone's reputation, everyone expresses the right contemporary moral sentiments...Even the upright grande dame of Lady Violet stumbles upon the scullery maid  in a state of distress and chooses to use the opportunity to tenderly feed her motherly advice. Yeah, sure, that would happen.<br /><br />The writing is just downright lazy! There are so many instances of facile exchanges that tie off loose ends with absolutely no faithfulness to authentic character development. It is like a TV movie of the week! I think my \\"favorite\\" one was when the Earl says to his wife \\"do you think there could be something I have overlooked about this whole affair\\" in relation to his daughter's betrothal to the evil Richard, it creates an opening for exposing the GREAT SECRET that no one could avoid, and his wife obligingly spills all.<br /><br />I wouldn't be so negative if this had been the first season, but my hopes were elevated from the excellent start of season one. But clearly Fellowes must be given credit for knowing what his audience wants (or at least the American version) as the comments here and at IMDB are uniformly positive. I just wish he could have pulled it all off with a bit more integrity. What is so grinding is that we've got so much evidence from his other work that he knows how to do it; he just clearly chose not to.
0307279189|4.0|I found this book to be both interesting and inspirational.  My only qualm is that the authors stories seem to be embellished. Often times he is describing the event as if he were there when it is obvious he wasn't.  Once it is understood the author exaggerates his stories the book is much better.  The sections regarding the shoe industry, training, and diet were interesting and I was wishing those subjects had been expanded on.
0345803485|5.0|I hate reading. I'm still cross-eyed from the college years of reading, studying and writing.  Having said that, my girlfriends insisted this was a good read. When I find something I like I throw myself in, fully.  I found this book to be so unbelievably addicting.  I simply could not put it down.  I found both characters relatable.  Perhaps you have to have a sliver of a dark side to fully appreciate these characters.  While I agree some of the writing was repetitive it didn't take away from the underlying story.  I don't think most people realize how rifely BDSM is in what society perceives as \\"normal people\\".  You simply never know.  There's a lot of judging Christian Grey, but in reality, if you read with an open mind, Ana ultimately has control.  It's necessary to read past the dark side of his so-called childhood issues.  (we never really know in book one)  It's a must read if you enjoy erotica.  I'm chomping at the bit (no pun intended) to start book #2.

B004GUSG4M|3.0|I found the story intriguing; like \\"Fifty First Dates\\" but with a sinister mysterious twist. I was disappointed by the saturation of f-word usage, and sexual descriptions which were unnecessary to the great plot.
030746363X|4.0|....and yet another book on dieting....yep!  I must say, the one good thing about this diet (and I think I've tried most of them) is that the dieter actually gets to eat real food and does not go throughout the day hungry.  Also, the diet does really seem to ween you away from sugar and processed foods, which is another good thing.  However, the diet itself is very slow in causing any actual weight loss and I think this is because this diet, which is only part of the book, was written by a man FOR a man.  The author does present some interesting data and I would recommend the book.
B000I9S64U|4.0|The movie is excellent, contains interesting action, locations, graphics, animation and story-line, even for a Sci-fi effort. So many things are intertwined that you sometimes forget what is going on in the \\"real world\\" outside and that is what a movie is supposed to do - entertain us. A very exilarating movie.
1582701709|4.0|This book has been a great reminder of lots of things I already knew. It has allowed me to start implementing them into my daily life. I have been using this to re train my mind to concentrate on positive thinking throughout the day. The success stories from some of the Contributors has been enlightening for me. The exercises with constant affirmations has already drastically changed my outlook on life, and to really focus in on what I really want. If you can swallow some of the cheesiness of how the author writes this, it really has some serious value. I do, however, wish that it did not refer to the video so much. At times I felt like the book was kind of used as a trailer for the video to purchase. It is definitely a life changer if you allow it to be, and it is pretty amazing that the further I get into the practice of \\"The Secret\\" How many other people that I am surrounded by with success stories all the sudden start revealing that they to have been using this for some time.

Good men and bad, heroes and villains, men of honor, liars, cravens, brutes...we have plenty, as do you.\\"<br /><br />The scope of Martin's world increases. The breadth of his characters grows by magnitudes. And the epic expands ever outwards.<br /><br />This book concludes little and alludes to a lot. It's not as fulfilling in and of itself, but \\"Dance\\" propels Martin's worlds forward in large leaps.<br /><br />Tyrion is back, and he was sorely missed in \\"Feast for Crows\\". Jon Snow's character evolves to put on a display of strength touched on in previous books but solidified in this tome. Like his previous novels, each chapter comes from the perspective of a different character. While some we know, Martin has the audacity to introduce even more characters to his historic rainbow of interconnected plots.<br /><br />\\"Dance\\" is as big and bold as the preceding novels. It's dark, heavy, and written with a lusciously lavish hand - like its four predecessors. I can't understand what readers don't like about this one short of the fact that it doesn't bring the stories to an end. But that's the fun, right?
0345803485|4.0|Time to put this 1 star vs. 5 star controversy to rest-- a review by a very well read bibliophile.<br /><br />Okay, so here is the deal.  Yes the books are pretty poorly written. No need to relay the litany of repetitive phrases and words that every other reviewer has already hashed out ad nauseum. But with that said-- why are they so popular? Why could a high brow classics nerd like myself not put them down in SPITE of this?  I've put some thought into the subject and here is what I came up with:<br /><br />There was only one other series of books I have experienced that had the same elementary writing style and yet inexplicable addictive appeal-- Twilight. No surprise then that this series was started by a Twi-hard who admittedly said, \\"Hmmm I can write this exact same story-- but for adults-- and without that whole abstinence problem.\\" There was no disguising the blatant \\"borrowing\\" that occurs here; man who feels he is a monster with a heart of gold, finds woman who teaches him to love -her and himself. Both series ran around 1800 pages-- both I read ravenously (Twilight in 1 week, and 50 in about 2). This seemed to be the pervading pacing for ALL the women I talked to then and now.  For each series nearly EVERYONE I mentioned the books to replied with an enthusiastic \\"Yes! I am reading that right now too! Finished the first one in 24 hours!\\"<br /><br />So what is the through line here-- how can books where everyone \\"rolls their eyes\\" at the clunky rudimentary style be spellbinding? Simple. They do something new-- something that literature has never dared to do before-- something we weak with bated breath lit nerds never dared even hope could happen; THEY GIVE US EXACTLY EVERYTHING THAT WE WANT.<br /><br />Most books make you WORK for it. WAIT for it. STRUGGLE through countless misunderstandings and stubborn heroes and heroines for it. Work for the moments when your characters overcome their adversity and achieve those few blessed moments of peace and clarity when they finally do and say what they've been holding back for hundreds of pages--  Twilight and 50 Shades don't suffer from this particular literary requirement-- instead they give the reader exactly what she wants, from all characters at ALL times. It is Instant Gratification Literature. The new cyber age of I-Want-Everything-Right-Now has finally invaded the World of Literature. It is a completely new and unique experience for readers. When presented with a misunderstanding or a secret or a challenge, the characters never fail to reward the reader by saying and doing exactly what you wish they would. It's like an entire book made up of what would normally be just your favorite chapters in any other book.<br /><br />So how can this be interesting? In a way, it's sort of devoid of drama. The style is like a dark romantic fantasy not a book. The conflict is somewhat secondary and not really driving the plot-- a novel idea, I know. So what IS driving the plot? Very intriguing characters, a desire to know what happens to them, and circumstances-- an very interesting premise for a story that leaves the reader wondering how they characters will live within and navigate out of it's seemly impossible constraints.<br /><br />So with all that said, HOW can I possibly rate this poorly written, drama-less book as 4 stars?  Because it entertained me. I was involved and entertained and unable to put it down for 2 weeks. What more are we asking of a story? Just like movies, there are ones that make you think, ones that explore the art form, and ones that just show you pretty people with lots of cars on fire. But really, why be snobby about it. They are all valid ways to spend $10, depending on your mood. and so was this. 50 Shades was exactly what it purported to be-- an addictive, though humbly authored, wildly entertaining book. Don't ask it to be Austen and you'll like it just fine.<br /><br />**A Post Script on one bit I did find particularly entertaining-- The emails. Whiledescriptive passages are not her forte, the email repartee was fantastic- witty, natural, and sharp. One thing worthy of props.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am stunned by all the reviews that are less than 4 stars.  This is absolutely one of the best books I've ever read.  It's more than a sex book. It is a terrific love story betweeen two people who are total opposites that bring out the best in each other.<br /><br />It's a must read.  If you are on the fence about reading it because of some of the bad reviews, don't be.  I, too, wasn't going to read it and I am so happy I did.  I am actually going to reread the whole series again.  I can't get enough of Christian and Ana!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Midnight In Paris is really fun!  While it might not get raves from that portion of the public unfamiliar with the smallest bit of 20th Century history and literature, this film is a real treat for the rest of us.<br />In this story the main character, while engaged to one woman but suddenly lusting after another, gets caught up in a time-travel loop where he keeps returning to scenes of much earlier life in Paris.  There he<br />runs into many of the old Paris inhabitants--Hemingway, Dali, Josephine Baker, Alice B.Toklas, etc., with hilarious results.<br /><br />Midnight In Paris is a seemingly small movie with a big reservoir of romance and chuckles just beneath the surface, and herein lies the completeness of it's charm.  Thank you, Woody.  You've done it again.
B002L4QP0M|5.0|Another excellent book by Jeffrey Archer! The plot is clear and fast moving making it difficult to put the book down. The twists and turns in the plot also made for<br />wanting to turn the next page and ignoring all those pesky chores that pile up.<br />Very good read.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|Won't go into detail about how unrealistic this movie is (read some of the other one-star reviews).  Horrible!  A movie for stupid people. One of the worst movies I've ever seen.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|War Horse is a well written, scored, shot, edited and directed film.  Character casting and horse footage are wonderful.  One doesn't have to be an avid horse lover to be drawn in by this<br />affecting production.  It is a film story expertly told, aided and abetted to good effect by the latest cinematic technical tools available.  The WWI battle scenes are especially involving and exciting.<br /><br />If any faults are to be found it would be in the seemingly overlong beginning sequences, where the bond between boy and horse are established.  While certainly necessary for story development,<br />the forward motion of the film temporarily bogs down here a bit.  Additionally, I feel that the film closes perhaps three or four times, where one time would have been more effective.  It is for these<br />reasons that War Horse has lost it's fourth star in my evaluation.<br /><br />Even so, this is definitely a well crafted film, enjoyable and certainly worth experiencing.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I find the time line in this novel more than a little confusing. It was difficult<br />to judge if I was reading what was happening in the present, or something<br />in the near past.Also, the jumping around between the countries,  are they living in Luxumberg or Paris today?<br />The scenic descriptions were very detailed, however at times I thought they were a little too much and detracted from the plot of the story. Lots of twists and turns<br />in the plot, kept me guessing.
1439153663|2.0|I must agree wholeheartedly with \\"Autumn's\\" review. I wont reiterate as she has managed to encapsulate my feelings on this book entirely. I am an avid reader of quality books, and this book disappoints. Lavinia's character starts off strongly enough and then as she matures seems to dissolve into a hapless addled mess totally at the mercy of fate, which is hard to swallow given the lively introduction of her younger character. The end of the book is...missing. It's as if the author got tired of her weak Irish heroine and simply gave up 85% of the way through. In short, the second part of the novel is just not very believable, and I rushed through, waiting for redemption and finding none. It doesn't hold a candle to Kathryn Stockett's totally plausible \\"The Help\\", and pales into insignificance next to the works of Toni Morrison, for example, who educates us every time we open her pages of wonderful prose.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I ordered the game to bring back memories when I played the Oregon Trail in elementary, but I was disappointed.  The game itself was fine but was unprepared for the hidden fees. To keep playing you have to pay for energy which is expensive. I would have rather paid for the game as a whole instead of having to go in my wallet to get energy for my player. I paid about $5 worth of energy and it lasted me about 15 min. That's how fast your money goes. It doesn't matter how well you play the purpose of the game is to keep on going back into your wallet. It's a cash cow for the game developer. Well this cow is not going to produce any more milk for them!
B0000009TT|5.0|This three-disc set is amazing.  So much of it was familiar from the previous (and unauthorized) LPs.  I wore the grooves off of these albums back in high school.  It's fantastic to finally be able to listen to them again.  I was so disappointed when [[ASIN:B0000009SU Sleep Dirt]] was re-released with those wretched vocals--what a relief to be able to hear it again after all those years.  (My vinyl collection was destroyed in the 1994 Northridge Earthquake, so I've been estranged from a lot of these tunes for many many years.)<br /><br />Buy it, rip it to your iPod, and listen to all three discs, one after another.  It will quench your thirst with FZ's finest works.

058201736X|4.0|The Diary of Anne Frank has amazed me at how brave and courageous she was during the time of WWII; she is writing her own life story  about how she and her family had to flee from their home and go into hiding for several years, and she recorded vivid impressions of her experiences in her diary.<br /><br />A common theme that I discovered as I read this book was loneliness and misery.  A quote that I found that goes along with this says \\"I could go on for hours about all the suffering the war has brought, but then I would only make myself more dejected. There is nothing we can do but wait as calmly as we can till the misery comes to an end\\" (64). To me this quote has a lot of meaning;  Anne and her family are suffering while they hide from the outside world and there's nothing they can do but wait, wait for the war to end, or wait for their lives to end -- they don't know what their future will hold so they have to live in fear and doubt. Although Anne is a very sweet and bright young girl, she is living in very hard conditions that bring her down and make her feel very sad and lonely.<br /><br />The word oppressive, which means difficult to bear, harsh, or cruel, is a very strong word used in Anne's diary. This word  stood out to me because Anne uses this word to express her feelings about never being able to do the things she wishes she could do as a little girl, and always being afraid of being found or hurt.<br /><br />I agree with the statement from a customer that says \\"It was one of the most moving, powerful experiences I've ever had.\\" Because Anne really expresses a lot of feelings as you read, you find that she is a truly remarkable girl.<br /><br />I recommend you read this book. In my opinion one of the best ways to learn about history and WWII is from the perspective of a person who was actually going through the hard times of the war,  and being able to read about some of the horrible things they had to go through along with their own personal thoughts. Reading this book will make you feel very much for Anne and her family and make you thankful for your life today.<br /><br />11th grade TJHS studentReading this book will make you feel very much for Anne and her family and make you thankful for your life today.<br /><br />11th grade TJHS student
B005UD1D62|5.0|Honestly, I do not watch any of her television shows but I did love this book.  It was a fun read!
B004FOA84A|3.0|the game is more difficult than it should be..theres no rhyme or reason to the order of how to go about solving things...and its very short also..I'm glad I only paid. 49 for it..it killed a whole half hour of my life..not one of the better point and click games..
B004SEUJYG|5.0|I bought this product for my husband since Patton is one of his favorite movies.  He loved the movie and all of the extras that came with it.  Great package for the price!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app so far... I haven't had any problems with it so far. I hope to not have any. the games are great to play when you have nothing to do.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this Bible app!! The reading plans are great, &amp; you can have it remind you to read. I also love that you can download some of the versions so that you can read even when there's no Internet connection. Awesome app!!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|The first book in the trilogy, 'the Hunger Games' deals with quite a dark subject matter (having teenagers kill each other for the entertainment of others). This book is very difficult to put down, and makes you need to keep reading, so be prepared to read the second and third books in quick succession!
0345803485|5.0|So first let me start by saying all the negative reviews are bs! I mean yes it lacks in the wording department just a little....but the story is so addicting you will barely notice. Christian is the most alluring character in a book in a long time! I am so addicted to the relationship evolving between Anastasia Steele and Christian Grey that the authors reference to female genatalia as \\"sex\\" doesn`t bother me that much. I mean so what she constantly mentions them blushing seriously don`t let negative prude women deter you from reading this book! I am a Mom of two kids and married for 6 years now and let me tell you I have spiced up the bedroom with reading these books! I can`t wait till it is a movie and would LOVE to see Ian Somerhalder star as Christian yummy!

0321544080|5.0|This is a great book to give photo shooting tips. Great reference point for composition and framing of your subject in interesting ways. The photographs used in the book are awesome as a standalone picture book. Recommended.
1401216676|2.0|I get it. This book is a classic, role re-defining story. I love Barbara Gordon as the Oracle, so I do have a sort of appreciation of this book.  But I don't understand Batman's complacency and compassion toward the Joker. It seems so out of character.  And maybe its just me, but the writing totally had me confused-I mean why the Hell is he laughing it up with the Joker after what both Jim and Barbara Gordon had just gone through?  Why did Joker get such a lame back story? I would rather not know than have read that.  I buy a lot of books off amazon based on reviews, but this is one that I disagree with the majority on.  Not a great story at all in my opinion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|best game in the world<br />and and and the universe<br />so I love the game more than its a seceret so that. is my review
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. They do try to get you to spend money in order to obtains certain items but it's not necessary, you can still play without spending any money. In the game your character has a set amount of energy. When that runs out you can buy more or wait 3 minutes. If you are going to play sporadically like me then waiting probably won't bother you.
B000H7J9RQ|5.0|I saw this years ago and knew some day I would add it to my Barbra Collection. She is amazing! I really enjoyed the setting of her home and wonderful friends in the audience. Robin Williams is a Hoot. A \\"Must Have\\" for all her fans.

1936891026|5.0|Everyone should read this book. For each person out there uncomfortable with \\"Change\\" and \\"Moving Forward\\" this is the book you should have. It reveals how procrastination hinders our lives from reaching our true goals, creativity, karma. Just read the book and see yourself in all your glory and learn something.
B007JCP8FE|3.0|The Amaryllis album is decent. However most of the songs are generic rock songs, interchangeable with each other. Album was worth a listen but won't be a favorite. Title track \\"Amaryllis\\" and \\"Bully\\" are worth a listen.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I purchased the SB-400 about 4 weeks ago, and I can't be more satisfied with this very portable flash.  It is easily small enough to be taken everywhere in my camera bag, uses AA batteries (available everywhere), installs in seconds on my D90, and produces great flash fill and indoor non-studio portraits.  It is a huge improvement over the built-in flash.  It is ready almost instantly between shots, and it sits high enough on the camera to prevent accidentally blocking it with a hand (the curse of being left-handed).  The built-in also has a max shutter speed of 1/60s, which is a little slow if you are zoomed or shooting something that is moving.  The SB-400 extents the max shutter speed to 1/200s, which is much faster.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I seriously cannot fathom why anyone is going nuts for this book.  I am 72% finished and the only reason I continue on is because I paid $10 and because I want to see if there is anything redeeming at the end.<br /><br />\\"Fifty Shades\\" is repetitive, unimaginative, and surprisingly quite boring.  The protagonist is an unlikeable, unbelievable, seemingly computer illiterate college senior who constantly blushes and flushes and refers to her lady parts as \\"down there.\\"  If I had to read one more sentence mentioning her inner goddess I think I will gasp.  Or maybe my breath will hitch.<br /><br />Sorry, but this book's fame makes no sense to me.  Maybe I would have liked this when I was 14 and I would have gone through with a highlighter so my friends and I could read  it and giggle in the lunchroom, but as an old lady of 30 I was unable to enjoy this.
B007PS0X0W|5.0|This is a great movie! Lots of action, suspense and just watching Kate Beckinsale kick some butt is awesome.<br /><br />*spoiler**<br />humans have discovered other species living in the world: lycans and vampires and they begin exterminating all of them.  There's a twist in the end!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this book because I saw a news interview saying this was the best book ever!  I am usually leary but I decided to jump on the band wagon.  From page one I was NOT impressed.  Unfortunately I had paid for it.  If I knew how to ask for a refund I would have gotten my money back.  They say the sex is so steamy hot, it isnt even luke warm.  I could go on about the characters and how awful, weak minded, wishy waashy and trully sad they were but I won't.  I finished 73% of the book and that is as much as I could stand. It is not for everyone.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I think it is fun and holds my interest.  I have to think a step ahead and actually picture the moves in my head.
B001GCUER0|5.0|I watch mostly DVD episode of TV shows due to my work/school/life schedule. I have just recently started watching this series and I must admit, I am hooked!! Its very interesting the dynamic of society and personal life during this era, and how it all related to the professional environment. The transition from Season 1 to Season 2 was rough and a little odd. All in all, I highly recommend it to anyone who likes a little twisted story, sex appeal, and a some interesting surprises!
B005LAIIS0|5.0|I'm surprised at the amount of people who gave this movie 2-stars or under. Usually I look for an action or thriller movie, and although The Grey wasn't as much as I expected, I still thought it was a great movie. If you gave it one or two-stars, you didn't understand all it stood for. I have been watching the end over and over again, it's just that good. Don't let all the bad reviews stop you from buying this movie!
B007C9N4H8|4.0|On a bored and nappy afternoon, I rented this on Amazon Prime.<br /><br />I love this movie. I love the Muppets in general. And above all, I love the fact that the Muppet's brand of self-effacing humor not only pleases the youngest AND the oldest members of the family with jokes and entendres that land where they're intended on each audience, but it also realizes how lucky a franchise is to hold its appeal with a viewer who grew up on \\"Sesame Street\\" and now has youngsters that find the same family of creatures just as heartwarming and engaging.<br /><br />Kermit, as their leader, never assumes you still adore him; rather, he keeps giving you reasons to find him lovable, and he thanks you for that. And these furry beings don't behave (as many Disney creations do) as if it's still the 1960s. They know their time and potential untimeliness, and they work hard to overcome the generation gaps that make so many other former favorites obsolete.<br /><br />This is a movie that pokes as much fun at itself as possible, and it's all the more endearing because of how conscious it is of how unendearing it could have been.<br /><br />I'll watch this every couple of months. It's a new favorite.
0385738765|5.0|Amazing only describes some aspects of this book. I am currently reading three books t this moment and each time I would put one book down to pick this one up. This story had me going until the very end. This is how writing should be; non stop action with twists and turns that leave you wanting more. I have to wait to read the third book, but when that day comes, it will be a celebration of some great reading.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Well written, interesting  account of the relationships developed by our presidents after completion of their terms of office.  Enjoyable and easy read.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|I am a person who actually became a mild fan of the Brothers Gibb before the disco era had taken off.  \\"Nights on Broadway\\" was the song of theirs which got my attention.  Anyway, this Bee Gees retrospective has everything; from the early \\"I Started a Joke,\\" to some of the later songs, like \\"You Win Again.\\"  It goes without saying that ALL of the classics in between (\\"Staying Alive,\\" \\"Night Fever,\\" \\"Tragedy,\\" \\"Jive Talkin',\\" etc., are all here, too.
B002QS1O36|3.0|I have a love/hate relationship with this movie - I love it because it is Phantom of the Opera and I love the scenery and the way the movie was done (I love everything Phantom); but to this day I do not think Gerard Butler was the best person for the part of the Phantom.  (I'm a Butler fan too, just not with his singing).  I bought the movie because I wanted it on my kindle fire.  It's still a nice movie to have when you want something to watch and you only have a short time.

B001S86J5S|5.0|What can I say?  This is one of my all-time favorite comedies and best baseball movie in my book.  My 19 year-old daughter loved it as well.  She was amused at some of the fun facts I pointed out like \\"One of the early works of Charlie Sheen, Wesley Snipes, Rene Russo, and Dennis Haysbert.\\"  She recognized them, respectively, as the guy famous for and who got fired from Two and a Half Men; Blade; Thor's Mom; the president from 24 and the All-State Insurance guy. One of the perks of getting older.  Last but not least, Mr. Baseball himself (no, not Tom Selleck), Bob Uecker's performance was purely classic!

The one I purchased can be used as a nice display piece and a fairly large action figure with all his weapons...for half the price and new-in-box.  Nuff said.

B0018AOA8E|4.0|Not really sure how to review this since, if you are buying a live CD of band then you probably are a fan. I really like this live cd, it has always been one of my favorites. The only thing I would say the draw back of this one is that it has A LOT of high end and hardly any Bass. You will really need to EQ it to get a decent sound.<br /><br />As for the music, this CD is from the tour promoting the CD For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge. Most of the songs are off that album, but in classic VH style, they throw some of the greats in here to.<br /><br />I think the set list for this tour was great and flowed very well. The songs transition nicely and you don't feel like the show is starting and stopping.

0307888908|3.0|This is an average book about business, clothed in the PR hype of today's young business people. While the author, co-founder of LinkedIn, cites some research that knocks a portion of \\"conventional\\" business ideas into a cocked hat, much of what he has to say is pretty standard.<br /><br />You have to know your markets, be mindful of changes, plan for contingencies, and think outside the box.<br /><br />While the business and work world of today is different than 20 or 30 years ago, to think that it is a totally new phenomena is incorrect. The business world today actually resembles the world of the late 1800s more than the 1960s and 1970s. We are in an era where changes in communication have caused things to speed up in a way that has thrown the steady patterns and methods of the previous few decades into a panic.<br /><br />The same was true in the late 1800s. Telegraphs and the new telephone had drastically altered the speed of communication and information transmission, and that had a radical effect on information-sensitive areas of society, especially business and finance.<br /><br />Also, the career paths he describes as being the typical expectations of workers in the recent past were actually a brief aberration in history, with the usual conditions being much more like today than we are generally told. The book is about being an employee, not an entrepreneur.<br /><br />I had some issues with some of the examples he uses, including one person who worked for the World Bank and had also smuggled materials into Russia illegally to help an illegal underground finance itself. Not exactly the kind of ethical standard I like to see held up in a business book, although I can certainly understand the acceptance of such behavior in the corrupt world of today's corporate fascism.<br /><br />I found the author's view of the world somewhat mundane and mainstream, despite all the talk about our radically changing world. Most of the business analysis seemed superficial tome, and many historical forces were simply ignored.<br /><br />On the whole, it is a good book with some sound advice, although nothing particularly breathtaking or radically new. There is much on workplace politics, networking, job searching, planning, and so on.<br /><br />While certainly not of the caliber of Chris Guillebeau or Ernie Zelinski, this is not a bad introduction to the business world of today.

B000S1M9LY|1.0|\\"The Emperor has no clothes!\\"<br /><br />Occam's Razor? Infinite Jest is a double head fake -- a private joke whose reception probably turned out to be a much needed source of amusement for DFW during the last quarter of his life. Needless to say, it would also explain the title.<br />--<br />Reading Infinite Jest is a bit like plowing through piles and piles of manure, looking for the occasional flashes of brilliance. As it turns out, Wallace distributes enough of them in the first half to make you last until the end -- just about (assuming you read quickly).<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong. There is more than enough evidence in this book that Wallace was truly one of a kind when it came to observing and understanding certain aspects of human nature. Unfortunately, the raw, intense method he chose to communicate this understanding doesn't quite work. Sometimes, it's perfect; other times, you find yourself thinking that he's trying to stick to the same style just for the sake of it, squeezing a round peg through a square hole, and failing to communicate unique insights and ideas that frankly deserved way better.<br /><br />My best guess is that the book is a double parody, and that most of the world's 'artistic elites' never got beyond round one. So they accept Infinite Jest, praising it as a unique portrait of our addicted, consuming society, written in a never-seen-before style -- all that whilst being completely oblivious to the similarities with a story about an emperor who had no clothes. Then, seeing that everyone else likes it, others join in, and soon enough, the world's wannabee intellectuals pile in, followed by the mass market.<br /><br />Some patiently suffer through the book for the reward of saying they've read it. Others take this ridiculous adventure even further, writing notes and trying to analyse the text, fighting through every page, re-reading the entire volume multiple times, and defining themselves by their admiration of it. Somehow, they manage to ignore the irony of getting addicted to a book about addiction.<br /><br />I have never read any of the author's other novels or essays. Many speak highly of them, but since the same people also speak highly of this book, I remain cautious. Yet, given DFW's understanding of pain and depression that clearly shines through here, one has to give him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />I struggle to accept, however, that someone with his intellect couldn't take the 30 pages of brilliance scattered through Infinite Jest, drop the 970 pages of utterly pointless, boring drivel, and turn it into a concise, entertaining and enlightening novel that could have reached a broader audience, and touched it more profoundly.<br /><br />By Occam's Razor, then, DFW must have wanted to make a point -- for, as unlikely as this explanation may seem, all the alternatives seem even less probable. What point, though?<br /><br />I have no idea, but hope it was something deeper than an attempt to amuse himself by watching the spectacle that ensued, since, albeit presumably quite amusing, it has been an expensive one..<br /><br />..for someone who understood the value of human freedom and happiness so deeply as Wallace, to have purposefully wasted millions of hours that humanity won't ever get back would be..truly sad.

I just finished my very first workout on Level one and I am feeling it! I could hardly finish the video, but i felt fantastic once i did. Can't wait to get further into this program.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I loved Adam's earlier release, \\"For Your Entertainment,\\" although I felt the songs somewhat obscured his great vocals.  He has taken care of that problem with \\"Trespassing.\\"  He sounds amazing.  I'd say my favorite song, hands down, is one of the bonus tracks, \\"Runnin'.\\"  I absolutely love hearing Adam sing in his lower register and the song has the drum-pounding intensity that makes the listener want to hear the song reach its final zenith.  Why this is a bonus track is beyond me.  IMO, it's the best song on the album.  My second favorite (which was my favorite until I heard \\"Runnin'\\") is the ballad, \\"Underneath.\\"  It has this lush feel to it and is so full of emotion.  Gorgeous.  Other favorites:  \\"Trespassing,\\"  \\"Shady,\\" \\"Kicking In,\\"  and \\"Chokehold.\\"  The two singles so far (\\"Better Than I Know Myself\\" and \\"Never Close Our Eyes\\") aren't bad (because there's nothing bad on this album).  They're just not my favorites here.  That they're not my favorites really illustrates the album's depth.  To those who haven't purchased it yet, I strongly encourage you to buy the deluxe version.  It's only a dollar or two more (depending on where you purchase it) and the three bonus songs are well worth the money.<br /><br />Overall, I'm a very pleased fan.  I've purchased two albums in the last two weeks of two of my favorite artists and I'll be buying another one at the end of the month and I strongly suspect that \\"Trespassing\\" will be my favorite of the three.  I easily give this five stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is one of the best. The love story is superior and that is what you should focus on when reading 50 Shades. Of course, you must read the whole series since it only gets better with reading each book.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I saw Bonnie at JazzFest in NO and she did many of these songs plus oldies. Her voice is great and she is an excellent guitarist!
B001NLL0RW|5.0|From start to finish, this is a novel worth reading.  It is hard to put down.  Educational, suspenseful, humorous -- everything I like all rolled into one.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|I really enjoy the music of Dr John and I think his new CD is awesome. He performed most of the songs at JazzFest live!!
B002KS1IJC|1.0|This is one of the worst movies that i've ever seen. Seriously, could the story, acting, and cgi be any worse?
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book was amazingly great. I really enjoyed the way the book took you through what happened and every single event leading up to it, including the training that the navy seals go through... This is a must read for anyone who wants to read about the heroics of our military, and to see the great sacrifice... the ULTIMATE sacrifice that 3 of MArcus's closest friends gave.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|There is quite the mix of easy and complex games you earn through playing, racking up points, and improving. Great for when you have a few minutes to kill.
B007SGM084|1.0|Why are valued customers being charged so much for this trilogy? If you purchase the book version it is cheaper and you can lend it out to as many friends as you want....re-thinking the kindle situation.

076781326X|1.0|It was the shortest version I've seen. The classic scenes like time between artful dodger and Oliver in the orphanage. What happened to that wonderful movie. This movie was dark and evil. I was so very disappointed
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Honestly, the book is so rife with graphic sex scenes...it resembles a bit of a modern day porn. The difference is, the S and M lifestyle gives way to a stilted romance of sorts. While Gray does not date women or love them, he wants to 'try to change' to please Anistasia. She goes along with his odd sexual proclivities because she...loves him..and loses her virginity to him. Seriously, amidst the stardust here we have sex scenes that are quick, muddled, and showcasing both parties as eager and frequent climaxers. The whole thing is unrealistic and not at all like chick lit. Chick lit is meant to be funny, ironic, depict women's lives as they are, be tongue in cheek, appeal to a certain age group, focus on certain women's issues, etc. A sex book mixed with fantasy...authored by a woman...is fine and dandy but is not adding anything of note to an emerging genre. This is a fiction book, mainly for fans of extreme erotica. I do not plan to read nay more as these sex scenes are quite a turn off.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book out of curiosity because everyone was talking about it.  It is prue trash.  It really is pure porn.
B0039OC64M|5.0|Great movie! I think everybody have to see this film. Great cast, great performance I am from Russia originally and for many years we had totalitarian government- Big Brother who control you live. People have to realize and remember how lucky they are to live in United States- the really democratic country in the World!
0393088774|2.0|Paul Krugman is a true Progressive. Every thing is seen through Progressive ideology. He invokes President Reagan to support President Obama's policies. President Obama is no President Reagan.<br /><br />Above all else, Government is responsible for maintaining Freedom. They are not responsible for providing goods and services. Free Market produces wealth and prosperity.<br /><br />I listened to a debate between Paul Krugman and Pedro Schwartz on youtube at v=EX55BH97quk . I suggest you listen before you buy.
B0070BG10U|5.0|I had gotten this CD about the time it was released and at that time Robin Gibb was in the hospital fighting for his life.<br />I finally sat and listened to it today, the day after the music world lost an amazing musician, Robin Gibb, who lost his battle with cancer.<br />This CD which is in relation to the 100th anniversary of the Titanic tragedy is also a major tribute to Robin Gibb.<br />He was a multi-talented musician and singer.  The song he sings on this CD is a haunting song that will touch your heart.<br />I highly recommend this CD of a lasting tribute to Robin Gibb.<br />The other person involved in producing this was Robin's son, RJ.  What wonderful experience for the two of them to work on this final work of Robin's.
B007WDPPK8|5.0|This book is a bit different than some of the classics about knitting in the round (for example, [[ASIN:0892725338 Jackie Fee's Sweater Workshop]] and [[ASIN:0684135051 Knitting without Tears]]) in that more types of items are included--socks, mittens, vests, baby stuff and fingerless gloves and shawls in addition to pullovers and cardigans. While the books I mentioned as classic references also cover some of these techniques, \\"Circular Knitting Workshop\\" is new and more varied and I think this belongs on any knitter's shelf of references for basic knitting. It is especially useful if you are new to circular knitting (where, essentially, one side of the knitting stays towards the knitter at all times, and you do not work back and forth) or if you want to incorporate this technique into your own original designs. Personally, I knit in the round probably 99 percent of the time, even for flat items like shawls; I start them in the center and work outwards, round and round. This book will show you how to do that!<br /><br />The author discusses TUBES (handy for gloves), working bottom up, top down and how to handle the \\"jog\\" which is the unfortunate issue that circular tubes have; the beginning of the new round stacks on top of the old round (you are really knitting up in a spiral) so the new round \\"jogs\\" over the old one. You'll see this in stripes; instead of rings of color stacked one on another, you get a jog at the beginning of the new stripe that shows up rather annoyingly. However, the author shows you ways to disguise this.<br /><br />A number of ways to cast on are demonstrated in good photographs. There are also a number of intriguing ways to cast off, including a decorative picot cast off I really like (nice for sweater necks or the cuffs of mittens.)<br /><br />Any size yarn --any gauge, from lacy to bulky, so this book has methods only limited by your imagination. It's a new classic. Highly recommended.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my new favorite workout DVD!! I have several of the Biggest Loser workout DVDs and had just completed the Last Chance Workout 6 week program, so I considered myself to be in okay shape. Imagine my surprise when I could barely get through level 1!! I'm so glad I stuck with it; I feel a lot more toned and definitely stronger thanks to the traveling push-ups. I haven't weighed myself yet, I'm waiting until day 30. My only question is about the diet plan; Jillian mentions it several times throughout the workout, but I don't know where I can find it. Can anyone steer me in the right direction? I definitely plan to do another 30 days and really want to follow the diet plan this time.
B003102JDM|1.0|I rented this movie. I'm Jewish and thought it might be fun to watch, since it was billed as a dark comedy.<br /><br />There were a few spots, like the Bar Mitzvah, that had some familiar Jewish tradition. But the rest --<br /><br />Not funny, not profound. No likeable characters. Slow paced and boring. The ending left you hanging, but by then I didn't care anyway.<br /><br />The best part of watching this movie was that I was hemming a pair of pants while I was watching it. Got the pants done, since the movie wasn't very distracting.
B003K5UMLE|5.0|This story is well written, thought-provoking and interesting. Karen Gillan, who plays Amy Pond later in DW beginning with season 5, plays a small role in this episode -- it's interesting to see her playing a different role than usual. Catherine Tate plays Donna Noble especially well in this story. The water pistol is pretty good too.

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This book was ok, but the way Katniss sees everything is kind of annoying, too pessimistic for me. Let's see what other people think.
0307719219|4.0|I enjoyed reading it, and agreed with much of the book.  However, there are problems. The book is as its best when correcting trendy or incorrect ideas of economic development and that is the reason to read it.  There are many in the poverty industry who have their pet theories on economic development.  Most want to spend more money of this or that.  The book does excellent research and blows away those.  For that reason I would suggest reading it.<br /><br />There are things I disagree with it.  First, it disregards both culture and geography as factors.  In fact the author disagrees that these play a part in development.  Thus only focus on manmade political and economic actions.  They have a very good point that nations will come to a key point in history and will often make a series of small decisions which will lead a certain way.  But those are influenced by culture as much as anything.  They give a number of examples but leave out examples like Appalachia or Mississippi in US.  There is a differences within a nation that lives under the same government that does not fix their theory. The state of Missippi is poorer than GA or AL and WV are poorer than PA or Ohio but they are next to those states.  But WV has no agriculture due to the hilly terrain.  Geography does matter. And the culture in Miss is also different.  I have read the works of Thomas Sowell and he goes into how culture does make a great deal of impact in the income and lives of people.  In this area I would read Sowell.  Looking across the US there would be no variance of income across regions and ethnic groups in was not true.<br />The authors need to define different systems also.  One system (dictatorship) is easy to define one if which the elite control everything for their benefit.  Stopping change in order to preserve their place at the top.  The alterative needs to be more defined.  What make it different?  The authors talk about the system having creative destruction and technical change,but I feel that there are other factors as well.  For example they don't discuss Athens during the Golden age of Greece.  After Athens threw out their dictator, and after the Persian wars.  Athens had a true Golden age.  Sparta did not share in this.  The reason was true freedom is both the freedom of ideas and speech but also property rights.  Freedom is also to keep what is yours.<br /><br />Another problem is that the book does discuss Venice but leave out that Venice grew rich when it was on the trading routes from the Middle East and Far East.  Then declined after Europe started sailing around Africa to the Far East.  A good view of this is Bernard Lewis  \\"What when wrong\\"  which details why the middle east which was once of the wealthiest areas, because of trade routes going through it is now one of the poorest areas (expect oil producing areas) Thus I think they are wrong to discount both culture and geography.<br />The authors begin the new era with England after the Glorious Revolution.  One problem is that they don't discuss Athens during the Golden age of Greece.  After Athens threw out their dictator and became a democracy it was a start of a Golden age.  The big question which they don't discuss is why.  Because true freedom is both the freedom of ideas, but also the freedom of owning what you produce.  Property rights.  Athens got that and that is what produced the Golden age.<br />They discuss the Fall of Rome.  But Rome was a more inclusive place than they mention.  The statement that August sowed the seeds of Rome decline is a statement that I disagree with.  He came to power around 31BC after the battle of Actium.  Became Augustus and assumed total control 27BC.  Rome started to fall to the Goth after the battle of Hadrianople in 378 AD.  Then totally fell by 476 AD.  For 400 years it was a nice run.  There are many reasons why Rome fell.  Peter Heather wrote an excellent book on the fall of Rome.  But, blaming Augustus 400- 500 years after the fact is somewhat off.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Very entertaining game for the whole family.  It is most fun when playing with 4 people.  My daughter, age 6 and her cousins (ages 8 & 51/2) were playing it the other day and they had so much fun trying to block each other out.  Easy game to learn but you hard to win.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This product is excellent and does exactly as it says. I bought this for use with my Kindle fire and it works perfect. both plugs fit tightly with no wiggle room on either end. This is the first Kindle product that I've used so I would like to make note to anyone purchasing this for the Kindle Fire, in order to use this, the device must be turned on and not in sleep mode or your computer will not recognize the device. Very good product at a great price.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have read a lot of the both positive and negative reviews.  The negative reviews have a point.  BUT I have to tell you that I have really liked this trilogy, simply as a great summer read.  I did get completely tired of the erotic scenes (they all sound alike after a while) but what is compelling (though unrealistic) is that the female protagonist is able to help the male protagonist learn how to have a \\"vanilla\\" relationship that is fulfilling and \\"normal\\" for lack of a better word.  In other words, BDSM is fine if it's for fun, but not okay if it's for pain and if it's for working out issues best discussed with one's therapist.  I've started skipping the sex but I really like the love story--it's a fairy tale but a great summer read.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is fun...a time consumer...I wish the energy reloaded faster I would play it more often if it did... But overall a fun game...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|First (and this is just me), I detest books written in present tense. Secondly, Ana is vapidly uninteresting as a character; there's nothing about her that makes me give a \\"crap\\" about her. Oh, and the repetitive use of stupid phrases. Flushing, peeking, smirking. Not to mention the overuse of the word, \\"crap\\". STOP!<br /><br />Horrid. All of it.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|During a period of my life that I spent catching up on all the classic works that I'd never foudn time for, The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes stands out.<br /><br />I can't give it any higher praise. Through a collection of Great books, this was the Greatest. And for the peroid in which it was written, it is still remarkably easy to read.<br /><br />My kindle edition has about a hundred underlined passages, but here's are two favourite Sherlock-Watson exchanges:<br />\\"You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.\\"<br />\\"Frequently.\\"<br />\\"How often?\\"<br />\\"Well, some hundreds of times.\\"<br />\\"Then how many are there?\\"<br />\\"How many? I don't know.\\"<br />\\"Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point.\\"<br /><br />\\"You do not mind breaking the law?\\"<br />\\"Not in the least.\\"<br />\\"Not running a chance of arrest?\\"<br />\\"Not in a good cause.\\"<br />\\"Oh, the cause is excellent!\\"<br />\\"Then I am your man!\\"
044024630X|4.0|This book is dynamite. Writing in the first person, novelist Lee Child takes us back to when Reacher was still an MP, in March 1997, and what happened at a base near the Mississippi-Tennessee border. A woman is found dead and mutilated, and Reacher is sent undercover, hoping that the killer isn't a soldier. He finds romance of a sort with dedicated town sheriff and former Marine Elizabeth Deveraux.<br /><br />However, Reacher soon finds evidence of a cover-up by the military. He's threatened a few times by both military personnel (what he does to four soldiers sent to take him back to the base is amusing and twisted) and the local hillbillies (what he does to them is also amusing and twisted). Deveraux is caught in the middle, and Reacher isn't so sure that she is innocent.<br /><br />The book is a blast to read, and Reacher is tough and virile and, when with Elizabeth, almost tender. However, he isn't going soft; the bad guys most definitely get theirs, as the book's stirring conclusion shows. It's a terrific read and a good introduction to a great, popular series by Lee Child.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hard to believe when the author wrote the original \\"Wool\\", that he did not have this entire series already in mind.<br />That's how naturally the story flows from one installment to the next.<br />I highly recommend this series, especially if you like post apocalypse novels, you won't be disappointed here.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|It is fun and addictive. It used freeze up so I had to uninstall and reinstall several times. Since the update I have not had any problems yet. It takes a long time for you to gain enough money to buy powerups after hitting certain levels you have to earn or buy Gold in order to power up. If it remains bug free I might just buy some gold in order to power. It is fun to slash zombies afterall.

B00009NQQO|4.0|I bought these for two very bath resistant boys. They took them out of the package and started playing with them before we even got into the tub! They look forward to the bath now so they can play with their \\"special\\" bath toys.<br /><br />I have a little problem getting the suction cups to stick to the tile walls. We pretty much just re-stick them every night as we're drawing the bath.<br /><br />The hoop is a little small for my kiddos to get the ball into, but that's helping them learn to aim better, so it's not a big deal.<br /><br />The balls are soft enough that it doesn't hurt if (when) they throw them at each other. They bounce pretty easily off the walls too so be prepared to chase them around the bathroom!<br /><br />This was one of three bath toy sets I recently bought to replace old toys and this is the one they want to play with the most.

0743270754|5.0|My own family descends from poor farmers who managed to rise to positions of significance within education and business, so Abraham Lincoln holds a special place in my heart.<br /><br />This is the second book I have read about Lincoln, and I found it succeeded remarkably well in bringing the great man to life. Reading the book, I clearly saw and heard him in conversation with his family, friends and cabinet members so much so that on several occasions I thought to myself how little has actually changed in the way people interact with each other on a fundamental level.<br /><br />There were many lessons I absorbed from this excellent book. Among them: Lincoln's mastery of patiently waiting and watching for the right moment to act when the public was ready to support controversial acts and initiatives, such as the emancipation proclamation. Lincoln likened it to waiting for a pear to ripen. \\"A man watches his pear tree day after day, impatient for the ripening of the fruit,\\" Lincoln explained. \\"Let him attempt to force the process, and he may spoil both fruit and tree. But let him patiently wait, and the ripe pear at length falls into his lap!\\"<br /><br />The passages in the book about Lincoln's emotional intelligence were equally fascinating and useful, particularly those about his deep understanding of his own emotional needs. During the most dispiriting times of the war, Lincoln visited General Grant and the troops numerous times to boost his own spirits so that he could in turn buoy the spirit of the nation by speaking confidently about the ability of the Union army and the inevitability of its success. And Lincoln spent considerable time reading literature and attending plays, which helped to relieve the weight of his many obligations and the stress of war, and undoubtedly contributed to his inspiring mastery of public speaking and writing.<br /><br />This book, which is 754 pages long, is definitely worth the time and effort!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|What a great love story with a little more excitement and eroticism than any I've ever read before.  Kept me interested and wanted to read more so read all 3 books back to back.  Writing was okay, kind of cheesy sometimes...for example there was great detail of the sexual trysts sometimes but then at other times it was more plain vanilla (\\"my sex\\"??!!) But I enjoyed the character development and storyline.  If you're a prude it wouldn't be a book for you....
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I have had these for a while and felt inclined to write a review on these. I absolutely love these. The sound quality is amazing and the surround sound actually works. I can't tell you how many times these have saved my life while playing COD. They are also great for kids who annoy their parents with the tv sound. With these headphones you can turn off the tv sound and listen to it through your headphones while still being able to hear your friends. They are great except that their comfort is better than most xbox headphones but the padding is stiff. Overall these headphones are great and I would recommend them to anyone. Thank you for reading this and I hope helped you.
1613823444|5.0|Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March.
B005ONTD42|3.0|This product is not as fun as it looks. I got this and had a lot of fun with it... for the first 30 minutes. After that it just wasn't as fun. Although, I must say that it is the best r/c toy I have ever had. I'm not a big r/c fan so I don't think it is that fun but for those who do like r/c stuff it should be really fun for you. At first this thing is very hard to steer and control, but after a while you will get used to it. Overall it's not that bad if you like r/c toys. Thank you for taking your time to read this and I hope it helped you.

B0079R8KO0|5.0|I had been using [[ASIN:B005HSG3VK Kindle Fire Lightweight MicroShell Folio Cover by Marware, Pink]] and I liked it well enough. The only problem I had was the stand. Lightweight MicroShell was light and pretty, but the stand part didn't work very well. It collapsed very often which frustrated me so much that I started using additional stand.<br /><br />This Vibe Case cover's stand works very well. It doesn't collapse like Lightweight MicroShell cover. I've traveled 6 countries recently with this cover, and I was very happy with it! I wish it was bright color like the other one thogh...

B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a great looking case for a great product (Kindle Fire). It fits like a glove; snaps right in. Once it's on, there's no movement of the device and it feels and looks just like a small notebook. Love the elastic strap that holds the cover closed.<br />My only issue with this case is that the stand mechanism could lock into place a bit better. While it works great on a solid surface like a table, on the lap it's a little touchy. Not a huge deal, but worth mentioning.

B007C3TVNA|4.0|The photography draws too much attention to itself, while the soundtrack is unending and overwhelming at times. However, the story itself is compelling and haunting to watch.  Does the boy become bad because his mother feels nothing for him, or was he born bad and she just had a feeling he would only get worse?  That is the central mystery in this tragic tale.
0756404738|2.0|Patrick did not write with magic with the second book as he did with the first book in the series because:<br /><br />1. the book is told in 4-5 different, unrelated episodes sewn together by a loose plot<br />2. episodes are not creative. They are beaten-to-death variations on erotica, Japanese Samurai, and other little things like Go<br />3. there is nothing major going on about Chandrian<br />4. characters are poorly written. Kvothe wonders far too often, Chandrian killed my parents. Kvothe likes D* for no reason. D* appears increasingly superficial.<br />5. no suspension in the third book: Natalia Lackless is Kvothe's mother. Kvothe is the mentioned son in the children's song.

B0064NTZQ2|2.0|It's a very slick & well-made film, but I was unable to suspend my disbelief. Perhaps I wasn't supposed to. I just didn't get the relationships: who is the girl in love with, anyway? What was she doing with that screw-up husband Standard in the first place? I guess she's just attracted to those antisocial personality disorder types...<br /><br />The acting was fantastic: I'm a huge fan of Gosling, and his emotional range and depth in this movie was as impressive as ever. What bothers me--and this is my personal bugaboo--is the Hollywood idealization of this kind of \\"bad guy\\": he is a  sociopath with a heart of gold and a soft spot for fatherless kids. I just don't buy it.
0385737955|5.0|My 28 year self was bitten by the YA book bug and immediately fell in love with this book and couldn't wait to finish it. Dashner's writing pulls you in and keeps you entranced. It's harder to find YA books that are mostly for a boy's audience. This book is great for girls and guys, but isn't filled with all that mushy love triangle mess.
0385342039|4.0|When Lara's grandmother's ghost begins bashing guests at her own funeral, Lara thinks she has gone crazy! Wouldn't you? What follows is a wonderful story about finding out who you really are and learning to trust your instincts. While not a fan of the \\"shopaholic\\" series, I adore Sophie Kinsella's other books and this one has displaced The Undomestic Goddess as my favorite. Wonderful quick-weekend/beach read.
B004J4WN0I|1.0|How can I convey to you, the awfulness of this book.  The things that drove me crazy, besides the awful dialogue between the main character and his dog, were many.  Ending each sentence with \\"though\\", making stunted references to late nineties slang, and trying to pass it off as hip and current, the horrible overuse of his computer's thesaurus (just because you CAN use big words, doesn't mean you should), and having the sense of humor of a twelve year old boy are the main irritants in this book.<br /><br />If you want a book that's clever and well written, I would suggest that you keep looking.  This isn't it.
B003ZD9DUC|4.0|This is probably Mel Gibson's first film.  A film he's done while he was in his 20's.  There is no doubt that he would become a great star in his native Australia, but this film launched him as an international movie star.  Especially since they released Mad Max 2 which was universally released as \\"The Road Warrior.\\"  And \\"The Road Warrior\\" is one of my Top Ten favorite films of the 1980's.<br /><br />Sure, Mad Max has some of that cheesy seventies style, but it definitely introduced us to a new kind of nameless hero which became the common theme of all upcoming action films even being made today.<br /><br />\\"Mad Max\\" is that one film, being over 30 years old, that can still be loved and cherished by people even less than 20 years old today.  This film is a classic in the \\"action hero\\" dramas for movie lovers who enjoy building a respectable movie library amongst their own home theatre.

B006VFLIYK|2.0|I know this author can write some really engaging stuff. I thoroughly enjoyed Zero Day. I like Child, and much of the Clancy stuff, so that will give you a feel for what I tend to look for. That the protagonist is an assassin working for some undisclosed agency, apparently not a direct report to Homeland Security - OK I was willing to accept that. That he gets qualms about who he is assigned to kill, with that target being a U.S. citizen located within the country...that starts to get tough to take.  Then we get introduced to 14-year old Ms. Super Girl, straight out of multiple foster care homes, who is a great student, taking calculus, no less. After hero assassin saves her from an attack by another trained killer, the bus they were both on blows up! Turns out there are multiple people in his agency, the FBI, and the Secret Service all out to get Assassin Robie. There is too much more of the unbelievable to really rescue what had some potential for a really great read. I am disappointed.

B0051T47NQ|3.0|I guess I'm just not a fan of \\"lost footage\\" fake documentaries.  This was the closest I've ever come to liking one, which I guess says something in its favor.  This movie purports to be the footage of a college film crew investigating a local disturbance involving a bear poacher.  When they begin following him, they discover that he is not hunting bears, but trolls.  The proceed to follow him around as he goes troll hunting, camera shaking all the way.  And that's pretty much it.  They seem to be going for understated comedy, which they pull off well in many places.<br /><br />Hans, the troll hunter, is played perfectly.  He treats troll hunting like a boring office job, and casually dresses up in an iron armor suit with a giant syringe to get a troll blood sample, moaning all the while about how he hates his job.  He's almost a cross between Bill Murray in a Wes Anderson film and Marvin the robot from the Hitchhiker's Guide.  The parts about Hans are great.  Unfortunately, lots of the film consists of pointing the camera at random objects, scenery, or other crew members.  They seem to think we care about the film crew, when we actually just want to see more Hans.<br /><br />And the shaky cam.  Oh god, the shaky cam.  If you don't like shaky cam, look elsewhere, because every time the trolls show up, it's basically watching someone run through the woods with the camera.  You see lots of ground and trees.  I would have liked this movie a lot more if they had went with the mockumentary style using a regular filming method rather than going for the fake documentary angle.<br /><br />In short, the parts with Hans are great, but are only about a third of the film or so, and the rest isn't very good at all.  Overall, I'd recommend it only if you like the fake documentary style.

B00479SVBU|4.0|I have owned this device for almost two years and love most of the features and sound quality.  The music from either the USB Drive or SD Card are very good except when driving in certain areas of the city or county.  However, the one thing that drives me crazy is  the \\"shuffle\\" feature of the device which basically seems to get into a loop of playing the same songs and the same order whenever I turn off the car and start it later.  It will play the last song played from the beginning but then I begin hearing the same list of songs I heard before in the exact same order as before.  It will only mix it up again if I keep fast forwarding about 10 or fifteen songs until I get some semblance of a new random shuffle of mp3's.<br /><br />Other than the fact that you really need the remote to use all of the features(so don't lose it!) of the device, I am very happy with the product.

0345803485|1.0|This book is sick, at best.  I am not against erotica, and I AM an avid romance novel reader, but was extremely disappointed in this book.  I am so glad that I only bought the first one.<br /><br />First of all -the writing is unbelievably juvenile.  My child could write better than this.  I understand that maybe she was trying to portray Ana as young, sheltered, naive, but too far. It's ridiculous.  What the hell would Grey see in her anyway?<br /><br />The worst thing for me was the first sexual encounter.  I mean -I felt like she was a virginal lamb being led to slaughter.  Grey is cold, mean, tender then punishing.  I get the idea, but this is just not for me.<br /><br />My best friend said this book was life changing.  I think we need to have some deeper discussions about her life.  LOL<br /><br />Bottom line:  If your sex-life is healthy at all -this is a waste of time, completely.  I could not relate in any way and stopped reading after chapter 9.  Worst $$ I ever spent on reading material.  Frustrating.

B002UM5BXW|5.0|Kitchen Confidential was a very good insight about what goes on in restaurant kitchens, particularly in New York and the surrounding areas. I have always enjoyed watching Anthony Bourdain's TV show and liked his style. This book was so well-written with a good combination of tips, humour, recipes & enough information to discourage anyone getting in to restaurant business - in a good & realistic way. A bit of an eye opener for me reading about chefs, line cooks & kitchen hands getting injured - burn wounds, knife wounds - while cooking. We all know it happens but to actually read about it with detailed description, was sort of off-putting. But all in all, this is a good book especially for foodies
B005LAIGPA|5.0|This movie was an all-around solid movie. The concept, acting, and effects were all great.<br /><br />I think it's also a great concept for making into a documentary style movie. I was surprised that this movie didn't have a better average review on amazon. Most of the negative reviews I read were people that don't like the documentary style that this movie was shot with. That style is a great way to tell certain kinds of stories, and this movie nailed it.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie. I had high expectations going into this movie, and it exceeded them.

0143118757|5.0|Practical and fundamental lessons in negotiation are useful to all of us.  For a person with a past or present eating disorder such lessons are vital.<br /><br />As a psychotherapist specializing in eating disorder recovery I am always on the lookout for resources that will help adults function well as they recover from these terrible disorders.  Getting to Yes is a fabulous recovery resource.<br /><br />An eating disorder limits, even cripples, mental functioning. Relationships and problem situations are seen in terms of black or white.  The goal in problem solving is more about being safe, being seen in a good light, being nice, or winning.  A person with an eating disorder does not speak from her authentic self in negotiation because she doesn't know her authentic self.  She wants to be liked and she wants to be safe. If she can't achieve a sense of safety she will reject any offered solution to retreat to isolation or capitulate in a victim mode.<br /><br />Part of her recovery is learning how to stand firm in her own authenticity and think clearly at the same time.<br /><br />The basic principles of Getting to Yes:<br /><br />1.  Separate people from the problem<br />2.  Focus on interests, not positions<br />3.  Generate a variety of possibilities before deciding what to do<br />4.  Insist that the result be based on some objective standard<br /><br />are the principles of clear thinking free of the eating disorder psychology.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book as a wonderful eating disorder recovery resource.<br /><br />Joanna Poppink, MFT<br />Los Angeles psychotherapist, speaker<br />author of Healing Your Hungry Heart: recovering from your eating disorder<br />eatingdisorderrecoverydotcom

Now with the publishing revolution fully underway, I realize I don't have to go that route, and there are other options available to me.<br /><br />This book delivers an excellent, blow-by-blow walk through of the process of publishing an ebook.

0525425764|4.0|John Grisham's new book is a great short story.  Yes, short story.  It is about half the length of his normal novels.  As such I was disappointed, not with the story, but with the price.  It seemed to be a bit high priced for the product.  I don't usually complain about price, so I will put that at the end.<br /><br />STORY REVIEW:<br /><br />Theodore Boone is a 13 year old aspiring lawyer.  He is in a private school and one of the brightest students that they have.  His parents are both lawyers.  His mom is a divorce lawyer and his father is a Real Estate Lawyer.  Neither are what we would consider high courtroom drama lawyers.  Theodore wants to be a courtroom lawyer, maybe a Criminal Defense Lawyer, or maybe a Prosecutor, but definitely a lawyer who is in the front of the fight in the courtroom.<br /><br />As such Theo has spent a good bit of time in the local courthouse watching trials.  He has even added people who are going to \\"Animal Court\\" where they are facing a small claims court type of proceeding where \\"lawyers\\" aren't the usual fare, the people usually represent themselves.  But Theo has been a friendly help to many who go to that court.<br /><br />But our story starts with Theo wanting to attend the trial of a man accused of killing his wife.  His school gives him a day pass to go to the court and observe the opening arguments of the trial so that he can then come back and give a report to the Civic's class on the courtroom proceedings.  Theo gets to the court and sits with his uncle Ike (who happens to be a lawyer who ran afoul of the system and is no longer practicing).  As the trial is ready to start and all the lawyers and judge are in place there is only one small problem.  The defendant has fled.  He is no where to be found.  He is in violation of his bail and will be forfeiting a million dollars worth of property put up for bail.  Where is he?  Why has he run?  What will Theo have to do with it?  Is it because Theo found a witness to the crime (an illegal alien) whom he has convinced to come forward to testify for the prosecutor's office.<br /><br />The reason I wonder if Theo is involved is because after the court let's out with a mis-trial because the defendant isn't around strange things start to happen.  Theo's bike tires keep getting slashed. Theo is accused then of breaking into a local electronic's store and stealing thousands of dollars worth of items, some of which are found in his locker at school by the police.  Theo is now on the short list of suspects in a crime.  Students at school start to spread rumors.  There is even an E-mail to hit the internet that mistakenly states that Theo has been arrested and has a trial date looming in Juvenile court (untrue at the moment, but a possible reality).<br /><br />His parents and school officials and his scout master all believe Theo, but the police don't.  Uncle Ike steps up to try and help Theo solve the case to get him off the hook.  And, all the time there is the problem of Peter Duffy, the wife killer, being on the loose.<br /><br />Who wants to mess with Theo's life?  Or did Theo really do it and has everybody fooled?<br /><br />In the midst of all of this there is Animal Court and Theo goes to help Miss Petunia defend her llama from unwarranted harassment from a Security Cop he wants to throw his weight around.  The 15 pages of this animal courtroom drama is probably one of the funniest things I have read in years.  I laughed so hard I cried.<br /><br />The book is great.  It is probably one of the best Grisham has written lately.  So, the story is FIVE STARS<br /><br />So, why did I give it only FOUR STARS?  Because it is my way of saying to the publishers, I am tired of you guys hiking up the price of E-books for more profit for yourselves.  Amazon introduced the Kindle with the desire to have no book over $9.99.  That could still be the case if the publishers would stop being so greedy.<br /><br />How do I know they are greedy?  Well a very good friend has self-published seven novels.  They have been picked up by a real publisher for two of the novels.  But when this author formatted the novels for Kindle the author found that she could make more profit than a hard-published book and that was even selling for less.  Example, paperback book sells for $14.95, the author makes $1.20 in profit.  Kindle format of the same book sells for $6.95 and the author is making $4.00 profit.  Which would the author prefer?  Well to make $4 for a $7 dollar price every time.  So, come on publishers, you make more money on E-books than hardcopy.  Quit being greedy, take your better profits and give us excellent reading for a reasonable price.  OK, sorry that's my rant.  I've never done that before, but unfortunately here's the truth.  The next Grisham novel will get published without me buying it unless the publisher gets over their greed.<br /><br />SO, enjoy this book, it is great, but maybe borrow it from a friend or the library.od friend has self-published seven novels.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I only read this book because it was banned in Florida. It was just as I thought it would be.  The author's attempts to shock in such a blatant manner make the whole story seem quite silly; and not very sexy at all.  It is The Story of O all over again; except this time it is not original. If you want erotica, you can do much better.  If you want to keep up with pop culture you should read it just so you can say you have. However, save your money and borrow it from your local library.  If it wasn't banned in Florida I certainly would have waited to read a borrowed copy.

I have noticed that Levon, Little Jeannie, and Blessed are NOT on the CD I received even though the cd title, cover art, etc. is exactly the same as advertised here. It does contain a few songs in their place, but I would have preferred the set listed here on Amazon. It is still a great collection and the sound quality of this remastered set is very good, so I'll still give it 5 stars but I was somewhat disappointed that the CD I received differed from what is advertised here.

B0053Q9DHW|3.0|Jane Eyre,the new film by Fukunaga,is an attempt to take a well-worn subject by an outsider new film-maker, shows a film faithful to its source material,while Buffini's screenplay introduces flashbacks to avoid the straightjacket of chronology-the film opens dramatically with Jane(Wasikowska) stumbling across the moors in distress,she's fleeing from Thornfield Hall,from the gothic mansion full of Rochester's(Fassbender)secrets and her wedding to Rochester,which has been disrupted by her knowledge of his mad wife.The film hinges on Wasikowska's excellent Jane,the plain governess,with her mix of purity,independence,defiance and lonely yearning. Her scenes with Fassbinder are repletewith witty repartee, honesty,and understated repressed passion. There is an edge to their scenes together:\\"Your gaze is very direct Miss Eyre.Do you think me handsome?\\"-he taunts.<br /><br />After the opening introduction to St.John Rivers and his sisters we go back through a tale of sorry woe to her childhood.Sally Hawkins plays Jane's aunt with a Dickensian cruelty.Lowood,the charity school where she is bullied by sadistic teachers.She later becomes a teacher there.She becomes a paid subordinate in Thornfield.She first meets him by frightening his horse and he gets thrown and injured.She gets to know him through the kindly but fussy Miss Fairfax(Dench).Jane and Rochester become friends and she rescues him when fire breaks out in the house.The gothic nature of the house is highlighted by the candlelight,the oil lamps,the fire in the grate, pushing against the surrounding darkness,as well as the tales of secret people walking about,of hidden knocks, bangs,footsteps,laughter,cries.There is less light in this period movie.<br /><br />Jane's compelling directness and otherworldliness galvanise Rochester's jaded Byronism.The film's virtue is a straightforward sincerity,a quietness of style and mood suited to austere times.The style is neo-realism,a pared-down costuming,chilly natural light,slate-and-earth colour palette,precise cinematography,and the use of period language,intonation and dialect.There is a referencing of the spiritual and supernatural,the distancing sense of the `past as a foreign country'.Marinelli's classical score has a Romantic impulse between humanfigure and engulfing landscapes.The movement of the story is from Jane's \\"poor,obscure\\" selfhood and self-possession to equality with the older Rochester.We are immersed in a mythic,timeless narrative world:\\"I imagine things I am powerless to execute\\"in an \\"invisible kingdom of spirits\\".The darker elements of the novel,centred around Bertha Mason,her madness,the colonial Caribbean backdrop,Rochester's brooding intensity,are largely left out.Fassbinder is the actor de nos jours,but he lacks the depth of previous incarnations,Welles,Dalton and Hurt.A striking directorial achievement nevertheless,renewing the appeal of a timeless classic.
0449011917|4.0|I love listening to good audiobooks while I drive and this series has so far been amazing, and while I'm only about 20% done with CDs for this 4th book I'm having a very hard time enjoying it as I did the previous ones.<br /><br />The reasoning is simple, while the narrator is the same as the previous books he sounds somewhat different but I could live with that if he hadn't also scrambled all the voices he uses for the various characters as well.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, so far the book seems good, if somewhat slower then the earlier ones, but the sudden drastic changes in the character's voices pulls me out of the story again and again (for example Arya now sounds like Ygritte, so much so that I keep waiting for her to say \\"you know nothing Jon Snow!\\")<br /><br />So, overall it's still an excellent book but after 100 or so hours of hearing it one way and then having the narrator voice it completely different really takes away from the immersion of this book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Not as compelling as book 1 & 2.  The ending was rushed and I had to reread sections to see if it was a flashback because it was not the same depth or writing style as the other books.
0739352962|4.0|Not only is this a great series, but the length of it makes it an awesome value as many audiobooks which sell for more and considerably shorter.<br /><br />I'm about 20% into the 4th book and so far my only complaint (other then the writer's tendancy to kill off the characters I like) is that while the narrator for them is all the same in book 4 he's voicing the characters totally differently which hurts the immersion factor of the audiobooks since it keeps pulling me out of the story over and over again<br /><br />Overall I would give the story 5 stars but as this is a review of the audiobooks I have to take off one star for the character voicing issue (hopefully I'll get used to it, but all things being equal I'd prefer he go back to the old voicing.)

B002SSUQFG|1.0|SEIKO!!! What happened? I guess this is just the way of the world now and we have to accept the fact that fine craftsmanship has given way to corporate greed in nearly all of our favorite brands. I was so confident this would be a great watch that I nearly bought two of them. I do love the design but quality and performance supersedes all other criteria in my book. A well designed boat isnt worth the paper it's drafted on if it's sitting on the bottom due to shoddy craftsmanship. The SEIKO 5 Automatic is a perfect example of how greedy executives turn loyal customers into scathing reviewers.<br /><br />Specifically, the crystal is... Well... It isn't crystal. In fact, I'd be very surprised if its anything more than a low grade acrylic. I've bought dime store sunglasses that are more scratch resistant. I'm not exaggerating. I've had a Seiko Divers Automatic for over 25 years. I'll swear to leaving it in a drawer for weeks and it was still ticking when I pulled it out. That<br />may be a bit of an exaggeration but... \\"Automatic\\" as it is applied to the SEIKO 5 means the piece will automatically stop some time between placing it on your night stand and fumbling for it when the alarm goes off the next morning. On the otherhand, if you are the compulsive time snchronizer type(c'mon you know you're out ther), then you may have found your match. As a field watch lover I was pleased with the size and weight of the SEIKO 5 but forget about using it as one. The luminescent paint used is the worst I've seen. It stays fairly visible for about 30 minutes but after that you'll need the flashlight app on your phone which of course defeats the purpose.<br /><br />In case you are wondering, I have had the piece authenticated. At first, I was certain that I had obtained one of the many Feikos floating around but to my astonishment, it was real. I'd love to get my hands on a bogus one to compare the two.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you're looking for a stylish poser with the name we used to trust and don't plan to wear it outside the comfort and safety of your bedroom, this is the watch for you. I honestly don't know why reviewers have given this watch anything higher than a two star rating. Do you actually wear the watch or just shelve them in a display case? Maybe I'm just old fashioned in my practicality.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|This is a good album.  I know alot of folks don't like this style of music for Paul or in general but if you compare it to most stuff coming out now days it's great!  Nice relaxing music.  I have certainly heard worse!
B007EC27QM|5.0|Works great. Very functional and large enough to see without any difficulties. Would recommend to anyone looking for a calculator app.
0807014273|5.0|This is life-changer upon one's mindset for facing the trials in life. A truly awesome book. I first received this book as a gift and when I saw the title I knew that this was a book that I would never have bought for myself because of the title \\"Man's Search for Meaning\\". Because as a Christian I understand the meaning of life. But this book deepened my understanding of adversity and I found it to be of great value. I then ordered two more books; each for 2 men serving life in prison and I hope this turns their despair to joy.
B004MPESSY|5.0|Seen the original and was shocked and awe. But the remake has a twist that was not expected to be seen.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Excellent 3rd book.  More intriguing than The Girl Who Played With Fire.  Hopefully both books will become movies to be released on DVD's.
0385344228|5.0|Brief summary and review, no spoilers.<br /><br />Andy is the number two man in the District Attorney's Office and when a young boy named Ben is stabbed to death in a local park, he decides to handle this potentially high publicity case himself. However, as soon it soon becomes apparent that his 14 year old son Jacob may be involved, a new prosecutor is substituted in and Andy and his wife Laurie's life becomes a nightmare. Andy is put on paid leave while Jacob is put on trial.<br /><br />Is Jacob guilty? Is it possible to inherit \\"murder genes\\" or a propensity to murder? What responsibility do we owe our children? And what would you do if your child was accused of a murder and you weren't sure if they were guilty or innocent?<br /><br />These are all questions that are raised and dealt with in this novel.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book because I found it a page-turner and I was really impressed by the accuracy in the depiction of the majority of the courtroom scenes. Those are usually so wrong in novels and it's a shame because this novel shows you that it is just as entertaining to get it right. I also thought that the level of tension was consistent with just the right amount of foreshadowing to keep me turning the pages. I've been in a bit of a reading slump but this got me right out.<br /><br />In critique, I never really felt like we knew Jacob, but that may have been more of an intentional decision made by the author. For me though he always seemed more a background character, with the main focus being on Andy. I also thought that there was a contrivance at the end of the novel involving a young girl, but I understand why the author needed to have that happen.<br /><br />Still, despite the critiques, I enjoyed the novel a lot and would give it 4 1/2 stars.<br /><br />Recommended. It's one of those book you'll know right away if it's your cuppa or not. Just start reading and if you're hooked then this is the book for you.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was happy with the end of the book, I read a review that mentions that this is a new age cinderella, I have to say I do not know if cinderella will be this sexually open, but I love the books and I will re-read them later on.
0465011047|5.0|A great read.  Here is living proof of the evilness of the Kim dictators.  They not only convict those that oppose them, but also imprison the families of the convicts.  It would be like my father committing a crime, and then having the whole family pay for it.  When they put you in prison, they give you little food, work you hard for ten years, and then hope you die.  If there are any self doubters of this regime, they should read this book and explain why volunteer returnees were subjected to this abuse.<br /><br />There is lots of talk about Syria, Iran, and North Korea these days.  These are evil regimes who kill their citizens.  Any person opposing these dictators are ruthlessly gunned down or put in prison.  Perhaps, if they could overthrow this regime, the world would be a better place.  A great read on the hermit kingdom.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is the second book of the trilogy, I have to say, that I never expencted to be so interested on a book of this kind before, I cannot put it down.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|Loved the story, disliked the film. With bad dialogue and over the top holllywood fx, a great franchise has been taken down a notch. Great concept, poorly written.

It covers all the things you need to know to get started and provides sources to take you beyond.This book will appeal to anyone looking to grow there own food with a sustainable system that will fit in you backyard or anywhere you can setup a fish tank and provide light for the plants. Great project for the whole family.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I bought this for my wife because it was a NY Times bestseller and was mentioned on the radio. I had no idea that I'd purchased a book that would completely offend her, and assault her morality and sense of decency. When she insisted that I read it to know what she was talking about, I was ashamed. And not only was it offensive, Ms. James' writing is no more than a college freshman trying to shock people in order to make a splash. Well, I may be in the minority, but this was a poorly written novel that is better suited for the \\"Dear Penthouse, I never thought that something like this could happen to me...\\" trash heap. A little warning in the future for such claptrap would be greatly appreciated, Amazon.

B007HO392S|2.0|I just purchased this cd yesterday and I must say that my first impression is not great. I have all Carrie's cd's to date and have liked all the others immensely, but this album is a little too dark and pop sounding for my taste. I understand Carries desire to cross over the boundaries of country & pop music, but I just didn't like enough songs on the album on my first and second listening to make me recommend this cd to anybody. There are only about 3 or 4 songs that I would consider truly country sounding and the rest aren't really strong enough to be pop hits - this album simply misses the mark
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very good read. Because I liked the book I was able to get my grandkids to also read it. They both also liked all 3 of the hunger game books.

B001L51RQE|4.0|there are no track listings on the DVD's which was disappointing.The relationship between the band members is an interesting insight explored in the 2nd DVD - the CD's supplied give a recording of the DVD show - is this necessary? I would have preferred the original studio recordings. A good addition to my collection and one which I will visit again and again to try and inspire my next generation of music afficionados (i.e. teenage kids) with the greatest era of music - 70's and 80's - a bit like trying to poke butter up a hedgehog's bum with a hot needle. Not that I've ever tried...

B001R4METS|5.0|My first ever Genesis album bought in vinyl, I still listen to it occasionally. Slightly darker than Selling England or Foxtrot but not as weird as Lamb. I have given up trying to interpret its meaning (Thank God) and a work that easily transports me back to the 70's and I'm glad I have the digital CD version. Give it a listen...
B007J4T2G8|2.0|other than the explicit detail of sexual encounters, i dont see what all the fuss is about. christian is the only character thats remotely interesting, the rest are bland. the storyline has the potential to be interesting but its poorly told and seems like the author hides this behind such detailed sexual enciunters. it  ends decent but didnt inspire me to want to buy the next book.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was published mainly for the shock factor.It is not a well written book. I found myself reading and wondering how I could fix the paragraphs and wording to make it more believable and interesting instead of actually reading the content.It's pretty bad when your mind starts wandering while you are reading.There is very little substance ,just sex.... kind of like watching a porno.
0802798225|5.0|wow, i can't believe its taken me this long to write a review. i read perfect chemistry along with the other 2 books to the sequel rules of attraction, and chain reaction. this book was such a relatable book written from 2 perspectives, a gang member, loving, caring, and sexy mexican boy alejandro and a perfect, caring, smart white not at all as it seems Brittany. this book shows the truth about stereotypes and the importance of reputations. its realistic and takes place in the suburbs on the outskirts of chicago. this book is so amazing and is easy to relate to weather your mexican, white, a gang banger, rich, live on the south, or north, have a handicapped sister, or not. and if you've never been in love or no what it is this book will show you. romantic, funny, INTRESTING and to be honest it was the first and last book to make me cry. THIS BOOK IS FOR BOYS AND GIRLS. just because its a romance doesn't mean a boy won't love it! we had to do book clubs in my class and didn't want to read another crappy school book so i suggested this to the group  because i knew they would love it! sure enough the other 2 girls AND GUY loved it! of course they're reading the other 2 asap! BEST BOOK IVE EVER READ. its in all cps libraries if you care to check it out and also at barnes and noble. i guarantee you'll fall in love.

0545265355|2.0|I am surprised that these books were written for teens. They are gruesome! Perhaps I have a more active imagination than others, but when I read it's like I'm watching a movie in my mind. I could not believe some of the things that happened to children in these books. It's a morbid flashback to the Roman coliseum, but the atrocities are inflicted on children by children.<br /><br />The books are an easy, fast read. I read the whole trilogy in 3 days. The first book is definitely the best from a literary perspective. It has a decent plot, suspense, climax and resolution. Book 2 is basically the same plot as Book 1 just with different horrors. Book 3 just feels like the author is rushing to finish the series. It's predictable, poorly written, and once again gruesome. The stuff of nightmares.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|sooo much fun. I enjoyed the variety of games. many of the games were challenging. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to have fun

B003O86FMW|3.0|Excited to read the second book after The Hunger Games but this one is a huge let down. No where near the page turner of the first book. I really enjoyed the movie but when the second movie comes out I'll wait till it hits cable based on this book.
044655667X|1.0|It is hard to describe how cheap and crass is the writing in this book.  The author thinks he makes some clever winks at the reader, but it is just weird hubris.  The legal stuff is ridiculous, any attorney won't be able to stomach it (or anyone with a passing familiarity with legal proceedings).  The plot twists are as bad as in any pulp fiction.  God. awful. book.  And to make it all the worse, there is a smug picture of the weird author in the back.  Gross.
1250008409|4.0|Having meditated on and off for the better part of a decade, the challenge always arises - I don't have hours a day to spend on this practice, and what happens when I inevitably miss due to travel or family, and how do I do this with two kids under the age of 10 screeching like banshees?<br /><br />Andy Puddicome wrote the book that bridges the gap between the 18 hour monastic meditation tradition and the 18 second focus that we tend to have in our lives as engaged Westerners. The book is extremely practical, guiding the reader through exercises that are both easy to try and tough to master. The beauty, however, is that the practices take 10 minutes or less. Puddicome makes you feel like it is OK to do something as opposed to nothing, and he recognizes and embraces the fast pace of Western life by offering up methods that are usable anytime, anywhere, and don't consume hours of your day.<br /><br />Maybe you are not into \\"meditation\\", and thus the view of \\"mindfulness\\" that Puddicome espouses makes you feel more comfortable, less New Age, or just more normal. Regardless of whether you call it meditation, mindfulness, awareness or mental calming, the approach is something that anyone can do, and Puddicome sets you up for success.\\"
0143039431|5.0|This brilliantly written, poetic, profound and highly political book suffers terribly from its status as \\"classic\\" which, unfortunately, frightens away many readers who would enjoy it immensely if only the writer were new or unknown.<br /><br />With millions of Americans again thrown out of their homes by banks, those great inhuman \\"monsters\\", the themes and plot of Steinbeck's immense reflection on the violent changes wrought by capitalism - and man's enduring struggle to retain his dignity and humanity in the face of repeated disaster - speak more directly to us now than perhaps at any time in the past fifty years.<br /><br />Read or reread it. Give it to your children. (Tell them it's by some guy you've never heard of but think is really amazing.)<br /><br />Above all, forget that it's a classic. That smells of dust - while this book, powered by rage and poetry and astonishing humor, pulsates with life.
0345803485|1.0|Ah, the infamous Fifty Shades. I'd heard so much, had to check it out.<br /><br />The first thing that struck me about this book was that it reads like a young girl's fantasy relationship. The devestatingly handsome man with dark secrets, the multiple, mindblowing orgasms, the intensity of the feelings. I agree with those who can't believe this is coming from a grown woman's mind. I felt embarrassed for the person who wrote this, it's so immature it's the kind of thing a person would disown when they grow up.<br /><br />The author also keeps repeating herself. Limited vocabulary for me equals limited enjoyment, so even if this book were as sophisticated and mature as all get-out, I'd still be complaining. To have to endure repetition on top of immaturity made reading doubly painful. Considering the subject matter of the book, I guess you could call it the right frame of mind to be in. Har har.<br /><br />I really don't get why this book is so popular-- it isn't the first to address these topics, and without any familiarity with the subject matter I'd still venture a guess and say it's not the best at doing so. Now that I've read Fifty Shades I don't know how people are actually telling people that this is their reading material. In broad daylight, with no shame. It's porn, for crying out loud! Graphic, pages long sex scenes, full-out porn is the #1 bestseller. Has the world gone mad?

0553381709|5.0|A Storm of Swords, being the third book in the series, had given me many expectations. Martin had to continue the many stories from the following books, while giving me a reason to want to read this as a new book, and not just yet another part of a very long tale. Why should I care about these characters and what happens to them? Will the maturity and lack of respect for the readers interests still suck me in like it did in the past (lack of respect being that we all wanted Eddard Stark to live, but for some reason having him taken away from us engaged us even more than if he had been saved)? Will Martin be able to captivate me with a new story while successfully merging past events?<br /><br />Move over life, because this 900+ page novel (or should I call it a collection of novels bunched into one huge masterpiece)is going to take over.<br /><br />Martin makes each character unique, recognizable, and with few exceptions, interesting. He kills off characters at appropriate times- meaning that although it is unexpected when he makes this decision, you are not just upset or pleased, but also satisfied with the amount of knowledge you have gained until that point- never does he make the reader feel like he introduced a character just to kill them off. The past events are continued successfully, and, to the readers enjoyment, most of the continued stories have hidden meanings and reasoning behind them that you would have never imagined.<br /><br />Basically, I don't generally enjoy fantasy books because of their predictability, lack of depth, and lack of great sequels, but Martin has put me in my place, because this series in unpredictable, unimaginably dense, and it is almost as if these books are not actually books- it is as if they already existed and are just glimpses into this amazing, entertaining world.

B0036EH3UC|4.0|Science fiction television is an interesting bag; one where all it takes a brief look at the multitude of space-centric serials and films throughout the years to realize that almost any genre of entertainment can be accomplished within the confines of a ship traversing the void of the universe.  I'm a huge fan of the latter Treks, Babylon 5, Farscape and even the (original) Star Wars films.  Naturally the reimagined Battlestar Galactica has been on my radar for some time now and I actually waited to purchase the complete collection rather than to piecemeal the odd seasonal releases.<br /><br />Last night represents my completion of the program from miniseries on through to series finale and I have spent the past 24-hours attempting to sort through the experience so as to assemble a review containing (hopefully) not quite as much drama as the series itself.<br /><br />To begin at the beginning, the 2004 miniseries/ pilot of Battlestar Galactica is one of the finest pieces of science fiction television in recent years.  The pacing is spectacular, the acting top notch, the plot epic in scope and it leaves the viewer anticipating, no craving the series that would follow.  I was especially impressed with the special effects; as it was extremely difficult to tell if the space scenes/ battles were CGI, miniatures, or some combination of both.  Camera work that included wild pans and off-timed zooms added to the realism and unlike so many contemporary space opera pieces, avoided the tendency to show scenes from a perspective that could not be achieved with an actual physical camera.<br /><br />Couple this to a score that is mournful and haunting and top it all off with some major motion picture acting and what results is the formula for a show Time magazine would hail \\"the best show on television\\".<br /><br />The first season picks things up quite seamlessly and introduces a whole new set of problems for our primary cast of characters to work through.  All the while the viewer is treated to a believable and interesting unveiling of the mysterious Cylon attackers who dropped humanity to their proverbial knees in the beginning of the miniseries.<br /><br />The second season carries on this tradition of excellence but the third takes a slight dip.  The fourth and final season starts out nearly as strong as the pilot then fizzles out- horribly.  Without giving up spoilers, let me do my best to justify my opinions.  The miniseries was solid space opera through and through but as the show gained momentum it took a decided turn for the dramatic.  That interesting and purposely-unstable camera work I praised in the miniseries becomes heavily overdone by about the midway point of the show, particularly in moments of close-cropped character interaction.<br /><br />There is no denying that character development is always in the forefront here but oftentimes to the point where the fact that the show takes place in space with technology that can allow matter to surpass the speed of light are totally irrelevant in favor of political squabbling, odd religious overload and sexual escapades that could make a college frat house jealous!  Individuals who fear technobabble need not be afraid to invest in Ronald D Moore's Battlestar Galactica so long as they are willing to accept a whole lot of tragedy-driven prime time television drama.<br /><br />I mentioned my ranking of the seasons and to that end, by the third season space and technology had all but faded entirely in favor of an Indiana Jones/ Allan Quartermain style adventure of piecing together prophesies from ancient texts and visiting booby-trapped abandoned temples in effort to piece together a map to find the planet earth.  What follows is a bit of messiness- again I will avoid direct spoilers in this review but will say that when the show reaches its ultimate conclusion, it does make one wonder what the point to some of this section actually was.<br /><br />The fourth season starts off with renewed vigor; laying down all sorts of layered mystery and prophecy amidst some pretty intense battle sequences.  The problem, in my opinion, is that the show's finale fails to live up to the intrigue presented.  There are multiple instances of unsolved mystery, foreshadowing that never pans out and strong evidence that the show's writers did not have an entire story arc mapped out ahead of time.<br /><br />Especially troubling is that the heavy-handed religious integration that is so overwhelmingly force-fed to us throughout the span of the show ends up fizzling out by the end.  Considering its implied importance all along, one really starts to suspect that it will play a crucial role in the conclusion of the series yet its significance is never fully fleshed out.<br /><br />In all, despite was looks like a laundry list of complaints, BSG is undeniably entertaining television.  While many of the writing choices are odd at best, the viewer can consistently count on wonderful acting, amazing visuals and some intense drama from start to finish.  When compared to campy and predictable entries to the genre like Stargate Atlantis, Battlestar Galactica does manage to achieve a sense of grandness typically associated with big-budget motion pictures rather than weekly television.  The tragedy, as far as I'm concerned anyway, lies in thinking what the show could have been had it not become bogged down with political and religious agendas; a true continuation of the vibe established in the miniseries.<br /><br />The material certainly does nothing to discredit the original series and in fact adds several welcomed layers of depth to the human versus our artificially intelligent robotic creations (a theme visited in everything from The Terminator to The Matrix to Captain Power).  Time magazine wasn't too far off in their assertion but there was still a bit of room for improvement.newed vigor; laying down all sorts of layered mystery and prophecy amidst some pretty intense battle sequences.

0451169514|3.0|Dear God, where do I begin a review on such an enormous book? My own emotions regarding this novel are still in flux. I mean, yes, it was well written. Yes, the depth of characterization was simply awe-inspiring to a pulp-drivel writer and avid reader such as myself. Yes, the ideas were creative and the evil being It was well imagined, but I cannot give this work, as potent as it was, anymore stars without cringing. I do want to make it clear- It, at least the first three-quarters or so, was nearly an amazing book. I couldn't put it down. That said, the ending (as other reviews have stated) was, although I hesitate to say \\"bad\\", it was lacking to a significant degree. The realization of the true form of It (the deadlights) was actually satisfying, but the rest of the cosmology of the book's universe was grotesquely pathetic. It seems a giant Turtle had a belly-ache which produced the universe, and it seems this Creator has a penchant for human cussing. I kid you not. This Turtle character made me drop the book in disgust. It simply ruined the entire serious nature of the book, making it a dopey satire worthy of scorn by the ghost of Lovecraft. King's cosmology is disgraceful compared to Lovecraft's, who had a much more fully realized, potent, and SERIOUS pantheon of \\"divine\\" creatures. The ending really ruined the book. Despite its bloated length and many pointless side-plots (the Derry Interludes, for instance) I still would have given this five stars if not for the terribly anti-climatic ending and the truly sickening scene where Beverly allows herself to be deflowered by the boys in order to find their way out of the sewers. I was genuinely pissed at King for this useless scene. What a disgrace! Apparently he gets a kick out of underage sex. I enjoyed the Shining and Skeleton Crew immensely, so I guess I'll read more King, but I was disappointed with this book. It had so much potential! It was worth reading, though.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the glowing reviews I fully expected a good read.  Yet I am half way through and just can't go on.  Even friends told me how gripping it was but I'm clearly missing it.  The writing is tremendously repetitive and besides climaxing on every second page, she also blushes, doesn't eat and watches him quirk up his lip on every second page.  Some of my favorite reads have been The Help, Secret Life of Bees, Saving CeeCee Honeycut, Girl in Translation, Major Pettigrew's Last Stand, .  If you liked these, save your money.  This book is for the most part kinky porn with an all but absent story line....at least one that I am not willing to read on to discover.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|Great plot, great characters and it was all done very well. I esp like the love story between Sarah and John. Loved it!
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|I saw a similar item advertized in a magazine at a higher price.  Thought it was a bit too expensive and thought I would try some surfing to see if I could find it cheaper somewhere else, but never got around to it.<br /><br />Then I needed to buy a friend a thank you present and found out they were a huge Harry Potter fan so thought this was the perfect idea.  Found this item on Amazon and decided it was worth a try, and also bought one for myself.<br /><br />After reading some of the reviews saying how difficult it was to program, I was a bit nervous.  However, it was a lot easier than I expected.  Some of the commands can be a little more difficult to use - the twisting clockwise and counterclockwise (which I used for volume control) can be a little challenging but does work after a try or two.  All of the others seem to work consistently.<br /><br />Pros: fun case and instructions included, works with many different types of devices, fairly easy to program<br /><br />cons: only 13 different commands (between my tv and cable box, they were quickly used up); reprogramming can be a little difficult so plan ahead on which commands you want to use for each function<br /><br />Overall, I think it is a great product and would recommend it for any blossoming wizards!!

B0017KIBAI|5.0|Oh Nintendo. It's quite amazing how you've always been a consistent force in the video game industry, and even more interesting, is the fact that your company created what is often considered one of the best controllers ever produced.<br /><br />With ergonomics and storage in mind, Nintendo created the gamecube controller with the intentions of making a controller that didn't force your hands into odd positions, while offering the maximum amount of control and buttons that is humanly possible. The left control stick was placed in the natural position for the thumb, with a nice amount of rubber placed on top to prevent slipping, as well as a C-stick specifically for camera control, kept out of the way of the main action. An additional Z button which is tiny, but quick and easy to press, allows for quick and precise actions, while the L and R triggers have both soft triggers, which activate when partially pressing down the trigger, and a hard trigger when you press it down and pass a certain threshold. The A, B, X, and Y buttons are all extremely responsive, as one would expect them to be, and the A and B button are both located in a spot that doesnt force you to overextend your finger.<br /><br />IF I had any real issues with this controller, it would be the following:<br /><br />A. The d-pad is terrible. It was put in as a control method for any extra 4 buttons the game would need that you dont need to control the game using the control stick<br /><br />B. The X and Y button are easy to lose track of, and to this day, I still sometimes confuse the position of these two buttons.<br /><br />One final thing to note is that this controller has an extra long cord, approximately 10 feet long, it allows you to play from rather large distances, which is a definite plus.<br /><br />Honestly a magnificent controller, and easily one of the better controllers I've ever owned.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|The built-in feature that occasionally reminds me to use the app is annoying. I don't appreciate being bagged by an application.
B00280LYHS|5.0|This book is the best out of the five Percy Jackson and the Olympians series. It's is very action packed and a book everyone would like.
B003OJBWGK|2.0|I'll admit upfront I didn't listen to the whole album.  After three tracks sounding all alike I gave up.  How much reverb does a voice need?  The thing sounds like it was recorded in a sewer.  One man's mumblecore is another man's Citizen Kane, whatever floats your boat.  Maybe I'm too old for this kind of thing but it just didn't speak to me.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The book was really good. Mocking jay is very surprising and exciting. It is a must read. Katniss's actions are unpredictable. This book is amazing.
B005LCYR7Y|5.0|All that can be said as far as i can say is this is one of the best books i have read for a long time i just did not want the book to finish but could not wait to find our the ending so not a waste of money
B003K8MI4K|5.0|The best ever.  David tennant is the best Doctor.  Catherine Tate was perfect as Donna Nobel.  Couldn't have asked for a better pairing.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game could never be any better if they had a sequll to this I would buy it or get it if it was free this game is so addicting I cant talk anymore must keepp playing bye y'all
1401235417|5.0|This story sets up the current \\"Night of the Owls\\" storyline covering all the Batman books. In this story, Batman finds himself facing a sinister new villain (later named \\"Talon\\") who knows much about his history. I've been an avid reader of comics for years and I can honestly say this was the second story I read where I was pretty sure Batman was toast in it (\\"Knightfall\\" was the first). Trapped in an obstacle course in some unknown place, Batman is stalked by the Talon and a sinister group of crazies who know all about him. As the story continues we find that Gotham and the Wayne family had a history even Bruce was unaware of. While this is a good story, I have to admit the \\"Night of the Owls\\" that I've seen so far is actually better simply because there isn't one Talon after him, now it's dozens of them. If one almost killed him, how can he defeat them all? Grab this one and enjoy this \\"reboot\\" from the new 52 that actually works.
B000BEZQ0Y|4.0|I've now watched this 5 to 8 times.  It's so good...we often are graced by more then we think we deserve, as Elizabeth is.
0345803485|1.0|This is an eye rolling, lip biting, foil ripping read.  The Red Room of Pain could inflict nothing as painful as reading this book.<br />I will need to slap the inner goddess should I ever meet her.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I've never seen an author so eager to finish a book - specially a saga - than Suzanne Collins. Fantastic Hunger Games, good Catching Fire and Mockingjay is... a draft. Still trying to understand how she condensed actions in to make it seem an incoherent dream. Waiting for the missing pages...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a great story, it really gets you in. You can smell the scene, feel the emotions and get sore calves from climbing the stairs in the silo. Great concept, well worth the read.
B004GYY714|5.0|Very Entertaining. I really enjoy playing music on my kindle while I read and play games.  I am a new kindle user and i am really enjoying it.
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|A bit disappointing compared to the original movie. It was very fragmented, and at times almost incoherent. There's too much reliance on computer generated special affects rather than plot and characters. Wished they focused more on the central characters, and less on the \\"wow\\" factor.

0345803485|5.0|This trilogy is addicting. I tell all my friends its like a Harlequin Romance with a little bit of smut thrown in. I am into my fourth go around of this trilogy. It seems that as soon as I finish book three, I need to get back to the beginning and how the characters met. Not the best writing in the world, but you certainly connect with the romance. I first bought the trilogy for my Kindle and then the paperbacks for my bookshelf. My 82 year-old mother just started reading book one...I'm anxious to get her take on all of it.

0385523912|5.0|Very well written. Not much I can say that hasn't already been said in the reviews. I've brought a few extra copies to give away and everyone else has loved it as well.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great variety of games for everyone. I enjoy them and so does my mom and sister. killed the battery hays.
0670023329|3.0|The story is amazing. But the mix of grammatical errors and the feeling of text book like references to other books makes it less pleasurable to read. The author refers to other books dozens of times. I have read most of the other books and they were good but I dont won't to read a book about other books. I want to read this book for THIS story.<br /><br />Editing was poor. I spotted at least a half a dozen to a dozen grammatical errors. I'm far from an English major but if I can spot them it is poor editing.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've been gaming for over ten years and never owned a pair of gaming headphones before.  I thought that the price combined with the lack of using them for anything else was just not worth it.  But I decided to jump in and many reviews took my to these.  I was also a little apprehensive about \\"wireless\\" headphones, my car Bluetooth is one thing, but expecting high quality out of a pair of wireless headphones just seemed like a reach. I WAS WRONG!<br /><br />These have an excellent range in my opinion, I can walk 30-40 feet away and have multiple walls/appliances in the liner sight and still get a signal.  I've only tried listening to music at these ranges though,  I have not tried to use the mic at max range.<br /><br />They are very comfortable on my head and do not give give any pain after extended uses.  The around the ear is very comfortable, I did notice that since the material is made out of some synthetic material, it does make my ears a little sweaty after an hour or so, to solve this just lift them up or let them hang around your neck for a minute.  Even just lifting them up and letting air circulate helps.<br /><br />After comparing most of the competition I found these to be an amazing pair. I WILL NEVER OWN CORDED EARPHONES FOR A COMPUTER AGAIN.  You don't notice until you use these how nice it is not having a cord running to your head.
0465011047|5.0|A very well written book. Anyone that wants to learn more of North Korean prison camps or life in the DPRK and then escape from DPRK needs to read this book.<br /><br />One of the better NK books out there. Well worth the new price, even though I'd buy it used because I'm cheap. lol
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have seen so many bad reviews on the books and about the writer. I couldnt put the books down. Thank god for my Kindle. I read for enjoyment and It has brought a ton of enjoyment to me and my Husband of 17 years.....He told me a few days ago after two weeks of reading them that (He is not a piece of meat) but he loves the attention. I have never read anything like this before and only saw Dr. OZ story on the book and open my Kindle and bought it. I loved Anastasia and Mr. Grey. I couldn't stop thinking about them and couldn't stop reading my book I had to find out what was next. I still keep thinking about them all the time. I think the writer did a great job of making two people so rememberable. Now I send my husband fun emails like they did. He hasn't read the books but he is sure glad that I did....:)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Awesome!!!!! Was one of the best books I have ever read!!! I wish there were more books like this available!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My 15 year old read the books and she was taling about it all the time so I thought I just finished reading a three book series and I had seen the movie with the kids and loved it, Great family time. Anyway, I still read the 1st book so that I didn't miss anything and im so glad it's been a while and didn't remember some of the movie. I couldn't put down book two and read it in two days. It's a has everything you want in a story and more. The thing I love most about it is, I can have great conversations with my teens and these days that is priceless.<br /><br />P.S. I just started on book 3.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an extremely useful ap. The choice of translations, the audio function, and ease of use is spectacular. I highly recommend it.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Just finished reading Fifty Shades of Grey, book three...enjoyed books one and two as well.  Hoping to see a book four very soon

B007SYWFRM|5.0|my grandson likes to play ice age village just as well as I do he enjoys the movie now very happy he can play the game
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book kept my attention right from the beginning.  It was well written with a twist ending! I always love a good court case that keeps you guessing until the end.  Worth your time to read.
0345803485|5.0|this book is a page turner.  i got it because of all the hype but was hesitant because of the low ratings.  however, i found it to be very interesting and fun to read!  never a dull moment.  i already ordered the other two book of the trilogy and am so excited to read what happens next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love all the choices of versions you can choose from. Also I like being able to highlight and bookmarks verses.
B00723NWJE|3.0|I'm a pretty big fan of Norah Jones, partly because she's been writing her own songs instead of hashing out old standards like a lot of other jazz singers. She's also ventured into pop and mainstream categories and that's all for the good. I liked \\"the Fall\\" because of the aforementioned reasons, and good solid songwriting to boot. This album has been billed as a break up album and it sounds every bit of it. To me, it gets a little hard to appreciate for this reason, as it feels like every song is personally for her, and about her life, and I feel a lot of an album's appeal comes from you, the listener, being able to relate to it.  I get and can appreciate songs of loss, heartache, pain and personal perseverance, but this album feels like I'm looking at Norah's life at the time, rather than being able to absorb the material personally. Also, all the songs are about some aspect of breaking up, which for me also gets a little tired. Others may feel differently.<br /><br />Musically also, the songs are just ok. Some of the chorus and bridge progressions get a little tired, but overall a fairly solid effort. I wouldn't call the album groundbreaking musically, more of a succession from past material. 3/5 stars
0307474275|1.0|This book is miserable, poorly written, painful to read on multiple levels: science, cryptography, language, plot, characters, logic. As a friend put it, there are so many twists in the plot that the novel resembles a mix of Femme a la Resille and Drawing Hands.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|One of the best books i have read and all for the price of $1.50 - unbelievable.<br />I rate this book up with Name of the Wind.<br />I wanted to read the book in one sitting - it draws you in and does not want to let you go.<br />Cant wait for the next in the series<br />If you like a strong main character and lots of action you cant go wrong.<br />Did I mention the price? $1.50 for a book of the is quality is amazing.<br />Buy it now!
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The pacing was very slow and plodding. The ending, when I finally reached it, was indecisive and anti-climatic. The premise was good, so I feel the book could, and should, have been so much better. A real let-down, after reading all the five star reviews.
B0080SZ0V8|4.0|I really like this game it has a lot of puzzles to do although I am having some trouble with it on my kindle fire
B00634GHJA|5.0|First time I used it, everything transfered perfectly and quickly.  I have tried a couple other apps for this and this one was the easiest!
1449389627|4.0|I can tell I'm reading a good book if, in the middle of it, I'm flooded with ideas and I have to resist the urge to put the book down and go make things happen. That happened numerous times reading The Myths of Innovation<br /><br />Mr. Berkun walks you through stories from creative people and tries to find commonalities between them, and, as the title indicates, debunks common misconceptions about how innovation and creativity work.<br /><br />At no point does Mr. Berkun give you a straightforward recipe for being innovative. Because there isn't one. Instead he throws out a whole bunch of things to think about and you have to apply it to your circumstances.<br /><br />The closest to recipes is a section on \\"Creative Thinking Hacks\\", little shortcuts to get people thinking about problems in new ways. This was my favorite section.<br /><br />My second favorite section was the bibliography. That's another way to tell if you've just read a good book, if you finish it and immediately want to read more about the subject. This section gave me plenty more to investigate.<br /><br />If there's one thing I didn't like, I thought the section on idea generation was pretty weak. He makes the point -- which I agree with -- that having a good idea is actually a very small part of the Innovation process. However, it's still the first thing you have to get done before you can do anything. This section consisted mainly of a recap of a somewhat-obscure classic that I had trouble tracking down to read more on it.<br /><br />Although as I mentioned above, the ideas seemed to come to me just reading about people coming up with ideas. Maybe I'm just making it too hard.<br /><br />Overall, top-notch reading. There are no easy answers here because there are no easy answers anywhere. You have to find them; this book will get you started.
B005IZLPMY|4.0|I did not know what to expect from this one at all. I vaguely knew Captain America's origins, but he's never been a superhero that caught my interest. I fell in love with the character over the course of the film. Steve Rogers is simply a good person who goes out and does the right thing, even if it means great risk to himself. It's hard not to rally around a character like that.Plus, it's a fun film. The bad guy (Red Skull) is over the top. Captain America's team, the Howling Commandos, are a diverse group of competent soldiers and wisecrackers.Great patriotic stuff!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|This app plays my Movies on my Coby Very smoothly no buffering or choppynes! I recomend this app IF you like to watch movies on the go!
B005FISC52|5.0|Great viewing this would have to be the best from all of the one tree hill seasons. I loved all the others but this one has so much drama,humour,reality and happiness all in one. A most for all one tree hill fans as well as a short scene with the return of Lucas Scott himself.Lots of tears,laughs and happiness all in one.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I only have 2 negative things to say: Firstly, the plot does drag a bit at times. I didn't much care, because I was invested enough in the characters and the setting that I wanted to see what happened next. Secondly, on my Kindle Touch, the font size for this book is TINY. I was able to bump up the font size several notches to make it readable, but then any time I switched to a different book, the font was so large there were only 10 lines on the screen. Didn't stop me from reading the book, but it was annoying.<br /><br />Negatives out of the way, here are the positives: It's a wonderful dystopian novel that had me really interested in and invested in the lives of the characters. Even the biggest \\"villan\\" of the later part of the novel becomes understandable, if not likeable. The story also offers up hope again and again, even in the crushingly dismal setting. Sometimes it's  false hope, but not always - and that's part of what made the story so gripping.
0765367297|5.0|Many books have one climax, and it takes a while to get into the book, without just dropping it and trying yet again to find a book. But this book is different it is exciting from the get go! This book is centered around a boy named John who is specially selected to be apart of a new military training starting from when they are six years old. This book is the prequel to the award winning Halo game series. If you are someone who loves a thrilling book, or books about scifi, or even military based book this one is for you! It will capitivate you from start to finsih!! I give this a 10 out of 10. For eric Nylund does an amazing job with this book, so well even the company who made the games has accepted it as its own back story to the enticing character of John-117.
B000Y11BAS|4.0|I was satisfied with this purchase.  The disc was actually in better shape than described.  The jewel case was not in great shape, but that was as described.  The disc was, as stated, in better shape than described, and played as if it was brand new.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Upon receiving a text from a friend who recommended this book, I was rather hesitant and unsure about starting a book... I have children and finding time for myself is almost impossible... I pulled up Amazon and read the first few paragraphs and was so intrigued that I bought the first book immediately... As with the initial reaction I couldnt wait to read the next book... This series of books is amazing and I could not stop reading until I finished the third book... I highly recommend it to EVERYONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001HBYH9Q|5.0|Julia Roberts is one of my favorite actresses. No matter who or what she does she is the best. Her smile is so great
0345803507|5.0|This was a great written book just when you want to put it down you can't. The first few paragraphs and you knew you were hooked it was like you were watching the 2 main caracters through tunnel vision, like you were there as a ghost or something. I really hope there are more Fifty Shades coming the way the book ended there should be !
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Very fun, does require in game purchases fire best results...  But good enough to get me to make in game purchases to upgrade my character and keep playing...
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Trespassing is AMAZING from start to finish. You can't sit down or stop moving for the first half of the album. I normally don't listen to a lot of dance music, but these songs are like no other combined with Adam's rock spirited voice. Each time you listen, you'll find a new favorite. The ballads towards the end of the album or gut wrenchingly perfect also. Adam Lambert's sophomore album must buy for any listener.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Very well done-good plotweaving-the ending is a little bit expected, but there is mystery throughout. Matt Damon and Emily Blunt are very good actors and actresses.
0062082353|3.0|It wasn't the best book ever. Wasn't horrible. Chris' views are a little out there but I think he mostly told a truthful story. Although, there were a few times where it was pretty clear that either Chris exaggerated, the Navy edited some passages or important evidence was left out. The book did contain a lot of excitement!
B0051MKNV8|4.0|interesting if you like exciting movies without a lot of violence. Bradley Cooper does a good job, but it's also not his best acting job. Interesting for types that like to get ahead and are interested in seeing the consequences of using less traditional means.
B002U0KHMY|5.0|very intriguing plot planned out thru the whole 3 seasons, highly recommended to people who want to watch something with essence, not just to waste time on the TV.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|The Social Network describes the experience of a generation. It is epic and very well done. Good acting and plot twists.
0345803485|5.0|Excellent light reading. Beware,this is everything that they say it is! Just be careful when taking it in the public because others will curiously grab to read the cover.
B00065VTU4|5.0|I tend to find \\"deluxe\\" editions a hit and mix affair; sometimes they fall very flat, indeed.  This Deluxe compilation, however, is first-rate all the way.  The remastering of the original album is strong; the additional tracks on disc one are worth a listen; above all, the concert on Disc Two is extremely strong: some of the very best live Clapton out there, including a good sampling of material that ranges from early solo-Clapton to Derek & the Dominoes, and even a bit of Cream thrown in for good measure.  And Clapton's guitar work here is very fine.  Even if you already own a copy of the non-Deluxe version of 461 Ocean Boulevard, I don't think you'll regret up-grading to the Deluxe.  Highly recommended.
0345803493|5.0|Wow....so much more plot in the second book of the triliogy.  Still mommy porn,but more detailed character development.  Can't put it down!
B005LY4B0A|5.0|great puzzle game that keeps you thinking. Just wishing for more. This is my first app that has no problems,  allways runs smooth with no problems!  When do we get an update?
0307474259|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend.<br />I started following Mr. Taubes' suggestions last August 2011.<br />I just had my annual checkup (May 2012). The results are astounding.<br />My total cholesterol is down 30% from last year. And I am no longer pre-diabetic.<br />Not counting calories. Just not eating grains, white starchy vegetables or processed carbs.<br />Blood pressure and resting heart rate are down too. Lost 30 pounds since August.<br />Energy is up. I am swimming 2 miles now. Not bad for a guy still shaped more like a barge than like Olympian Phelps.<br />But making progress.<br /><br />Thanks Mr. Taubes.
B005CVWWJY|5.0|This is a marvelous novel despite those negative comments. Not everyone enjoys reading this novel. I would say two types of people love it like a gem. First type is, you should be around 30-40, male(not excluding the girls but I think the majority would be male). Second type is, you like/love video games and have been playing all types of consoles over 15 years. If you are both, JUST READ IT!<br /><br />Besides it as a novel, it really gave me a thinking that the world might someday be like what it described inside: the virtual world is a safer 'habitant', people would be using fake name to hide their real identity and personality for 'normal' social activities, and that most people will be behind a sophisticated computer to do virtually everything. It's more like something in a movie now. Just who knows?
B000683VI4|5.0|A beautiful movie from start to finish.  Well worth the money.  Acting is strong from the full cast.  This is a dramatic romance so that even my husband really liked it.
0142419400|5.0|Oh to be 17 in Paris and in love!  What a blissfully romantic, truly magical, winning and witty book this is.  The characters are likeable, well-rounded and real, the conflict is pitch perfect and the deliciously agonizing feeling of being in love is utterly engaging.  Buy it.  Read it.  Wish you hadn't read it so fast when you get to the end.
B002RI9O9G|5.0|This was an interesting novel as it was historical and fun.  I learned something as well which is always a bonus.  I enjoy this time period and learning of the immigrants.
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|why are some books not available in the Pacific regions  - These are more not available.<br /><br />No mention is made of the fact that we down here can't get the full collection of Kindle Books<br /><br />I would be pleased to hear when they will be made available and at least to be warned about this fact<br /><br /> !The Fountainhead, by Ayn Rand,The Gatekeepers, a book about the US college admission process - not available.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|It's an action flick, so the plot is thin.  Unfortunately, even the action was stretched out.  Like a fairly long running scene in an open alley.  The actual fighting scenes are great after all Gina is a MMA fighter. With the director and other cast I was just hoping for a bit more.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is a little too graphic for my taste. I wish I could delete it from my cloud. The short preview didn't give any indication of what was to come.
1600595871|5.0|The book gives nice overview from different kind of tecniques of making the books. Doesn't consist the exact tutorals, but gives a good general idea of many possibilities.<br />If you have done paperwork before you can easily transform the ideas to be useful for you right away. Inspired me.
0345803485|1.0|This book is truly disturbing and outrageous.  I laugh at this being a best seller.  It is a very poorly written, stupid story about a real sick Individual that is so unrealistic I have to roll my eyes.  I have never read any romance novels or anything close to this soft porn \\"plot\\".  I say plot lightly because THERE IS NO PLOT! I was happy to finally be done with this nonsense and I advise anyone to save their money.

0307951529|5.0|In The $100 Startup, Chris Guillebeau (author of The Art of Non-Conformity) accomplishes something unique. Instead of discussing how to grow, scale, leverage, and sell a new business--typical of much of the entrepreneurship literature--he focuses entirely on \\"microbusinesses\\": tiny, one- or two-person operations that maximize freedom and generate roughly $50,000 per year.<br /><br />Much of Chris' advice will benefit solo creatives who rely upon strong online presences. (Chris himself makes a living from writing, blogging, and selling digital guides.) But the stories that he culled from hundreds of interviews with entrepreneurs satisfied my need for a diverse proof-of-concept. Product- and service-based--online and offline--freelance, partnership, and employee-hiring: all such business are represented in this book.<br /><br />As a serial microbusiness entrepreneur myself, I especially appreciated Chris' discussion about the benefits of staying small, serving a tiny niche, and avoiding the hassles of hiring and managing employees. And his discussion of self-marketing, a.k.a. \\"hustling,\\" felt refreshingly ethical.<br /><br />Most importantly, The $100 Startup demonstrates that you do not need to go into debt to start a profitable and meaningful business. If more people took this advice in the realm of schooling--realizing that you don't need to go into debt to give yourself a higher education--then our world would benefit from an incredible boost in the number of creative entrepreneurs ready to tackle our problems, both big and small.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to teenagers, young adults, recent graduates, and transitioning adults who are eager to begin crafting a tiny yet profitable business, right now.<br /><br />-Blake Boles<br />Author, Better Than College<br />Founder & Director, Unschool Adventures

B007SGM084|1.0|This trilogy has got to be some kind of f-ed up conspiracy.  I think EL James woke up one day and decided to try an experiment.  She wrote a bunch of garbage and then threw it at us to see if we'd scarf it up.  It must be so entertaining that so many Americans did (it made the best seller list!!! WTF!)...  I can just see Ms. James now, slouching frumpliy at her computer and watching her bank roll over and over, and her laughing out loud saying, \\"silly idiot Americans!  See how they love to pay to eat garbage!  All I had to do was take a cheesy Lifetime movie script and mix it up with some porn, and those poor, oversexed Yankies got all hot and bothered for it.  Mwuhahha!\\"<br /><br />Well, I envision a different experiment - and my hypothesis is that one could recognize a SIZABLE delta between the average IQ scores of those who \\"LOVED\\" this trilogy and those who were overcome by disgust for it.<br /><br />I feel I'm in the latter category, although my IQ must be significantly lower now that I've read the book.  I gave in only because it was on the best seller list (WTF!!!).  I read it.  I regret it.  I am embarassed that I'm sitting here writing a review for it, but in the interest of sheer PATRIOTISM, I am trying to warn others off.... (anyone up for throwing these books in the harbor for the sake of national pride?)<br /><br />James trying to 1)write erotica and 2) set this thing in America -- It's like when the old perverts pretend to be 13 year old girls online...  It's just NOT RIGHT!!<br /><br />I absolutely LOL'd at all the britishisms in this book.  The characters and dialog are so embarassingly written!  It is so bad, I can't even begin to describe it.  And then, I LOL'd even MORE when I saw some of the \\"I LOVED THIS!\\" reviews of this junk... Seriously?  I suppose that if you've got no brain cells of your own, you can easily love this book.  But if you're a thinker, and you enjoy a GOOD story, with deep characters and a moving story line, this is NOT a readfor you.  You'll only hate yourself later for wasting your time on it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Let me start by saying that you need an open mind to read this book. While the words are literal and obvious, it is a somewhat metaphor, describing all the things that captivate us, influence of decision making capabilities, instill fear in us and most of all, the things that haunt us.<br /><br />You can take it in its literal sense, or you can go beyond and experience what Fifty Shades is about, the life of human beings...<br /><br />If you are looking for great literature, this is not for you, so do not even bother. If you are looking for an enjoyable read that will take you to the depths and breaths of many many (ooooh many) things... then give it a try.<br /><br />You will end up realising that we are all but fifty shades of something or the other....

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I loved the first series, and I was thrilled to discover that Season Two is astonishing!<br />It is subtler, has more implied violence than the first series, which I appreciate. We do not need to always see the blood spilling!<br />Benedict Cumberbatch IS Sherlock! I read Conan Doyle and I am a big fan of Basil Rathbone, I really thought nobody can beat the classics! I was disappointed at the choice of Downey Jr. and Law playing in the movies, I think it's a mistake and those movies are a complete mess. Cumberbatch shows what refined acting can do with this material! He is an extremely talented actor, I can't praise him enough! He brings depth, intelligence and enough quirky humor to make it watching him such a delight!!!Same to be said about Martin Freeman, his low keyed fine acting brings dimension to Dr. Watson( BTW thank you writing team for not emasculating Dr. Watson as Nigel Bruce did!) The 2 of them together are priceless!<br />I do have to add few words about Moriarty! I know things have been said about the Scandal in Belgravia episode for good reasons! But my favorite is The Reichenbach fall, the writing there is terrific and the duel between Sherlock and Moriarty is such a magnificent piece of acting! Andrew Scott is fantastic!!! You cannot imagine a scarier Moriarty, the blank stare and the aloofness,a chilling depiction of a modern terrorist!<br />The series benefits from a great supporting cast :Rupert Graves, Gatiss himself, Una Stubbs,to name just a few, is fast paced and looks like slick advertising for London!<br />The team Steven Moffat-Mark Gatiss does an incredible job in reinventing the character, making him modern and sexy, and being reverent to the books at the same time! Can we get more than 3 episodes, please?!
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Great trilogy. Believable characters with lots of adventure. Katniss is my kind of gal. It's adventure with a twist. I don't usually enjoy futuristic fiction but this was exceptional.  A story for both adults and teens. Leaves vampire stories for dead!

B003VANOFY|1.0|There's apparently a problem with the power connector on the headphones that can kep them from taking a charge. I have this problem on the phones I just bought and they're useless now. Searched on the net and found that this was a problem others have had as well. Now I have to deal with the hassle of a return -- after I just disposed of the packing materials. Can't believe Logitech is shipping this crap. Don't buy them!!!<br /><br />Update: Amazon honored the return despite my not having the packing materials (thanks, Amazon) so I took a chance and got a replacement instead of a refund, as I really like the headset except for the jack problem. The new headset worked fine at first but is developing the same problem -- I have to wiggle the USB power connector after inserting it or it won't connect for a charge. The jack -- and I know it's the jack and not the plug/cable because it shows the same symptoms with other micro USB cables -- is clearly going to fail completely at some point. Can't believe Logitech hasn't fixed this problem yet. Ruins an otherwise very fine headset.<br /><br />2nd update: the second recharge connector has failed, making the headset useless. I'm now forced to buy a wired (Sennheiser) set to replace them. That's 2 out of 2 headsets that have failed the same way on me. There's obviously a serious manufacturing/design problem for it to happen 2 out 2. DO NOT BUY THIS HEADSET!!!!

B002NZK5QY|2.0|First let me tell you how excited I was to watch this movie again after so many years...I was very frustrated from the moment  the disc went into the player!  There was background music playing and I could see them speaking but couldn't hear them.  Weird.  Ok so i checked the player, it was fine.  After fiddling with the menu for what seemed like 10 minutes, I got sound.  Good.  Let's watch the movie.  Chapter 23 ends.  Yep, just ends and I was like where is the rest of the movie???  There weren't two discs...where could the rest of the movie possibly be?  So I thought for a moment and I took the disc out and flipped it over.  There it was, 14 more chapters.  I don't think I have ever flipped a disc in my life...seriously.  OK, play... again background music and NO talking again.  Had to fiddle with it and the menu many more minutes.  It totally took away from the experience.  Very disappointed with quality.

B004YCKK6Y|3.0|Tim Roth stars as a twitchy, maligned bellhop in this wacky anthology of four loosely-linked short films. With a different director behind the wheel for each chapter, it shouldn't come as much surprise to hear this is an uneven tale that never settles on a firm identity for itself. The underlying theme is light slapstick suspense with a vibrant collection of supporting players, but each act also has its share of dark secrets and sinister overtones. The first two portions are colorful, but too thin for my taste. It seems like both had a solid beginning and ending in mind, and only set about painting by numbers to bring the two together. It's Robert Rodriguez's third act and Quentin Tarantino's closer, though, that drew me to the show anyway. Both serve as bite-sized capsules of both the best and worst traits and habits that have come to define each director. Rodriguez's arc, which naturally features both Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayeck (albeit in short cameos) is a middle ground of sorts between Spy Kids and Planet Terror. It's part kid-focused mayhem and part pulpy, black, gross-out trauma; an enthusiastic, if shallow, ride. Tarantino's adventurous final chapter is more dialog driven, with the director (of course) playing the leading role. Like a caricature of himself, he spends a good ninety percent of the scene spewing pop culture references and jazzy one-liners before the whole drama culminates in a jolting, blunt burst of adrenaline. Overall, Four Rooms is a mixed bag, and apart from the Tarantino chapter, none of the acts stand up particularly well. While fans of the director will no doubt love Quentin's arc, it's short enough that it would probably be just as easily - and effectively - viewed on YouTube or Vimeo.

B000XR4OC0|4.0|Yes they are overpriced.  But you have to consider that you are buying 2 pair-one for you and one for someone in need.  That makes it a worthwile price I think.<br /><br />I tried these on at nordstroms.  I also recomend trying them on before you buy.  I bought these to wear without socks and had to get 1.5 sizes smaller than my regular athletic shoes with socks.<br /><br />The fit is snug around the foot and the shoe is light so it feels like wearing slippers.  I have very flat feet and wear athletic shoes that correct my flat foot with a lot of arch support and stability so for me these shoes are too flimsy to wear all the time.  I wear them to work where I sit and if I am running to the store or somewhere quick.  But I would not wear them if I would be walking all day.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I have been using these headphones since Jan 2012 and I love them. I use them for walking, hiking, running, working out on the elliptical... The best is that they stay in my ears no matter how much I move and they don't hurt me. I can also pop them out of my ears quickly while still keeping them on my head. I often wear a hat on top of them and I haven't had any problem.<br /><br />The sound is great as well and I am always amazed at the good quality for headphones that were not that expensive. I am a heavy sweater and so far, they've survived all the water treatment. I'd say it is a pretty good deal.<br /><br />Update as of May 2013: They are still doing pretty good. I have had no issues at all. I have been using them at least twice a week in pretty sweaty work outs and I use them at work as well for meeting with clients.
0345803485|2.0|Have you ever hung on to a relationship just for the sex? There's no meeting of the minds there; no deep soul connection. Half the time, you're not even sure you like this person. You certainly wouldn't introduce him or her to your, say, more intellectual friends. They'd say you were slumming.<br /><br />Well, that's how I'd describe my experience of reading Fifty Shades. It's a kind of guilty pleasure. There's lots of sex and James is really good at writing about it (no mean feat). Nor is it a completely stupid book; it deals with themes of heterosexuality, intimacy and power in a raw, in-your-face way that's rare in popular fiction. But the characters are so stereotypical and boring. The dialogue--dull to the point of deadening (especially their emails). And cliché on top of cliché in style and storyline. No surprise it's a big hit, though, and kudos to James to pulling it off. Now who do you think should play Christian and Ana in the movie franchise???
B0084YAU86|5.0|As I watched the first season of \\"Sherlock,\\" my fondness for this show increased. From the opening moments in \\"A Study in Pink\\" to the Moriarty's stunning entrance in \\"The Great Game,\\" I knew I was witnessing the rebirth of an icon. Yes, Mr. Downing Jr.'s portrayal in Hollywood's version is admirable and entertaining, but to find the true spirit of Sherlock Holmes one need look no further than this series. However, to say that it was ever more than \\"darn good television\\" would have been pushing it. Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman put on a fantastic show, and ever so often the writing and acting gave small glimmers of greatness, but I was never tempted to say that the show had achieved lasting greatness (though to successfully transpose Holmes into the modern age was a feat in and of itself).<br /><br />However, with \\"The Reichenbach Fall,\\" I'm pleased to say that Sherlock has left far behind casual crime drama (good drama though it was) and has now entered the realm of true, incredible art. From the writing to the acting, to the gripping, gut-wrenching final moments (I don't know who deserves more credit, Cumberbatch or Freeman for displaying some amazing acting chops), I am pleased to say that this episode delivered some of the finest television I've ever had the privilege of watching. To go any further into how incredible this single episode is would do a dis-service to you, if you have read this review so far. Stop reading and watch. Really.

0307588343|5.0|Of all the recent spate of books on Lehman's collapse, this is it. Told from the inside by a trader, the author speeds along the path to the ultimate annihilation of Lehman Bros. It was a critical turning point when the merchant bank went bust, and seen from the inside, it was a crazy ride to hell. The author foresaw the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market well before the rest of Wall street, so made handsome profits by shorting them. He also made good profits by going long on Delta airlines at a time when the airline looked ready for the knacker's yard. It was thus a pity and a shame that the Lehman bank had ignored the warnings of sub-prime, and was caught holding the parcel when that market grounded (despite the authors' good works). The author calls it by a single wor5d: stupid, and he is so right. It doesn't take a genius to see that mortgages cannot be repaid by NINJA buyers. One telling incident occurs when the author visits a cafe near to one of the mortgage businesses, and talks to sub-prime salesmen. Their role was to package the mortgages into complex derivatives called CDOs (collateralized debt obligations) which might then be sold on to anyone stupid enough to see what they were: junk. Meanwhile, the rating agencies were approving the junk with AAA ratings! The whole corrupt edifice went south soon afterwards, taking Lehmans with it, and threatening the whole financial system. The tragedy is that we are all in the west still living with the debacle, and in anything, a further crisis looms in Europe with Eurogeddon, the final collapse of the euro currency. European banks were caught in dodgy mortgages as well, especially of new build office blocks and crazily inflated houses, but their losses have not yet been realised or crystallized on their balance sheets. They are also facing huge losses on their Greek, Portugese and Spanish bonds when Greece finally bites the bullet and leaves the Euro. Perhaps those other countries will follow leaving a shrunken core of EU members. And of course the EU is in the process of penalising its own productive industries by adopting stupid carbon taxes, which nobody believes in elsewhere in the (sane) world. This book is a wake-up call for all who believe that bankers rule the world: buy and be shocked!

B004EPZ03Y|5.0|(Originally posted on The Absentee Blogger)<br /><br />I finally had the chance to watch the new Muppet movie this past weekend. Yes, I am a life-long Muppet fan. Yes, I cried profusely. It made me think a lot, remembering my own childhood and part of the reasons why I am what I am today. I considered doing a review, but realized my feelings were more personal than a normal review would allow. Instead, I decided to do a mock letter to Jason Segel, who made the movie what it was. So, without further ado, my take on The Muppets.<br /><br />Dear Mr. Segel,<br /><br />I'm sure you have heard this countless times from every fan who has watched The Muppets movie, but I am, without a doubt, Walter. I danced to the theme song before I could even walk and watched religiously every week. Once we owned a VCR, my dad was forced to tape every episode and many of those tapes still survive today, albeit worn out and fuzzy from the years. Whenever I was asked what I was going to be when I grew up, my answer was I would be on the Muppet Show.<br /><br />The most traumatic episode of my young life came when I was 9 years old and my father told me Jim Henson had passed away. I was crushed. All my dreams were gone. While it was true there were several attempts to resurrect the Muppets over the interceding 20 years, they felt like the Moopets masquerading under the Muppet name. Something was always missing, the important elements that made them something more.<br /><br />I'll freely admit, I was skeptical when I heard you were going to give it another go. Why can't they just leave what's left of my childhood memories alone? My husband was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt and talked me into watching. I want to thank him for believing in you when I had given up and to you for making me love the Muppets again.<br /><br />You have captured perfectly the frustration every fan has felt over the past two decades. The sadness of 'our' Muppets disappearing to be replaced by what executives think we want. Muppets that had turned to crassness to cover the lost chemistry. All of us have been searching for the Kermit we knew and loved, suddenly absent from our lives and entertainment. You found him and brought him and the whole gang back.<br /><br />While it's true they now have to 'start from scratch' to rebuilt their audience among younger viewers, the real Muppets have never been forgotten by their fans. They inspired us to dream and believe. To act silly and enjoy life. Most of all, they taught us that if a pig and a frog can fall in love, a bear can tell jokes and a Gonzo can gather fans through 'performance art,' anything is possible.<br /><br />Normally I don't get so emotionally invested in movies. After all, they're only entertainment for a short period of time. This was more for me. It awoke every childhood memory. It made me believe in my dreams again. Thank you.<br /><br />From one Muppet fan to another, you did just what you set out to do.utives think we want. Muppets that had turned to crassness to cover the lost chemistry.

I am reading the stories in this book already and I find myself caught up in the vampire world of A.Rice again..<br />I do give a warning to the current flock of Vampire readers. This world that is created by A.Rice is very complex and mortals are the food of the vampire so be ready to see a darker more evil world than most current tales offer.

B004KKYX9K|4.0|Etremely interesting read.Engrossing subject matter and one of Jodi Picoults better stories.<br />I found the characters believable and the ending, while possibly predictable,quite satisfying.<br />In essence,not really thought provoking ,rathger an intertaining read.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I thought this would be an exiting romance for all ages but eventhough it's written ok I would not recommend it for readers over 25/30. Language use is not too bad at all and it sexual content is pretty limited. Which is fine but when I read the description I thought it would be a more exiting. I mean \\"losing a bet and being forced to live with someone for a month ????? kind of calls for some \\"intense\\" scenes one would think...but no... Again if you're a younger reader you may enjoy this book....

B0027Z9C2I|5.0|What can I say?<br /><br />The DVD arrived safe and sound and performed like a DVD should.<br /><br />Quality was fine and played with no problems,
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|I liked this movie, even in spite of all it's structural flaws (And there were many). The reason? Quite simply it's the cast. the way they bounce off one another, the way the dialogue is delivered, the sheer chemistry between the teams of Ansari/Eisenburg and McBride/Swardson, is fantastic and very enjoyable. The plot may be forgettable, but that just makes the cast stand out even more by comparison.
B0041D843M|5.0|The book: [[ASIN:1932100660 The China Study: The Most Comprehensive Study of Nutrition Ever Conducted And the Startling Implications for Diet, Weight Loss, And Long-term Health]], and its associated video: [[ASIN:B0053ZHZI2 Forks Over Knives]], are life changing documents on why many of us living in Western societies are coming down with serious diseases that most people in the world do not get. The information presented shows that many of us in affluent Western cultures are simply eating ourselves to death.

0896898288|5.0|A group of us who have only used rotary cutters to cut out our pieces, are now learning how to use templates. We all love it! The blocks aren't difficult, and we're all enjoying collecting new styles of fabrics and sharing them amongst ourselves. Each quilt in the group will be the same, but very different depending on how we put together our fabric choices for each block. Very challenging but well worth the effort.

B0035G9ABQ|5.0|After the successful \\"Demon Days\\" era, Gorillaz return with a album that is creative in it's best. As leader and bassist Murdoc lends you a passport to the strange but unique Plastic Beach, he gives the fans what they want: the music describing his exploits of the island. \\"Rhinestone Eyes\\" is my favorite song, recorded on Murdoc's submarine, it's mainly lead singer 2D who dominates the song with lyrics about scary gargoyles and rhinestones falling from the sky. \\"On Melancholy Hill\\" is emotional, as it we see it as a place to escape from the sorrows we suffer. The album features many guest collaborators, from Snoop Dogg, Bobby Womack, Mos Def, Little Dragon, even reuniting Clash members Paul Simonon and Mick Jones! Overall, my hats are off to Captain Murdoc and Gorillaz for guiding us through the paradise that is Plastic Beach.

B0051HNMTI|2.0|Low rating because you cannot watch videos without it being during a workout. There should be a way to watch the video and learn the exercise without having to start and do the workout. There also is not enough time between each exercise to get into the position for the next 1, which is exacerbated by the fact that the pause button is hard to hit if you're in the middle of doing the exercise. Or getting ready. You should be able to control the time between exercises and you should be able to watch the video and learn the exercise without it being during the workout.
B0038JN6VA|5.0|is an excelent product.  It work really nice with a good sound and performance, come with a mini SD of 2 G for a lot of music.

B00785P2QC|5.0|really fun free game. hasn't been a dull free game.  full version and no demo. hours of injoyment fun routing trucks to supliers and stores.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Despite horrible marketing and worse box office, John Carter is a wonderful version of the tale of a Civil War veteran who finds himself on a Mars as imagined in the age of Verne and Welles. It is part western, part swashbuckling adventure, and part science fiction adventure. If you missed this movie while it was in the theaters, you should get the DVD. Besides, the movie version of Dejah Thoris, the Princess of Mars, is Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, and Elizabeth the First all in one, with the added bonus that she can kick butt.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|I have been trying to find this movie every where. I am so glad I found it here. my husband and I both like it very much. The dvd is of good quaity, and doesn't frezze up like alot of dvds. the picture is so clear.

0374203032|3.0|Michael Sandel is, to my mind, perhaps the greatest living political theorist. To get an idea of his breadth, check out his books on Amazon (and read my reviews of a couple). This book, however, is really journalistic social commentary and says nothing new. However, it is great reading, as Sandel has done an excellent job at amassing anecdotes to the effect that more and more of social life takes the form of market interactions.<br /><br />His main point is that there are moral dimension concerning the way we make agreements and distribute the rights and duties of participating in society, and the use of markets and contracts are only one way, and not always the morally correct way.<br /><br />My favorite example of this is a sketch on the sitcom Seinfeld, where on Elaine's birthday, George and Kramer give her thoughtful gifts, while Jerry give her a sum of money. When Elaine opens the envelope and sees the money, she exclaims rather incredulously, \\"Money! You gave me money on my birthday!\\" Jerry explains that money is better than some other gift, because you can spend it any way you want. Elaine will have none of it. \\"Money! I can believe you gave me money on my birthday.\\"<br /><br />How about a personal example? Many years ago, when I was teaching at Harvard, my wife and I had a dinner party for a half dozen Harvard faculty and their spouses. Two days later I received a letter in the mail from one of the guests. The envelope contained a $20 bill (a lot of money in those days) and a note saying \\"Thank you so much for your hospitality.\\" NEVER in my life was I so deeply insulted. I learned after some inquiries that the gentleman was not mentally balanced, and he took offense to my criticism of s United Nations resolution that Zionism is a form of racism. When I confronted him directly, he accused me of being a CIA agent (this was an insult in those days).<br /><br />So if you have not ever thought much about when markets are the right way to interact and when they are not, you will get a lot out of this book. Sandel makes the obvious point that paying someone to wait in line for you to get into the fancy museum may be immoral because people should have access to the museum on the basis of their capacity to wait in line, not their wealth. But Sandel does not try to formulate a comprehensive moral structure that tells us when to use markets and when not. I think he should have tried.<br /><br />Sandel lists two main problems with using markets for social interactions. One is that the poor cannot make use of markets. I do not agree with this critique. The poor are excluded from participation in many aspects of life, and the cure is to eliminate poverty, not to make sure others are also excluded from monetary exchanges. The other is that monetizing social relations leads to a decline in moral sensibility. For instance, if firms can pay for the right to emit carbon into the atmosphere, this erodes the moral obligation we all have to reduce pollution. This is because paying for pollution legitimizes pollution and turns a social decision into a purely private decision.<br /><br />I think this is just wrong. We do not expect firms in a competitive economy to sacrifice profits on behalf of the environment. We expect firms to obey the laws concerning emissions. The notion that CEO morality can replace regulation is really silly. Of course, when it comes to private life, Sandel's critique has a great deal of force. But we all know that, and few of his examples are this (private) form.<br /><br />Sandel does not like economists, but his critique of economics is ill-informed and anecdotal. The The idea that not all valuable things should be bought and sold on markets has been known for centuries, certainly since the anti-slavery movement in England, and all mature economists understand this well. The fact that an economist can gain his fifteen minutes of fame once in a while be advocating the suppression of non-monetary gift-giving should not be interpreted as an exercise of brilliant economic argument. We do not have an adequate theory of when the exchange of valuable entities are best left to the market and when they should be regulated by other mechanisms, such as queues, social norms or laws, but the notion that economists have gotten this all wrong is just absurd.<br /><br />Sandel's point that hat monetary incentives can crowd out moral incentives has been known at least since Richard Titmus's 1971 book, but it is certainly not a cut-and-dry issue. For instance, in 2008 economists Laurence Goette and Alois Stutzer conducted a large field experiment in Switzerland, found that offering lottery tickets increased turnout at blood drives. More generally, Nicola Lacetera and Mario Macis found that donors prefer small in-kind rewards to monetary incentives. On the other hand, economists are often correct in saying that if voluntary contributions do not elicit enough participation, then monetary incentive may do so, despite the fact that they completely drive out moral incentives. By neglecting this point, Sandel gives the impression that wherever the supply of a social good or service is governed by altruistic motivations, is a social evil to replace moral incentives with financial incentives. This is simply not the case, and his critique of Kenneth Arrow and Lawrence Summers is therefore faulty.<br /><br />In the same vein, economists Ernst Fehr and Klaus Schmidt, in a paper published in the European Economic Review in year 2000, showed that basing a business relationship in part on trust rather than relying upon complete contractual specification, can increase both the efficiency and the fairness of the relationship. This is just one of many contributions by economists that belie Sandel's crude depiction of economic theory. Does he really believe that nothing has changed in the twenty first century?<br /><br />Sandel is persistent in his critique of economics, but he smears all of economic theory with the broad brush of neoclassical economics of a previous era. The impression given in this book is that it is not worth studying economics, because it is incurably ideological and incapable of dealing with contemporary social policy issues. This, I believe, is simply not the case.<br /><br />Sandel consistently ignores contemporary economic theory, espectially behavioral economics. This stance leads him to misrepresent a key issue in contemporary economic policy: the role of corruption in economic efficiency and growth. According to Sandel, corruption is a purely moral issue. ``corruption...points to the degrading effect of market valuation and exchange.'' In fact, corruption is a major impediment to economic growth in both developing and developed economies, as stressed by economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson in their new book Why Nations Fail.<br /><br />Sandel's second blind spot is far more serious. By focusing on the marketability of particular things, e misses the larger effect of an economy regulated by markets on the evolution of social morality. Where have movements for religious and lifestyle tolerance, gender equality, and democratic government flourished and triumphed? The answer is in societies governed by market exchange.<br /><br />Dramatic confirmation of this relationship between markets and morality come from studies of fairness in fifteen simple societies studied by myself and colleagues, described in our book Foundations of Human Sociality: Economic Experiments and Ethnographic Evidence from Fifteen Small-Scale Societies (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004). These societies consisted of three hunter-gatherers, six horticulturalists, four nomadic herders, and four small-scale, sedentary farmers in Africa, Latin America, and Asia, and they played standard ultimatum, public goods, and trust games, conducted by twelve professional anthropologists and economists. As in advanced industrial societies, all these societies exhibited a considerable degree of moral motivation, subject being willing to sacrifice monetary gain to achieve fairness and reciprocity goals, even in anonymous one-shot situations. More interest for our purposes, we measured the degree of market exposure and cooperation in production for each of these fifteen societies, and we found that simple societies that regularly engage in market exchange with the larger society have more pronounced fairness motivations. The fact that the market generates a high level of economic inequality is incontrovertible, The notion that the market economy makes people greed, selfish, and amoral is simply and dramatically fallacious.h the broad brush of neoclassical economics of a previous era.
