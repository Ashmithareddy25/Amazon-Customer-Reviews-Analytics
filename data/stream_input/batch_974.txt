B000P0J0DI|5.0|Clint Eastwood directs and stars in Unforgiven.  The 1992 movie is complex, it examines what is good and evil, the viewpoints of age and youth, finding courage, doing what is important while feeling guilt and yet finding redemption through change.<br /><br />This is a Western set in Kansas and Big Whisky, Wyoming.  The opening scene is in Kansas and shows William Munny, a retired gunslinger, chasing pigs with his two young children, a girl and a boy.  Munny is also a widower and has to make do on his small farm.  He has sworn off gun-slinging and wild women to honor the love of his life, his wife who  died at age 29.  She turned his life around and though poor, he felt good about making up for his past life of violence, drinking and wild women.<br /><br />A young man on a horse comes up to Munny.  He is the Shofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett).  He has a proposal to kill two cowboys that cut up a prostitute in Wyoming.  There is reward money of $1,000 and they can split two ways.  Munny initially refuses to help with the assassination, but realizes that it would help his children have a better future if he could afford to do something else.<br /><br />After a few days he sets off with his best friend, Ned Logan (Morgan Freeman) also a retired gunfighter.  Ned reluctantly leaves his Native American Wife, \\"Two Feathers\\" to go along on the hit.  Two Feathers is near Munny's farm and agrees to check in on his children and help when they need her.<br /><br />The trio get to the town of Big Whisky and find the Sheriff, Little Bill Daggett (Gene Hackman), enforcing gun control and using his power as he sees fit.  He had denied justice to the prostitutes who now want revenge and have secretly gathered the $1,000 reward money.<br /><br />Thereafter the story keeps developing with twists and turns.  The mighty win over the weak.  It is a haunting story of life's and moralities ambiguity.
B00005ASQ1|5.0|Dear Seller:      We really had a great time with this film.  It was nicely sent, with fine wrapping materials, love and tender care.  What a beautiful story . . . my beloved, my ex-wife was so pleased with it that she re-wrapped it and sent it as a birthday gift for her brother (my ex-brother-in-law) in California, partly because he is looking a lot like Sean Connery with hair.  Anyway, thanks so much for a great film and gift.            Best wishes,                J \\"Jay\\" Samuel Davis, Alpine, Texas
1416595554|5.0|Sashenka the novel by Simon Montefiore is story telling at its finest. It is a story that seamlessly ties political conspiracy, love, family, heartbreak, inhumanity, injustice, and unspeakable terror perfectly. It is powerful and intensely moving, and has changed me forever. I can hardly believe the horror and tragedy the people of Russia went through during the 1930's, and there will always be a soft spot in my heart for every family that endured the cruelty of the Stalinist era, and for every \\"Sashenka\\" that has ever existed.    Sashenka is my first historical fiction novel, and the first novel I have come across with such impeccable writing. Simon Montefiore has truly written a masterpiece. The writing style is vivid, compassionate, and immersive. The plot is brilliant, well paced and complex but very well structured which makes it a smooth read and keeps those pages turning, with a wonderful weave of real and fictional characters, written in 3 parts spanning three different time periods in Russian history.    The story is based on true events, but the author uses the (fictional) main character \\"Sashenka\\" as a looking glass to all those events. This is all made more believable and fascinating due to the author's extensive knowledge and scholarly study of the era.  This even makes the novel a great and effective learning instrument.    Part One takes place in St. Petersburg in 1916, where we follow the young and beautiful Sashenka, who is distantly loved by her father (a rich Jewish banker), and severely neglected and disdained by her irresponsible and selfish mother.  Driven by her adolescent rebellion against the nobility and her disgust of her family's lavish lifestyle in a world overwhelmed with poverty, is thrown into the arms of the Bolshevik cause. Suddenly, family, love, and friendship didn't matter anymore, only the cause mattered. She was pure and easily molded by her party loyalist uncle who was a devout Marxist, which starts her involvement in the preparation for the revolution.    I read this first part slowly, savoring the craftsmanship of this story. The author's descriptive ability is so extraordinary that you get so immersed in the world that everything starts to feel real. You start to form such an intimate relationship with every single character that their thoughts and feelings become yours.    Part two takes place in Moscow, in 1939. This part grabbed me strongly enough to read it all in one sitting. I felt much more attached to the people and the story. Sashenka and her husband are now leading Bolshevik Stalinist figures in Moscow, with two children, and are considered the pinnacle of success. Their friends and acquaintances are amongst the Communist party elite, and even Stalin attended one of Sashenka's parties. Yet when she gets involved in a reckless affair, it threatens her entire life and will turn her world upside down.    This is where the plot and characters suddenly grip the reader and don't let go. I felt transported into her world, and went through every emotion the characters went through. No novel has ever made me cry and sob like this, I truly felt devastated just as Sashenka did.    Part Three takes place in contemporary Russia in 1994.  It has been 50 years since we last heard of Sashenka, and we are now following a young historian, Katinka Vinsky, who is hired to look into and unravel what happened in those times. The deeper she digs, more mysteries arise and this is no longer a simple lookup. Like her, I became obsessed with finding out the truth, especially because this bridges the 50 year gap between part two and three. This part was so fast and captivating that I also read it in one sitting as you also feel like you are trying to hunt down all the missing pieces of Sashenka's life. Every discovery Katinka makes is shocking, revealing more tales of betrayal, strange alliances and motivations, and moments hidden within history that truly define Sashenka's life and fate, with small flashes of humanity that brighten up the dark and grim story.     Montefiore's skill really shines in the intrigue and mystery and how the events play out. There was always something to be discovered up until the very last line, and it is wrapped up into one amazing package.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this dvd along with the Skinny Bitch workout dvd and Carmen Electras stripper fit video. I can't stand the others but LOVED Jillians. She is to the point and gives you options so if you are not ready to get into that low squat yet you can work your way to it. I'm going to purchase her others because I loved this one so much. Go Jillian!

B002Y5FKUE|2.0|My two stars are for Juan Diego Florez who sings his role almost to perfection. But there's little else here to excite a listener or viewer. Natalie Dessay, in my opinion a vastly overrated, frankly homely, pennywhistle coloratura, has neither the beauty nor the commanding, non-goofy acting skills of a Callas on the one hand, nor the supreme vocal beauty of a Sutherland, both women her immediate predecessors in this most demanding role. As to Mary Zimmerman, a slavish imitator of conformist Euro-fashion updatings (our by now stale tradition these days in opera), it's gallant to be silent. This is a performance best allowed to fade into history as a giant misstep.
0786868724|5.0|NO words can describe the beautiful, inspirational meaning of the book. It made my faith grow more from within my soul!!! I highly recommend this book.
0060775858|5.0|Some classics are past their \\"Best By\\" date (see my review of the original Curious George: [[ASIN:0395922720 The Original Curious George]]). Others, like Goodnight Moon, continue to offer new parents and their young children an opportunity to enjoy some quiet contemplative time together. Many read Goodnight Moon as part of a bedtime ritual; the familiar items and cadence are sweet and soothing. The New Yorker once called it a \\"hypnotic bedtime litany.\\" If you need a book to settle down a young child to sleep, this is it.<br /><br />Nice detail: look for the tiny mouse moving all over the room as the book progresses. The brightness of each page also gradually decreases. (Kudos to illustrator Clement G. Hurd for his huge contribution to children's literature.)<br /><br />For interested parents, a bizarre (and sad) story by Joshua Prager of the Wall Street Journal about the nine-year-old who was the beneficiary of Margaret Wise Brown's will, and how it all went south. See Comment below for link.<br /><br />P.S. We also own the board book of Goodnight Moon but in this case the hardcover is a better match for the story. The glossy pages of the board book are less subtle, and less soothing.

0393075966|5.0|In general, I was not disappointed by Professor Stiglitz's book.  His criticism of the Wall Street banks, the corrupt and incompetent regulators, the Bush and Obama administrations in terms of their roles in the bailouts could not be more effective.  I strongly agreed with his prescription for fixing the bank problem. Quit providing the zombie banks with the underwriting of the American taxpayer.  Seize the zombies and put them into receivership and sell their assets--the non-toxic ones that is--in good due time.  Throwing good money after bad is no solution.  Rewarding the corrupt and the incompetent for their extraordinary failures is the height of cynicism, political expediency, moral hazard, and in some cases--just plain stupidity.    One reviewer took Stiglitz to task for not being environmentally sensitive enough.  I did not find that to be the case when I read the book.  He appeared to me to be painfully aware of the problems of pollution, resource depletion, peak oil, climate change and global warming, overpopulation, etc.    There was, however, one area in which I was in disagreement with him.  That area is associated with \\"free trade\\" versus \\"protectionism.\\"  I am all for helping the poorer countries achieve greater development--provided that the development is not destructive to their societies, human rights, soil and water resources, global climate, etc.  However, I do not find the globalist recipe of \\"free trade\\" to be terribly compelling.  Gutting our American industry and manufacturing is not the way to go.  Nor are $700 or $800 billion (whatever the figure is)  trade deficits to be tolerated.    Protecting our domestic industry and manufacturing should not be a taboo subject.  I realize that such \\"protectionism\\" will cut into the profits of our corporations and elites.  So be it.  They have stolen more than their fair share of national wealth from the rest of us in the last few decades. Let them give up a bit of it with a re-alignment of industry andmanufacturing to a more domestic basis.    Our people need to be employed.  We cannot be a great nation or an economically healthy nation where we make very little of what we consume and import everything else.  Common sense and reason must at some point prevail and the fairy dust of globalism needs to be sprinkled elsewhere.  Foreign trade is fine up to a point and where it is done in a balanced manner.  And where it does not undercut or destroy critical domestic industry.  A reasoned and rational debate in the media (corporate and otherwise) on these trade issues is long overdue in this country.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|First half of the movie really raises your expectations.  Great scenes of a decaying city. And Will Smith plays  his part to perfection.    Unfortunately, the dialogue with his german sheppard  is much better than the interaction between Will and  the female he meets toward the end of the movie.    This is another one to add to my \\"Last Man\\" Movies.  \\"Last Man on Earth\\", \\"28 Days Later\\", \\"Omega Man\\", etc.    All Good. None Great.
B001993Y2C|4.0|First off, if you've watched the series you know it is an excellent drama full of action, intrigue, betrayal, moral dilemmas etc.  I've always said that the biggest problem with the series is that they called it Battlestar Galactica. They should have called it something else and even stated that it was based on the series from the 1970s. Then they would have gotten away from the preconceived notions of the cheesy, yet enjoyable original.  The series combined with the extras (commentaries on every episode so far, deleted scenes, mini docs and yes the Resistance WEBISODES ARE INCLUDED ON S3D2 on the blu-ray discs)and video transfer gets five stars from me weighted most heavily.    The packaging looks cool but it's crap.  It's huge but with a big empty space in the middle. The internal disc holders aren't even the digipacks, included in most collections, as many pointed out.  Usually,large collections like this would included books and such as well as the normal booklets that accompany the discs with the episodes descriptions.  This collection doesn't even have an episode list ANYWHERE.  That is particularly problematic when several episodes precede extended episodes on the next disc with no warning.  Someone else wrote up a full description of this mess but in a nutshell don't watch Pegasus it's extended about 18 minutes on the next disc. Skip the last episode on S3D2 for the same reason as well as S4D3 shows four episodes but the last one combines the first 3 into an extended one.  I know I missed one in there but you can find it in another review. Three stars for packaging.    Lastly, I haven't seen it mentioned but the menus are cumbersome in not intuitive.  You're left to guess what the circles do as well as other features.  I don't know if it's the fault of the discs or my PS3 but the machine doesn't remember disc position even if a press stop by accident.  So don't bump you remote. Menus are below average, two stars.    The last two items are superfluous to theseries; however,  while one cannot give it five stars the content overcomes its shortcomings.
B00001OH7T|3.0|Despite being a colossal David Bowie fan who is constantly in love with his music,  I simply don't understand the high praise for this album. By no means lousy, many songs are a lazy effort made worse by the fact that we know that Bowie can do a lot better.     Here's the problem:    Usually, the great chameleon is known for his edginess (\\"Cracked Actor\\"), his lyrical GENIUS (\\"Cygnet Committee\\"), his sense of emotion (\\"Five Years\\"), or just his blazing, beating force (\\"Station to Station\\"). Even songs that are by no means great from a music/songwriting point of view can at least be damn *enjoyable*, such as \\"Sons of the Silent Age\\". But the Young Americans album - EXCEPT for the terrific title track and one or two other songs - is often a watery effort with songs that often have cheap lyrics (#3-4), or at least are not interesting (#5). Ask yourself: what do we really have here at the end of the day? It's as if Bowie didn't even try hard, which is a shame, because there was a lot of potential in exploring soul.    Overall, this is not a terrible album. You have a dynamite title track, a good cover song, a love song, and some nice doses of soul. But there's a lot of cheapness in the album (songs #3-5, and #2 somewhat) that suffers from lackluster lyrics and a shortage of conviction. I find these songs to be boring. They can be enjoyable to some, but they're still weak.     Even decent tracks such as \\"Can You Hear Me\\" and \\"Fame\\" are bland in comparison to the genius and edginess of much of his other work. (For example, Bowie has seen deeper days for love songs than \\"Can You Hear Me\\" - [\\"Wild is the Wind\\", \\"Letter to Hermione\\"], and when Bowie is being cynical or critical, like in \\"Fame\\", the results are usually more exploratory: [\\"Teenage Wildlife\\", \\"Boys Keep Swinging\\"]). Bowie usually has something smarter to share with us. With all of this said, I truly believe this album is inferior to his surrounding work.    -----------------------------------    Here's a breakdown:    \\"Young Americans\\": By and far the best song of the album. This is the towering MONUMENT of the album. With clever lyrics that have much to say, the song's proof of Bowie's fantastic writing skills. Full of pace, energy, and mature wit, this is perhaps one of the finest songs in his career. It's too bad that it goes downhill from here. I mean, I can't say enough praiseworthy things about this song. He's in his element here.    \\"Win\\": a slow, soulful song that may have to grow on fans over time, but it has its rewards. It's mellow, moody, and subtle, with a playful jazzy feel. A great song? Nope, but I can see how one can dig it on a pure enjoyability factor. Lyrically, Bowie's dealing with somebody who apparently needs to \\"win\\" in life, and he senses that this person is in danger of metaphorically crashing.    \\"Fascination\\": has a fun beat and chorus (which verges on being too repetitive), but the lyrics are ultimately lazy and there's not much backbone to the song. Look at the lyrics and you'll see. I'll admit the music is catchy and might stick in your head, but ultimately there's nothing special.    \\"Right\\": decent music that is worthy enough of the soul genre, but the lyrics are a disaster. Eventually, it gets so boring that you might want to just listen to a Bowie song that is actually good. There is little to no thought in the repetition of the lyrics - the song has nothing to give us.     \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\": it's more lively than last three songs and isn't as repetitive as the last two, but in the end, it's silly in an unfunny, unfulfilling way. Maybe if you're a soul person you might like it. Personally, I don't like it all, but I'll admit there's a good taste of soul and a nice flourish of sax throughout. But honestly, Bowie could've done a hell of a lot better.    \\"Across The Universe\\": I always defend this song, and let me explain why. Don't get mad, but Bowie took a monotone, boring song laced with jibberish (or whatever it was) and turned it into an energetic piece of compassion and emotion. There's so much conviction in his voice. This is a song that's better off with emotion and liveliness, and the Beatles version is bland and squandered in comparison. Bowie brings his cover version to life and gives it a new lease. Here, he's anything BUT lazy. He feels and means every word of it. And even if you don't care for it that much, you HAVE to admit that he makes it his own song. Other cover artists of simply copy the original, which is uninspiring. Bowie reminds us that if you're going to rip somebody else off, you might as well do your own thing. And I believe his is better. It's a little ironic that his cover song speaks more defiantly than the original ones.    \\"Can You Hear Me\\": A touching, intimate love song where Bowie sings from the soul, like the previous song. Lyrically, Bowie realizes - after life has taken him many places - that he knows the person he wants to be with. (The theme is loosely similar to \\"Be My Wife\\" from Low). The result is touching, sentimental, and warm. I personally love the opening instrumentals. The last minute or two could've been edited, but the whole song is a preview of even better things to come (\\"Wild is the Wind\\"). You'll probably like it if you're into Bowie, but despite its replayability, the quality is generally lukeworm.    \\"Fame\\": A cyncical view on being famous, with decent rhyme and a catchy flow. Recorded a year after the other songs, this doesn't have much of a soul feel and was probably made so the album could have a good single for the radio. The most important thing to remember about this song is what he's singing about. Overall, I go for deeper Bowie songs from other albums, but this song is better than fine.
081186510X|5.0|In this photograph book there are pictures you can't find elsewhere. There are many Michael Stipes's close-ups which are just gorgeous and inspiring as well; some are really unusual and surprising for example: in a photo you can see a close-up of Stipe's feet malachite-green colored; in another  he  almost looks like an enormous insect, and so on. Many photographs have been shot during R.E.M. tours around the world, and in  my opinion, the one shot during a show in Berlin is amazing.  The colors are beautiful and vivid, and the subjects of these photos are various. A highly recommended picure book.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|Imelda May should be a world known artist.  The vocals are warm and sultry.  The words to the songs are imaginative and clever.  Many of the melodies are danceable.  Ms. May wrote most of the songs on this CD.  The CD transcends \\"rockabilly\\".  The instrumentation is excellent!  Enjoy!
B000002KMY|4.0|The cover art on this cd is quite creepy and Black Sabbath's 'demon' logo is a bit similar to Led Zeppelin's 'angel' artwork. Even though I like this album more that Dio's first foray with Black Sabbath, a stumbling block for me embracing him is his similarity, vocally, to family friendly Australian pop/rock singer John Farnham! Anyway, on first listen I was inclined to give this album 77.5/100, roughly, but maybe it deserves to get around 85/100...which would put it roughly equal third with my third favourite Sabbath album, Ozzy's \\"Master of reality\\"...behind Paranoid and Sabotage (but having recently listened to \\"Never say die!\\", that album may just sneak into 3rd spot for me).      Best song:      Country girl - has a catchy riff, not too far from \\"Iron man\\", off of \\"Paranoid\\". Dio's vocals harmonise with the riff. This song should have made their 2cd \\"Best of\\", I think.      Next best songs:      Falling off the edge of the world - I'm assuming that this is my pick as the next best song...not sure if I put a dot next to this song because it's not bad, or if the dot was just some speck of dirt or something...been a while since I listened to this album in any case. Song has a moody, broody intro, bassy strings and maybe a synth violin effect. Also has a nice change in mood...sort of like Judy Garland joining the band or something (hmm...note to self: make sure comments written at the time will make sense when read months later!). Dio's vocals remind me of John Farnham and Freddie Mercury in this song. The rock part of this song reminds me of Metallica's classic song \\"Fade to black\\". Maybe Metallica were aware of this song?    The mob rules - might have taken until the second listen to rate this song higher. Has a party rock sound with grinding guitars. A bit of this song is similar to Guns'n'Roses' song \\"Welcome to the jungle\\". Song has a message about the consequences of listening to fools.        Best of the rest (on second listen):        Turn up the night- has a contemporary, mainstream metal vibe to it. Sing-song vocal melody is catchy. Lots of flickering/wow-wow lead guitar work and solos etc.    The sign - pleasant intro of accoustic, steel string guitar and a breathy voice. Song then goes into \\"Iron man\\" territory, riff wise, with an occasional doomy riff.    E5150 - Instrumental. REALLY low and heavy bass synth notes. Sort of whale song noises and \\"Close encounters of the 3rd kind\\" UFO noises. Outro is a bit in the Jean Michel Jarre mould.        The rest:        Voodoo - a bluesy riff to strut to. Bassy, with a growling vocal style. Song/riff is very much in the 1980s mould. You can just imagine the cheesy video to accompany this song!    Slipping away - grindy guitars. Intro a bit like Van Halen's take on \\"You really got me\\" (originally by The Kinks). A bassy track with some super heavy bass too. Track has a bit of a Led Zeppelin vibe to it, as well as Dire Straits' \\"Industrial disease\\" (in the latter song's case, that should really be 'vice versa'.     Over and over - a melancholy sounding track with lots of bluesy lead guitar solos. Bassy. Perhaps the most John Farnham sounding song on the album!        Black Sabbath recommendations:           If you haven't explored this band I'd say check out their first three albums...      Black Sabbath - my least favourite Sabbath album...quite heavy folk rock in style. Is regarded my many as the birth of heavy metal. Critics also regard it as a classic album. They never did an album like this ever again.    Paranoid - my pick as their masterpiece. Has their most memorable and accessible songs. They never did an album like this ever again.    Master of reality - their 3rd best album, in my view. Their 3rd album, which set the template for all their subsequent albums until \\"Technical ecstasy\\" moved the band into another direction (i.e. more 'feel good' rock/light metal type stuff). If you like this album, all their albums up to and including \\"Sabotage\\" are consistent in quality. \\"Sabotage\\" is my 2nd favourite Sabbath album.      If you like \\"Mob rules\\", you might enjoy Ozzy's last two albums \\"Technical ecstasy\\" and \\"Never say die!\\" (and vice versa).  Their last one actually may be my new 3rd favourite Sabbath album...has some really accessible songs on it...songs deserving of radio airplay.
B0009MAP9A|5.0|This is one of my favorite Bob Dylan Albums!  digitally remastered The music sounds as new as the day it was released over 45 years years ago!  this album is great for folk music lovers and is generally easy listening for \\"hanging out\\" or perfect for a long car ride.  I only wish there were more songs on the album!  enjoy!
B000002KKS|4.0|Before I'd heard Ozzy's last two albums with Sabbath, I said of Dio's debut with the band that it was a departure from the previous formula, with Ozzy. It was more straight up rock with none of the experimental flights of fancy which first appeared on \\"Master of reality\\" (although one could argue that \\"Planet caravan\\" on their classic \\"Paranoid\\" album was their first foray into this kind of experimenting). It's also good to report that the bass guitar is back on overdrive with this Dio debut. Ronnie James Dio's vocals are rock, with a high level of technical accomplishment. He can growl, be clear and glassy, as well as really hold a note. That he also has good diction is not a negative either. On first listen I was inclined to give this album 70/100, but on second listen bumped it up to 75/100.        Best songs:        Lonely is the word - buzzing intro with an interesting texture to the guitars and soundscape. Bassy track. Pity that the intro riff is not central to this song. Outro synth riff is familiar.    Heaven and Hell - good bass and drums with a delicate accoustic guitar outro. Expansive riff. Dio sounds like family friendly Australian pop/rock singer John Farnham here, and in earlier songs on this album.        Next best song:      Children of the sea - pretty, with steel string accoustic guitar bookends. Johnny Farnham type vocals with a pretty chorus. Middle of the song is rock with a decent riff. Bass is noticeable and nice.        The rest:      Neon knights - has a chugga chugga rhythm with some Status Quo type riffs. Fantasy theme to the lyrics and power metal type vocals, which are fast. Vocal melody is poppy.    Lady Evil - good bass, especially for the intro, which is similar to ABBA's \\"Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)\\". Lyrically, it's a Brothers Grimm fairytale.    Wishing well - bassy, with lead guitar solos.    Die young - spacey synth intro. Bluesy lead guitar then rock. Bassy, with a driving rhythm and solo-ing. Has a slow bit with the piano, then keyboard later on, for a bit.    Walk away - intro buzzing, with grinding guitars. Similar to \\"Whatever you want\\" by Status Quo, as far as the guitar sound goes. Bassy.          Black Sabbath recommendations:           If you haven't explored this band I'd say check out their first three albums...      Black Sabbath - my least favourite Sabbath album...quite heavy folk rock in style. Is regarded my many as the birth of heavy metal. Critics also regard it as a classic album. They never did an album like this ever again.    Paranoid - my pick as their masterpiece. Has their most memorable and accessible songs. They never did an album like this ever again.    Master of reality - their 3rd best album, in my view. Their 3rd album, which set the template for all their subsequent albums until \\"Technical ecstasy\\" moved the band into another direction (i.e. more 'feel good' rock/light metal type stuff). If you like this album, all their albums up to and including \\"Sabotage\\" are consistent in quality. \\"Sabotage\\" is my 2nd favourite Sabbath album.      Black Sabbath's next album, with Dio was \\"Mob rules\\", which marked a return to the kind of direction the band were heading in with their last two albums with Ozzy upfront. If you like \\"Mob rules\\", you might enjoy Ozzy's last two albums \\"Technical ecstasy\\" and \\"Never say die!\\" (and vice versa).  Their last one actually may be my new 3rd favourite Sabbath album...has some really accessible songs on it...songs deserving of radio airplay.
006135323X|3.0|Thought-provoking, but should have been one third of its actual length.  Repeatedly found myself saying, \\"OK, Dan. I get it. Next topic, please.\\"    Nevertheless, it's guaranteed to bring new perspective to the decisions you make on a daily basis and the forces that influence those decisions. It's worth taking Ariely's advice and pausing at the end of each chapter to reflect on how it pertains to your own life.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I don't usually have time to watch TV, being a grad student in physical therapy and juggling my time between jobs in the process, but a year ago I stumbled across a preview for Castle on ABC at 10pm, and its somewhat opened up my interest in viewing primetime TV again, even in other shows.  Ironically, that's a decent time for me to watch TV, and having been a person who thoroughly enjoyed Firefly back before my professional pursuits took hold, I have an appreciation for Nathan Fillion (as well as Adam Baldwin in Chuck, which earns my #2 favorite TV show spot).  Castle hooked me from the start, and I've watched every episode since its release with a bit of help by my DVR, and this DVD has just added to the fun.  I can sit and watch some of these episodes multiple times and still get an enjoyment from them, which is substantial when it comes to buying a DVD.  House is the only other show that I can say I've been able to rewatch more than twice and still be engrossed in the acting.    Nathan and Stana do an amazing job of balancing the story plots and their underlying \\"No I'm not\\" attraction and it makes for interesting situations as well as some moments where there feels like genuine emotion has taken hold.  I've seen Stana in an episode of 24 prior to Castle and didn't think much of her, but her performance in 24 is nothing like it is in Castle.  She's a much better actress than I was initially left to believe after her brief appearance opposite Keifer Sutherland.    Castle is a genuinely good time and fun to watch over and over, and unlike most cop shows, Castle proves that some lighthearted comedy can work with serious undertones as long as the characters were designed to be believable, and the actors able to act.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|Over the years, I have owned four Garmin GPS units, so I was confident that this one would meet my expectations.  But after a week of frustration, I have given up and returned it.  I never could get it to communicate with my computer and found it almost impossible to work with on the go.  On top of the technical issues, it's not even truly waterproof.  This is the most disappointing purchase I have made in years.  Sorry Garmin, this one needs to go back to the drawing board.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|So glad I got this DVD - my granddaughters (ages 7 and 4) absolutely love this movie!! They have watched it non-stop for three days! I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a sweet, everybody type movie.  There is something for all ages in this one!!
B0017CW5J4|5.0|If you liked the first DVD, you'll love this one, with its addition of the little theater pieces they've adapted from their city shows.  The female singer here is just as good as Tracy Bonham was, though the cute girl with the incredible voice from Venus Hum is definitely missed.  I was excited to see Pink Floyd's \\"One Of These Days\\" included here, as the performance of this song at a live show blew me away.    If you haven't seen the first DVD, or seen Blue Man Group live, and especially if you like percussion, this DVD/Blu-ray is worth the purchase price.  Just note, the DVD contains an audio CD of the performance, while the Blu-ray does not.  Rhino's website was very unclear on this, and they refused to remedy the situation other than to offer me a refund.  I didn't want a refund, I wanted the CD I expected.  Bad, bad marketing company, excellent DVD/Blu-ray.

B00000IREA|5.0|Fabulous movie.  Old-skool Star Trek has a threesome with the Labyrinth and Conan the Barbarian, while Boris Vallejo only wishes he was there ...and the deliciously badass sex-kitten Barbarella is born.  Full-on seventies kitsch, with shag carpet rocket-ship interiors, killer dolls, rockstar costumes, and unabashed Jane Fonda hotness.      And let's not forget the raddest, most titillating title sequence ever...
B002XMGGJM|5.0|Hi All.  I saw \\"Law Abiding Citizen last Night, Despite what I thought was a contrived ending (I guess it needed to end that way, but I did not think that would have been a realistic ending), I Was blown away by how good this movie actually is.   As an attorney, I can honestly say that there were some pretty accurate depictions of how it works in the profession.  First a comment.  Reading some of the negative reviews of the film, I am simply appalled at the lack of intelligence, and even moral fabric of some of the reviewers and their simple inability to follow a well thought out plot line, and terrific explanation as to how Mr. Butler was able to do what he did.  Whether it could have been pulled off or not is not the issue.  It is a reasonable and valid explanation for the plan that was put in place. ANd frankly it was ingenious.  He had many years to put it in place so how is that so impossible?     Some of the positive and thoughtful reviews are spot on with the idea that this film, played excellently by Mr. Butler, deals intelligently with one (Suremely intelligent and gifted) man's reaction to a system he deems to be incredibly unjust.  And indeed, his reaction and plan (which would not be possible if he were not so resourceful and intelligent) to Prosecutors making deals to ensure convictions, while ignoring the barbarity of crimes committed is very realistic because prosecutors are by nature very political animals who get relected through things like high conviction rates.  They care little about actual victims of crimes, even though they probably did not start out that way. How many families of victims of crimes are left feeling helpless because the law did not help them, the law did not see their catastrophic pain as anything else than an opportunity to notch one more in the conviction belt.  this is probably why many people are convicted wrongly anyway. It's not often enough about justice being done. I t is more often, can I get a conviction as a prosecutor, despite whether your better sense tells you that this person is innocent or guilty.           SPOLIERS AHEAD***********    There are however prosecutors who do the right thing and would have taken this matter to trial to see ultimate justice done (even if the prosecutor had ultimately lost) simply because of the barbarity of the crimes against Mr. Butler and his family. That being said, even a conscientious proseutor may take a deal if a conviction if doubtful or hampered by police misconduct.  In this instance it may have been correct, as the DNA evidence taken was deemed to be inadmissible.  However, the idea that Mr. Butler, an eyewitness to what occurred, would somehow prove to be an unreliable witness is a stretch.  I  would have taken my chances with a jury convicting the criminals, and my chances with Clyde Shelton (Butler) as a witness. Mr. Butler's idealistic rant during his bail proceeding is very realistic in the sense of a layman who does not understand how the process works. The process itself is skewed in favor of defendants because the system is designed to limit the instances (even though it may not always work) where innocent people are convicted.  let's assume for a moment, that Mr. butler was set up by someone else for the crimes he was alleged to have committed, then the judge revoking his bail, even though he was innocent would have been harsh and unfair- an innocent man sitting in prison until his trial.  That is a terrible in its own right.  It is such a difficult thing to combine a desire to see justice done against criminals versus making sure we do not convict the innocent.  Thus, the judge, assuming all men to be innocent until proven guilty should have given him an opportunity at bail despite the horrificness of the crimes he was alleged to have committed. IN this instance, the judge was right and Mr. Butler was wrong but how can you blame a lay person and the victim of a horrific crime (as he was) for hating the very system that letssomeone who did what they did to his family serve less than 5 years in prison. You can't blame him.  I would lose my mind if what happened to him happend to me.  I would have wanted to kill everyone, in the most barbaric of ways. That's what makes this movie so excellent is because it deals with such important and difficult issues.      Other comments.      SPOLIERS AHEAD **********    The ingenius maneuvers by Mr. Butler were amazing to watch and the come uppance received by at least one of the criminals is the single greatest come uppance that I have seen on film.  Unflinchly unforgiving, and I Loved it.       but I have some  questions for the educated and well read viewers who watched this film.  MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN FILM.  I REPEAT.  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN FILM.     I believe the ending was entirely contrived for several reasons.  It is unlikely that Mr. Butler's plan would have been discovered by Mr. Foxx in a timely fashion even with the information he obtained. It is clear that Mr. butler having planned so ingeniously would have made his secret location failry impenetrable by anyone but him either through the use of digital codes, retinal scanners what have you, in order to gain acess to his lair.  Assuming for a moment that we accept that Mr. Foxx realistically came upon this information and discovered the plan by any means necessary, then the movie ends completely unrealistically because Mr. Foxx, the Judge, and the police officer broke various laws in finding out his plan, and violated Mr. butler's civil rights in the process.  So even if the they were able to stop Butler from carrying out his plan, it is very likely that Mr. Foxx, and all involved would have been removed as ADA, Judge and cop and would have been disbarred, and probably prosecuted for crimes.  How about the instances where Mr. Butler is asaulted by Mr. Foxx.  Foxx would have been charged with Assault and lost his job (even though he may have been doing what's right, he still broke the laws and would need to be hald accountable). This would have been a true ending, because if every one must be held accountable, then Mr. Foxx, even though he saves the day (Where he deserved execution in my opinion), should be held accountable for breaking a mutitude of laws in stopping.  Anyone can get any result they want if they are willing to ignore the constituion that protects liberties.  That's why we have the protections in the first place.  So if you violate those liberties, even to save lives, then guess what- you have to pay the piper as a result.      That is the price that one has to pay for doing things outside the law even when the result saves lives.  How come only Gerard Butler's character has to be held accountable for breaking the law to obtain justice when no one else would do what they were supposed to do.  Why is that he alone has to pay the price for takinjg the law into his own hands.  Why is his life and the lives of his wife and child less in the eyes of Mr. Foxx and co, than the lives of Foxx's colleagues.  Why is Mr. Foxx not held accountable, after breaking the laws to stop Butler? The appropriate ending, based on what actually happened would have been Mr. Foxx's daughter and wife at the daughter's recital, after Foxx saves the day, but he himself would have been either a jailed or disbarred attorney for his actions in getting there.  There is a price to pay for these actions, despite the result.   My question to you, is do you agree with my thoughts on this?    Finally, the more realistic ending would have been for Mr. butler to pull the whole thing off (executing everyone even remotely connected with the prosecution of these defendants) and then walk out of his prison through his secret way, which I won't reveal, and disappear into the sea of humanity.  I just do not think that he would have been caught.  This would have satisfied me alot more, and made this movie an all time great in my opinion.  But then again, this may be more to do with my desire for vengeance on his behalf then any clear cut logical thinking.  Your thoughts??

006621131X|4.0|Patti Smith's valentine to her soulmate Robert Mapplethorpe is a deeply moving account not only of Smith's complex relationship with Mapplethorpe but also a fascinating story of bohemian life in New York in the late 60s and early 70s. Just Kids is beautifully written, sympathetically told and, in its way, pretty damn dishy -- but never in a harsh or distasteful way. While there are times when a reader, such as me, may start to question whether Smith is a bit amnesiac about her and Mapplethorpe's legendarily intense ambitions to be famous, Smith never comes across self-serving or cruel. Rather, Smith is reflective and presents herself as what she is - a true and uncompromising artist who loved a man just as dedicated to living life through art as she was. This is a classy book. It pulses with love, respect and humanity.
B002VECLVO|5.0|Tom Ford has said that he read \\"A Single Man\\" in his youth. That it left a profound impression that haunted him.  And upon re-reading as an adult was so again inspired, that he decided to produce the film out of his own pocket. It is truly a labor of love.  Its focus centers around the dramatization of one mans personal memories and reflections as he goes about his day.  Beautifully acted and filmed, this simple but tragic tale has some amazingly subtle moments.  It will leave those emotional capable of understanding it with something that can't be forgotten.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|...and if you view it with that understanding, you may be pleasantly surprised. Another very imaginative childrens' fantasy of the 80s (right up there with Labyrinth and The Never Ending Story). My 4 year old daughter loves this movie. Some reviewers here have complained that it is too dark, but I think children will generally prefer a dark, but emotionally honest, film to a condescendingly bright movie any day. Still, some kids are more susceptible to nightmares than other, so be aware that there are a few scenes that could give very sensitive viewers bad dreams.
B001SGEUNI|3.0|Halestorm, fronted by Lizzie Hale, recently broke into the rock scene after touring with the likes of Shinedown, Seether, and Trapt, among others. With their eponymous debut album, Halestorm sent two songs, \\"It's Not You\\" and \\"I Get Off,\\" to the top 20 on the rock music charts, instantly garnering them mass exposure and overnight fame. This led me to want to hear more of the young Pennsylvania rockers; unfortunately, I was less than impressed when I explored their album.<br /><br />Both of the singles are quite catchy, and overall decent songs, but not every track on the album compares. Many of the songs are plagued by cliche lyrics and stock riffs, and though tracks such as \\"Familiar Taste of Poison\\" and \\"Innocence\\" showcase great vocals from Lizzie, the music is terribly generic. Lizzie's vocals are enough to keep me interested, but, save for the two singles, it took me until the eighth song on the cd, \\"Love/Hate Heartbreak,\\" to choose another standout. This song is easily the strongest on the album, with a creative opening riff and lick, and powerful vocals. The album ends on a solid note, and I'd say the last four songs are the highlight of the disc.<br /><br />I've heard Halestorm is much better live than on their album, and after hearing the album I can imagine why. There are some bright spots on this CD along with a number of catchy tunes, but when I scroll down the track list I struggle to pick out more than one or two standouts, and even those aren't songs I'd find myself playing over and over. I expect bigger and better things from Halestorm in the future, but their debut is quite average as a whole.<br /><br />EDIT: My opinion of the album remains the same, but having now seen Halestorm peform I have a new respect for their musical ability. Great live show, average album. Hopefully they can take the energy they have on tour and cross it over into future releases.
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this for my son's 9th dinner and a movie b-day party at home. It was a hit! The movie caught the children's attention for 2 hours. It was a mixture of whimsical/magical/scary/humurous/adventurous story that was just perfect for everyone to enjoy. My 9 yr old loved it; we all loved it! I am now looking for another Miyazaki movie to buy- Ponyo.

B0034JKZ86|2.0|I was excited for my little girl to see this movie, but was greatly disappointed. The movie has alot of very dark magic, not the cute disney magic but dark and evil and scary. (They had to get blood from the prince for the magic to work, and they brought back spirits from the dead.) My daughter got scared and had a hard time understanding the movie. The princess part of the movie was cute, but almost half the movie was the evil magic. We will not be watching this movie again.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Meryl Streep is amazing. Wanted to see more of her. Hoping that there is a \\"Life & Times of Julia Child\\" so that we may see Ms. Streep again in this truly astounding role.  Overall - LOVED this movie.
0446569895|5.0|When I first saw you, and read the first line, I'm glad I bought you, and you are all mine. No copy from the library, and no due date. I stay up through the night, reading real late. I laugh at least one thing on each and every page. Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh, Sweet Leaf. How can I put you downnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn. Seriously, I'm only on page 48 and already laughed until I cried several times. I highly recommend this book. I think that everyone can relate to this book because it's about the human condition. Each person can see themselves in it. Ozzie's light vulgarity and his entertaining way of putting things is very funny, although the subject matter can be somber. Whether you are an Ozzie fan or not, I definitely recommend reading this book. The literary style is uncommonly refreshing.
B002WCLG48|4.0|To be honest, I was not hoping for much from HALO Legends. I am a fan of the game and all, but I am not obsessed with it. I found the stories to be rather interesting and entertaining, but not ground breaking or otherwise remarkable. The artwork for all of the stories were pretty average, except for \\"the Duel\\" which I found to be very imaginative and unique. As for the rest of the stories, if you have seen any recent anime then you have seen the art styles from this movie. Overall I am no disappointed that I bought the movie, and it was good for an hour or so diversion, but like I said it was not ground breaking to me. If you are a fan of the games, a sci-fi fan, an anime fan, or a little curious about the HALO mythology then I would have to recommend it.
B002UNMW7O|2.0|... of being boring.<br />-There are no likable characters unless your are easily swayed by two dimensional stereotypes like the smart beauty or the comedy relief minority.<br />-Relies solely on the reputation of the first ilm which wasnt that great to begin with.<br />-The humor isn't even funny at the elementary school level.<br />-The violence isn't exciting or well choreographed, it consists entirely for slow motion shots of the main characters holding pistols in front of them and repeatedly squeezing the triggers followed by a shot of 2 to 6 men dancing back and forth with pained looks as they slowly fall to the ground while their squibs go off.<br />So with all of these terrible facts, why give this movie two stars?<br />-I give credit to the actors for trying to perform around such terrible material. They cry convincingly when boring or downright stupid characters die before them, the female lead is consistant and works well with the chemistry of her costars, etc.<br />-I give the director credit for some interesting shots despite the fact that they go nowhere and provide nothing to the story.<br />If these final \\"good\\" points are enough to carry a film for you, then you are likely to enjoy it OR if you delight in a movie about characters who obsess over a faith in which they show absolutely no respect or even understanding of, you'll enjoy this film.<br />In sum, this movie is another homage to 70s and 80s action films and the iconic Punisher character but sadly misses all the marks.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I adored Return to Cranford.  It is every bit as good as the original.  Judi Dench and Julia McKenzie and the rest of the cast are simply wonderful.
0451169514|5.0|I have read a lot of Stephen King novels as well as other books in my time and I have to say that this book is the best novel I have ever read. I love everything about it. the Characters, the town, the villain manifesting itself in the fears of children, it's all brilliant. The mere fact that the story takes place during three different time periods and describes not only the life of Derry as a town, but the Lives of each of the children starting when they were children and ending to the adults they have become after the horrors they have seen in is amazing.<br /><br />People may argue that the ending was bad. Please don't see the movie and say the endings are similar because they are not. The book delves much deeper into what is truly going on. If you have read any othe King books involving the town of Derry (Insomnia) you will know there is a lot going on there that seems to be intertwined. I have heard theories about how the ending has been referenced to some of the dark tower novels, sadly I have never read any of the Dark Tower books. Perhaps I will in the future.<br /><br />All and all, IT is easily a great read if not the best. It may look intimidating being that it is over 1000 pages, but you will fly through it as if it were a comic book. I have read The Stand as well and I must say IT is better.<br />BUY THIS BOOK AND READ IT, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!
B000YIGNKE|2.0|The cinematography is shaky and stilted.  It's as if the director wants the emotion to come from the shaking of the camera as opposed to the characters.  Anne stares into the camera frequently, as if we are somehow to see into her soul and empathize with her deep pain.  However, this is difficult, since all she seems to do is cry and we do not understand enough of the backstory to see her as anything other than pessimistic, morose and self-pitying.  I never felt connected with the charater, and therefore found myself underwhelmed at the classic Austen romantic climax.    The final scene was rushed and ridiculous.  There is no reason a gentleman's daughter would *run* around Bath.  Then to have her just miss her quarry several times in a row became humorous.  I found myself laughing at what should be a serious, romantic moment.    I liked two things only about this version.  The first was Anthony Stewart Head (of Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame) as Mr. Elliot.  He was delightful as an over-the-top buffoon.  The other thing I appreciate about the film was its brevity.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|Saw the performer on Public Broadcasting and in concert live!!! Fantastic, wonderful, very entertaining. I play my disc in the car, in the house, at night to relax. Some songs I just put on repeat - I do not get tired of playing them, and singing along.  That voice, the words, the recitations, the music, the band, the back-up singers who are not really back-up but an integral part of the action!!! Exciting! Hot!! Erotic!!! \\"a thousand kisses deep\\"!!!! He can \\"dance me to the end of love\\". He's THE MAN.
0743277708|2.0|I suppose my threshold for silliness for books with talking animals (particularly bunnies) is \\"The Wind in the Willows.\\"  Anything more sophisticated than that is preposterous, I think.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this aims to go several degrees more sophisticated than that.  It succeeds in parts, but on the whole, it's hard to take it seriously unless you're a pre-teen girl.  But if you are, good luck with the language.<br /><br />Now, maybe I just waited too long to read this.  I had wanted to ever since I was a kid but never got around to it until middle age.  Sure, I've seen the cartoon on which it was based years ago, but didn't think much of it.  I was assured by those who had read it, however, that the book was much better (and deeper!).  I guess I'm glad I didn't read this as a teenager:  I think I would have given up after a few chapters.  For a book with a bunch of talking animals, it contains an unreasonably high level of prose.<br /><br />There's another reason it was hard to get into:  I've lived in cities all my life, so much so that I've never even seen a wooden fence, much less a cow.  (I think maybe once I saw a squirrel.)  Sad, I know; but the point is, much of the bucolic terms were completely flat to me:  marjoram?  meadowsweet?  thistle bloom?  kingcups?  watercress?  It's like you need a PhD in Botany to understand what's going on.  (The cynic in me suspects the author doesn't know either, and was simply writing with Newcomb's Wildflower Guide propped open next to the typewriter.)<br /><br />There are points in the book's favor:  the action is swift and things are helped along by short chapters.  But Adams's characterization must be accounted a minus:  there's plenty of rabbits along for the exodus, but it's hard to tell them apart.<br /><br />Worse, though, is the sustained pretension of Lapine, the language of Adams's bunnies.  Why not just \\"translate\\" everything into English?  At one point (p. 15), we're told the rabbits are going to \\"meet again here, fu Inle.\\"  What does \\"fun Inle\\" mean?  A helpful glossary at the back of the book tells us:  it means \\"after moonrise.\\"  What did it add to include the original expression?  Why couldn't Adams have just written \\"after moonrise\\"?  Why is that particular expression rendered in the original Lapine, but not others, such as \\"Is it true?\\" \\"Who is this?\\" and \\"Over the hill\\"?<br /><br />I'll tell you why:  because the interlarded Lapine, like so much else in the book, symbolizes the flowery affectation in which the whole thing is steeped.mean?

B001B0G5WA|5.0|OMG!!! Not only is this a heavy and flawless pressing, but Capitol also included the original insert.  Additionally they kept it true to the first pressing in mono form.  Now some people will argue about this; but pet sounds was an album that was just better mono... The strange stereo remix is just not for me.  This is pretty much identical to the first issue with the exception of it being at least a 180gram pressing... Order this and rejoice.

B000JQU4TW|5.0|What for most of my life I knew only as the answer to a trivia question, I've now read and enjoyed thoroughly, thanks to Amazon Kindle.  His only novel, Oscar Wilde's satire of the upper class in late 19th century Britain mocks their vapid lifestyle, while at times glorying in it, though the story arc comes from the tradition of Edgar Allan Poe.  The combination is both delicious and shocking. \\"Picture\\" is also a veritable gold mine, or should I say minefield, of ironic aphorisms, most of them emanating from the mind and mouth of Gray's friend and mentor Sir Henry Wooten, who is kind of like Michael Scott of \\"The Office\\", except with a functioning brain.<br /><br />Brilliantly written, entertaining and thought provoking, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" stands highly recommended to readers young and old.  It's sad that Wilde lived at a time when homosexuals were persecuted, in his case prosecuted, even moreso than they are now.  A giant of 19th century literature could have contributed well into the 20th century, but died penniless, estranged from his birthplace in Ireland, and home in England, at the age of 46 in the year 1900.

B000ICLRIE|1.0|After having sold our 4-disk director's cut, we find that the blu-ray version we ordered has no special features whatsoever.  No doubt Fox will come out with a 2-disc version in six months. Personally, I used the mirror image side to see the idiot who just wasted his money on the blu-ray and needs to re-purchase the DVD.    Here's the history:  1. bought Kingdom of Heaven 2-disc DVD  2. bought Kingdom of Heaven 4-disc DVD  3. sold Kingdom of Heaven 4-disc DVD  4. bought Kingdom of Heaven blu-ray  5. waiting to see Kingdom of Heaven the Ultimate Cut (they did this with Watchmen)  6. waiting for blu-ray to be discontinued, blu-ray players no longer made and everything going to studio-controlled downloads.    I think I'm spelling Kingdumb wrong.  We are the dumb part, while the studios are quadruple-dipping.    PS. Thank Heaven this never came out on Betamax, because it soooo wouldn't have worked on our VHS!    PPS. There appears to be some sound glitches on the blu-ray in the opening scene during the burial, just as Liam Neeson rides up.  The sound cuts out for a second about five times.  I have played two different discs that I got from Amazon about two months apart with the same result. I assume, unless it was a bad production lot sent to Amazon, that the glitch is on the master.

It felt like it started off a little bit slow, but I thought that the Prototype, The babysitter, and The Package were absolutely fantastic. I really look forward to watching it again in the future.
0425205061|4.0|As usual, an action packed good guys beat bad guys story.  Hey, it might be corny and full of cliches but during these politically correct times, I LOVE IT!  More more more!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I am speechless. Finally someone has listen to our prayers and given us back some quality television. I was heartbroken when Daria was cancelled. It is by far one of the few good shows that came from MTV. After years of waiting we can all sit back and enjoy Daria, Quinn  and Jane again. Yippy.
0761119752|5.0|I must confess, that I personally am not actually all that enamored of this book. I've always liked Sandra Boynton, but the verses in this particular book are, here and there, just too derivative of Dr Seuss for my taste...     ...However, my daughter, who is 15 months old, is CRAZY about this book (and at this point, she prefers it to Dr Seuss, so there you go). She has loved this book for many many months now, actually, and amazingly, it remains the one and ONLY book she truly enjoys. Her eyes just light up when I start reading it, and she remains RAPT throughout... And I admit, it is always fun to read it to her... And we have special dancing book movements for some pages (\\"jammy to the left...\\"), and in another spot, I make a special yucky monster voice (\\"some are the ugliest you've ever seen!\\")     For some reason, the last page just drives my little sweetie-pie wild with delight. So, as another reviewer commented, you may want to reserve this book for any time BUT bedtime...   :)     In sum, this is a book that I am sure will always conjure very fond memories for me, and for her.
0061914177|4.0|Although many people advise against turning your hobby into your day job, Gary Vaynerchuk, an Internet and business phenomenon, vehemently disagrees. He boldly promotes quitting your job to pursue a profession that is your passion. An immigrant from Belarus, Vaynerchuk rose to fame in his mid-30s because of Wine Library TV, the popular, highly publicized video blog he started in 2006. Through his imaginative Internet Webcasts, Vaynerchuk has made himself a leading authority on wines and a respected expert on online brand development and marketing. His style is unpretentious, a welcome change from the reserved mien of tuxedoed wine critics. Vaynerchuk provides step-by-step explanations on how to create a personal brand and promote it using social media such as Facebook and Twitter. Although the advice is overly simplistic - Vaynerchuk somewhat naively assumes anyone can emulate his success - and the topic is well-worn, getAbstract appreciates Vaynerchuk's sincere advice and recommends his clear, lively book to new entrepreneurs and others who want an introduction to the world of social media.
B002QW7ALM|4.0|The movie is a little wack at the start, but it turned out to be a pretty good movie.  However it did have a very similar story line as seen in all deep space exploration movies.  You seen one, you've seen them all.  Just a different cast, ship and new space aliens.
0345404475|5.0|\\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\\" has to be one of the most thought-provoking novel I've ever read, at least in my short 14 years of life. You've probably heard of its loose film adaptation \\"Blade Runner\\", which is just as good. But the book and the movie are almost completely different. They're so different that the plot elements that the book's title refers to were removed from the story, causing them to re-title it \\"Blade Runner.\\"    Written in 1968, the story takes place in 2021 after World War Terminus, or World War III. After the war, governments began trying to force their citizens to emigrate to newly established Mars Colonies. The few people that remain are either planning to emigrate or special (people with limited mental capacities.) Because of the nuclear World War, most of the animal species have become extinct or endangered, creating an attitude that life is extremely precious. Because of this, companies have began manufacturing incredibly realistic electric animals such has sheep, horses, cats, dogs and even humans. Everyone who moves to mars is given an android, but they've become illegal on Earth. The main character's a Bounty Hunter who hunts down Androids. He has to hunt down 6 Androids that have come from Mars and killed several people. Along the way, the story turns into an adventure as Rick questions his own humanity because of his seemingly relentless and hateful destruction of these \\"people.\\" But should they even be considered people?    The book and the film are in different genres. The movie is a neo-noir/sci-fi drama while the book is a very wry cyperpunk adventure and when I saw wry, I mean wry. Philip K. Dick, the author, has an extremely wry humorous tone to his writing, evident by the book's quirky title. He had written other dark stories with the same style such as \\"A Scanner Darkly\\" before his death shortly before the film version of \\"Androids\\" had been released. He even wrote the short story \\"We Can Remember It For You Wholesale\\" which served as the basis for Total Recall. The story and the intriguing ideas found in the book will keep you thinking for a long time. As soon as I finished the book, I sat thinking about everything I'd just previously read. The book questions what truly constitutes being a human, the value in being human, the difference between being an android and being a human and what these differences mean. Once you read the book, many of its ideas will be floating around in your head. This is definitely a book for thinkers and not those who just want an entertaining story. It also has a great ending. I wont spoil it, but Philip K. Dick was not the kind of writer to have to make you feel super happy and satisfied in the end. Often times, his characters don't end the story having fixed something or made it better. They may have realized their wrong ways, but that doesn't mean that anything is better. They've simply gone through an experience which has changed them. This gives his writing an honest, dry edge to it that makes it special.     I could say a lot more on this book, but I'll stop here and just say that I highly recommend \\"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\\" and its film counterpart \\"Blade Runner.\\" They're both some of the best entertainment I've have in a long time.
B002QGUFWE|1.0|I saw the live performances, I heard the music, I really wanted to like Lady GaGa. But unfortunately she has no integrity as a music artist. If you consider yourself a music artist, selling music IS the way you provide customer service to your fans. The fans might never met their idol in person or never go to your concerts but the fans have a little of the admired artist in their albums. But if you don't allow them to buy the music you promot on the radio and your concerts and instead you sell them mutilated, censored versions of your art. You have no integrity, not to mention that the ONLY way to get that music is to buy the more expensive Australian imported version. This also happen with Nelly Furtado. I guess hating and ripping off American fans is a way to kill the music business model. The General Motors mentality at is best.  Lesson learned.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I started watching daria when i were like 8 i think & she's totally awesome & i were looking everywhere for the seasons of this truly amazing tv show!!! and i found it... thanks -i mean it-
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|\\"Triangle\\" is an astonishingly creepy and unexplainable journey into the realm of the unknown. This film is best described as \\"The Twilight Zone meets The Shining\\" on a boat (one might notice that the room on the ship where the characters notice the red writing on the mirror is \\"Room 237\\" which, if you are a fan of \\"The Shining,\\" then you know the significance of that number.) In this film, a group of friends sets sail and ends up caught in a lightning storm, which sweeps them into an area perhaps similar to the Bermuda Triangle. After they capsize and are forced to board a large sea cruiser, they quickly notice that things are out of sorts. The ship appears to be operating all on its own; there are signs of life, but no bodies. No crew. Set primarily on the large and seemingly abandoned boat, it seems that George's character has been there before. As she is experiencing a strange form of deja vu, the reasons revealed for this is both stunningly unpredictable and utterly unexplainable.<br /><br />This is an eerie, moody film - at times almost noir - that is not only carried, but dominated by the performance of Melissa George, in what might end up being an epic star turn for her, like \\"The Ring\\" was to Naomi Watts. She is the focal point of the film, and excels in that role. I'm not going to give anyting away, other than to remind the viewer that often times in films like this, you have to suspend disbelief and keep in mind that some things are simply unexplained. This film is truly creepy in that regard. This film is really something to behold, both visually and atmospherically. It won't make you yell at the screen too much, but you might be caught staring at the screen in a bewildered manner on several occasions. I would rate this four stars if not for the performance by George. She has raised the bar for female leads in horror films.
B000JMKNV0|5.0|So glad I read this. I read that some people figured out the ending halfway through, but I was totally surprised. So glad I read this and can't imagine the movie even comes close.
0743298039|3.0|A good, well-written mystery is a pleasure.  The journey through the mystery's maze must be enticing and fun, and the answer to the puzzle must tie up all the loose ends in a surprising but believable way.  THE THIRTEENTH TALE just squeaks by on both counts.  In fact, I had to force myself to read it through to the end, although it did get easier to stay engrossed by midway.  Part of the problem was the writing.  Ms. Setterfield is not as disciplined, clear a writer as I would like.  Her descriptions are often vague.  For instance, I was uncertain what time period we were visiting in this book, although clearly it was not present-day.  Why was this not delineated?  Perhaps if I were English, I'd have an easier time of it, but as an American I had trouble visualizing the places and actions because of this omission.      Ms. Setterfield likes to use repetitive sentence fragments.  Does she think it makes the writing more like actual thought, that it moves the action along faster, or that it signifies intensity?  To me, it makes the book read in spots like a cheap, mass-market paperback.      The most serious problem is that the resolution of the mystery, while definitely surprising, is not very plausible.  I just didn't buy it.  And the neat way in which the pieces are tied up at the end felt contrived.  In addition, it's a risky conceit to make a world famous author the central character, and then have to produce examples that are supposed to demonstrate the famous author's brilliant writing style.  I, the reader, am forced to take on faith that the sample of said writer's work that's provided at the end is actually top-drawer.      Lastly, the degree of overwrought psychobabble regarding the narrator's childhood trauma just got on my nerves.  Over-the-top melodrama is not necessarily deeply thought or felt.    As I write this, I see that I disliked THE THIRTEENTH TALE more than I thought I did.  But, since I finished it and it gave me a few days' worth of diversion,I'll let my 3-star rating stand.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|The thing about a movie like this is that it will never please everyone.  Some wanted more technical talk, but it's not a how-to video.  Some didn't like the choice of players presented.  If you think Guitar World's yearly top lists get hate mail, you can only imagine what happens with a film like this.  And it's not a concert film.<br /><br />I thought the choice of guitarists was inspired.  Three generations of players, each whose art is a reaction to the others.  And each finding out that they come from common ground.  I have a love/hate relationship with Jack White's music.  I understand where he comes from, but some of it just doesn't grab me yet.  I love some of Edge's work in U2 and other stuff I find simple and repetitive.  Jimmy page is one of the main architects of \\"the riff\\" and has influenced millions of players.  But at the same time, he's kinda sloppy.<br /><br />And that's what I find inspiring.  These guys aren't the greatest technicians on the instrument. Not virtuosos.  But masters of what they do, and always a student of the music.  They could have gotten super high end players like Clapton or Vai.  And that would certainly be an interesting conversation too, but very different from this one.<br /><br />This isn't a \\"how to play guitar\\" movie.  It's a movie about how an artist finds their voice.  From Jimmy Page realizing that Muzak sessions couldn't be his future.  Or Jack White discovering the Flat Duo Jets and Son House and realizing that the deconstruction of music can be as important as its construction.<br /><br />I think artists need to see this to see that their heroes are just as big a fans of music as they are.  And that they live what they do.  And that they don't have all the answers.  But they are looking for them.<br /><br />And for music fans... If you want to see what happens inside a players head as he's creating and playing, this is a good place to start.
B002U6CJCO|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with Universal Soldier: Regeneration. I expected a hokey borefest with minimal action and ended up watching one of the best films both Jean Claude Van Damme and Dolph Lundgren ever appeared in. I won't give away too much, largely because I'm tired and typing this at 6:22 AM after working my horrible late night shift. Basically, a recycled terrorist/kidnapping plot leads to lots of hardcore booty-kicking from MMA badass, Andrei Arlovski as the next generation UniSol. Eventually, Luc Deveraux (Van Damme) is re-juiced in order to take him on. Throw in a sick bonus battle with Lundgren and there you have it. The fight scenes with Lundgren and Arlovski are some of the grittiest I've seen in something that didn't come out of Hong Kong. Did Donnie Yen ghost-choreograph these battles that are loaded with cool MMA moves? Van Damme proves once again that he can rock when he has to  because Lundgren and Arlovski never let up on him. Overall, this is new-school grindhouse fun that will light up a Saturday afternoon. Toss in a Shaw Bros. classic and a schlocky horror film, pop some corn, and grab your favorite cold beverage. Sit back and enjoy.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Alright, so coming off the high that was Season 1, we dive into Season 2. Unfortunately, like any other sophomore season, this show has a LOT of growing pains, and they're very evident. Sure, we get a lot more mystery, but most of the events of this season are virtually erased by the middle of Season 3. But don't worry, Lost is about characters, not story, right? Yeah, but they frustratingly can get much right there this season.<br /><br />Highlight Episodes:<br />Man of Science, Man of Faith<br />The Other 48 Days<br />One of Them<br />Lockdown<br />Live Together, Die Alone<br /><br />Alright, so we do get a lot of great moments in the Hatch, and we do get to know the Tailies, but by season's end, most of the Tailies are dead, and the hatch is blown up. The mystery certainly did its job, but in retrospect, it was kind of for nothing, besides a few character building moments. Which brings me to the Flashbacks. These moments in the first season often gave us insight into the characters, but in season two, they mostly tell us what we already know, and a lot of them feel just straight-up pointless and not enjoyable. Sure, they're useful when first meeting the Tailies, but that's about it.<br /><br />Then there's the crime this season commits against its characters. By the end of the first season, we had grown to love these characters, and while they weren't always likable, they had a good reason to be so. This season however, it seems the Island has a tendency to just make everybody annoying/jerky. Basically Sawyer, Sayid & Locke are untouched by this rampage of bad turns with characters, but that's because they align with who they were last season. I can't say as much for the rest of the characters. Jack becomes increasingly more irrational/annoying when he goes he becomes more of a roguish leader shaped by the harsh reality of the Island. Kate isn't given that much to do, but between love-triangles & more irrationality, she became annoying very quickly. Michael wasn't there for most of the season, and he was just trying to get his son back, but I found him more frustrating and just being in the way of the action I actually cared about to care about his predicament, or even try to justify his actions, since they were completely irrational. Sun & Jin took way too long to get where they were going in their personal journeys.<br /><br />And then there was Charlie. My god, what did the producers/writers do to Charlie? There was simply no reason to bring back the heroin storyline with him, and they just made him into a pompous jerk bent on being a smart-ass & nothing more. There was simply no reason to do this, and again, the Writers spent a LONG time after that to get the guy to become likable again, and it just barely worked because it reminded us of the Charlie of Season 1, since Charlie of Season 2 was a douche. I also wasn't a fan of Claire, since she became the new Shannon, ala annoying screaming girl, who I just lost all physical attraction for. And again, most of her actions are not rational in any sense of the word.<br /><br />But, for all that Season 2 does wrong with the characters, it does introduce us to the wonder that is Michael Emerson & Desmond Hume. Henry Gale/Ben Linus just makes for such a perfect foil of John Locke, and his character is just so compelling, even though you don't know a single thing about him. His expressions, his actions, every word he speaks and doesn't speak is absolutely spell-binding. And even though Desmond Hume is only in the Season a grand total of 2 or 3 episodes, the character is fascinating on every level, and does the most with his short time.<br /><br />Overall, the story is compelling and a lot of interesting stuff is raises, the Season suffers from a grand sense of pointlessness, and what it does to the characters that we fell in love with just a season before, is almost unforgivable. They may have Lost their way, but at least there's enough good elements here to find yourself getting through the Season, on to bigger and better stuff.
0061922315|5.0|The Secret Daughter is a quick read told by five people; Kavita and Jasu, the poor Indian birth parents of a baby girl, Somer and Krishnan, American doctors who adopt the baby; and Asha, their daughter.  The book covers the emotional highs and lows that are so common in any adoption plus the struggles the characters have in their very diverse lives.     The story includes the plight of India's desperately poor.  Infanticide, untenable living conditions, and the incredible contrast between the \\"haves\\" and \\"have-nots\\" are touched on, but the main story is the age-old one of the birth mother wondering if she did the right thing and worrying about her daughter, the adoptive mother wondering if she was a good enough mom, and the daughter wondering why she was given up for adoption.  I would have preferred there be more coverage about the world of Indian women, both rich and poor, but that was not this book.  Instead it was a rich tale of two families and two worlds connected by a very lucky young woman.
1608201236|5.0|I could not have asked for a better wrap-up to the Adrien English series, even if I want novellas. I have read every Josh's work and The Dark Tide is Josh's best to-date.<br />There is so much emotions between Adrien and Jake, the intensity of their feelings really getting to me, their struggles almost heartbreaking. Scenes between these two men are just unforgettable, one or two sentences which manage to convey so much, the love, the hurt. Will these two men make it? Will Adrien be able to trust Jake? Is Jake worth it? Conversely is Adrien worth Jake's sacrifice? All these questions are dealt with brilliantly in The Dark Tide. The mystery is tightly paced and well plotted and vintage Josh. But for me the Dark Tide is all about Adrien and Jake, the intensity of these two characters who truly shine, their love and passion. As for the supporting characters they are so well intertwined into the story. Adrien's past lover much to Jake's chagrin. Adrien's extended family, including one adopted puppy and one stray cat, providing heartwarming and light moments. No words could describe The Dark Tide. I have the e-book and am getting the print too. For once MLR press has given us a nice cover. The Dark Tide is just brilliant! If you have been following Adrien's story you are going to love this final book. Sad that it is the final volume but Josh could not have given us a better conclusion!

1417790032|5.0|This book should be required reading for everyone concerned with the state of the modern soul. I agree with the reviewer who countermands the relativist notion that we are all potential Eichmann's.  In fact, Arendt is one of the most forceful advocates for the call to moral responsibility that is our one effective resistance to tyranny and genocide.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I am a really big fan of the Harry Potter books as well as the films, and I must say that--although Half-Blood Prince was not my favorite film--it was an incredible film. To this day, Prisoner of Azkaban remains the strongest piece of filmmaking in the series; but this one closely follows. For those who gave this film a negative review, I can sympathize; but people have to realize what it entails to make a film. It will never be the book. Of course, the first few films followed their stories quite accurately, but the size of the book has played a huge role. As the books have become progressively bigger, it has become more of a challenge for the filmmakers to adapt the story. I think Yates and Steve Kloves did an exceptional job adapting this book. The scenes that needed to be left in, were, and the ones that weren't were chopped off. Many people have complained that the film was boring, but I do not think that has anything to do with how the movie was made. If the movie followed the book, word for word, people still would have had the same complaint. If you're looking for the thrills and adventure that you got in Goblet of Fire, you won't find it here; this film has more of a narrowly-focused plot, whereas in GOF, there seemed to be too much going on for one film. Here, in HBP, Yates chooses to focus on and play up the relationships (since they will be essential for the last film); he touches on certain aspects of Voldemort's past that give clear enough evidence of his origins and why he turned out the way he did; and he builds up an obvious tension for a climax that will inevitably occur in the last film. Not only does Yates deliver a more subtle film, but he delivers one of the best looking films in the series. The visual tone and cinematography of this film are top-notch, and cannot be compared to any of the other films, except Prisoner of Azkaban.     Give this movie a chance and appreciate it in its own terms. If possible, don't step into it prepared to compareit to the book, because chances are you will be disappointed. Additionally, don't think it will be like Goblet of Fire; the book wasn't even like Goblet of Fire. Many people I know seem to put all the films on a scale with Goblet of Fire, but Goblet of Fire worked more on an action level on par with films such as Transformers and Spider-Man. These stories, as they progress, become more focused on a universal and political dilemma: that Voldemort has returned; and the relationships, because of it, are enhanced and exhibited more fluently. Yes, the films become more dialogue-driven and less colorful; but so do the books. In changing the tone and pacing of the movie, the audience is allowed to witness the threat Voldemort poses in the Wizarding World.     Let this movie take you in; it's an amazing work of art and filmmaking.
006190628X|5.0|Lehane's story is very predictable because it is a story that's been told before many times.  But the manner in which Lehane tells it and the manner in which  Stechschulte reads it are both engaging.  Lehane tells the story in a fast paced manner with good emphasis on the development of the main character (who I honestly can't see being played by Leonardo DiCaprio, fine actor though he is).  It doesn't take too long for the listener/reader to figure out what the deal is but I was still invested in wanting to know how and when the main character was going to figure out what the deal was.<br /><br />Lehane uses this well worn story to make some really good points about society in general.  The story takes place in the late 50's but I totally saw it as an allegory for some of the things going on today in society regarding big pharma and the diagnosis/treatment of mental illness.  In addition I saw allegories regarding some of the things critics pointed out about the so-called \\"unAmerican\\" things the Bush Administration did during their wars.<br /><br />Stechschulte did a fine job in his reading, giving each character his own particular voice and style of speaking.  I wrote \\"giving HIS character\\" because my one critique of Stechschulte is that his female character voices all sound too much alike and the main female character he reads in an annoying, breathy voice that seems forced.
0441013074|2.0|Reynolds attempts to blend hard-boiled detective fiction with science fiction and does not come up with a very good book. I put it aside after reading somewhat more than half. I shan't finish, as, by any measure \\"Century Rain\\" is poorly written: the plot is predictable; the characters poorly drawn; and the dialogue leaden. I recommend choosing another book by Reynolds.
031606792X|5.0|The book itself is great. I Read all the bad reviews and I thought that that Stephenie Meyer did a terrible job, but it was the opposite.Don't let others influence the way you see things.  Make your own judgement.<br /><br />Now, the book is a bit different from the movie, because it's more longer 700+ pages, but all in all, it's the same plot. I loved the book, and now that I've seen the movie, I'm going to read the book again.
0670021652|4.0|Don't go into this expecting a replay of Eat Pray Love. EPL so profoundly affected us all mainly because it was the culmination of years of struggle and thought put into one place. Nothing else is going to match that, so don't hold this to the same standard. Relative to EPL, this is fluff. It is quite a beautiful book, though. I love Gilbert's writing style, and the realities of figuring out what you want and what you can have in love and marriage are very nice to have on paper. Strongly recommend it.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I'm always keen to see the Pixar films. For me (and my girlfriend), they are the pinnacle of 3D animation films. All people involved seem to understand that the animation side is secondary to character development and depth. Although I enjoy 3D animated films from other studios (Sony, Dreamworks etc), they always seem to fall into the typecast bucket.For example: token black guy/girl who says things like \\"That's what I'm talking about\\", or \\"You can't touch this\\" etc etc, whether they're a hippo, a zebra or a mammoth. Then there's the central annoying white guy/girl, who usually does something to annoy all his/her friends, and ends up redeeming his/her self. And at the end there's always the obligatory terrible dance tune like \\"I like to move it move it\\". Tiresome, obvious jokes, that do sometimes hit the mark and genuinely make me laugh, but more often than not reek of White Trash-inspired dumbness.  But Pixar has a way of avoiding all these cliches and pot holes, and instead bring stories filled with depth, true humour, sadness, and all ranges of visual and emotional splendour that leave you feeling great (and usually quite thoughtful!).    Way to go Pixar. You may be the only part of Disney that isn't out to exploit all children for their parents' money!
0670021652|4.0|I liked this book a lot. At first I was afraid it wouldn't live up to Eat, Pray, Love, but it was equally engaging, just different. I finished it in a 24-hour span (and I have a small child). Gilbert writes about how her now-husband, Felipe, is detained by the Department of Homeland Security because of his too-frequent visits to the U.S., and forbidden to return. His magic ticket back to the country? Marriage. Both Gilbert and Felipe are scarred by divorce, but not willing to part with each other. So Gilbert takes a year's crash course in marriage around the world, interviewing her friends and women in other countries. I learned an enormous amount, and most of it was fascinating. Occasionally Gilbert is too long-winded and a little repetitive, but these flaws did not significantly mar a charming and informative book.

B000MU4F5Y|5.0|I can't believe the only review you have on this record.  I read it and just had to respond to such blasphemy.  If you were into rock n roll in 1967, and I suspect the other reviewer wasn't even alive then, you would have definitely remembered what a treat Sgt. Pepper was when it came out.  Everyone agreed that it was years ahead of it's time, and we were right.  The whole album is beautiful; needless to say, a person could on for half an hour talking about the great songs on it.  If you think this album is dull, clear your mind, forget about all other music for about 40 minutes and just listen in a nice quiet spot.
1594488878|4.0|I really liked this book. It might be my favorite work by Nick Hornby. It tells the story of Duncan (pathetic, obsessed fan), Annie (ready for a new lease on life) and Tucker Crowe (an aging ex-musician who is the target of Duncan's obsession). Unexpectedly, Tucker emails Annie after reading her review of his CD, which is called Juliet, Naked. With that correspondence, all three lives change.    I thought Annie was particularly believable, and I liked the way Hornby explored everyone's motivation. I also enjoyed his whimsical sense of humor. My one complaint was a slightly ambiguous ending.
0307454541|4.0|I'm not much for mystery novels & don't read them often, but this book captured my attention shortly after it's release.  After recommending it to my book club I knew I would make myself read it.  I am so glad I did!  This book is in my top ten favorite books of all times.  It starts out a little slow and clinical but the details in the beginning really help you understand the main characters.  After 5 chapters, I could not put it down.  I stayed up late into the night reading & thought about the book all day until I was able to sit down & read more.  I loved it!

1563890119|4.0|Gaiman's Sandman series is widely considered one of the finest achievements in the graphic novel medium, but does it live up to all the hype?  In this opening volume, a mortal who intends to capture Death accidentally snags her sibling Dream instead and winds up keeping him prisoner for decades.  Finally escaping, Dream sets about reclaiming his lost talismans so he can rebuild his kingdom, which has greatly deteriorated during his long captivity.<br /><br />There are some pretty good moments among these dozen stories; I especially liked the cleverly-done duel with Lucifer Morningstar, and the truly gruesome sequences that relate to Dr. Destiny's attempt to destroy the entire human race.  And in the concluding episode we finally get to meet Death herself, who isn't at all what we might have expected.  But not everything in this collection clicks.  The art varies from mediocre to decent - certainly not great, while the storytelling is good but only occasionally superior.  The few brief cameos from the DC Universe are pretty insignificant, and don't add much to the stories, but on the other hand, many readers won't recognize these characters anyway and they only detract from the unique cosmology that Gaiman is creating for us.  And ultimately, that's the key to this book's reputation: as the title suggests, this is only the prelude.  The subsequent volumes each build on the cornerstones laid in this collection, and there's plenty of promise here.  Mind you, horror's not really my thing, but this was certainly all around good enough that I'm eager to go on to \\"The Doll's House\\", and see what further surprises are in store.  But is this volume really light-years ahead of everything else in the comics world?  Probably not.  Three and a half stars.
0307269981|5.0|Bought this book the day it came out!  I had waited long enough & wasn't going to waste a minute.  I think I read this in less than 4 days, sneaking in pages while cooking, waiting for kids to get off the bus, in the gym locker room -- anywhere I could read it!  I loved it more than the prequel and actually found it to be an easier read.  I cannot wait for #3!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Unbelievable! Watch it the first week of December! These true heroes are dying out..... you owe it to them to experience this epic!  Pay close attention to the narratives by the interviewed veterans in these episodes and the last episode will stir your heart!
B00079FUI6|5.0|My BOYFRIEND got me into this series, and i couldn't be happier. It is hilarious and addicting. We got this season here at a great price.
B001LF347E|5.0|I have a region-free DVD player, so I purchased this in region 2 from Amazon UK. So, assuming the US release will be the same, this DVD not only contains 13 exceptionally good episodes but lots and lots of interesting extra features that will bring you up close and personal with the utterly CHARMING stars of this great show.<br /><br />I say great, because season 1 of Merlin (comparing it to the other recent family-friendly BBC shows that I've seen) is orders of magnitude better than Robin Hood, and solidly better than season 1 of Doctor Who. The stories, while not especially complex, are very entertaining and colorful, and the fresh, young actors are all really fantastic finds. I would say that Bradley James as Arthur slightly edges out the rest to be the best of the lot, and Colin Morgan is so fascinating you can't take your eyes off him. The writing is fast and witty with lots of humor and some surprising depth. And the castle is real!<br /><br />So, season 1 of Merlin is most definitely worth buying, keeping, and watching more than once.<br /><br />Oh, but wait until you see what's coming next! Also via Amazon UK I also have Merlin season 2. And if season 1 is great, season 2 is utterly fantastic!! I won't say too much or give anything away, but I will say this: they chose the right actors. Because season 2 pushes every character to extremes far beyond season 1 and all of them rise to it magnificently. Absolutely one of the best shows I've ever seen. And good news! There will be a season 3. And hopefully many more.
B000BZIT5M|5.0|WOW! I just finished viewing this fabulous opera.La Boheme has long been a favorite opera of mine. I cut my opera   teeth on the Von Karajan reading showcasing His Highness Luciano Pavoratti & Mirella Freni. I didn't think anything  could better that monumental effort.I must confess I was wrong.There are the technical issues other reviewers have   noted. Ghost images and such.The scenic designer deserves their kudos because they accomplished what the opera calls  for.Rusticness was in abundance.I half expected a mouse to run across the floor of the garrett in Act 1.Benoit should have been reported to the Housing Authority. Guess that's what landlords can get away with when you don't  pay your rent. I shudder to think what Mimi's place looked like!      Ileana Cotrubas was born to play this role. Physically,she is the Mimi & Gilda not the Traviata & Manon.Her  performance I find difficult to put into words. She wraps each note with so much beauty one can hardly stand it.  Perhaps,because of her reputation of being difficult, she knew that she always had to bring her \\"A\\" game.She could  never phone it in. Not that she ever would.Her coyness & elation in the role establish her,to me, as the greatest   acting opera singer ,bar none.The role will never be sung and acted better.      Neil Shicoff was a wonderful Rodolfo.Singly and when paired with Ms.Cotrubas, he was magnificent!His,too,is an  instrument beyond compare.The supporting cast is stellar. This is the definitive La Boheme on film.Puccini would  be very proud indeed. A must for every collection!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|If Sean were 35 today, this is how he would have played this part!!!! Sean Connery is \\"James Bond\\". I didn't care much for the actors that took on this role after him. I really tried to like Pierce in this roll but he just missed it it by a fraction. Daniel Craig brings the book version of Bond to the screen! \\"Casino Royale\\" is the best Bond movie script ever made. If you haven't seen it, do so! You won't be sorry!
0307266303|5.0|Having read tens if not scores of running books, I put this one near the top of the list for readability, breadth of information and overall composition. But if you are looking for a \\"how to\\" book on running - look elsewhere. This is not an instructional text. Its more of a philosphy. That being said, I did enjoy it thoroughly and, despite having just recently finished it will likely re-read it again soon. Highly recommended.
B00365YVRO|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015T963C Kindle Wireless Reading Device (6\\" Display, Global Wireless, Latest Generation)]]  Sade maintains her style without compromising her taste.  A true fan will recognize and enjoy her sounds, still, today.  Fabulous.  I enjoyed the two new song styles on Soldier of Love and remark about her traditional taste.  Sade is timeless and classic on this CD/Album.  She continues to make brilliant music that captures your heart and stirs your soul.  Well, I guess to keep your style and flavor, you have to be a soldier for what you love and cultivate it.  It is unfortunate, the times which Soldier of Love could be indicative about.     by ShuGaimes
031606792X|5.0|Meh, lots of naysayers.  But if they didnt love the story they never would have made it to book 4.  Decent wrap up of the story.  I do agree with naysayers in one way tho, she does get everything and gives up nothing.  I love the story, i love the characters.  Doesnt matter what you think of #4, if you read 1-3 you MUST read #4, there is no way around it.
B000BNX3B4|4.0|If you love Lane & Cusack movies, you \\"Must Love Dogs\\" the movie!! Heh heh! Great one liners, and a great cast!! The cast of characters around these two is phenomenal! An overlooked gem! I watch again periodically!
B000F4RHB6|4.0|This compilation replaces 1996's [[ASIN:B000002HNV Time Flies: The Best of Huey Lewis & the News]] and trumps that prior disc in every way.  The prior collection only contained 16 tracks, 4 of which were \\"new\\" tracks which never really did become \\"hits\\".  In addition to the 12 genuine hits on \\"Time Flies\\", \\"Greatest Hits\\" adds 9 must have hits for almost 80 minutes of as-good-as-it-gets 1980's pop.        As others have stated some, not all, of the tracks are \\"single\\" versions.  While this is not a problem for the tracks from [[ASIN:B000008HPE Fore!]] and [[ASIN:B000008HPG Picture This]] which clock in at just about their original length, it is noticeable on the [[ASIN:B00000JCFP Sports]] tracks \\"Heart of Rock & Roll\\", which is about 1 minute shorter than the LP version, & \\"I Want a New Drug\\" which loses more than a minute. The biggest victim is \\"Couple Days Off\\" from [[ASIN:B00000DRAO Hard at Play]] which is slashed by over a minute and a half, losing much of its relentless drive and powerful drumming. Still, if you were used to hearing Huey Lewis on the radio back in the mid '80s and you're looking to recapture those days, then these \\"single\\" versions should suit your needs just fine.      I'm not hearing any audio revelations on this CD but I think the sonics are as good as it's going to get and a marked improvement over the earliest releases of the Huey Lewis catalog on CD. I think the sometimes dense and compressed sound is simply of a reflection of the recording and production techniques used to make these albums back in the '80s.      If you want to dig a bit deeper but don't want to have to spring for all the individual CDs, I also recommend the 3-disc [[ASIN:B0000DEL4W Thirty Six All Time Greatest]] which is bare-bones in terms of packaging (no liner notes) but chock to the rim with just about every essential track from the first five LPs (5 of 10 tracks from the original (out of print) [[ASIN:B000AL8YRK Huey Lewis And The News]], 8 of 10 tracks from \\"Picture This\\", 6 of 9 from \\"Sports\\", 9 of 10 from \\"Fore!\\", 5 of 10 from [[ASIN:B000008HPH Small World]], the two singles from \\"Hard at Play\\", plus \\"Power of Love\\" from \\"Back to the Future\\"). While the \\"Heart of R&R\\" and \\"Want a New Drug\\" are sadly included in their single versions here as well, \\"Couple Days Off\\" is present in its full 5-minute version. At $30.00 it's a bit steep and you will lose \\"Back in Time\\" plus later hits \\"It's Alright\\", \\"But It's Alright\\", and \\"Cruisin\\", but \\"Thirty-Six All Time Greatest\\" may be all the Huey Lewis you ever need and includes some essential album tracks not included on \\"Greatest Hits\\".
0446401307|3.0|Although I love Connelly and I found this outing to be adequate for a Bosch \\"fix,\\" it really didn't grab me the way other Bosch books have. Part of it was because I figured it out too easily, knew too soon what had happened and what was going to happen. I don't know why.<br /><br />Another disappointment was that it advanced literally nothing in the overall story of Harry Bosch. I know it's hard to keep a character moving when the essence of the character's situation is that it really DOESN'T change, but I want Harry to stop treading water.<br /><br />It felt like a stop-gap, without enough imagination/innovation, and a little lacking in energy, too.<br /><br />But of course, if you're a fan like me, you'll enjoy it anyway!
B002M5E2DW|5.0|Because of \\"The Secret\\", and my fearless application of its principles, I have received several \\"out-of-the-blue\\" benefits: 1) I no longer wear glasses. I'd worn them since I was 16. I'm 34. 2) I have a new job with a great boss, and opportunity for advancement; 3) I have projected numerous parking places, dinner tables, and other limited-quantity privileges at peak times, occasionally being given prime positions by valets or concierges above earlier guests; 4) I wanted to upgrade my iPod Touch from 8 to 16 gigabytes (last summer) without paying for them, and I focused so hard I attracted 2 of them by 2 different family members who wanted to just give them to me for no reason!<br /><br />Also using the Secret's principles, I have actually been provided by insurance a restoration to my house. It cost over $4000. I paid only $100! Only 2.5%!<br /><br />It is possible these things COULD have happened by themselves; but The Secret helped me to get into a resourceful state to recognize the opportunities for what they were, and to speak and act in ways that caused the special treatment. In either case, be it Universal Providence or merely \\"applied behaviorist expectancy\\", I've received results.<br /><br />For all the naysayers: this book may be over-commercialized. The DVD might be cheesy, especially since they edited out some of the (supposedly) better stuff due to royalties-SNAFU from a couple original voices. But Results are Results. Anyone poo-pooing The Secret fall in the category described within of people who cannot open their imaginations to Einstein's quote (paraphrased), \\"One must ask oneself, 'Do I see the Universe as Friendly to me?'\\"<br /><br />I dared take The Secret's challenge, and have turned my life on it's end, coming out on top!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Superb! We were enthralled to see the King of Pop in his final days.  His creation was ready to be born into the world, at least all the hard work was not completely lost...  his death was preventable, Michael Jackson is yet another tragic example of several industries gone awry.
1847879071|4.0|I find this book very practical for those who are trying to figure out how to use SPSS, whithout having to go into detailed formulas and deep statistical understanding. I recommend it for PhD students and researchers who want to squeeze information from their data and make fair interpretation of their results. Thanks to the clear and step by step explanations provided in this book, you do not need to be a statistician to understand what your numbers are telling you.
B00275EGX8|3.0|HURT LOCKER is a good flick.  It gives you a good feel for what the war in Iraq is really like, and it allows you a bird's eye view of a difficult and very dangerous job.  I do feel the movie was a little overhyped.  I was expecting more from all of the Oscar buzz and some reviewers comparing it to the best war movies (Ex: SAVING PRIVATE RYAN).  In my opinion it does not compare with the very best war movies.  I think a lot of it has to do with the budget of the movie.  This is a much smaller movie than some of the best war movies.  The HURT LOCKER is well done, and my only real complaint is you don't get a real good feel for the three main characters, what make's them tick, why are they in Iraq, how do they feel about the war are all questions I found myself asking with few answers.  The main character Jeremy Renner is very cocky and takes a lot of risks, but they don't really explain how his approach developed.  There is little background information on any of the character's, which is always something I find enjoyable in these types of movies.  I enjoyed the movie and would recommend it, but do not expect SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.
B00365YVRO|5.0|I once read a 'professional' music review attempting to describe Sade's music...the one word that stood out was 'honest.' I agree. She sang (sings) a lot about love, and you believe her. And ANYONE who ever heard THAT VOICE in the 80s for the first time HAD to want to hear it again, and again! Even today, 'Hang on to you love' has lyrical value, sounds better, and is light years ahead of the current crop of female non-singers. I do think she could have put a few more tracks on SOLDIER OF LOVE that were reminiscent of her heydey..like \\"Never as good as the first time\\" or \\"Nothing can come between us\\" or my all time favorite tune: \\"Kiss of life\\" ...nuff said! Kudos to a great 'throwback' CD jacket (album cover) as well.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|All I've heard about this movie was that it was the scariest movie ever made, so my wife just had to have it. What a waste of money. Scariest movie ever? Are you kidding me? The only scary part was when Kate was dragged out of bed and down the hall. The rest of the movie actually sucked!!! The first half was so boring I almost fell asleep. We kept waiting to be really scared, but it never happened! Wost movie I ever saw. Don't even waste your money renting it. It's that bad !!!
B002DKGWSE|4.0|LEAVE THE KIDS AT HOME!!!  This one is definitely a spine-tingling chiller and what makes it a flick for true horror fans is the fact that this type of horror exists in this cruel, cruel world.  Not for the squeamish...a definite must for revenge-flick fanatics...and probably not one you'd take mom to, either.  I believe the original was more \\"original\\", but this one lives up to modern-day gore-or.  The original film was much more believable and the acting had no trace of Hollywood.  This one had its millennium feel to it.  Being the father of a daughter and having two grandgirls, I felt the anguish and pain...it truly hit home.  I watched it alone (my dog was curled up on his dog bed).  I think that was a good idea.  FOUR stars.  I gave the original FIVE of them.
B002JIOQCO|4.0|Cosmic Egg is a good sequel to their first album.  The sound is very similar to their first album, which in my opinion is a good thing.  Wolfmother reminds me of a modern day Led Zeppelin.  If you are a Wolfmother fan definitely check this album out!
B002RKSZWG|4.0|This was a typical Jane Austen love story and a well-written piece.  I actually found it quite quick.  My only gripe is that this story (compared to \\"Mansfield Park\\" or \\"Pride and Prejudice\\") is quite incomplete in descriptions about the mannerisms between some characters *at the time of their occurance* that, though explained fully in the last couple of chapters, a reader would not find them as easily recognizable as one would hope.  I was slightly shocked to see the motives behind two of the characters.  It was a good read but it did feel a little incomplete.

B000MRAAJM|4.0|I saw this series when it first aired in the U.S. on A&E.  It was an amazing experience in HD, even with the relatively restricted bandwidth and high compression of HD cable.  On Blu Ray it is a revelation.  I enjoyed Sigourney Weaver's narration on the U.S. cut, but also liked Attenborough's original track here, while not having a strong preference for either.  I did like the additional footage seen in the BBC edit, which was lost to commericals when the show aired in the U.S.  This was one of my first Blu Ray purchases after I bought my Blu Ray player this past Thanksgiving and I've already watched it through a couple of times.  (It is a great set to share with others, not to mention showing off my system.)

B002QGUFWE|5.0|\\"The Fame Monster [Deluxe Edition]\\" will go down in music history as one of the best extended debut pop/dance albums ever.  It's loaded with catchy, danceable, and repeat-listenable tracks--with enough hooks to catch a sea full of fish!  If you don't \\"get\\" Lady Gaga overall, well, trust me, you're not letting yourself go enough in life (loosen up, folks, it feels good, wakes you up, and won't hurt you!).  Allow Gaga the performer and Gaga the songwriter to mess with your head in a pleasurable way.  She's great performance art in motion.  She's got a real singing voice (check her out on YouTube for dozens of fascinating live performance versions of her many original songs--some sung with only a piano accompanying her--she doesn't have to hide behind a production studio's door to sound good).  My youth was spent listening to and watching folks like Annie Lennox, Deborah Harry, Cyndi Lauper, and Elton John (and with the mind-tweaking likes of Monty Python and Mad Magazine as well)--Annie, Deborah, Cyndi and Elton have prominently gone on record as loving Gaga.  Think of what they were like in their youth, and you'll \\"get\\" why:  She's a breath of fresh air in the music and art world, just as they were back then (I still love all four and consider them still vital, but you get my point about how all 4 were also breaths of fresh air when they first emerged on the music scene), someone really pushing the envelope in an increasingly pre-packaged, slick, mind-numbing era...as Gaga says, \\"Just Dance, It'll Be OK\\"...and have a blast!  Let yourself become one of her \\"Little Monsters\\" (her nickname for her fans).
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this video after running into two different friends that had really toned up.  I asked them what they were doing and they both said 30-Day Shred.  I've done it several days now and can really feel a difference, especially in my upper body.  My friend recommended going up to the next level about every 10 days. It's nice also that it is only 20 mins long.  I only took off a star because sometimes it hurts my knees.  In Level 1, there is a good bit of jumping jacks and butt kicks.   I also like exercise videos made by \\"Prevention\\".
B001OQCV6K|4.0|No one will probably ever top Jeremy Brett as Holmes.  Anyone reading this who has any interest in filmed versions of the Sherlock Holmes stories should immediately watch/rent/borrow/buy the Granada television series from the 80's.  They are simply superb.  Anyway, I was shocked at how much this movie did not suck.  Robert Downey Jr. does an excellent job.  Jude Law does too.  It was fun and funny.  It's mostly an action movie.  I would guess the aim of the movie was to present Sherlock Holmes to audiences used to things like Batman or any of the latest crop of comic book action hero movies of the last few years.  Could it have benefited from some more breathing room for engaging dialogue with deductive reasoning and dramatic tension?  Sure.  Do the kids want that?  Heck no!  Are there a lot of explosions?  Yes.  Are there too many?  Maybe. Does the movie have anything to do with the original stories?  Yes, the movie never does anything that you couldn't imagine Sherlock or Watson doing.  It's just sort of hyped up.  There are fight scenes.  Sherlock could fight.  It's in the original stories.  Sherlock does deserve a movie that matches his contemplative mood.  A movie for boring old farts like me.  Does anyone make those kinds of movies anymore?  This movie is more akin to Moulin Rouge than it is The Good the Bad and the Ugly.  It's in your face and the kids won't fall asleep due to explosions.  There's nothing in it that will make you cringe.  The story isn't amazing but it's passable.
1595141715|3.0|Clay Jensen finds a package outside of his house---a shoebox with cassette tapes inside painted on with nail polish. He is to listen to these tapes, and pass them on. There are seven tapes inside, those that discuss thirteen reasons (and thirteen people) that Hannah Baker decided to kill herself. If they don't get listened to and passed on, there will be consequences for the people on the tapes. (I never figured out how she would follow through with the consequences) Clay, who is a \\"good guy,\\" doesn't seem to understand why he received those tapes or what he did. But, he listens anyway, captivated, and soon finds out why she decided to commit suicide.<br /><br />I really liked the premise, and it was a quick read. I have disliked characters before and it hasn't ruined the story for me, but there were a LOT of unlikable and annoying characters in this book, including Hannah. I get that she is depressed, but I would think that's going a little bit far to blame other people for your suicide. Maybe I thought that some of the \\"reasons\\" would be a bigger deal. Some of them I totally get...but someone smacking your butt, someone using you for rides to parties...really? Sometimes, her reasons came out a little bit whiny. I know that the author said he got together with his wife and female writing partners to find out about some experiences that they would never get over, but maybe people are just more sensitive than me.<br /><br />I gave it as many stars as I did because I never once wanted to give up on the book. I thought that there would be more toward the end that would save the book and make it a little bit better. I didn't give it more stars because of the reasons mentioned above and it was also frustrating to listen to Hannah's tapes and hear constant interruption from Clay's thoughts and actions. Even though they were in different fonts, it made it difficult to follow at times.<br /><br />For a YA book it's not bad, but I have read many that are better.

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Like alot of people I came to the \\"Firefly\\" universe by way of the movie \\"Senerity\\". I read a glowing review of the movie by sci-fi author Orson Scott Card, and when I realized it was a Joss Whedon project I had to see it. I loved the movie so much I started watching \\"Firefly\\" reruns on the Sci-Fi network when I could. Of course I was already a huge fan of \\"Buffy The Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" so I thought \\"Firefly\\" couldn't be too bad. It was Great! It's like a great western but in space. However, since I'm reviewing the dvd and not just the series I have to give it 4 stars instead of 5. The dvd is supposed to contain optional audio commentary by Joss Whedon and the cast on certain episodes. My copy did not contain the audio commentary despite the fact it said so on the box. However, this is only a minor flaw and is still worth owning.
1594488843|4.0|Dan Pink is a provocative writer and a clear thinker, and in this book we are given another example of Pink's intelligence and insight into the world of business, the arts, education, and any other field where harnessing human motivation is critical for personal or organizational success.  I enjoyed reading this book, and while some other reviewers have poked holes in Pink's use of research on motivation, or have found parts of his argument where there may seem to be apparent contradictions, nonetheless I think this book is an important and very helpful read.  As noted by other reviewers, the core of this book is Pink's exploration of motivation, both how companies and organizations have historically motivated their participants/employees, and how he sees organizations that will excel in the future approaching these tasks differently in order to unleash creativity and innovation among their ranks.  To accompany his central argument, Pink has included a number of resources, conversation starters, books to read, activities to undertake, and a recap of the book as a sort of \\"tool kit\\" to help implement the concepts found in the book.<br /><br />After a survey of the existing reviews, there isn't much to add to the current discussion.  Thankfully, Amazon has created a community where a broad diversity of opinions can be represented, and those that are the best will rise to the top.  Read the other reviews, and take my reactions as complementary, rather than as exhaustive.  Like a wiki, I'm contributing to the whole, not reinventing the wheel.  As a Christian educator, however, I will add one particular take away I found of value.<br /><br />Pink's stress on the need for autonomy, mastery, and purpose among individuals in organizations that will have the greatest success in the 21st century is an important message for those leading in the religious sphere.  The problem, of course, is creating an environment where this type of motivation becomes intrinsic.  Oftentimes religion is cast in terms of \\"carrots and sticks.\\"  However, those who undergo the most radical types of transformation, particularly in Christianity, should not view their faith this way.  In this regard, Pink's insights are helpful for someone like me, who is seeking to unlock motivation in those that I lead that will help them to realize the highest ideals of Christian faith, and thus become exemplary persons of character that reflect the person of Jesus.<br /><br />One final thought: I think this book is worth reading, and even if you find yourself disagreeing with Pink at times, his argument will nonetheless provoke you to engage in the conversation, and, if so, we'll all be better off.terms of \\"carrots and sticks.\\"  However, those who undergo the most radical types of transformation, particularly in Christianity, should not view their faith this way.

0375413405|5.0|The recipes that we have tried so far have produced wonderful tablefare.  A note of caution: these recipes are somewhat involved and using this book requires some study and preperation.  Do not pull out the book, flip through and think to have a meal ready in an hour.  On the other hand, the preperation and cooking process is fun and the tastes are different (in a very good way) than the cooking that I am used to.  Another word of caution: If you are into health food, don't even bother - this book is not for you.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|I remember buying this cd at a store a couple years ago, and I could not be any happier with my choice.<br />The Sufferer and the Witness is just an amazing album.<br />The album gets a great start with Chamber the Cartridge, and the energy is flowing throughout the whole album.<br />Unlike Siren Song, The Sufferer & the Witness actually has two \\"soft\\" songs (The Approaching Curve and Roadside). They change the tone of the cd ever so slightly, but they are not bad songs at all. The Approaching Curve is a very emotional song, and once you realize its meaning, it gets to you pretty deep.<br />Back to the rest of the cd... it's all great. Nothing should be missed on this album. The vocals and lyrics are on par with all Rise Against songs, and should not be ignored. Sandwiched between The Approaching Curve and Roadside is my favorite section of this album: \\"Worth Dying For\\" followed by \\"Behind Closed Doors\\". Of course, you will be sad once this cd ends, but the conclusion of The Good Left Undone/Survive will just leave you stunned. This is the culmination of the album, and it is done with two of Rise Against's greatest songs.
0812973992|4.0|I am fairly certain that had this book been published when I was in college, it would have been assigned reading in one of my courses.This is definitely not a novel that one would give to a friend who is about to vacation at the beach.<br />As I've gotten older, I've discovered that required reading was intended to make me think, and now I actually enjoy it (who'd a thunk it).There is much to think about in this novel.<br />Foremost, in my mind is the author's choice of characters to write about. He has chosen to depict human fraility as resplendant with drugs, crime, veniality and personal arrogance. Yes, redeeming characteristics are present, but it is those on the fringe of society that the author wants us to think about and disect.  Is it any wonder that our hero (Corrigan) dresses in black given the depressing portrayal of most of the characters. Is this a slice of life we need to spend time examining? I think so. My wife did not.<br />I can think of no higher compliment to an excellent writer than \\"he/she has a way with words\\" Colum McCann is such a writer, which makes reading whatever he writes worthwhile.<br />Which leaves us with the searing question, what's with the man on the wire? I'm saving that answer for my term paper.
0812973992|5.0|This was an amazing book, especially if you remember Sept 11th and the demise of the Twin Towers in NYC.  And, if you've seen the amazing documentary, \\"Man on Wire\\", it's even better.  In fact, I would suggest renting and watching that movie before reading the book as it will provide a richer context to your read.      The writing captured me from the first page to the last.  And, even though it seemed a bit contrived at times, the two degrees of separation between all the characters was actually both intriguing and entertaining.  The book is so well-written.  There are sentences and paragraphs  you want to underline and savor later on their own.      I also found the book to be a fast read because it is so engaging.  I've recommended it to several of my friends as I found it a \\"must read\\".
B002RVCD6O|1.0|I kept thinking it would get better.     No, it was a complete waste of the 2 dollar fee to view it.    The movie had no point, a thin plot, the only thing that happened of any import was at the end.    Don't waste your time, don't buy this turkey, pretend it never happened.
B002UD56I6|5.0|A disc well worth the wait!! Excellent in every way!!  Watching video was definitely bittersweet.  I still can't believe he's gone.  The \\"This Is It\\" Concert would have definitely been a \\"concert of concerts!!\\"  So sad we weren't able to see him enjoy all the fruits of his and others efforts.  He was such a gift to us all, and thank God we have his video capturing the essence of his talent, genius & love... :>)  Michael is such a great loss to the world and more, and thank God he'll forever be alive in our hearts, because we're all so fortunate to have all his videos and music for all time... :>)

0393324818|5.0|MONEYBALL is a great book. Michael Lewis is a writer who knows how to keep the reader moving through the book. There is a lot of detail in this text and it is written with excitement that keeps you flipping the pages. There is a constant sense of, \\"What is going to happen next?\\" or \\"Why did they do that?\\" and Lewis is able to present already interesting information in an even more interesting format that keeps your eyes glued to the page: \\"All he saw was that one major league baseball team treated him like a used carpet in a Moroccan garage sale...\\" When you have language such as this, coupled with information as to how an under-bankrolled baseball team produces winning records, you have one awesome book.    Statistical information proves that numbers are better at determining what is successful than what the eye can see. Purchase this book if you want to learn a few things and, simultaneously, be entertained in the process.

I listen to a lot of rock music myself also but this album is just garbage in my opinion. He need to stick to what hes good at which is rapping. I guess its good he tried something new but it is Fail! If he keeps making music like this I will no longer be a fan and just keep bump his old good stuff. Hes turning into one of them artists that people say \\"his old stuff is better\\".
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|Most of the reviews both by Disney fans and critics alike are all focusing on the wrong viewpoint of this film.<br />The point is not that Tiana is African American (my children don't notice because children don't see \\"colors\\"on skin) or that this is not exactly traditional Disney fare. The point is that a modern character faced modern problems and that love and the timeless story of The Princess and the Frog prevailed. Tiana is a frog for nearly the entirety of the film because that is who she was in life. In fact, she's a frog from the beginning until the last 15 minutes of the film and becomes human long before the surprise ending of the Dr. Facilier's frog spell. True it was Prince Naveen who \\"transformed\\" her but Tiana's refusal to see love or friendship was caused by ambition. This ambition wasn't bad or for selfish reasons, but in pursuit of her fathers dream she ignored everything he had tried to teach her. If you look past the political correctness or the \\"coloring issues\\" within the movie you can see this clear as day! My four year old got it and when Tiana goes in search of Naveen to tell him that she's fallen for him, my son declared loudly in the middle of the theater, \\"he love her mama!\\". When the Charlotte tries to break the spell without \\"getting her prince\\" he was ecstatic and when he saw the impostor prince \\"marrying\\" Charlotte he was heartbroken.<br /><br />The magic is not Disney fare but it fits in perfectly with a cultural immersion of New Orleans. It goes without saying that the animation is GORGEOUS and the music is good too. The gospel number with Mama Odie is by far my favorite!<br /><br />The secondary characters almost steal the show. Charlotte in all her spoiled glory is actually a big-hearted, cute and hilarious Southern Belle. Mama Odie is lovable and zany and goes around nearly killing her beloved pet snake and smacking \\"young 'uns\\" on the arm for their \\"stupidity\\". Big Louis is funny and gives the movie a faster pace. Ray is by far my VERY favorite \\"supporting actor\\" and will belong in the same pantheon with Jimminy Cricket and Tinker Bell. I won't spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but Disney's second star to the right will be immortalized forever thanks to Ray.<br /><br />All in all the modern retelling of the fairy tale is needed for this generation. Times are hard, we have to work harder and our dreams may not come true in the way we thought they would, but LOVE is still worth fighting for.

0385504225|3.0|Loved the Da Vinci Code, despite the controversy, liked very much Angels and Demons and was mostly bored silly by The Lost Symbol. Its feels recycled and plodding. Da Vinci was so exciting and moved like lightening. Maybe the character of Langdon is burned out, but it felt really slow and false. Still there are interesting bits and enjoyable semantic revelations, but as a whole it was not nearly as good as his previous work. The revelation of the villain at the end (figured it out hundreds of pages prior) had the feel of a Scooby Doo episode where the villain is unmasked at the end.
B002ZG997C|3.0|It did have the effect of making us argue afterwards, and all weekend long, about the two so-called surprise twists in the picture.  It's worth seeing if only for that good post-mortem that sends you to the diner arguing over french fries about the real meaning of the scene between Denzel Washington and Jennifer Beals.<br /><br />Otherwise, the film is ridiculously bleak and heavyhanded.  Tumbleweeds, check.  Sepia tones throughout, check.  Cannibals, check.  It is a patchwork of familiar elements that you have seen done better in a hundred other movies.  In one scene, Denzel is held captive in a cell-like room decorated only by a tattered poster from a long-ago 70s apocalypse film, Don Johnson in A Boy and His Dog--itself so much better than The Book of Eli it seemed almost as if the movie was taunting itself!  But instead it was probably intended as a homage...  Much of the movie was one homage stitched onto another...  When Mila Kunis made the sign of the cross to a leering Gary Oldman, it was so much like Bram Stoker's Dracula it was crazy!  And what about the old, decrepit desert house occupied by the two seniors, who call themselves George and Martha?  Their names recall the central couple in Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?, but why?<br /><br />Denzel, Gary Oldman, most of the actors were good, but against all odds.  The things they had to say and act out were ludicrous.  Defeated, perhaps by her character arc, perhaps by her own limitations, was poor Mila Kunis.  I thought Kylie Minogue, much as I love her, a bad actress, but Mila Kunis makes Kylie seem like Dame Judi Dench in comparison.  And yet, I wound up liking her just the same, especially when I read the interview with her that said in preparation for playing \\"Solara\\" opposite Denzel Washington, she had tried to read the Bible.  \\"Which part?\\"  \\"The first part.  Genesis.  But I just couldn't finish it.  It was good but it was boring.\\"  Now, that's what my dad used to call \\"stick to it-ive-ness.\\"
B0002NRQTS|4.0|When this album 1st came out in 1989 when I was 20, I bought it quickly, hoping Rush had released an album on par with earlier works like Moving Pictures, having grown a bit tired of the mid-80's synthesizer period the band went through. My friends and I were listening to a lot of Pink Floyd on our travels, and were in need of something fresh. My first listen to with my girlfriend (now wife) didnt impress me much, though she liked it a little more. And so it went into the cassette case to linger a bit.  Then, my two closest friends and I took an insane fear and loathing type trip to Washington DC for some reason I cant recall. I remember stumbling around the Department of Agriculture drinking a fifth of Jack Daniels out of a sports drink bottle, doing a bunch of other crazy stuff, then ending up on a porch at a ghetto apartment complex shooting fireworks. I pleaded with my friends to come inside before we would be killed to chill a bit.. and that when we got out this album.  I can hear the opening tunes of Show Me Dont Tell Me in my mind today as clear as that late night all those years ago. The albums lyrics somehow represented us, what period we were in \\" Proud stagger out of the school yard, waiting for the worlds applause..\\"  The groves were infectious, the instuments played with percision, and the whole effect synonomous with the magic the albums title suggested. It calmed my friends instantly, and we went on to have one of those all night sessions listening to music, discussing dreams and beliefs that you only have with a select group of friends your whole life. I know I am being a little vague on the album dissection, but I think you may be understanding the impact this collection of songs had on us. We later all went to see the tour at the Pittsburgh Civic Arena (coincidentally, the first place this line up of Rush ever played) and were confirmed in our belief that these guys are akin to magicians. What an incredible tour!  My wife still wears the tour shirt to this day, lifts up the hat and drops it so the rabbit appears and says \\"Presto\\"!  Once a year, when the weather stars to get a refreshing chill in the air, I hop on my bike, get my old walkman and cassette copy of Presto and take ride.

B002ZTQVBQ|1.0|This is the first film in quite a few years that I have so thoroughly disliked.  Many admirers claim \\"it's hand-drawn, not the cold, heartless work of computers!\\" or \\"the symbolism is so important and you obviously don't get it,\\" or \\"Miyazaki's a master!\\" or \\"you need to attend to what's not being said as much as what IS being said.\\" I still say any film that has a father-figure dressed like a bad drag combo of Ann-Margaret and Cher, any film that has a mother ignore warnings and outrace a flood in her crappy car and then LEAVE her very young child alone (with a strange fish!) in said flood in order to check on a bunch of old folks who are in an institution miles away with other guardians, any film that allows 5-year-olds to determine their destinies in love, and any film that so clearly wimps out at its climax is hooey.  Enjoy the magic!  Revel in childhood innocence!  Accept the unacceptable!  Yep, heard and read it all before. Ponyo's annoying and endless repetition of \\"Sosuke\\" and \\"ham\\" is grating (not cute), and the ecological message is heavy-handed.  Miyazaki is more interested in emotions than conflict; yet, without conflict, emotional impact is lost.  Again, I'm supposed to believe that this boy and fish are drawn (pun intended) together? Are fated soul-mates? Kids, get back to me in 20 years and let's see how you're doing. Yes, I hear the collective intake of great indignation, but for me, this was an exercise in tedium and sappiness.
0131479415|4.0|After having read many books on agile software development, this is the book that finally made the entire system hang together for me. Cohn walks through all of the various aspects of agile planning, providing reasoning about why various approaches are taken as well as how to go about executing them. While the flow of the book can be a bit jarring at times, jumping from one topic to a seemingly unrelated one between chapters, I still came away from the book with a much better understanding of the end-to-end agile planning process.<br /><br />The book only briefly covers multi-team planning so further reading regarding this may be warranted if you have that need. There are also sections of the book that gloss over some rather large topics (Kano studies, as an example) but the light coverage and accompanied references can lead to jumping off points for those who want more information. A few sections do contain essentially throw-away recommendations (such as the section on task breakdown of stories) but such sections are often in areas that real-world teams will have experience anyhow so it wasn't a big detractor for me. Lastly, if you're looking for advice on running an agile process with a distributed (off-shore) team, this book doesn't touch on any of those challenges.<br /><br />As with most books on agile, this book carries on the tradition of focusing solely on the people processes without any recognition that certain *engineering* processes or practices (test-driven, continuous integration, etc) are necessary for long-term sustainability of an agile process. This is my number one complaint with all agile process books, and I've yet to find one that states, let alone defines, a certain level of software engineering organizational maturity is necessary before embarking on an agile process.<br /><br />Despite these few drawbacks, this book did succeed in finally making the entire agile planning process click for me personally. After reading several of Ken Schwaber's books on the same topic I understood agile in the abstract but this book really brought it all together into a cohesive, pragmatic approach for me.s books on the same topic I understood agile in the abstract but this book really brought it all together into a cohesive, pragmatic approach for me.

B00127RAJY|5.0|Like many others out there, I'd like to be in better shape. Office job sitting on my butt 9 hours a day. Gym memberships - been there, done that, spending a ton of money and never going. Thought I would try this DVD thinking I would be more likely to use it since I can work out in my basement and in less than half an hour!    First all, not all work out DVDs are for everyone. I am very uncoordinated and I am awful at anything dance-routine oriented. This is more like what you would get at a gym with a personal trainer - yet however is combined movement (upper body with lower body) and no equipment other than your own weight resistance and hand held weights. And you don't need to do weird toe tap dancing routines. So if you're like me and hate dance videos and want to get down to business in a no-nonsense way, this is for you.    I got my husband to try this with me - he thought it would be easy and wanted to do level 2 immediately. Nope. Level 1 kicked our butts the first night. It's so hard at first - but then your strength and stamina increase and before you know it, you are rocking level 1 and moving on. I recommend jumping up a level for a day (then moving back down) if you feel like you have mostly mastered a level but still have some problem areas - that way you can give yourself a more of a beating by going up. For example, I still have some issues with some of the cardio on level 2, but I will mix in level 3 to start getting ready for that one - alternating between all 3 basically. I just add more weight if the weight portion is too easy, etc. If you're not sweating, you should probably move up a level or add more weight.    I've been doing the DVD every other day - sometimes being bad and skipping a few days - or at times I will actually do it 3 days in a row. It's been about a month now and I while I haven't been eating better, I've noticed changes in my body. If I ate better, I'm sure I'd see even more changes.    The two girls in this DVD are great - Jillian and her friends are great workout buddies. The time flies by, you work hard, and you definitely do progress, which makes you want to do this more.     I'm looking forward to seeing my results in a few months.

B000RW3VD4|5.0|Wallstreet was made in 1987 by writer and director Oliver Stone and starring Michael Douglas, Charlie Sheen, Martin Sheen, Darryl Hannah, and John C. McGinley. A young stockbroker after months of persistence finally bags the big fish, Gordon Gekko, a man whose presence and lifestyle he idolizes. He shuns his blue collar background in pursuit of greed and impatiently engages in illegal insider trading.<br /><br />I first watched this movie after a book called \\"Now Showing\\" claimed it to be one of the best 25 movies....ever, I guess. I must say, all in all, it was a good movie. I actually really liked Charlie Sheen and Martin Sheen's work in it and I believed their relationship. The pull of an actual father and son relationship really added to the authenticity of the roles. I finally got to see Michael Douglas just the way I like him -- being a bad guy, someone getting the best of him, and not seducing women.<br /><br />Michael Douglas plays a big Wallstreet player who has money falling out of his eyeballs and is idolized by Charlie Sheen's Bud Fox. Fox is taught to bend and eventually break the rules to get ahead and get that cold hard cash. This movie is all about greed. Douglas' character likes to buy out the majority of shares in a company and then liquidate it getting away with a quick buck. When Douglas gets going into a lengthy monologue, he oozes confidence which is amazing considering the pressure he was under. Bud Fox grows a conscience when he sells out his father's company to this same fate and decides to fight against it ruining everything he's worked for. This was one of those roles that really made Charlie Sheen stand out and become a celebrity in his own right and brought the extra challenges of that responsibility with it. There is an appearance by Darryl Hannah as random home decorating girlfriend who is very comfortable in her way of living and leaves Fox the first time it gets tough. I thought it would be more dramatic and more of a point of her being in the movie, but there really isn't and it ended up being a waste of screen time and just one more thing for him to lose on his fall from grace. She is a symbol of the rewards that can be earned by a fast way of living stepping on others and her substance is very shallow. Again I really loved seeing someone get the best of Michael Douglas, even if they couldn't get away scot-free and had to face the music. Shows the value of time, hard work, and morals over getting rich quick with some family values thrown in too.<br /><br />Probably an undervalued asset to this film is one of my favorites, John C. McGinley whom you'll remember as one of the Bob's from Office Space and his role of Dr. Cox on Scrubs. Always there to heckle and mock his good friend and has some of the best one-liners in the movie. Actually three of the main five lines people quote from this movie can all be attributed to this character he developed.<br /><br />This is especially a great movie for men and/or people who love business and stocks. This is one of my husband's all-time favorites and many men can quote it readily.<br /><br />DVD Extras:<br /><br />The first part of this review I wrote three years ago, but now I've gotten my hands on the 20th anniversary edition with special features and I want to gush about those for you. First, there is a new commentary by director, Oliver Stone. He is a precise fellow! Stories are told of how filming is going on and he isn't even looking through the camera, he is following along word for word in the script to make sure his actors don't miss a moment of his dialogue. Before Michael Douglas, Stone considered Warren Beatty and Richard Gere for the role of Gordon Gekko which both declined when the script was in an earlier form. Apparently Gere still wonders where his career would have gone if he had gotten the script that Michael Douglas got to shoot. Douglas had a heck of a time with the lines. There was so much to his monologues and dialogue and much was shot in long takes. When he finally put in the time and memorized his part better, he was able to put in the performance that was needed. The commentary reveals more behind-the-scenes information as well as Stone's apparently neurotic tendencies. So many times after a line is said, he commented on how so-and-so of some magazine or whatever complained about THAT line but why he justified it being important to the script. If he really was that confident behind each one, he probably wouldn't need to expain, right?<br /><br />Also, there are two featurettes: \\"Greed is Good\\" and \\"Money Never Sleeps: The Making of Wallstreet\\". Greed is Good focuses on what this movie meant to that audience in 1987 and how real brokers took it to heart and how some began to idolize Gekko as well and even asked Charlie Sheen to open accounts for them so they'd be able to say they had an account with Bud Fox. It's pretty entertaining to see how this became a bit of a bible and how every single day, this movie is quoted on the floor of the stock market. It is also brought up how tempting it is to try and take shortcuts in the business and what their field of work really means to brokers and their families. The Making of Wallstreet is based more in the behind-the-scenes information again and what it did for the careers of individual actors and what they struggled with. Darryl Hannah had issues with the development of her character and didn't believe women could be like that but Stone assured her that there are gold-diggers like that out there.<br /><br />The deleted scenes are minimal and don't seem to add much to the movie. But I'd say the commentary and featurettes are great for fans of this movie. If you like this movie, you should also check out \\"Boiler Room\\". It has VERY similar themes, cutting corners, a father/son dynamic, and the actors even quote entire scenes from \\"Wallstreet.\\"<br /><br />With the sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps coming out on April 23rd this year, I'm very excited to see what has happened with Michael Douglas' Gordon Gekko and his new protege played by Shia LaBeouf. Also Casey Mulligan who starred in one of this year's Best Picture nominees \\"An Education\\" will be making an appearance so I am looking forward to that!s shot in long takes.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|Emma is my favorite novel by Jane Austen and having been used to the Gwyneth Paltrow/Jeremy Northam version of the book, I was hesitant to like this production. To my surprise, it is now my favorite. Garai is  a thoughtful and true version of Emma and Miller's Mr. Knightley is more refined and gentile as his character should be. If you like Paltrow's version (and I still do), give this one a chance. Each time I watch it, I enjoy it more. Thoroughly and thoughtfully done.
1584282584|5.0|I've read several books to educate myself, including many of Scott Kelby's books.  As good as the books were on discussing flash, none of them come close to this book.    The author did an excellent job showing several pictures to demonstrate the settings and how those settings affected the quality of the picture.  He discussed how flash gels still have relevancy despite what can be done post-processing.  He went into depth on the Nikon and Canon flash units, as well as the unique aspects of each.    While I read the book, several things \\"clicked\\" for me, techniques I'd not done quite right, pictures that did not come out quite how I wanted them to, etc.  He communicates his flash techniques quite clearly.    This is a Must Have for any high end amateur (like myself).

The science shows that the secret to high performance isn't our biological drive or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our third drive - our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilites, and to live a life of purpose.\\"<br /><br />Here is where DRIVE seems to slip into NEUTRAL. Particularly when trying to gain traction with minimal scientific contribution from the neurocognitive, neurobiological and the neuroscience of human relationships.

From the excessive OVERREACH of State, Local, and Federal Government with countless UNJUST and in most cases totally ABSURD rules, regulations, fees, taxes, frivolous lawsuits, unfundable mandates, political correctness run amuck, to the endless class envy/warfare that pervades certain political/media elites that are \\"self-evident\\".<br /><br />May I recommend some void fillin' options such as ...<br /><br />[[ASIN:1400083311 How Capitalism Saved America: The Untold History of Our Country, from the Pilgrims to the Present]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0465028020 The Happiness Hypothesis: Finding Modern Truth in Ancient Wisdom]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1596981180 The War On Success: How the Obama Agenda Is Shattering the American Dream]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0757307655 Evolve Your Brain: The Science of Changing Your Mind]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1564141934 For Entrepreneurs Only]]<br /><br />Most of what is presented in DRIVE is of a productive theme yet does seem to support an anecdotal approach of applying ourselves as \\"passive and fair\\" with our \\"nature\\".

B000GG4Y32|4.0|Reds is a quintessential epic, a big movie about big history. Warren Beatty plays Jack Reed, an intellectual revolutionary trying to get into the mix of the Russian Revolution. He meets Louise Bryant (played by Diane Keaton), an earnest writer of sorts who doesn't have a cause but who greatly desires change. They move to Greenwich Village and take up with other famous movers and shakers of that time, such as Eugene O'Neill and Emma Goldman. Events escalate overseas, Reed becomes enmeshed with the Communists, and Bryant tried to find herself through trying to find out what makes Reed tick.     That, of course, is the tip of the iceberg here. Westerners often look to Russian art and history to get a palatable panorama of human existence, and this film excels at dissecting that fascination. Beatty directs this film with great skill, making it a digestible history lesson wrapped in an absorbing love story. Parts of it are also a lot of fun- who wouldn't want to see Jack Nicholson's take on Eugene O'Neill? There is also a very subtle thread of humor throughout- Beatty knows how much info to give the audience at any given time before the story suffers. Also praiseworthy is the film's exquisite cinematography- this is a huge sweeping homage to the great epics of the 40's and 50's. It is a rather large commitment for any passive fan, but I would highly recommend it to anyone with any interest in the Revolution or Communism in Europe.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|I started watching this series in the middle of the 4th season.  I liked it from the get go, but had a lot of questions.  That's when I found seasons 1, 2, and 3.  They have answered all my questions, and now my husband is addicted to them too.  I love the relationship between Sam and Dean.
B002ZTIIXK|3.0|From a purely musical standpoint, this is a superb collection. My problem -- and it's a BIG one -- is that each CD is only about 50 minutes in length. That leaves about 40 minutes of empty space on this 2-CD collection. k.d. has been making records for 25 years, and I've been a fan almost that whole time. I can't believe the record company was so stingy with its music. There's no excuse in this day and age to release such as skimpy anthology. Sorry, k.d. Love you, but not your record company's treatment of your fans.

B000EZ7ZZE|5.0|As an avid Resident Evil (video games) and Milla Jovovich fan, my 5 stars could certainly be a biased opinion. I enjoyed seeing more of the story, surrounding the games and I really enjoyed the acting on everyone's parts and I enjoyed the action scenes.  This movie is far superior to the next movie in the line \\"Resident Evil: Extinction\\". That was in one word: Awful. Zombies don't wear jumpsuits! Why are they in jumpsuits!?
0785134352|5.0|Well written, brisk pacing, fantastic art, fun twists, and great characters all combine to make this one of the best reads out there right now.    Is it shocking?  Sure, but that's part of the fun of it!  However, the \\"shock factor\\" is only one small part of what makes this book feel so fresh.    For me, Millar and JRJR kncoked this book out of the park.  You can tell how much fun they're having telling their story, and I love being along for the ride.    If you're sensitive to violence or to underage kids using guns, swords, and adult language, this book may not be for you; but if you can appreciate it for what it is, you won't be disappointed.  Don't worry -- it's nowhere near as \\"shocking\\" as many other comics out there such as Preacher or The Boys (or pretty much anything else Garth Ennis writes), but it certainly is edgy.    Overall, it's a surprisingly fresh and unique take on superheroes, geek culture, and adolescence, masterfully illustrated and perfectly paced.      I love it!
044661758X|5.0|If you've never read a book from the Harry Bosch series - do so in order, starting with The Black Echo and then the Black Ice. Connelly's development of story lines and characters builds with each book. The Concrete Blonde is the third in the series and, so far, the best of the bunch - but for its full impact, read the other two first. You will be very happy you dove into the Bosch series. This is great crime and detective writing and story telling. Bosch is quite the complex individual, but others around him are also built by Connelly with depth. As for the stories - as you would want, they are filled with twists and turns all the way to the very end.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|This movie shows the true genius of Michael Jackson.  He was a very humble and sweet man.  He still sounded and moved brilliantly!
1416594787|5.0|I am exactly the kind of person for whom this book was written.  I am an agnostic who believes that life on earth arrived in the many configurations we see today through evolutionary processes, but I had only a smattering of knowledge about the evidence.    The Greatest Show on Earth did a wonderful job of filling in the many blanks in my knowledge and giving me an excellent lay-person's foundational knowledge of the unarguable proof of evolution.  I know I am not an expert, having never studied biology, but I now feel like my belief in evolution is very well justified by the available evidence, and if I am ever in conversation with somebody who doubts the reality of evolution, or who denies the accuracy of carbon dating or geological dating I think I will be reasonably equipped to debate with them.    This is really why I wanted to read this book in the first place.  Once or twice, I have found myself trying to defend my beliefs, and I got fed up with having to fall back on saying, \\"I don't know - I haven't studied it in any depth.\\"  Now I have the vital bullet points in my head, and I understand why, intuitively, it always made sense to me.    Dawkins's writing style is fantastic.  He writes in a smooth, warm, conversational style that is a pleasure to read.  The whole book has the feel of a nice chat by an open fire in a comfortable study, sipping warm brandy while discussing science and nature.  The science is very accessible and written in easy-to-understand language.  The only part that gave me any trouble was Dawkins's discussion of embryonic development.  It was a difficult section to struggle through, but my perseverance was well rewarded when this basic knowledge was shown to be vital to understand the chapters that followed.    Amusingly, I found this book so engrossing that I was reading it as I would a detective thriller; I was racing to the end of the page so I got flip over and keep reading, and I was always vaguely resentful when my train reached itsstation and I had to stop reading and go to work.    If you are well-versed in biology and already have extensive knowledge of evolutionary theory, you may find this book a little too basic, so I would not necessarily recommend it for you.  Then again, it's so nicely written you might find it to be a nice summary and brush-up.    As for the fundamentalists who are posting hostile reviews here, please do one thing: borrow the book from a library, for free, and read it.  Don't spend a single cent buying it, just borrow it.  Read every page, try to keep an open mind, and don't stop reading just because it makes you uncomfortable.  Maybe it won't change your mind, but at least you will understand what your opposition genuinely believes, instead of listening to propaganda from people like Ray Comfort.  If you're going to disagree, at least take the time to understand what you're disagreeing with.    Posting a one-star review in which you bluntly state that you haven't read the book just makes you look fanatical and ignorant.    For everyone with an open mind, though, read this book.  It's great!
B002L6I9Z4|2.0|My son received this camera for his birthday and is thrilled with it, however, it would seem that Lego have skimped out on the camera's quality with sub-par lensing, and digital resolution, 3MP? my cell phone takes better images.  Also, the flash is possibly visible from space.  A sturdy product but expect your hard drive to fill up fast of overexposed and washed out color photos.  A rip at half the price.
B002FOQXZK|5.0|The fact that this dude speaks what he feels, against beats that arent mainstream, speaks volumes. I like Biggie, 2Pac, Face, and early Jay-Z as well, but that's where it ends. There is no more Biggie and Pac, a new Face album is rare nowadays, and Jigga is on his way out the door. NOT TO MENTION the fact the alot of rappers who try to emulate these cats wind up one hit wonders, or even worse, they go commercial and perpetually release weak albums. I am a fan of 'real' hip-hop, and what I mean by that, to clear up the confusion, is when someone speaks about their own experiences. If you never sold dope, then don't rap about it, etc. Few successful hip-hop aritists can follow this motto, probably out of fear or whatever but it doesn't get followed by the vast majority IMHO.    I don't know if you heard A kid name Cudi, [[ASIN:B002GCJTIO Kid Named Cudi]], but that to me was tight too. Maybe being from the MidWest (DETROIT) I can relate more, but I definitely felt that one too, especially 'Cleveland Is The Reason'. I front to back both these albums faithfully.    Personally, HIP-HOP NEEDS A DRASTIC CHANGE. Period. It was stated in another review [...], Hip-Hop has always done 3 things, and the 1st point was that it painted a picture of urban/street youth. That's true, but I have a question for you, at what point did urban/street youth start riding Bentley's and wearing 20 carat's of jewlery and a new pair of shoes everyday? Exactly, maybe 1% of them, yo D-boys and kids D-men, but that's it. So, why is all the HIP-HOP you hear nowadays about that? The majority of the hood can't afford that crap, and the music isn't uplifting them, it makes them feel insecure b/c they don't have this stuff, and makes them wanna rob and steal to get it. My moral compass tells me that's not right, and to be honest I get sick of listening to most of it. If they were really servicing the urban/street youth, instead of servicing their wallets, they would talk about their weaknesses, the struggles they overcame, and not about their wealth and fame. This IS something that Big and Pac did, and Face does, and something Jigga used to do, but even for him it's rare nowadays('You want my old stuff, buy my old album.' ?!?! Can you say crossed-over?)    Don't get me wrong, I listen to Jeezy and some other gangsta rap, and am a fan of Jigga still, and like it, but at a point the music becomes counterproductive to what hip-hop was supposed to be.     To sum it up, I give this album 5 stars and encourage him, Lupe, and any up-and-coming artists to make music about what they feel and what happened in their life, not about what's 'the norm', cuz we all know there is no such thing as the norm.
0785126708|4.0|World War Hulk is a good series which sees the Hulk returning to Earth for retribution on those that in his mind betrayed him and their freindship for the good of humanity.  What makes this comic really good is that the Hulk is going after some of the \\"superheroes\\" that I have always wanted to see get killed/crap beaten out of them, notably Iron Man and Mr. Fantastic.  Unfortunately, as is commonplace with Marvel, the series falls apart with a typical Marvel ending.  I won't spoil anything but if you have read any Marvel series you already know how they conclude things and how ultimately the story has no impact on the Marvel universe expect to set up another 2-3 series (an example but not related is the killing of Captain America only to say he wasn't killed but transported to an alternate dimension).     Good  - Story (9/10): Strong up until the end.  Finally a story that lives up to the Hulk's brutal nature.  - Graphics/Drawings (7-8/10):  Most of the comic looks good (but not awesome) but has small areas here and there that look amateur.    Bad  - The ending.  - Nothing major happens.

B0018QCXGY|5.0|All the secrecy that went into the filmmaking of Cloverfield really paid off.  I went into the show with no knowledge of the plot, thanks to the eerie trailer, and wound up actually being excited during the viewing.  With all the spoilers in your face everywhere on the internet, it's hard to really be suprised anymore.  What movies like Cloverfield and The Dark Knight did, is they committed much of their time to protecting the material from being exposed.  When movies like X-men Origins: Wolverine are leaked, they lose their theater appreciation before they are released.  Cloverfield had to be one of the best big monster movies next to Peter Jackson's King Kong.  Its incredibly real and involving.  Those who are sensitive to shaky camera motions, may not appreciate it as much, but know that it is all for a sense of reality.  I couldn't bear to watch the Bourne movies because they were filmed poorly, but Cloverfield does \\"shaky-cam\\" right and respects the limits of my equilibrium and stomach.<br /><br />So after Cloverfield comes to Blu-ray, is it the same experience? No, but I still enjoy it and I see something new in it every time I view it.  It becomes on of those movies that you have to show people unaware of it.  The special features are ok.  I wanted the trailer on the disc as well as some more polished behind-the-scenes.  Star Trek had a much better disc delivery from J.J. Abrahms.  I'm upset to see the 3 star average review due to the pickiness of the cinematography.  I understand where you're coming from as long as you respect why it was made this particular way.  They didn't film it on a handycam to make it look cool.  They filmed it that way to make you feel a part of the show, and to make a monster movie as realistic as possible.  All the bumblings and jump cuts, just bring reality to the man behind the camera.  I think the shakiness only works in a film like this, where the one filming is a part of the cast.  What sense does it make to shake around the camera filming the Bourne Supremacy, when the view is the eye of God.  The one filming in those unnecessarily shaky movies is not a part of the cast.<br /><br />But anyway, I accept the mixed feelings people have for this movie.  I am one of the people who enjoyed it thoroughly in theaters and at home.  I am pushing a movement for directors and screenwriters to keep the entire production a secret while filming.  All these online set visits are going to destroy peoples experiences when the movie is released.

0375842209|5.0|this was an absolutely exquisite read.  there are not enough adjectives to describe how wonderful the book was, for the amazingly tangible characters and storyline, and especially for the language and imagery.  for reasons unknown to me, this book is listed as young adult fiction (maybe because the main character is young herself??), which is not my usual genre of choice.  it is also yet another holocaust book, but i can confidently say that none of that mattered in the least.  there are rare jewels that can be found, the kind of books that show a reader, on occasion, the power of words and what is possible within the confines of two covers and a few hundred pages.  this was one of those rare moments - stunning, powerful and hauntingly beautiful.  i really can't rave enough, so i'll just stop and get on with the review.<br /><br />The Book Thief is, at the surface, about liesel, a young girl in nazi germany, who has just witnessed her brothers' death and her mothers' abandonment.  rosa and hans hubermann, her new foster parents, are two highly contradictory beings.  rosa is foul-mouthed and demanding (she loves to call liesel saumensch, german for swine); hans is gentle and has the uncanny ability to always says the right thing.  both are infinitely compassionate in their own way and you can't help but come to love them both.  as the story goes, liesel steals her first book at her brothers funeral and spirals into a life that builds meaning around words.  from the beginning, when hans teaches her to read and write with paint on the walls of the basement, liesel begins to write (and paint) her own story. in the beginning, middle and end - everything in her life comes back to the words.<br /><br />  \\"She was the book thief without the words. Trust me, though, the words were on their way, and when they arrived, Liesel would hold them in her hands like the clouds, and she would wring them out like rain.\\"<br /><br />the other characters are equally remarkable. rudy, \\"the boy with the lemon colored hair\\", is liesel's best friend and partner in crime, their love for each other cemented in the books that he helps her steal, and of course, the amper river.  max, the jew that the hubermann's hide in their basement, brings the pieces of the story that will pull at your heart strings. and, he also brings some of the most wonderfully profound moments.  after over a year without seeing the outside world, this fragment of his soul is written - \\"from a himmel street window, he wrote, the stars set fire to my eyes\\".  i mean, how can you not fall in love with a character like that, who writes books for liesel, since he has nothing else to offer?  honestly though, even the characters that only make random cameo appearances, like tommy and the mayors wife are substantial enough that they could have their own books written about them.  everyone and everything is so vivid, so utterly believable in a way that is rarely seen.  and ultimately, each of them helps to define liesel and her love of words.<br /><br />oh yeah, and i can't forget to mention the narrator.  DEATH himself, although he claims he doesn't carry a scythe or wear a cloaked hood (unless its cold), brings us the story, and thankfully he has some sense of humor and compassion.  the narration is unusual and may take some readers into a place of discomfort, but i thought it worked brilliantly.  expect a lot of foreshadowing, a lot of unexpected tangents that will eventually become very important, and most importantly, expect a lot of dying (but also a lot of glorious living).<br /><br />the language (my favorite part of the book, for sure) is musical, poetic. the music, notably the accordian playing of hans hubermann, is imperfectly perfect.  and the colors of the landscape are bright and dark in ways that make them impossible not to notice.  altogether, The Book Thief is a rare work of art.<br /><br />i will be recommending this book to anyone who will give it a chance.  it was worthy enough to be etched a permanent home on my bookshelf. and with that, i'll leave you with a quote from the book itself.<br /><br />  \\"Sometimes you read a book so special that you want to carry it around with you for months after you've finished just to stay near it.\\"<br /><br />this was surely one of those books.shelf. and with that, i'll leave you with a quote from the book itself.        \\"Sometimes you read a book so special that you want to carry it around with you for months after you've finished just to stay near it.\\"    this was surely one of those books.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|This version of the Zauberflöte es, by far, one of the best. It's hard to find a producition, of any opera, with such outstanding elements.   First, what has me more excited is that here we have a version of the Magic Flute that goes beyond the naive story for children, although there's plenty of room for that kind of fantasy. You can actually feel and taste the deepness of Mozart's music through the opera (deepness which also requires innocence, humbleness and humanity, all present here) and not just find yourself inside a magical soft storyline. So, you get both, the beauty and brightness of a so-called pretty opera, and the depth of a master's work, the exact mix that Mozart's all about.  Second, amazing singers. A soft and warm Tamino, with precise high notes (not too closed and no too open), you'll almost never get the sensation that he's aching, so recurrent in Mozart's tenors.   Dorothea Röschmann is the most amazing Pamina I've seen, with a colourful voice, intelligent inflections and great acting, making his character a whole and not just a pinky soprano doing Pamina.   What can be said about Diana Damrau as the Queen?: she just rocks. She is all about the passion, great great vocal qualities, her high notes are never flat, she is light in her coloraturas but always deep in tone, and about the acting, she is as evil as it gets.  Sarastro has warm and tender low notes and a great stage presence. May be his voice could be less spread and more directed, but you won't feel he is wrong in the character, at all.   Monostatos is very very funny, with a nice vocal rendition.  Papageno is just great.  I have to say I'm specially charmed about the Queen's three ladies, they sing it precise, sharp and evil, but always beautiful.     Above all, you have a so well thought scenario here. Every momento of this production is like a picture of the most elegant barroque light and shade. Truly memorable.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Whatever your criticism of personal life or proclivities, this man is amazing at 50.  OK, he doesn't do the leg kicks like he used to or go up on his toes anymore, but there's no auto-tune in this entire video and his moves are still spot on after a 10 year hiatus.    This video is the concert without the costumes, but all of the performances are there and the special effects and introductions to the pieces are also included.  MJ is in almost every scene and you also get to see his interaction with the musicians, dancers and singers (i.e. his instructions to them, his feedback to them, his encouragement).  You also get to see some of his personality without too much burnishing.    Highly recommended.

Even some films of his not accorded much praise(such as \\"King of Comedy\\" and \\"After Hours\\") are terrific. \\"Age of Innocence\\" is, for my money, his best film, with \\"Raging Bull\\" a close second.  When he is great, he is untouchable.  When he is middling, he sinks.  \\"Cape Fear\\" had nothing over the original - and ended with the most absurd river-ride of attempted terror ever put on film.  \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" makes Mel Gibson's \\"Passion\\" look like \\"Citizen Kane.\\"<br /><br />Anyway..now we have \\"Shutter Island.\\"  Lots of people loved it, lots hated it.  Same with the critics.  It is that sort of flick. To me, it has to be one of the most lugubrious, leaden, sleep-inducing, yawn-energizing movies I've seen in some time.  It is shot with a muddy, murky, somewhat Hammer-horror look to it. That's fine and dandy, but the story drags on and on and on with a plot that would be almost impossible to follow if one didn't surmise the ending about midpoint in the film.  Blame the story then, and not the great Mr. S.  If you took the backbone of \\"The Wicker Man\\" (the original), big chunks from \\"A Beautiful Mind\\", the noir and period ambiance and jaw-drop ending from the old Mickey Rourke film \\"Angel Heart\\" and mixed in some jiggers and teaspoonfuls of certain Twilight Zone episodes and lots and lots of bits and pieces from the original television series \\"The Prisoner\\" (even parts of the just-made remake)....well, if you took all of those sources and put 'em in a blender out would come \\"Shutter Island.\\"<br /><br />There are alot of other movies very similar to this one, thematically, but I can't remember all of their titles.  One starred Jeffrey Hunter in the early sixties, another had Warren Beatty roaming around an institution with a twist ending.  Anyway....once upon a time Martin Scorsese had the ambition to film a biopic on the life of George Gershwin.  That would have been one hell of a movie!  Scorsese already had practice on musicals with \\"New York, New York\\" (another maligned film that I thought was very good.)  Too bad he never filmed the life story of one of America's greatest song-writers who died so tragically at age 39. The young DeNiro would have been perfect in the part. Just like there was alot of talk about a filmed biopic due out in 2009 on the life of Poe to commemorate his 200th birthday - and Robert Downey Jr. was touted as a possible Poe.  He would have been perfect in every conceivable way!  But the Gershwin pic falls through the cracks and a terrific part for Downey ends up nowhere...and instead of what could have been another \\"Chaplin\\" for Downey  we get his talents wasted in \\"Iron Man II.\\"  Sometimes, the best laid plans are, indeed, of mice and men...<br /><br />I digress...but only because I was very disappointed in the Maestro's latest offering.  But God bless him for all he has given us.sese already had practice on musicals with \\"New York, New York\\" (another maligned film that I thought was very good.)

B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie and it was \\"wonderful\\" to see it in color and B&W.  Great value for the quality of the DVD's.  I am glad I purchased 2 and gave one away as a gift.

B0011MPZM4|1.0|This book is about a psychopath Mom who stalks her son.  It's beyond creepy. Any real mother who acted like this would be locked away in an insane asylum, or prison.  And I AM a mother with 4 adorable children. Two are sons, my youngest is my baby-boy.  But I still think this book is disturbing in what it promotes.  It is not healthy for anyone to think this behavior is okay.    I didn't buy the book, it was given to us in a bag-o-books. I can see why someone wanted to get rid of it....CREEEEPY sums it up
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I love this score better than the movie!  I can listen to it again and again -- it is very relaxing, yet nuanced, with many layers of complexity.  Every time I hear it, I want to watch the movie again, then I remember the movie was not as good as the Colin Firth version..
B001992NUQ|5.0|If you have any doubts about whether you should see this film, put them aside, buy it, and watch it. Then come back and read the reviews.<br /><br />I first saw \\"Fight Club\\" on DVD about eight years ago. It made perfect sense. I immediately \\"got\\" what it was about, unlike some reviewers I have great respect for (Ebert, Turan). Then came The Great Reveal at one hour and fifty-three minutes. I sat there blindsided, my jaw open, wondering \\"What the hell is going on here? What is the point of this, as the story has already made its point?\\".<br /><br />One might still raise that obejction, but a second viewing (on Blu-ray) reveals that Fincher drops subtle hints as to what is really going on. Further, what is hidden up to that point is thematically and psychologically consistent with the rest of the story.<br /><br />This is a film you have to experience and absorb on your own. But... it is absolutely /not/ about the (presumed) pleasure men take in beating up each other (though the title unfortunately suggests that). If you don't understand /why/ they fight, then you've missed one of the story's basic points. (Hint: It's not to affirm their masculinity in a feminized world.) This is not a story about sado-masochism or fascism. It is, as most great American films, an attack on American society and values.<br /><br />\\"Fight Club\\" will someday be recognized as one of /the/ great American films. Why it's taking so long, I don't know.<br /><br />PS: Blu-ray navigation is occasionally confusing, but \\"Fight Club\\" is the hardest-to-navigate BD I've yet viewed. It's difficult to make exactly the selections you want among the options. And there are points in the selection process where everything seems to have locked up, and you have to press Play to get it to continue. The film itself plays flawlessly.
B000007T2Z|4.0|While having a seriously ridiculous cold and having injested far too much caugh syrup I decided to listen to this album after months of loving it but never giving it my full attention as doing that is a feet in itself. But upon this listen it was that I finally gave it my ultimate un-divided attention, and Im thankful I did. I have never been able to listen to nor look at this the same way again.<br /><br />It's a flawless piece of musical work and one that should and must be listened to, to fully appreciate. The vast epicness of the album is something that I can't even begin to think about describing. The album once divided is weak but added together as a whole is one of the most cohesive pieces of work I have ever heard musically.<br /><br />After reading a ton of reviews about ho awfully dreadful and boring this album can be all I can suggest is injest some caugh syrup.
B00280LYIC|4.0|This book was one of those books where you can predict the ending, but occasional surprises pop in. However, don't get your hopes up that the movie is a mirror of the book; the movie leaves out many things, twists scenes around, and picks the wrong actors for the age of the real characters. So, I suggest reading this before watching the movie.
0786715103|5.0|in the world, if you ask me.    As an academic with a focus on African history, this was one of the most important books in achieving an understanding about what, on the UN/Western side of things, went wrong in Rwanda leading up to 1994.  Highly reccomended.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|....a good movie for once! After renting and watching this movie Saturday night.....not 1 hour later , I bought it!<br /><br /> This is one of my favorite movies now. The acting is amazing, the story is amazing, and I can't stop thinking about it or stop telling people about it. Come Monday morning, I had 5 people I told , watch this movie by Sunday night.<br /><br />Everyone of them agreed that this movie kicks @$$!!!<br /><br />I agree with some of the reviewers that the ending could of been better but it had to come to an end. An ending with him walking out into public (like Hannibal Lecter) would of been a great ending..........but........that always screams sequel. Sequels aren't always a bad thing but there are wayyyy too many nowadays.<br /><br />This is a must OWN movie for movie fanatics like me. It's a mix of Seven and maybe Death Sentence with a little Silence of The Lambs maybe???<br /><br />Amazing 5* movie if not 10 stars.<br /><br />*****unrated edition only available on Blu-Ray?***** F U ! Trying to force blu ray discs on us for extra stuff is criminal. Screw bluray
B002IR3PQ4|5.0|For any first timer's on Queen music this is a great buy, those of us which have bought countless versions of this tracklisting, we are drawn in by the little extra's Brian May and Roger Taylor wish to market to us.

Go on then, and give them some of your cash, it's money well spent.

0307460444|4.0|I tried making the Chocolate Salted-Caramel mini cupcakes (in standard size), and everything went perfectly. Until it can time to taste them. The batter was simple and came out great, the caramel came together easily (who knew I could make caramel), they all tasted great...seperately. The problem came when the caramel cooled to room temp, as would be the case if you were bringing them somewhere. Instead of having a nice soft, flowy caramel (like I was expecting) it was a lump. Not real hard like the wrapped candies, but it was just too, too much. Maybe it is my fault and it works way better in mini form. I would definitely try it again that way. The caramel was really good, even nice for maybe making candies for something else. I ended up using the batter to make the cupcakes, and using the caramel to drizzle on the top. Turned out much better.   I like that there are quite a few recipes that call for ingredients anyone would have on hand, like regular flour as opposed to self-rising or cake flour.(Although there are a few of them too.)  There are great tips, suggestions and ideas. There are a ton of pictures. I was intimidated by the whole \\"It's a Martha Stewart book\\", and thought I would never be able to pull it off, but many of the recipes seem pretty straightfoward and simple. My only other criticism is that there is not a simple vanilla cupcake recipe (maybe in the next one?), but that is my own peeve. There are enough ideas in here to try for anyone's tastes.
B000000OF6|5.0|This is a great collection of some of the best Queen songs ever.  I purchased this for a 13-year-old who is newly becoming acquainted with Queen, and now it's all she listens to.

B001V7UXG2|5.0|This series is worth pure gold galore. It is British and that means the actors are absolutely excellent, the settings and the production are extremely fine and rich. The details are not neglected and that is a real pleasure. The best part is of course the work on the language, the speech patterns, and you can imagine the pleasure they take when the two characters move to New York. The contrast between the extreme aristocratic tone and intonation, the fascinating politeness of Jeeves, the Valet, and the American secular and even gross way of speaking with no affectation is a bag of diamonds on the screen. The action takes place in the 20s or 30s with some kind of fuzziness as for the time period. We seem to still be in the prohibition era, and at the same time not to be in the post 1929 depression. So we could be in the 1920s. That corresponds to the period Francis Scott Fitzgerald preferred for his rich idle young American men and women coming to Europe to enjoy their idleness in pure carelessness. But here these young aristocrats are constantly taken up in innumerable intrigues that have to do with their century old rivalries and jealousies, or their innumerable love affairs and hormonal capers. The main character is not so much Wooster, the aristocrat, but Jeeves, his valet, because he is the one who constantly builds the intrigues, thickens and even sickens the plots, in many ways manipulates his \\"master\\" into doing things he would like to do but can't do because he is a valet, a servant, and that would be too risky for him. He is also some kind of guardian angel for his \\"master\\" saving him quite often from total perdition at the very last minute. He is the champion of all escape makers and escape planners. But this series goes a lot further than that. We cannot say that the social content is that rich and that we could speak of social criticism. It is a comedy and does not intend to become a social drama or a social epic. That humor is English and only the British can produce it. It is both so elaborate and so extreme that it is hilarious from beginning to end. You thus have all the themes you need to really be humorous from a pure English point of view. You have them all, and even more. Old spinsters, old bachelors, plumbers, bobbies, Anglican priests, twins, old aunts and old uncles being fooled by young nieces and nephews, all kinds of grotesque characters, the fools and the crazies of this world, even some good Africans and judges. You cannot miss the all man's club and the impersonation of so many characters that we just wonder at times if we are not back in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Disguises, transvestites, foolish capers, you name it you have it. The rhythm of these parades is so diabolical that you can hardly follow them, even if they are predictable at times to the very second. But they are too funny for you not to play the game. The only missing character is the desert island and the marooned person there under his coconut tree eating ladyfingers. That is a must for those who like British humor, slightly black, definitely grinding to a crazy downfall, certainly not to a halt. I just wonder if we could not say it is a classic.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGIDsh can produce it.

1595141715|5.0|Kennedy  HLW-3  2-18-10  Book Review          In Thirteen Reasons Why, Jay Asher captivates the roller coaster of life, where it does not always end well.  He illustrates that no matter how we interact with other people, regardless of how insignificant it may appear to be, it can have an everlasting impact on their lives.          For his first novel, Jay Asher did a splendid job.  He was initially inspired to write this novel when attending an audio tour of a museum.  Asher writes from the perspective of the main character, Clay Jenson, as he listens to Hannah Baker's suicide tapes, which she addresses to thirteen various individuals, including Clay.  The thirteen individuals were all students who attended her school and touched her life in small and big ways.        This way of writing is unique to other teen novels.  He includes Hannah's tapes, the main part of the book, but he also remembers to include Clay's thoughts and what is going on around him.  He is sent on a journey with a map that Hannah gave all thirteen people, and the reader is able to experience the journey with Clay.  The book stays on its main focal point without drifting off too far from the conflict of Hannah's life.         This book is so well written, it is difficult to put it down.  It was unpredictable, unlike most teen novels, which made it even more interesting.  It leaves the reader with the desire to extend kindness more freely or to connect more honestly to people you come into contact with every day, or to just even be a little bit nicer to the stranger next to you.
0307269981|4.0|\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is a must-read. It is the second installment in the \\"Millennium\\" trilogy by late Swedish publicist and novelist Stieg Larsson. Reportedly, Larsson meant to write as many as ten books in the series, but only managed to complete the first three. He died of AMI at the age of 50.<br />Millennium is a lot about raising social awareness of problems plaguing the modern Swedish society (and yours, too). Larsson focuses on chronic abuse of women, endemic white-collar crime, and repeat violations of the constitution by corrupt agents of government.<br />The first Millennium book, originally titled \\"Men Who Hate Women\\" and published in English as \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\", was a spellbinding mystery novel. After reading it, many women might think twice about ever going to Sweden. Book #2, \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" evolves the plot into a suspense flick. And the final installment, \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest\\", morphs into a plain conspiracy thriller that reaches all the way to the top of Sweden's political power structure.<br />Millennium is a small magazine with a reputation for exposing the corrupt dealings of Sweden's financial, industrial and political elite. One of the two main protagonists in Larsson's trilogy is Mikael Blomkvist - the star journalist of the magazine. Apparently an author surrogate, Blomkvist is a socially conscious alpha-male. A somewhat promiscuous character, who gets sexually involved with virtually each major female character throughout the trilogy, Blomkvist embodies the model of the post-modern man with liberal views of the world - political and otherwise.<br />Lisbeth Salander - \\"The Girl\\" in question - is the second main character of Millennium. She is a troubled sociopath deemed incapable of looking after herself and placed under the oversight of a social guardian. She comes from a broken family and is the victim of repeat institutionalized abuse. In the first installment of the trilogy, she becomes the unlikely ally of Blomkvist. She helps him to both solve a decade-old family clan mystery and scrape his ruined professional reputation. The odd couple triumphs against a money-laundering crook and an unknown villain whom we shall not name.<br />In \\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" the focus shifts from Blomkvist to Salander. She is suspected of the double-murder of one of Blomkvist's colleagues and his young spouse. The two are shot dead in their apartment, just as they are about to make public their research on a major sex trafficking ring in Sweden. Salander is also accused of for the murder of her appointed guardian - a corrupt and sadistic sexual pervert whom we first encounter in book one. Blomkvist is convinced that Salander was not involved in the murders and sets out to prove her innocence. Meanwhile, Salander - ever incapable of trusting anyone but herself - goes into hiding as she tries to exert her own vengeance on the criminal ring that tried to destroy her. A few unexpected turns await the reader in the twisting plot of this captivating piece of page-turning suspense. Who will get burned in the end? Enjoy reading this masterpiece as you find out.<br />P.S. Movies have been created based on all three books in the Millennium trilogy. If you are thinking of watching them first in order to get a feel of the books - DON'T. These movies definitely do not match the heights of Larsson's writing!nlikely ally of Blomkvist.

B001993Y2C|5.0|The Blu-ray version of Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series is simply excellent.  It contains all of the aired shows, the mini-series, and the additional \\"Razor\\" series that came between the 3rd and 4th season.  It does not, however, contain \\"The Plan.\\"  The packaging, while it seems pretty neat on the outside, is pretty cheap.  All four seasons are packaged separately in their own cardboard containers, however, the interior of the package has each Blu-Ray in a little pocket that is very flimsy, and allows the discs to slide around inside.  I would prefer to have traditional cases that fold out and have the plastic piece that holds the disc stationary.  This should not be a reason against purchasing the package, though.  Since Blu-Rays have a scratch resistant coating, this type of packaging should be fine for storing them.  One could always purchase separate cases for all of the discs if s/he is concerned about the packaging.  Coming from someone who did not see the series on television prior to ordering this series, it is clear to me that this is the best way to view the series.  Each episode is a cliffhanger, so you will really have a hard time not watching \\"just one more episode.\\"  Also, since there are no commercials, you do not have to wait to find out what's going to happen next.  I highly recommend this series, it is some of the best Sci-fi I have seen in a long time.  I'm sad to almost be finished watching the whole series.

B002U6CJCO|4.0|Dang, it's tough to write this review right. How can I accurately express that after eighteen years of struggling through unworthy sequels, one of the coolest action premises of the early-90s is back on track? Well, for now, take my word on it: \\"Universal Soldier: Regeneration\\" is good. Damn good, even, considering the apprehension I endured while the film was being made, knowing that it was shot in Bulgaria (favored locale of all cheap direct-to-video fare) by a director with limited accolades to his name (John Hyams, [[ASIN:B0000C52JT The Smashing Machine - The Life and Times of Extreme Fighter Mark Kerr]]) and wouldn't see a theatrical release in the western world. Well, none of that's changed, but guess what? - sequel number four is officially on top of the heap, from its solid dramatic performances to its no-nonsense action content, therein giving the series a complete, welcome genetic makeover.<br /><br />The story: when a Russian terrorist faction led by a vengeful commander (Zahary Baharov, [[ASIN:B002IRYYPU Command Performance]]) take the prime minister's children hostage in a crippled Chernobyl nuclear reactor fortified by the next model of deadly UniSol (UFC star Andrei Arlovski), the only force capable of breaking through their defenses when all else have failed is the recommissioned, reprogrammed Luc Devereaux (Van Damme)...but unbeknownst to him, he'll be meeting more than one killing machine, for his old enemy Andrew Scott (Lundgren) has been genetically recreated and is as unstable and hell-bent on destruction as he ever was.<br /><br />Right from the start, it's clear that this isn't your regular, overblown DTV movie: the film starts silently with minimalistic titles that take up no extra amount of time or space, but within the few minutes that follow, the new UniSol has established himself by kidnapping the children and plowing through waves of police defense with an armored truck and a powerful machinegun. By now, you're only five minutes into the movie, you haven't heard a beat of music and you don't even know who the inhuman kidnapper is yet, but already you've witnessed an action scene more intense than most else on the DTV market. The remaining action content is sparser than anything I'm used to, but is so very good, timed so intricately, and so handily placed that it's hard to complain. In all, there are about five hand-to-hand fights, a couple shootouts, and a combination of both featuring Van Damme blasting through enemy lines before taking on a houseful of terrorists by knife. The hand-to-hand fights in particular are extremely satisfying:  featuring UFC alumnus Mike Pyle and stuntman Dian Hristov (primary double for Dolph Lundgren and Steven Seagal) and choreographed as a blend of mixed martial arts, karate, and pro wrestling moves, they are extremely well-shot, of a good lengths, and remain exciting despite their insistence on relative realism.<br /><br />\\"Regeneration\\" makes no pretense about being a DTV feature: the film quality doesn't feel mainstream at all and there are a couple storyline twists that would have never been cleared in a Hollywood production (for good reason), but nevertheless, the movie mounts critics and beats them about the head with how competent it is despite its flaws and limitations. Take the shooting location, for example: in any other film, the bleakness of the abandoned industrial complex would've looked boring as hell, but through the masterful cinematography of Peter Hyams, the reactor building becomes a myriad of imposing, colossal architectures like something out of [[ASIN:B000G6BM00 Aliens]]. With the occasional exception (e.g. Kerry Shale as the scheming UniSol engineer), acting performances are strong among the supporting cast. Authentic Russian is spoken throughout the film, which is always nice. Van Damme channels some of the dark energy he expressed in [[ASIN:B001PWY4NG JCVD]] to show a new, broken side of Luc, and Dolph deserves definite credit for his own \\"JCVD\\"-esque existentialist monologue.<br /><br />The DVD cover bills Andrei Arlovski over both Lundgren and Van Damme, and while this is an accurate accreditation in terms of screentime, it does not diminish the importance of the other two stars. On the other end of the spectrum, Lundgren is seen the least of the three and plays more of a supporting role, but his presence is acknowledged throughout the movie without feeling insufficient. Both he and Van Damme only go into real action mode an hour into the film, but the buildup to the last 25 minutes has been so expertly handled and the payoff so grandiose that you don't feel cheated. Though Luc and Andrew do ultimately engage in the promised rematch, their reunion prior to this unfolds in an unexpected way. Without spoiling anything, a role reversal has taken place: feeling his age and coming off years of anesthetizing therapy, Luc is remade into a soldier at the cost of his barely-regained humanity, whereas Andrew switches between violent confusion and dreamlike contemplation of his existence in a manner not unlike that of Frankenstein's monster, making him slightly sympathetic. Nevertheless, it's unclear whether the events of [[ASIN:B000022TSJ Universal Soldier - The Return]] are acknowledged in Luc's condition and it's never laid out why Andrew can override his programming like he does, and this could potentially hurt a few peoples' opinion of the movie. It doesn't help that the Luc vs. Andrew fight, though satisfyingly edited and generally cool, makes frequent use of obvious stunt doubles and stand-ins. The open-ended ending leaves a bit to be desired, too...<br /><br />While I consider this to be the best of the \\"Universal Soldier\\" series despite its DTV-ness, the film misses a perfect rating strictly because of its indulgence of a few unlikeable DTV traits - the ambiguity of the backstory, the stunt doubles in the rematch, etc. With the exception of [[ASIN:B002FOFX9C The Tournament]], this is the best recent DTV movie I have seen this year, and fans of everybody involved should take notice. I daresay this film is strong enough even for newcomers to the series to acquaint themselves with the material before checking out the original [[ASIN:B00005O6Y3 Universal Soldier]] if they so wish. Amazingly, this one is beyond being a labeled action vehicle for any specific star: it's an all-around cool action flick for both devotees and casual viewers to enjoy, even if they've never heard of the stars involved.t monologue.      The DVD cover bills Andrei Arlovski over both Lundgren and Van Damme, and while this is an accurate accreditation in terms of screentime, it does not diminish the importance of the other two stars. On the other end of the spectrum, Lundgren is seen the least of the three and plays more of a supporting role, but his presence is acknowledged throughout the movie without feeling insufficient.

Though Luc and Andrew do ultimately engage in the promised rematch, their reunion prior to this unfolds in an unexpected way. Without spoiling anything, a role reversal has taken place: feeling his age and coming off years of anesthetizing therapy, Luc is remade into a soldier at the cost of his barely-regained humanity, whereas Andrew switches between violent confusion and dreamlike contemplation of his existence in a manner not unlike that of Frankenstein's monster, making him slightly sympathetic. Nevertheless, it's unclear whether the events of [[ASIN:B000022TSJ Universal Soldier - The Return]] are acknowledged in Luc's condition and it's never laid out why Andrew can override his programming like he does, and this could potentially hurt a few peoples' opinion of the movie. It doesn't help that the Luc vs. Andrew fight, though satisfyingly edited and generally cool, makes frequent use of obvious stunt doubles and stand-ins. The open-ended ending leaves a bit to be desired, too...    While I consider this to be the best of the \\"Universal Soldier\\" series despite its DTV-ness, the film misses a perfect rating strictly because of its indulgence of a few unlikeable DTV traits - the ambiguity of the backstory, the stunt doubles in the rematch, etc. With the exception of [[ASIN:B002FOFX9C The Tournament]], this is the best recent DTV movie I have seen this year, and fans of everybody involved should take notice. I daresay this film is strong enough even for newcomers to the series to acquaint themselves with the material before checking out the original [[ASIN:B00005O6Y3 Universal Soldier]] if they so wish. Amazingly, this one is beyond being a labeled action vehicle for any specific star: it's an all-around cool action flick for both devotees and casual viewers to enjoy, even if they've never heard of the stars involved.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This Emma is absolutely the best. The music, costumes and sets and are just lovely and spot on. But what makes this version magical is how it stays so true to the essence of the book, and yet there is a slightly modern, refreshing feeling to the whole production.     The chemistry between Garai and Miller is fantastic. They are both beautiful to watch. And their wit and timing is flawless.     All of the actors did a stupendous job, but Miller's Mr. Knightly still has me swooning.     Bravo!
B001EYU1VO|5.0|I plugged this joystick into my Mac and it worked right away with no set-up.  I never had to even put in the install disk that it came with.  It just worked.  Even though the description says nothing about Mac compatibility, I found it highly compatible.   F.Y.I.: I'm using OSX 10.6 and with X-Plane 9, works great.  The joystick itself is also fantastic.
B002SF9YNO|5.0|Fully satisfying and engrossing story telling.  Engaging as well as sensitive the acting and direction satisfy the desire to be involved in a real and substantive way.  Enough has been said by others describing the plot, writing, etc.  Suffice it to say, I'm definitly left feeling fulfilled when such artistry is realized.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|Relax. This review won't give away the ending which comes as somewhat of a surprise, although many will admit to guessing the overall situation pretty early on.<br /><br />If you like your mysteries drenched in atmospheric surroundings, look no further than SHUTTER ISLAND. Director Martin Scorsese starts out with murky skies and a foreboding of doom as two men (a sheriff and his partner) approach a rocky coastline on a ferry as an ominous looking island looms into view. The plot, although keeping the viewer in a sea of confusion as it unravels, only becomes clear toward the last thirty minutes--but until then, the less you know about the outcome, the more you will enjoy the satisfying ending.<br /><br />None of the exposition is direct. Instead, we see the story from the viewpoint of a man (LEONARDO DiCAPRIO) who is obviously very troubled about tragic incidents in his past and who only gradually begins to see things in a different light. His journey is compelling right from the start, thanks to the marvelous performances of DiCaprio and MARK RUFFALO who begin their investigation into happenings at the island housing the mentally insane--some of them very dangerous cases.<br /><br />Director Martin Scorsese has the benefit of an excellent cinematographer, ROBERT RICHARDSON, whose camera work makes every frame of the film captivating. All of the exterior scenes along the rocky coastline of Maine have a sinister look. The story is told in a leisurely way but there is always an air of mystery in the relationships between the main characters, including BEN KINGSLEY as the psychiatrist in charge of the institution and MAX VON SYDOW as a suspicious looking German doctor.<br /><br />It's best not to dwell on the final outcome--but let's just say it probably won't come as a complete surprise to everyone. Nevertheless, it's the sort of thinking man's psychological thriller that any mystery fan should be able to savor.

B000067UUJ|4.0|I own the Hullabaloo yes I do, but beware which Hullabaloo you buy, for there is more than one, there are four -or five.<br /><br />Well maybe not four or five but certainly more than one.  It seems all have two discs but some have a live disc with only one disc being b-sides.  I have downloaded all variations of Hullabaloo and the ones with two discs of all b-sides is the more fantastic buy for sure; not that their live stuff isn't any good but quite the contrary.  I have been to over 100 concerts in my life seeing hundreds of bands and artists and I concluded a long time ago that Muse was the most pheonomenal, although not my favorite band.  If you want to hear their live stuff I recommend getting Haarp with the dvd and you'll SEE what I mean... or just go see them live (hint hint).<br /><br />The best b-sides on here in my opinion are definitely Recess, Hyperchondriac Music, Gallery, Shrinking Universe and In Your World.  It's ashame this wasn't released after Absolution with the amazing b-sides it produced like Fury and the cover of House of the Rising Sun.  But this is an awesome b-sides collection nevertheless, however I'm unsure where some of these other songs I have came from as they weren't on this album or any other official release.  If you already have the Hullabaloo you should check out the b-sides from their albums Absolution and Blackholes and Revelations.
1932100385|5.0|this book is amazing. extremely well structured. very thorough and thought out. i like how the book takes a scientific/medical approach, examining, analyzing, theorizing. the author is obviously extremely educated and non biased. A+! not a typical \\"vegan hippy\\" book :) also, ANYONE WITH CANCER SHOULD READ THIS BOOK IMMEDIATELY!!!!
B00364K6YW|5.0|This is without doubt the best adaptation of the beloved novel. Firth and Ehle work wonderfully together, and the supporting cast was perfect! As with any movie based on a novel there were some scenes cut and some jumbled together for times sake. But all n all a wonderful and faithful version. The attention to detail not only in costumes and hair but also in locations was amazing. The scene where Lizzy sees Pemberly for the first time took my breath away. It was beautifully done.

B002WYH5N2|1.0|First off I will admit that I do not care for Keira Knightley in the first place. But I was willing to give the film the benefit of the doubt and at least watch it.I turned it off with in the first five minutes. I was horrified! I did however sit and watch it all the way through a few weeks later with some friends. (I think they had to tie me down to keep me from leaving) The acting was terrible, the characters were not faithfully presented at all. This is one of my favorite novels and it was butchered! Ms. Knightley did not make a good Elizabeth Bennett, she came off as a silly air head with no wits at all, rather than the smart, witty, prejudiced Lizzy we all love. Mr. Bingley was portrayed as an imbecile who only knew how to laugh and smile. I could go on but I think you see my point. Many key parts were left out of the film. I was very disappointed. I don't see how any Austen fan could enjoy this at all.
0143034901|5.0|In a word, magnificent. All the praise is just--this book is a rare and delightful pleasure and I highly recommend it.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This version of Emma puts the others to shame. It is so splendid. All of the requisite elements are there, gorgeous sets and costumes and wonderful acting.     The characters, script and events are relatively close to the book. However it doesn't feel stiff and stilted, like an over done period piece. It does take some liberties with the book, but this makes it seem fresh and relevant. There are little modern flourishes here and there like Emma's hair and manners occasionally, and the music. But these are gentle touches and actually make the production much more enjoyable than an absolutely perfect regency piece.    I was completely enchanted with Johnny Lee Miller's version of Mr. Knightly. He is extremely handsome and witty. His portrayal was perfectly balanced between being the down-to-earth gentleman he was supposed to be and also humorous and engaging. He was just amazing- definitely an award winning performance. Romola Garai was a perfect Emma. She was so delightful. They were fantastic together.     This is not just my favorite version of Emma it is quickly becoming a favorite movie. I just adore it!
B00092ZL80|5.0|The Chicago/Earth, Wind, and Fire DVD is awesome!!!  My husband and I watch it every Friday night as we dance to the music.

B000BQ7BX2|5.0|I think enough has been said about this Mahler set so I just wanted to add another 5 star rating so more people know about Gari Bertini and Cologne Symphony Orchestra. Because, you should know about these wonderful readings. The recording quality is impeccable and symphony No 10 for example, sounds much better than Chailly/RSO Berlin. Bertini has this amazing gift to 'drive' the music  and make it interesting and moving. That reminds me of Furtwaengler' approach - music being in a fluid state, not a solid one. Definately the best 9 I have heard is in this set. Considering the price and the quality, this is the set to get

0312370849|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I had seen it before but didn't buy it because it didn't seem like a book I'd like. She was so adamant about how good the book was that I decided to buy it and give it a try. Wow, was she right about this book!    I spent a whole day reading this book, I couldn't put it down! I was immediately captivated by Sarah's story. I was, however, getting slightly depressed by what she was going through and almost wanted to stop reading, but then there was a sudden change of events that made me keep reading (I don't want to give away the surprise!).    I wasn't as excited about the book when it switched to Julia's chapters. Not that they were bad, but they were nothing like Sarah's chapters. I was also kind of disappointed when Sarah's chapters just ended and the remainder of the story was told through Julia. I would have liked to hear more of Sarah's point of view.    Even with my few small gripes listed above, I still LOVED this book. I definitely recommend reading \\"Sarah's Key\\".
1863513418|3.0|This is certainly a thick book for such a specific topic, so I was disappointed to discover so few pictures.  Many are just hand-drawn diagrams, but there aren't even a lot of those!  It definitely has valuable information, but for such a visual craft, you'd think they'd include more illustrations and photographs.  Also, this book is not for a beginner embroiderer.  It was fine for me, but I can see it being a bit confusing for someone who has no experience with general embroidery.

B00103584Y|5.0|I won't get into the details why this movie should be considered a great movie. 500+ reviews out there with 4.5 average star rating is hard to beat. I just want to stop at one of the greatness of this movie, even if that means giving out some spoilers. If you're like me, you may be interested in reading reviews of a movie even after watching it - just in case you missed something important. In that case, you won't mind the spoilers.<br /><br />What I really like about this movie is how the three stories rate on the scale of being believable in contrast to our own aspirations and hopes. They all look pretty unbelievable at one point or another. Yet nothing seems less probable than the one with the happy ending, considering it involves winning at the casino 100% of the time, a 1 in a Million chance of some of the encounters. Yet we all prefer the happy ending over the other two stories. It's in our nature - to hope and have faith for the best. And when the movie ends, we're left with the happy ending feeling, even though that's only one third of what's portrayed here. Ironic - isn't it?

B00009MGR6|2.0|Strange departure in a string of declining fortunes for the Australian rockers.  At least Johnson's voice is in better form than either their previous (Fly on the Wall) or latter (Razor's Edge), and this is as good as he would sound until turn of the century.  But bringing back old producers Vanda & Young did nothing to reverse the sinking trend, if anything just exposed the tired blues rock riffs by way of thin production.  The lyrics try a little harder than on FOTW, but that's never the point when listening to AC/DC.  \\"Heatseeker\\" and \\"That's the Way I Wanna Rock N Roll\\" are the obvious attempts to break radio (or video), neither having the power or hook to push that threshold open.  The band could benefit from some of the witty sleeze/sly word play Scott used to employ in his lyrics.  \\"Meanstreak,\\" \\"Go Zone,\\" and \\"Ruff Stuff\\" all being bland, by the numbers songs with little personality, no spark.  This is dead similar to the writer's block headed issues Ram It Down by Judas Priest was experiencing the same year.  Both bands looking to stay relevant in a changing rock environment but hitting a brick wall in the process.  Fortunately, things would improve, at least a little, with the turn of the 90's.

0719079276|4.0|I purchased the book to prepare myself for a degree in cultural and literary studies. The book is excellent as a beginners book. The only problem is that it is too small for the range it covers. The informations are short and almost encyclopedic. The author usually connects only one person with a (cultural) period or an idea (for example Barthes with Post-structuralism or Derrida with Postmodernism). However, as I said, there is no better book for beginners.<br />There are parts in the book (towards the end of every chapter) that help you to understand better the ideas presented (these are called STOP and THINK, where the author of the book helps you to apply the knowledge you gained from reading about a certain theory). Also, there are, at the end of every chapter, suggested books for \\"further reading\\" with short explanations pointing (in a nutshell) the quality and shortcomings (biases etc) of each book.<br />At the end, I can just conclude that this book is worth buying only as a beginning point (probably that's why there is BEGINNINGS in the name of the book). If you already know something, and still look for a book to help you understand theory, get separate books for every kind of theory (e.g. get a book on post-structuralism, book on postmodernism etc.)<br />PS. The book itself was poorly made. It already started falling apart and I have it less than a month.

0307271862|2.0|Having read happily through Henning Mankell's previous books, I was thoroughly disappointed, even irritated, by \\"The Man From Beijing.\\"  This book has harnessed plot in the service of political diatribe--the digressions are much more substantial than the actual story.  Most of the political lecture is pretty boring and, what's worse, much of it is hard to swallow.  This is true in particular of the pages of praise for Robert Mugabe.  Who is Mr. Mankell kidding?  It's hard to know whether anything in this book, even descriptions of the Swedish court system, are remotely realistic.  Political prejudice lurks behind every word when it's not right out in the open.    I am sorry I bought this book, sorrier that I read it, and very unlikely to read another of his books.
0143038095|5.0|Even though they are not the main voices of the stories, the mothers are the heroines.  Amy Tam does a wonderful job of telling their stories in precise and poetic language that takes the readers on a voyeuristic journey through the lives of these 4 families and their ancestors.    The first time I read this novel more than 20 years ago, the power of Ms Tan's story telling just bowled me over; I did not even notice that it was a 'mother daughter' category novel.  The stories of the mothers were particularly magical and tragic.  And the ones of Number 4 wife was developed as (I think) a 'Queen Gambit' when she sacrifices her life for her children; and it works.    Now I am rereading it and it still has power.  Now I can perceive the similarity in character of the mothers and their interactions with their daughters.  One has to wonder whether Ms Tan is describing her own mother and their own arguments.  I also note that the quixotic twists in the plots of the various stories remind me of the planning and developing of chess game strategies.  Many of the stories end in a 'draw', the game continues as does life; others like the one about the architect ends with a dramatic shift in power and the game continues. The last one about 'June' (I can remember that name) meeting her 2 sisters is a sort of 'winning' conclusion even though her mother (the queen) is no more.    This is a wonderful book and can be be enjoyed by anyone who enjoys well crafted stories with a difference.

B001RXB4FY|5.0|My brother pointed out a song he's heard on youtube, \\"Still Counting\\" when it suddenly appeared on the local rock radio station. For how long this band has been around (5 years since their debut album), I'm surprised I hadn't known about them sooner. I ordered the album and it is SOLID! Heavy metal at its finest, infused with country (Something I don't usually like, but Volbeat has its own way of presenting), Punk rock, Classic Rock & Roll, and some old-school blues. The singer's voice is POWERFUL! The riffs vary from soft and accessible to incredibly heavy.  My favorite songs on the album include the title track, Hallelujah Goat, Still Counting, Wild Rover of Hell, and their cover of I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.    I don't normally say this, but I'd recommend this album to ANY rock music fan. If you're a veteran metal-head who listens to stuff like Puddle of Mudd, Metallica, and Seether; this will be very accessible and incredibly awesome. If you're still listening to stuff like All-American Rejects, Daughtry, and Foo Fighters: this album will CHANGE YOUR LIFE!!!!    Also, I'm looking forward to their next album coming this fall. ROCK ON VOLBEAT!!!!!
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|This recording contains perhaps the last musical performance of pianist Richard Wright of the original Pink Floyd, who recently died of lung cancer.  Nick Mason (drummer) does not appear on this recording.  The music is a mixture of Pink Floyd songs and Gilmour's original songs.  I found it to be a great combination and extremely well recorded.  The audience is appreciative without being intrusive, always a concern on a live album.  When Gilmour thanks them in Polish, a great cheer erupts.    For Pink Floyd fans, this is a change to relive the great days with orchestral backing and excellent sound quality.  For those who still miss Roger Waters, you are out of luck, although many of his songs are used here.  I know he sued Pink Floyd after he left, but three out of four were still around.  Now one is performing and one is retired, tending to his priceless Ferrari collection.  Enjoy David Gilmour while you can.  His guitar work and voice are still first rate.

B002WY65VU|2.0|I rented this hoping for a comical zombie romp. This movie starts off really good with the opening credits, and the first fifteen mins establishing storyline was great. Then after Eisenbergs and Harrelsons characters meet up with the two girls..well..it got BORING! They just seemed like they didnt know where to go with this movie. The zombies were too far in the background and a lot of the movie is spent with them driving to California..shots of them driving with different ppl driving and talking while the other ones are asleep. The movie tries to redeem itself by having them go to hollywood and they end up finding Bill Murrays house. They get in and start to make themselves at home, not realizing that Bill is home. Harrelson and one of the girls come upon him, and he is not a zombie. They joke around,smoke pot,play Ghostbusters..then decide to show Eisenberg and the other girl that Murray is there. Murray desquises himself as a zombie and walks toward Eisenburg while they are watching a movie. Eisenberg thinks he is a zombie and shoots him. Then they dispose of his body and the two girls leave to Adventureland (not what it is called..just a reference to Eisenbergs other film) and surprise!!! Zombies come after them,the guys come and save them. They drive off together. THE END  I call this movie a waste of my time. At least it was a rental from Netflix, so I don't feel bad for having wasted gas to go to the video store to rent it. This could have been a great film if they had kept up what they had going for the first fifteen mins..but either they got lazy or just didnt know where to go with it. If you want to see a great zombie film, see Dawn of the Dead (the original from the 60's. Shaun of the Dead was ok for a comical zombie movie. Before I get bombarded by lovers of this movie, who may think I have no taste in movies..I will list some of my personal favorites. The Godfather I and II.Gone With The Wind.Raging Bull,Taxi Driver,Goodfellas,Color Purple. As for comedies, The 40 year old Virgin,Superbad,Forgetting Sarah Marshall,Knocked Up,Meet the Parents just to name a few. This was just off the top of my head.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I purchased this DVD at the end of 2009. Tried it out for a week and gave up. Level 1 really did kick my butt. As part of my new years resolution of toning up and losing about 15 lbs, (I'm 5'7\\" 150 lbs and want to get to 130 to 135lbs,) I decided to make myself a promise that no matter how tired I was or how sore I was that I was going to work out to this DVD every day. I worked out to Level one every day for 10 days, level two every day for 10 days and now I am part of the way through level 3. I have about 5 more days to go. I have stuck to my promise to myself. I had a personal trainer for a while in 2008 and did lose an over all 11 inches with the trainer. My trainer loves Jillian Michaels and incorporated a lot of what is included in this DVD into the sessions I had with her. So therefore I'm sure this DVD does work to some extent. Each level, the first few times you do it, is extremely hard. After a while of doing it every day, your body adapts and its not that difficult anymore. At least it wasn't for me, so when it was time to move up a level, I didn't think it would be that big of a deal. Let me tell you that every time I started a new level I felt like I was going to die. I had all the intentions of doing the more advanced moves, but did some modifications when it became too difficult. I didn't give up though and I completed every second of the workouts. Now you are probably asking if I have lost weight and to tell you the truth. No I haven't. But I can tell you that before starting this process I had no triceps and my underarms were more flabby than they are now. Why Quadraceps are definitely firmer and so are my hamstrings and calf muscles. My Butt was pretty flabby and couldn't really feel any muscles and now...it still looks flabby, but not quite as much and I have some butt muscles now. I haven't checked to see if I've lost any inches yet. Diet wise, I try to eat better than I did before, but occasionally i'll still eat some of my favorite foods. I'vealso been trying to drink a lot more water. I have also been using the flex belt and flex mini skirt since I started level 2 on a daily basis. I've only missed one day of the flex belt and two days of the flex mini skirt so far. And I've just recently started a bowel cleanse. I've also been running intervals at the gym and doing an extra ab workout about two to three times a week.    Final thoughts I think this workout DVD is definitely HARD. It is no joke. I haven't followed her diet plan, so I don't know if that would help or not, but so far I feel like I am more toned, but have not seen the drop on the scale just yet. I do plan on keeping up with using this DVD daily even after being done with the 30 days and alternating between each workout. I will try to update with my progress

1416594787|5.0|It rather disturbs me that books like this are necessary. The reality-deniers persist, trying to force their thunder gods and sky demons on us. This book provides the ammunition you'll need to defend yourself from the onslaught. Professor Dawkins presents the overwhelming evidence in favor of evolution in easily understood terms. This is less aggressive than some of his past writing and instead focuses on the science. This is more about common sense and rational thinking, less about revealing the absurdity of Creationist claims.

0307269981|1.0|If you liked \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tatoo,\\" which I loved, it is likely youd be disappointed by its follow up. I only read the first hundred and thirty pages of this book and sort of lost interest. It had none of the intrigue, none of the mystery of the first.<br /><br />Its not horrible, it just doesn't come anywhere close to the first one. Although, the characters are almost enough to keep me reading, Blomkvist and Salander are great characters and they still are in the sequel. The plot's just not there
B001E57SH8|4.0|I would have given this a 5 star rating, but sometimes it takes 4 strikes of the flint to get the flame to light.  The upside, you don't have the smell of lighter fluid as with the traditional zippo lighter.  Looks great, has very very good construction, and pretty much works like a charm.  Flame stays on for about 1 second longer after you release the trigger, so you can't really immediately close the lid when you're done.  Very good wind-proof lighter!
0316067598|5.0|If dangerous revisionism like Howard Zinn has been sadly required for three decades in our schools, why not be balanced?<br /><br />Firstly, to the small but vocal critics, who cares if the book is \\"well-written\\" by your standards? It is very readable, and as this is an intense story, it's hard to be wordy, like many preachy writers, when you're recalling these harrowing incidents. The book's story speaks for itself. This story is, thankfully, not Avatar.<br /><br />Secondly, Luttrell's book actually is well-written! And this comes from someone who's written four novels and about 1000 published articles the past six years, and therefore can be picky. The story is chronological, smooth, and the syntax and vocabulary are above-average. The descriptions of Coronado and SEAL training and very well done.<br /><br />There is also more military history (and important US history) and military education in Mr. Luttrell's book than you or Barack Obama would learn in seven years at Harvard! So the critics are ignorant and wrong. It is essential for American youths to read this book.<br /><br />As for the other criticism, jealous/proud military guys have more credence, but the bottom line is that the author leaves no stone unturned (book is 400 pages, but could've been fewer than 300) and does not sugar coat this tale. And his story was simply more gripping and tragic than anyone else's from the G.W.O.T. as far as I know. He's not pushing an agenda either. He's telling the truths we're not told by our state-run media.<br /><br />As a reviewer accurately wrote: \\"One does not survive any severe challenge without strong opinions and attitude. It is part of the man, therefore a required part of his story.\\"<br /><br />My cousin, who served two Afghan tours, knows Luttrell, and he agrees this is one of the best and most important books of our lifetimes. He says to ignore the \\"stupid comments\\" and most of the one star reviews (90% are 4-5 stars) are just that.<br /><br />As for the substance, how can this book not receive four or five stars? Aside from the incredible nuts and bolts of the main topic (the battle for Murphy's Ridge, survival, etc), as mentioned, it flows nicely, with the opening chapters giving personal background, descriptions, and so on. No complaints here, as I wasn't even expecting that bonus (nearly 200 pages before we get to the action).<br /><br />Summarizing, left-wing haters here and abroad will despise this book because it is honest, important and inspiring, rather than supercilious, petulant and politically correct. It also rips the despicable anti-American media, which has endangered our freedom-loving, proud nation and our troops to a higher degree than any AQ or Taliban member could. It's all spelled out.<br /><br />Thank goodness we didn't have Olbermann/Maher/Stewart, Blitzer, Leno/Letterman, Moyers, Maddow, Brokaw, Moore, Cameron, Gore/Kerry/Murtha/Boxer/Pelosi, Family Guy scribes, Colbert/Stewart, Williams/Couric/Gibson, and disingenuous 'educators' making these same inane rules during WW2, else we'd be speaking German and my Jewish European brothers & sisters would cease to exist.<br /><br />These heroes who died for our country could have saved themselves and killed \\"innocent civilians\\" (who eventually turned them in, leading to American deaths) but really did fear the American liberal media (and the aftermath) more than AQ or the Taliban. How does that make you feel when you turn on PBS, CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN or MSNBC each night, folks?<br /><br />I am glad at least some of these misguided reviewers actually read the book, so at least they may have learned something from the content...before they went back to the guitar and the campus offices.<br /><br />Luttrell's book is also -- gasp -- pro-American, anti-Jihad, patriotic, and ends with a real life scene involving Pres. Bush. That this scene accurately shows our 43rd Commander in Chief to be humble, noble, caring, intelligent and perceptive -- all qualities lacked by the current affirmative action narcissist ruining our great nation from the White House now -- will anger some. So be it.<br /><br />The honor and respect this author (and by his account, nearly every person in Special Forces (our most elite military men) with whom he served) has for President George W. Bush is just another area of the \\"War to Save Liberalism\\" sadly ignored in these Orwellian times for partisan reasons.ation from the White House now -- will anger some. So be it.

B000WS4P5G|5.0|When I purchased Danzig around 1989 or 1990, the metal scene was saturated with hair bands, thrash acts such as Metallica and Slayer were in a creative decline, and Pantera was about to introduce a style that would ruin it for everybody.  I bought this album because I was looking for something different and \\"Mother\\" was receiving airplay on metal radio, but it was quite a pleasant surprise to discover how good the rest of the record was.    Metal follows trends just like any other music genre, and as a result many bands sound alike.  It is pretty safe to say that no other band sounds like Danzig.  If you are tired of cookie monster vocals, blast beats, and \\"technicality\\", this record is for you.  The instrumentation is straightforward and minimalist, and Glenn Danzig's vocals range from howling to crooning, powerful to subtle.  The lyrics are poetic and would sound clichéd if sung by any other vocalist, but Glenn Danzig delivers them with depth and emotion.  Danzig manages to combine satanic and occult themes, gothic imagery, and sexuality into a unique package.  I have heard them played in a strip club (\\"She Rides\\"), how many other legitimate metal bands can make that claim?      The record is a gem from start to finish.  \\"Twist Of Cain\\", \\"She Rides\\", and \\"Mother\\" are probably the most familiar to metalheads, but other tracks stand out as well.  You will bang your head to \\"Am I Demon\\" while \\"Soul On Fire\\", \\"End Of Time\\", and \\"Evil Thing\\" are also excellent songs.  The mood overall is cold, dark and bleak, sometimes mysterious and ethereal.  This is undoubtedly a metal record but one that is heavy without relying on speed or volume.  Stylistically, it bears quite a bit of resemblance to Judas Priest during the era of Sad Wings Of Destiny, Sin After Sin, and Stained Class.    No metalhead should ever forget that Danzig carried the torch for years during some of metal's leaner years.  In an era dominated by grunge and alternative, the band refused to compromise and gave hope to an embattled metal audience.  This is an outstanding debut record and is rivaled only by Danzig IV in terms of quality.  It is definitely worth a purchase.

B000WS4OUW|4.0|The first Danzig record created the template for their sound and in my opinion will always be the band's greatest achievement.  Danzig II is a very good follow-up that falls somewhat short of that classic debut.    Although stylistically II bears close resemblance to the debut, it is apparent from the first notes of \\"Long Way Back From Hell\\" that the guitar tone is fuller and Glenn Danzig really lets loose with his vocals.  In fact, in my opinion this is his strongest vocal performance out of the first four classic records.  Especially strong tracks include \\"Snakes Of Christ\\", \\"Tired Of Being Alive\\", and \\"Her Black Wings\\".  \\"Blood And Tears\\" is great ballad that somehow manages to be powerful and devoid of sappy romantic sentiment.      It is on this record that Danzig's blues influences are the most apparent, and this is my biggest criticism.  The most blues-influenced tracks such as \\"Killer Wolf\\", \\"I'm The One\\", and \\"777\\" are also the weakest and diminish the album's impact.  \\"Pain In The World\\" is also a relatively bland closer and illustrates the inconsistency of the record.    Danzig II is certainly recommended for devoted fans of the band, who will want to own all of the first four records.  However, the casual fan may be disappointed by the amount of mediocre material.
B001QWBM62|5.0|I am an intermediate to advanced videographer and home recording artist.    This little thing is great.  It's not going to replace a high-quality home studio, but it's a nice little portastudio on it's own.  With enough patience, I imagine you could pull off a decent sounding album...but Audition or Acid is sure a lot easier to work with.     It is very nice for field recording.  The stereo mics just have a great sound.  The compressor and limiter are something I've never had on a portable recorder before.  They are a huge help.  I also use it to record audio for video.  I bought it with the intention of using it to record live concerts and speeches, so I could move the camera around without being tied to a soundboard.  Much cheaper than a video field recorder and sounds great.      The interface can be a bit aggravating, but I guess that's what you get for something so small and affordable.   I'm also a bit wary of the mics just sitting out like that with no protection, but overall very happy with the purchase.

A couple of early insights set the tone:<br /><br />  * Change requires the exertion of self control<br />  * Self control is an exhaustible resource<br />  * Change is hard because people wear themselves out.<br /><br />The book then goes on to very simple lay out the critical steps in making change easier, and what one needs to look for.  Also by imbedding case studies that encourage you to use their ideas before reading their suggested answer,  your learning grows.  (The design of the book follows their own findings! ) Lots of great information at [..]/resources.  The ideas that we are driven at the same time by a logical driver ( The Rider) and an emotional one (The Elephant) is a very useful metaphor.Its an easy read but as very valuable one.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|AVATAR<br /><br />STARRING: Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver, Stephen Lang, Joel Moore, Giovani Ribisi, Michelle Rodriguez, Laz Alonso, Wes Studi, CCH Pounder and Dileep Rao<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: James Cameron<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: James Cameron<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Science Fiction<br />Release Date: 18 December 2009<br /><br />James Cameron stopped making movies long ago. Now he makes events.  He made history with Titanic and he's made more of it with his latest film, Avatar. There is a reason he keeps us waiting sometimes ten years or longer between his films: he wants it to be done right. This is something which seems to be overlooked entirely by many of today's directors making big scale action pictures.<br /><br />At last - a huge Hollywood Blockbuster worthy of computer generated characters is upon us. Rumors placing Avatar's budget at somewhere between 250 and 300 million dollars, are not in the least bit unfortunate; as the film has already more than doubled that amount in profits, and is still continuing to roll in the dough for 20th Century Fox.<br /><br />James Cameron promised the world he would deliver us something that we had never seen before and needless to say, he delivered. He filmed a rough cut of the entire movie once, three years ago with the entire cast in special-ally designed suites that would visually capture their every movement, to later be loaded into computers. Then, he waited; for technology to advance so that he could apply the CGI to his actors properly, and finish the film.<br /><br />I have heard a lot of what I like to call jealous and or insecure people, ripping on Cameron for being a poor writer. I have read a lot of screenplays and I recently read his script for his 1986 film, Aliens. I'm here to tell you, it was the best original screenplay I have ever read. James Cameron is a true artist both visually and on the page.<br /><br />He may not create some of the most dialogue-driven characters and his films do tend to have the traditional three act structure with a boy meets girl concept to them; but clearly he's doing a good job, or his films would not be as successful as they are. Much like Michael Bay, Cameron doesn't need avid fans like me to defend him - the ticket-sales speak more than loudly enough on his behalf; so I'll shut up about that now, and get on with the review.<br /><br />Sam Worthington stars as a wheel-chair-bound Marine, by the name of Jake Sully. The year is 2154 and wars still wage on. When a group of Military officials decide to raid a foreign planet called Pandora, in search of valuable minerals; they need Jake's help.<br /><br />Prior to being killed, the Military had a special avatar designed for Jake's twin brother to operate. They planned on using this avatar to blend in with the natives of Pandora, in an effort to obtain valuable information regarding the whereabouts of the precious mineral. Having the exact genetic build as his twin, Jake sees how valuable he is. If he agrees to help, he will be given an expensive operation that will restore his legs to working order. He agrees.<br /><br />Pandora is a truly beautiful place. In a way it resembles Earth a great deal. It has rich green forests and breath-taking waterfalls. It also has islands, but rather than poke up from the ocean, they simply float in mid-air. The downside is that its air source is not adaptable for human lungs.<br /><br />The inhabitants of Pandora are a race of large blue people with tails, pointy cat-like ears and yellow eyes, standing at maybe 10 or 12 feet in height. Jake's avatar, is designed to look like one of these natives of Pandora, called the Na'vi.<br /><br />He is heavily sedated in a special tube-like chamber and once unconscious, is able to mobilize his avatar with his brain. He can taste, touch, feel, hear, see and even walk or run with his new body. Worthington is marvelous at convincing us that it has been God knows how long, since he had the use of his legs.<br /><br />Once on Pandora, Jake meets a beautiful native named Neytiri (Zoe Saldana). She saves his life from a savage beast of her forest, and takes him to meet her people. He becomes attached to the Na'vi and especially Neytiri.<br /><br />When the Military reveal their plans to annihilate the Na'vi, if they don't disperse from the area where the sacred mineral is believed to be; Jake must defend them. The Military is headed up by one of the best villains ever: Colonel Miles Quaritch. He was played superbly by Stephen Lang.<br /><br />If you get a chance to see the film in 3-D, I highly recommend it. It's without a doubt the best 3-D film I have ever seen. It's not done to have cheap thrills pop out your face simply for the purpose of making you jump in your seat. It's designed to make you feel like you are there with the characters and that's exactly what it does.<br /><br />One of the things I found most interesting about the film, was the numerous uses of avatars. Jake's character obviously uses his avatar to blend in with the Na'vi. The Military use avatar-like robots similar to those used in Aliens and Iron Man, to navigate around; and the Na'vi use animals and creatures in the forest as avatars, by linking their tentacle-like membranes into the ears of these beasts.<br /><br />It's more than obvious that the film has underlying themes regarding the early Americans and the Native Americans. You can arguably find similarities in today's political issues and conflicts as well. What's great however is that they aren't forced down our throats, and if wanted they could easily be overlooked entirely, for the purpose of just enjoying the film.<br /><br />I've heard countless opinions of people who think James Cameron is a racist against whites because he makes them look bad by taking over the Na'vi; I have head others say he's racist because the Na'vi are played by either black or Native American actors and he purposely had them be dark-skinned characters etc, etc. Having seen the film twice and having heard James Cameron defend it in countless interviews; I can honestly say that I don't think he is coming from a racial, anti-American or in any other possible way, negative place with Avatar. It's simply a film about people in general and the main thing to take from is as simple as the oldest rule in the book: do unto others as you would have done unto you.e Saldana).

0545140315|3.0|At some pivotal moment in their life, every teenage girl will come to the point where she will become fed up with boys and their typical immature shenanigans. Some might even go so far as to completely swear off the male sex for a certain period of time. A very few others will possibly not only stop dating boys, but they will encourage all their friends to do so and will then create a club where they can celebrate their self-induced single-ness with other like-minded females. Our hero, Penny Lane Bloom belongs to the last category.     After finding herself with a broken heart yet again, Penny decides to swear off boys (except the Beatles) until after high school, choosing instead to focus on herself and her girlfriends by creating The Lonely Hearts Club (so named after the Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band album). Penny couldn't be happier with her new found freedom, even if she is only a club of one. But word of Penny's new club spreads quickly among the girls of her school who are also eager to shed their boy-troubles and Penny quickly finds herself on the outs with nearly every boy, some particularly catty girls, and even her principal.    There were several things to love about Elizabeth Eulberg's debut novel The Lonely Hearts Club. First off, any novel that takes not only its title but several character names and a 'date' to a Beatles impersonators concert from the Fab Four cannot help but be entertaining. Additionally, I adore the lighthearted cover with its modern girly Abbey Road inspired cover. I also applaud Eulberg for creating some strong female characters who recognize the futility of centering their lives around the whims of immature males who go on to get good grades, join sports teams, and who understand the value of female friendship. Thank you for that.     As much as I enjoyed Penny and the girls, I often found myself wondering if The Lonely Hearts Club had been written about eight years ago after listening to Penny's best friend repeatedly say \\"what to the ev\\" (gag) or how the girls applied shimmer powder before going to party. Shimmer powder? Yeah, that kind of stopped happening with anyone over the age of 10 after 2006. And those are only a few small details. I had issues with the basically nonexistent parents who were essentially present only to lend Penny her Beatles infatuation and the unbelievably unsupportive Principal who would have been slapped with several lawsuits quicker than you can say \\"advanced placement.\\" And as much as I was rooting for Penny, though many of her exchanges with friends could sometimes be described as light and fun, they were usually awkward and extremely after-school-special unrealistic. Which I found extremely sad since all the components for making The Lonely Hearts Club into something really entertaining were right there. In the end, Penny and her club just failed to turn it into something more than a predictable 90's sitcom.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|This is an incredibly good record.    I hesitated to buy it.  How can a band produce something like \\"Home\\" and not have the rest of the record sound like repitition or duds?  \\"Home\\" sounds like a perfect candidate for a \\"one-hit wonder\\" band.    But that is not the case.      This record is full of invention and wonder; originality combined with allusions to other masters. I hear so many sounds that make me go \\"who is that like?\\" and if I remember I think \\"no - it is reminiscent, but not a copy\\".  And they just layer it all on you, over and over, track after track.  Creating their own original experience.    Incredible.  Thanks, Brooke, for turning me onto this.    Oh - and the car radio or YouTube or little things stuck in your ears do not do justice.  You need to hear it play (loud) where the drum pounds through your chest and the piano rings in your ears and the horns blare in your face and you dance and smile.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This is a movie about the director of some of the worst movies ever made in movie history. In honor of Ed Wood it's filmed in black and white with cheap sets, made to look just like one of the schlocky, low budget films that Ed was so famous for. If you are a fan of Ed Wood, or a fan of cheesy movies this is a must see!     For anyone who has ever asked, \\"How do crappy movies get made?\\" the answers can be found in this film...And it is sure to make you LAUGH too! The story begins with our struggling director as he creates the travesty \\"Glen or Glenda?\\" and we get some insight into Ed's personal life. The movie goes on to tell the tale of the many tragically bad yet brilliant movies that Ed went on to make...Plan 9 from Outer Space, Bride of the Monster...etc. Each movie Ed made was a cheaply made, poorly written and horribly reviewed disaster! Many were pieced together with scrap footage, shot in one take and made with no budget and it shows. The classic line \\"Fine, shoot whatever bologna you want just make sure it's seven reels long!\\" pretty much sums it up!     I felt sympathy for Ed, who seemed like a nice person honestly trying to make a living and doing his best to make something good. He ends up failing and making instead a legendary collection of thrown together, cheap, corny and laughable movies. We learn too about Ed's life, his ladies, his friendship with Bella Lugosi, his love for cross dressing. This movie is a tragic, quirky tale about a nice, generous guy who didn't have the money or support to make good movies...so he made bad ones instead! One thing Ed had was heart and although his movies are considered awful, in some ways they are brilliant too. It's one thing to make a bad movie...But Ed's movies are so bad they're good and that is a rare thing!           Johnny Depp is amazing in this role. It is ironic how a movie about horrible movies actually ends up being a great movie! The movie honors Ed and Johnny is very believable. Watching this helps aperson truly understand all that goes into making a stinker. For every bad movie made, no matter how awful, someone somewhere thought it was a good idea. Someone had the courage (or stupidity) to press on through hardship, failure, doubt and struggle to make something the world would remember. Ed Wood will be remembered for making bad movies and this movie is a great homage to him. If you are a fan of Ed Wood movies you will love this!

0316096199|5.0|This book was brave and from a personal perspective it spoke to me. She was honest and not a bit of this memoir is inaccurate. It spoke to me personally, and I hope to everyone else who has been a victim of sexual assault or knows someone who has been. This type of crime does indeed shatter a person's life, and sometimes recovery takes a life time. She described her journey so well, and I am glad she was brave enough to write about it, and share her experience. Many victims of crime, especially rape and sexual assault, feel alone and unable to face what happened to them. let alone go to trial and write a book. Mrs. Sebold sets a great example for other women, and demonstrates there hope and recovery after something as traumatic as rape. I especially appreciated the information about PTSD, since I have dealt with that disorder in my own life.

0385737947|3.0|I brought this book with me on a cruise and it was a perfect selection: a plot that moved along and kept me interested. So interested, in fact, there were times when I wanted nothing more than to stay by the pool, reading.  However, the characters and writing did not quite reach the level of the plot. I was not particularly drawn to Thomas, or invested in his plight. For the most part I just enjoyed the twists and turns of the story, and they were enough to make me ignore the weaker points. The only downfall of that is, at times, I found my eyes skipping ahead to see what happened, rather than digesting every word of the text.  That being said, I will definitely be picking up the Scorch Trials (sequel)!
1594488916|5.0|Allison Hoover Bartlett took the risk (as did her publisher) of spending significant time and effort writing about a man whom many would rather easily dismiss as a mere \\"klepto.\\"  Instead, John Gilkey, apparently, defined himself to himself and to others through the books he purloined from rare book shops.  A mere shoplifter would not have used the Modern Library \\"Top 100\\" as his guide to stealing.  Gilkey, however, appears to have let his love of books if not literature invent a world where the \\"have nots\\" are perfectly justified in taking from the \\"haves,\\" in this case book dealers who had dedicated their lives to buying and selling valuable books and building important collections at very little profit.<br />Bartlett's honesty in approaching her subject, both bibliomania in general and Gilkey in particular, is refreshing.

Ken Sanders, her pilot through the early part of her investigation, figures largely in the story as  initially a one man crusade to corral and incarcerate book thieves.  Using an unwished for promotion to head of security for the ABAA, Sanders launches a network of electronic communication that allowed members of the organization to alert each other to Gilkey's movements.  By the end of the book, Sanders has relinquished his post and slowly disappears from the stage while Bartlett follows Gilkey from one prison term to another, questioning her own involvement and objectivity in the story.<br /><br />If you have ever felt an unreasonable or unhealthy appetite for books, you might enjoy this book as a participant, if not in the stealing perhaps in the fervor.  Those who are not avid book collectors or bibliophiles but who have felt driven to collect something may still understand the almost psychotic drive to own and possess one thing, and then another, and another, without ever being able to say \\"I am satisfied, no more.\\"<br /><br />In this age of drug wars and blood lust, a book about a book thief might sound anticlimactic.  My best advice is, buy the book, enjoy the story, and thank Allison for seeing it through.

B002XMGGK6|4.0|All the internet chattering aside, LAW ABIDING CITIZEN is just what it sets out to be - a thriller that keeps the viewer involved in the mind games of a passionate man right up to the end (uh, well almost - except for the needlessly sugary revolting Hallmarky last few frames meant to clean up the mess the movie suggests...)<br /><br />Kurt Wimmer wrote this 'taking justice into our own hands' story with a good deal of imagination and gadgetry and F. Gary Gary keeps the momentum of the story going along at a breakneck pace.  Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler) opens his home door to face two thugs who beat and kill his wife and daughter and injure him substantially.  Shelton seeks a good lawyer and finds himself in the hands of smarty guy Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx) who sets the film in motion by accepting a plea bargain on behalf of the killers - one will be sent to prison with the death penalty and the other just gets a little time. Shelton is distraught at this abuse of the justice game. Jump forward 10 years and the one killer has a botched heinous execution while the other, now free, is is laughtered hideously - both by Shelton.  There is a plan in Shelton's head to destroy everyone who allowed justice to misfire and the rest of the film is how the genius mind of Shelton (jailed after his slaughter of the killer) manages to wipe out everyone involved in the court system that instigated the terror.<br /><br />Butler and Foxx make a good sparring pair and there are some excellent cameos by Colm Meany, Viola Davis, Bruce McGill et al.  Yes, this is a violent film, and not for the squeamish, but it does make us look at the judicial system with different eyes.  If only the director hadn't glopped on the sloppy goodie-two-shoes happy-wappy scene that ends the film and feels like a purging cathartic....Grady Harp, February 10
B002T9H2LA|3.0|The legend of \\"Inglorious Basterds,\\" QT's long-germinating WWII epic, is as entertaining as the movie itself.  That's not a criticism.  Newspaper and Internet stories have dangled tantalizing tales of Tarantino nurturing this script along - it will be a four-hour epic, it will be a miniseries a la \\"Band of Brothers,\\" it will be a tribute to \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" it will be Tarantino's greatest film, etc.      *** Beware mild spoilers ensue *** (in case you've been under a rock and don't know how the movie ends)    Perhaps no film could have lived up to the hype of \\"Basterds,\\" but amazingingly, the opening scene does just that.  Using QT's hallowed practice of dividing the movie into chapters, the movie opens with \\"Once Upon a Time in Nazi Occupied France.\\"  A riveting scene of pure dialogue ensues - a masterpiece of tension as the \\"Jew Hunter,\\" Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (a fantastic Christoph Waltz, destined for a best-supporting actor Oscar) interrogates a French dairy farmer suspected of harboring Jews.  Using a diabolical combination of charm, sincerity, and honesty, Landa establishes himself as one of the great film villains of the new century.  A lone survivor of his raid, Shosanna (Melanie Laurent) flees to Paris to open a film theater (natch).    We then meet the Basterds, led by Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt).  Raine is one of those redneck war gods you see so often in the movies.  Maybe it's because so many films get made by non-Southerners, but it's a cliche of WWII films that if you have a soldier from the South, he's going to be a crack marksman and natural-born soldier (see Barry Pepper's character in \\"Saving Private Ryan\\").  Raine is equally motivated by sadism, as he and the Basterds are going to parachute into Europe and kill Nazis with such barbarism that the Nazis \\"will be sickened by us, and they will fear us.\\"      QT thereby sets an exquisite table, but then shockingly refuses to serve the meal.  For long stretches of the movie, you wonder, \\"where are the Basterds?\\"  In \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" one of QT's all-time favorite movies, you fall in love with the scruffy band of murderers and cut-throats watching them achieve their unique brand of bizarre greatness.  As a result, the final scene at the Nazi chateau combines both terrific action and wonderful exploitation of the bond we have forged with the characters.    \\"Basterds\\" looks a thousand times better than \\"Dozen,\\" and Tarantino has written some exquisite scenes.  And yet, by the time of the climactic scene at Shosanna's movie theater - which cleverly uses film to defeat Hitler - I could not name any of the Basterds involved in the mission other than Raine.  Indeed, a couple of Basterds appear to be on a suicide mission, yet we have not seen any discussion of who these guys are and why they would be motivated to make that supreme sacrifice.  While the easy answer is, \\"because they're killing Nazis,\\" but there's nothing in the film that indicates these guys are motivated by anything approaching Bushido - these guys are in Europe to kill Nazis and to keep killing Nazis . . . something that's hard to do if you're committing suicide.    One of the hardest things to do in writing a book or making a movie is deciding what to leave in and what to leave out.  Authors often lament leaving favorite characters and subplots out of stories because they don't work in the overall scheme.  In \\"Basterds,\\" QT left in some stuff that's darn good but distracts from the overall work - you can't make a movie called \\"Basterds\\" and not have the audience fall in love with the guys.  But QT doesn't give us time to do that.    Ultimately, this movie has some of the finest scenes of suspense of any war movie (particularly a war movie that doesn't have any real battlefield scenes).  There are also scenes of pure visual artistry.  And there are some terrific performances.  But as a whole, the movie does not exceed the sum of its parts.  It is a case study in What Might Have Been.

B002NWRMVS|4.0|Norah Jones once again takes her music in new directions on her fourth studio release The Fall.  In some ways it is hard to believe that this is the same artist that brought us the sweet, piano-driven Come Away with Me some eight years ago.  However it is a testament to her talent as an artist that she need not follow a formula of cranking out clones of the past in order to be successful.<br /><br />While her sound has changed over time, the overall mood of her music has changed too.  The Fall is known as her \\"break up CD\\", and this is not without merit.  Listeners see Jones in the various stages of dealing with her loss.  Her anger shines through on \\"Tell Yer Mama\\" where she goes as far as blaming her ex's parents for the way that they raised him.  This song is by a bouncy electric bass rhythm that supports her finger wagging delivery.  In the whimsical opener, \\"Chasing Pirates\\", Jones seems more interested in escape.  This is one of the few songs on the CD that is semi-upbeat.  Jones also touches on her sadness with \\"You've Ruined Me\\".  She sings with an earnestness and emotional depth that is not common for her.  The instrumentation gives a sway in 3/4 time that supports the song well.  However, Jones closes The Fall with \\"Man Of The Hour\\", a song that I hope is meant to be tongue-in-cheek.  With only her piano playing as a backdrop she decides to give up men for dogs - hence the strong canine presence on the CD front and back.<br /><br />However, her ex is not the only one to receive Jones' reproach.  On \\"It's Gonna Be\\", the most electric/rock sounding song on the CD, takes her swipe at the critics with lines such as \\"And now that everyone's a critic/It's makin' my mascara runny.\\" and \\"Cuz there's a fine line between a skewer/And a decent sense of humor.\\"  Yet it almost becomes comical with the line \\"Aim at the ones who've really hurt us/They should be arrested for murder.\\"  While I found the lyrics somewhat questionable, \\"It's Gonna Be\\" was my favorite song on The Fall.  It has nice vocal harmony, and I found it interesting to hear her cut loose with a more rock influenced sound.<br /><br />Overall, I thought The Fall was a musical success for the continued evolution of Norah Jones as an artist.  However, if you don't like \\"break up\\" music, or you were hoping for a return to her piano-driven style of old; you probably won't like The Fall.<br /><br />Download this:  It's Gonna Bes nice vocal harmony, and I found it interesting to hear her cut loose with a more rock influenced sound.

B000089HCR|4.0|Great album - must have for fans of more traditional metal. THE FLAME is one of the greatest songs of all time -but what makes this album so strong is almost everyone that loves it has a different favorite.    If WASP would have had all their albums as strong as this one (and The Last Command) they could have been huge...but oh well...still made some great music.
0446569895|5.0|\\"I Am Ozzy\\" is one the most entertaining reads I've ever had. I raced through the book and found it hard to put down. Ozzy tells his life story (at least the parts that dribbled out...his words, not mine!) in a conversationalist prose, like you're sitting at the pub with him, having a pint.<br /><br />I already knew most of the details. I've been an Ozzy fan for over 30 years. But to experience him telling his story with his brand of self-deprecating, dry humor was a great surprise. I did not expect this book to be as funny as it was; nor as touching. You come to realize how much this man loves Sharon and his family, why he pissed on the Alamo, why he chomped the head off of a dove...and of course, the bat.<br /><br />It is a must have for any Ozzy fan, rock & roll fan, or generally any fan of music who grew up in the 80's.

B002YIHO7I|3.0|I am a big fan of Sade and have enjoyed all the previous CDs and songs; obviously some more than others.  After waiting such a long time for this new work, understandably expectations were high among all her fans.    I enjoy the CD.  I paid $9.99 plus shipping for it and believe I got my money's worth.  They are not her best songs.  Realistically, I don't think there's an artist whose every album is better than the one that went before it.  It's probably more a case of just the opposite.  But it is not a disaster, and I'm certain that with time even those voicing disappointment will have their favorite songs from \\"Soldier of Love\\".
1416583408|4.0|The title of this book is INSIDE OF A DOG, WHAT DOGS SEE, SMELL, AND KNOW.  After reading the text, I feel I have a much greater understanding of exactly what my canine companions see, smell, know, and how they may interpret the world surrounding them (including the humans in it).  Dr. Horowitz does a lovely job of explaining the sensory abilities that dogs have (particularly smell and sight).  She then interprets how those abilities help dogs take in their surroundings and how they might affect the ways dogs relate to us and how we should relate to them.  Additionally, she addresses the topic of anthropomorphism and how we can replace it with a better understanding of the way dogs act and possibly feel, based on their specific canine abilities and their understanding of the world around them.  This is so important, as people seem to realize less and less that dogs are still animals and differ from us in many ways, even though they are able to relate to human companions so well.<br />I love the personal stories that are sprinkled throughout the book about the author and her dog.  It brings a bit of a personal note to the text and reminded me of special moments that I've had with my dogs. Additionally, although the book is written by a cognitive scientist, it is written in a manner that can be enjoyed by a wide audience.<br />My only hang up is that I felt the book could've been even more focused on the cognitive abilities of dogs without so many side notes (about rat testing, genomic mapping in foxes, etc.).  These asides are not overwhelming, by any means, but my expectations were that the book would focus on dogs' abilities, so that led to my less than perfect rating.  Overall, this book is an enjoyable and informative read!
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I couldn't give this a higher rating. The sound is better than the stereo or mono sets and it comes in a beautiful and portable USB. I have put the music on several computers without having to load CD's over and over again.     Converting the FLAC files to Apple Lossless was easy as pie with dBpoweramp.     The artwork and documentaries are also AMAZING to watch.    Anyone who says anything negative about this item are just trying bring people down. Notice how many 5 star and higher if they could ratings.     Don't walk, RUN to get this before such a unique item will only be available as a collectors piece and those bozo's are still lugging around their many many CDs.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|Thought the book was a good read but was a little disappointed with the ending. It felt like the writer had to end the book suddenly. I wanted more out of the ending. I wanted to have more details of the killer. I thought his demise was to...easy...nonchalant like. But all in all it was a good read. I recommend it for teens on up. I think I related to this book because I was a teen girl of the 70's.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|I have tried a number of times to get into this author's work because my friends have recommended his work for years.  Wit, hilarity, irony are frequent words tossed about in reference to his work.  On every prior effort I've failed to \\"get it\\".  I finally got it in two formats to break this impasse, if indeed it was breakable.  First, I got the audio version of JEEVES & WOOSTER, narrated by Martin Jarvis.  Then I watched the Video version with Hugh Laurie and Stephen Fry.  I am happy to report that I finally \\"get\\" the humor and fun which readers of Wodehouse have long enjoyed.  If you too have had trouble getting into the wit behind the work, I suggest you do the same.<br /><br />The stories revolve around a well connected English gentleman, Bertie Wooster, who is as idle as can be. There are lords and ladies in his family.  He did go to Eton and Oxford and now belongs to all the right clubs.  However, the way he behaves, is the way most men of his class behaved in England back in his day, when automobiles were first coming out.  You do see Bertie tooling about in his roadster.  Bertie is played by Hugh Laurie. This character couldn't be any more different from Doctor Gregory House, especially since Bertie could not figure his way around his own breakfast, much less diagnose someone in dire distress. Bertie is funny but you are most definitely laughing at Bertie, not with him. Hugh Laurie is superb. His is the harder role as he has to come across as likable but not having much but air between his ears.<br /><br />Jeeves is as opposite from Bertie as can be.  Jeeves is of the working class, Bertie's valet.  He is suave, intelligent, well read, shrewd and manipulative.  Also, he is always calm and collected, never losing his cool.  Stephen Fry plays him to perfection but it is a one note performance.  In each and every episode, it is Jeeves who rescues Bertie, his friends or his family members after they have gotten themselves (always) into some ferocious mess of their own making. Just with picking out potential marital partners, they are all utter disasters.<br /><br />A big part of my problem with Wodehouse and J&W was simply being American.  In this same era in America, a well born, well educated man like Bertie would be considered a sluggard for accomplishing nothing. That he could go to (by comparison) Andover and Yale, after being born into a prominent American family, yet be such an idiot that his valet had to do his thinking for him, would not be the making of an American satire!  That Bertie and all his friends regard any form of work as beyond the pale is also about as un American a concept as there could be. This classic of wit and satire could only come from England since it revolves around the concept and conceit of the idle English gentleman in that era.<br /><br />Visit my blog with link given on my profile page here or use this phonetically given URL (livingasseniors dot blogspot dot com).

0307454541|1.0|I am an avid reader and once I start a book, even if I don't like it, I will read it to the bitter end because I hate giving up on anything.  I gave up on this book.  I made it through about 250 pages of it before throwing in the towel.  It was very, very, very dull.  The characters had no color.  The whole book was like watching a grainy black and white movie that had no sound or music.  It was just dull.  The \\"mystery\\" wasn't very interesting.  I could not make a personal connection to any of the characters or the plot and it was just soooooooo slow moving.  Sorry, I just don't get the hype!
0385504225|4.0|It's entertaining.  I had fun reading it.  I've read and agree with most of the critical reviews.  Those reviews that conclude that the book isn't worth your time to read, are wrongheaded. We all enjoy books and movies and heck, operas! that one can make the same negative assessments about, but those we like, we like because they are engaging despite any silly plot points or because they fail to provide The Secrets of the Universe in the end.  This book is engaging.  I read it in just a couple days and recommend it. I needn't repeat other reviewer's comments to explain why I didn't give it full stars.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|All the songs on this release are great but I love the uptempo rock songs the best. I would recommend this release to anyone that likes girl fronted rock bands.  Too many favorites to list but it's just a great release.  Also, loved the fact that Amazon offered it for $3.99.

0764207407|3.0|The story centers around two sisters - Elinor and Marianne Daswood. The love and loyalty between the sisters is astounding, but they do not understand each other. Elinor is a quiet, sensible and sensitive young lady cheerful and putting others first. Marianne is just the opposite. She has a quick temper, speaks before thinking, is often rude and is full of herself. Her wishes and desires come first regardless of who is hurt.<br /><br />The family lives in late 18 century England where a person is judged by breeding and wealth, looking down on the working class. Circumstances change in the sisters lives and they are forced to move from the family homer to the country. Their half-brother has good intentions as to their welfare, but is overruled by his wife. Through the goodness of a distant cousins and friends, the sisters remain in polite society. Both have feelings for two gentlemen of the upper class, but whose feelings do not appear to be in their favor or any chance of marriage. What transpires in the lives of Elinor and Marianne along with their friends leads to some interesting conclusions.<br /><br />Jane Austen has always been a favorite author of many. However, this is a reprint of the original book first published around 1811. The trivia and notes that highlight this \\"Insight Edition\\" in the right margin is very distracting, and at times I found the story rambling without anything worthwhile being said.<br /><br />Jane Austen fans who want to reread the book will, no doubt, purchase the reprint for the interesting trivia, but I found it very hard to follow, due to the inserts in the margin, and to only hold my attention for short periods of time.<br /><br />This book was provided by the publisher for review.

B00003CXA2|1.0|Robert Zemickis is no stranger to making films that go back in time. Whether it be through time travel in \\"Back To The Future\\" or through the accounts of a simple yet intellectual challenged man named Forrest Gump. In Forrest Gump Tom Hanks takes on the title role of a Alabama man who overcomes odds only to face more as he grows older. While many will give this movie 5 stars and critics and movie goers alike loved this movie, I will give you an honest opinion that differs. This movie will take you on an emotional rollercoaster with some laughs thrown in otherwise it would be unbearable.The visual effects are excellent and were state of the art at the time of the films release in 1994. This movie is very far from being a comedy though. It has some comedic elements but they are there only to neutralize the impending doom that comes to most of the characters throughout the movie. Forrest Gump also unabashfully reeks of a conservative message that the person who obeys and belives in God first and foremost, believes in his country no matter what and has morals no matter how unintelligent he might be will survive over everything and everyone else. At what price though one must ask?, When this movie and the main character must deal with abdonment from just about every character. Anyone who has experienced abdonment issues should be warned this movie will definetly bring these issues to a head. It is anything but a feel good movie. While the character Forrest Gump must be looked at as commendable and a good person you cant help but feel sorry for him ( not because he has a low IQ but rather because of all the people that leave his life). You simply walk away from this movie feeling bad overall yourself. I'm still confused as to how this movie could ever be labeled a feel good movie. It's tragedy is what it is. Here is a man of humble means and intelligence who goes on to experience the 50's through the 1980's in America, helps shape popular culture by pure accident, has runins with president and celebrites, by pure chance, becomes successful in the shrimp industry with the help of a hurricane, by pure chance becomes finacially stable for life because he invest in Apple Computers, but what does any of this success mean when all the people he cares about leave him or die? This movie sends the message the opposite of what's really important. Forrest becomes rich in materialism and noteriety but is he really rich in spirit and personal life when everyone he cares about is gone? The movie winds down and concludes by trying to soften this blow with the revelation that Jenny who now lives in Savannah Georgia after years of promiscuness and drug use now has a son who is actually Forrest's very own biological child. This even comes off sad and confusing. And for me was the final straw for this movie having any redeeming qualities. Did Jenny really get pregnant by Forrest that faithful night she decided to hop into bed with him? Only to leave the next morning abdoning Forrest once more? The movie only hints that Jenny and Forrest had sex together. Yet by having a scene where Forrest and Jenny's son both tilt their heads the same way while watching tv we are to believe without a doubt he is Forrest son.Based on Jenny's track record for sleeping around the odds are pretty high that other guys she was with could had passed a gene on to the kid that makes him tilt his head. Titling ones head is not uncommon at all and most certainly doesnt give proof positive evidence that Forrest is the father. If Jenny found out she was pregnant soon after in her transient travel assuming she hadnt slept with anyone else how did she know for sure Forrest was the father? Regardless of Jenny's troubled past I would think if she cared at all about Forrest she would had contacted him before the baby was born to tell him it was his child.  If she was sleeping around as the movie hints at throught out her adult life, then the story and movie leaves an unexplanied gap.How did Jenny known Forrest fathered the baby? The second scenerio which i'm afraid is even sadder, Is Jenny got pregnant sometime after she left Forrest's house by some other guy, and when she found out 6 years later she was dying she decided she could call upon good old dependable Forrest and use his lack of intelligence and good naturedness against him and tell him the kid is his knowing he would raise the child and would do anything for Jenny. Either way the motives of Jenny which go unaddressed is heartbreaking none the less. and in my opinion leaves her character with no redeeming qualites whatsoever. Afterall she could never give her love to Forrest his entire life, even though he offered unconditional love to her, but only when she is dying and needs her son to be raised by someone she knows is dependable does she give her love and self to Forrest. As the movie ends and Forrest is sending his \\"son\\" off to school just like his momma had done for him you get the sense of sadness. Not because things have come full circle, but because the movie leaves many things untied as to whether or not Jenny lied to Forrest about him being the daddy. And if she didnt lie then she selfishly prevented Forrest from knowing his only child until she was close to death.And robbed the boy of his first 5 or 6 years of life knowing his daddy. After watching this movie you will feel you invested 2 1/2 hours of your life only to feel cynical, angry and empty all at the same time. This is no American Classic it is an American Tragedy at best. For some reasons many years ago I opted not to go see this movie as a teenager even though my entire family and some friends all went into the theatre together for the same showing on opening weekend. As I went several rooms over to watch \\"Wolf\\" starring Jack Nicholson to a near empty theatre and thought I was missing out on pop culture history perhaps.. Years later I watched Forrest Gump numerous times on tv, cable and video, and realized I wasglad I never saw it on the big screen. In closing for this review then I'll give some advice based on my experience. If your thinking about buying this movie, go buy Wolf on dvd instead. Trust me you'll be a hell of lot happier and not depressed afterwards.

0783229364|5.0|Michael J Fox stars in this fast paced 80's classic titled The Secret Of My Success, and it's no secret as to why Fox captures the hearts and captivates people whether on the small screen or big screen. In this movie Fox plays Brantley Foster a bright eyed bushy tailed kid from a farm in the midwest who starts the movie by hyping up to his parents his dreams and desires of making it big in New York City. The movie waste little time in showing Fox as he makes the transition to living in the big city even after his first job which he went to NYC in the first place for falls apart before walks in the door.Brantley must then do what an  aspiring yuppie from the 1980's would do. Network and promote himself anyway possible to get a job. After repeated failed attempts Brantley winds up at the offices of his uncle who is the head of a major coporation. After throwing his charm around. A knack that Fox uses and gives to his character throught the movie, he is able to work his way up the ladder after his uncle gives him a measly mailboy job. Of course Brantley's aspirations are much bigger then this and comedy ensues. Not to mention a love triangle or is it a love square? Helen Slater. Best known for other 80's movies such as Supergirl and The Legend Of Billie Jean plays Fox's to the books business chic looking love interest who Fox evetually charms as well. It says alot about Michael J. Fox that he is able to bring a likablitly even to a character that is yuppie in the 1980's. In fact there seems to be a theme in the movie that Fox's character Brantley Foster seems to charm everyone he comes across, and everyone likes him. From his aunt, to his secretery to his peers to even the dreamgirl who has no time for love. Michael J Fox's other works in the 80's such as Back To The Future and Teen Wolf might be more notable or popular but in my opinion The Secret Of My Succes is probably one of the best movies Michael J Fox has made. If you loved Fox as Alex P Keaton in Family Ties this movie is the perfect supplement to that. It's original enough and funny enough to keep you capitivated the entire ride.Plus has enough plot twist that will keep you wondering what will happen next all while making you laugh. But it is familiar enough as well that you will instantly feel like perhaps your getting a glimpse into what it would had been like had Alex P Keaton went to NYC and got his big break. It really is no secret then to this movies success and watchablity. It's Michael J Fox's funny and likable performance. The supporting cast only add to this. Helen Slater brings the perfect balance to the no nonsense all work type girl who eveuntally let's her guard down and opens her heart to the right guy. Definetly a feel good movie and it perfectly captures the hustle and bustle and yuppie capitalism that was so transparently widespread in the 1980's
B001453LSI|5.0|The only problem with Melody Gardot, is she seems to be a one-of-a-kind and she's not producing music nearly fast enough to suit me. There is something very special about the songs she writes and the way she sings them and the band she has is top-notch.    If you enjoy complex jazz melodies, and rich vocals, you will love this album.

0385528752|5.0|This book is great follow-on to Made-to-Stick.  If you're like me, you have too much to read and not enough time.  This book is definitely worth the time.  It had me hooked after I had read only a few pages.      After reading just the first chapters you will already have new ideas on how to identify & overcome barriers to change, both in your personal and professional life. Some of the ideas I couldn't wait to use with my kids.  As Heath & Heath offer positive approaches to instituting change, there is no downside to experimenting with their ideas.      For example, if your child is getting good grades in every subject but one, you tend to focus on the one, rather than trying to figure out why he/she excels in the others.  I'm looking forward to using the ideas at work at well.  The company I work for is ungoing a merger and there is much need to trigger change.      Another strength of the book is that it follows the Made-to-stick approach, i.e., you'll remember most of what you read.  Once I started the book, I used examples from it in daily conversations with many many colleagues.  You'll find reading it a valuable investment of time that pays many dividends.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|Love how HBO has brought Dead Until Dark to life. Great characters. Anna Paquin is the perfect choice for Sookie. Love watching a show with a strong lead heroine who doesn't look plastic. The extras ae vastly entertaining as well. A mockumentary about life as a vampire is worth watching.

B002WCLG3O|1.0|I just got through watching this and honestly I am so upset I can't return it for a refund.  I started it last night but couldn't even make it half way through before I shut if off.  I forced myself to watch the second half expecting it to get better and well...it did, but barely.  As a little perspective from where I cam coming from; I have all but the original Halo game and I love the franchise so they really could have given me a mediocre product and I would have been happy.  However, this is just bad.     My last purchase like this was Batman: Gotham Knight and I thought that it was an excellent product and was hoping this would be similar...wrong.    I will discuss each episode with NO spoilers so feel free to read on.    Origin I & II (Score 1.5/5):   They are just a retelling of the Halo story thus far.  They were just a summary and at first I thought I was watching the special feature Halo: The Story So Far which Origin I & II were except they missed some pretty big points.  I agree with another poster that many of creators clearly have never played or knew very much about Halo.  The story also contained a ridiculous amount of forced melancholy.    The Duel (Score 0/5):   This is one of the worst things I have ever watched.  O.K. the animation style was annoying but they tried something original and I will give them credit for that...Yes, even with the credit for the animation they only got a zero.  Without it they would have gotten negative points.  This story could not have been \\"phoned in\\" any more.  It could not have been more unoriginal or derivative (but not in a good way) and could not have been more stereotypical of a \\"Eastern\\" inspired production.  Take every single annoying Asian story stereotype put them together with some blurry water colors and you have \\"The Duel.\\"  This was stereotypical even down to the giggling female character.  Why was she giggling?  The scene didn't even call for it.  If I was more P.C. I would say it was even insulting.Believe me this is not a spoiler.    Homecoming (Score 2/5)   This was typical Japanese anime; some cool action but poorly written, over-the-top, untouching, emotional scenes that really were lacked any verisimilitude.    Odd Man Out (Score 0.5/5):   If you liked DragonBallz you may like this but I doubt it.  This was written for VERY young children.  There was a Tyrannosaurus Rex in this...seriously need I say any more?    Prototype (Score 2.5/5)   This could have been good.  It started well and was getting some emotion and attachment until...another walking Japanese stereotype.  Completely ridiculous in the Halo story line.  Hey if the UNSC can make those how are they losing this war?    The Babysitter (Score 3.4/5)   This also started off well and was o.k.  If all of the stories were like this I would not have considered the purchase a total waste.  The problem here is that they eluded to some problems between the ODST and Spartans but never do anything with it.  The best thing that I can say about this is that it really could have been MUCH better which means it had a lot of unrealized potential which is still better than anything previous.    The Package (Score 3.75/5)   Clearly, the artist that knew Halo the best.  The shots inside the helmets of the Spartans were really well done and this does the best job of making you feel like you are in the game.  They had problems with animating characters' lips during speaking but that isn't really an issue with the Spartans (because of their helmets) that have most of the screen time.  The story was nothing special and you really did not feel any loss.  Still the best of the bunch and a good outing for a straight to DVD production.  This story did not have the potential that Babysitter had but it got closer to realizing its potential.
B001GCUO5M|2.0|Take a brilliant director Martian Scorsese (Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Cape Fear,) Mix in an outstanding cast, Leonardo DiCaprio, (Titanic, Blood Diamond,) Ben Kingsley (Schindler's List, Gandhi) Mark Ruffalo, (Reservation Road, Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind) and Michelle Williams, (Brokeback Mountain) and one instantly concludes Paramount Pictures likely has another iconic hit movie in \\"Shutter Island.\\"     Filmed in Massachusetts around my neck of the woods, Shutter Island is the tale about the disappearance of a criminal insane patient. Federal Agents (DiCaprio) and partner (Ruffalo) are sent to this factitional island off the cost of Boston to investigate. DiCaprio's character soon finds the search is on for two missing patients, discovering one missing patient is not listed on the hospital roster.    The whole scenario would seem to make for an intense wild ride in this quote advertized \\"mysterious psychological thriller.\\" In reality, \\"Shutter Island\\" may have been best pushed off the island cliffs into the deepest part of the Atlantic, all the way to Davey Jones' locker.     Through the first half hour plus a \\"Jaws\\" like theme plays but nothing happens that warrants the unending annoying scary music. The soundtrack is also so loud it is a distraction to the dialog of the movie. However, this mismatched music score does not turn out to be such a bad thing when I realized the entire movie is nothing but one line of dialog after another. The dialog never stops. Shutter Island is all talk, talk, talk, and more talk with no action. I personally became so tired of the continuous rambling dialog, I thought about hanging myself in the movie theater just to escape Shutter Island myself.     In less than a half hour I already knew the probable ending to \\"Shutter Island.\\" I thought to myself, \\"self, the movie just can't be that lame and simple,\\" but it was. I \\"shutter\\" to think this movie made it off the shelf.     I read Paramount did not have money to promote the film for its original release date in 09 causing a delay till February, 2010. Paramount broke? I searched the internet looking for articles which suggest Paramount Studios is broke. I found no such articles. Maybe the truth is Paramount executives watched a preview of \\"Shutter Island\\" and decided they should all disappear too, rather to face the music.    This so called \\"thriller\\" is no thrill. The mystery of \\"Shutter Island\\" is quickly discovered by any average movie goer. If however you are a fan of mismatched music scores, cameras that pan to quickly and people who talk a blue streak and another blue streak and yet another and another, so on and so on, this movie may be just what you are looking for. Otherwise, just like the Bismarck in World War II, someone should put \\"Shutter Island\\" out of it misery and sink it, or sent it to the island of misfit movies.
0375842209|4.0|This thrilling tale by Markus Zusak is told in the perspective of death. In the beginning Liesel's little brother dies. She then steals her first book,The Grave Diggers Handbook. As I read the book I felt like Death was responsive. It gave a different effect on the typical view of death, as shallow and unconcerned. This book shows that death can still be compassionate. Liesel Meminger is not your normal teenager. She has to go through more than just schoolwork, and boys. She is struggling with a Jew in her basement and delivering laundry to the Mayor's wife. Her friend Rudy is pretending to be Jesse Owens and she steals books from her neighbors. It is a thrilling tale and you should definetely read it.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I watched this movie last night on HBO.  This was an outstanding movie at many levels.  What struck me most intensely was the thought of what could have been.  Temple is old enough where her life and contributions might have been diverted into a dark place of institutional placements.  The movie did a wonderful job of showing her strengths and weaknesses (smacking a teasing bully who deserved it).  Yet, that alone could have brought her significant, negative attention with a corresponding nasty outcome.   It was clear that people who saw her gifts allowed Temple the thrills and satisfaction of self expression.  Her ability to see things normal brains do not see is extraordinary to learn about.  The changes in her chosen (cattle) industry were significant because she saw the world so differently.  Things done a certain way for decades and decades take a very powerful force to cause change.  As a society we stopped institutionalization for people with differences.  One wonders how many Temple Grandin's did not escape that dehumanized fate.  The movie makes you consider how many other systems we take for granted that could use a Temple Grandin approach to trying another way.
B002X9GX4S|5.0|Alesana has put out yet another great album.  I love the cohesion in this one, the whole thing comes together amazingly well to tell the story.  My favorite album to date :-)
B002XTBE6K|5.0|Quite honestly, the previous adaptations of Emma were fair, at best.  To watch them alongside the various adaptations of the other Jane Austen novels, I would place Emma dead last in a list of favorites.  Gwyneth Paltrow even put me to sleep.  But this new BBC version is so far beyond the other attempts, I would place it up there with Sense and Sensibility, just behind Pride and Prejudice.  Let's face it, nothing will ever match the BBC version of Pride and Prejudice.  But this one is highly entertaining through and through.  Highest marks for cast, scenery and music.
0061537969|5.0|I was skeptical about this book...what in the world would a dog have to say? This is the best book I have read this year! The story is moving, funny and insightful. Enzo the dog has an excellent and hysterical point of view. I loved this book, even though I am not a big racing fan. I loved the way Garth Stein relates racing to real life. A must read!

0451450523|5.0|I remember watching the animated version of \\"The Last Unicorn\\" when I was a child. Back then, it was my all-time favorite movie, and I must say that it is still my favorite animated movie.    When I found out that the movie was actually based on a book, I was very excited and bought the book right away. I must say that it was well worth the purchase; even the first paragraph sucked me in and kept me reading for hours.    The book is extremely well-written and the characters are very likable. Beagle does go a bit heavy on the sensory details, and normally this would bother me. However, he uses it so well and so effectively that it didn't bother me at all. Rather, it put me right into the story and made it that much more enjoyable to read.    I would certainly recommend this book (and the movie) to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy.
B002BW7A58|4.0|to all of you looking for \\"rap\\" please expand your minds. i am by no way a die hard wayne fan, but over the last three years i must say he has been on a rampage to solidify his place as one of the greats.    having said that, please understand what he did here that has truly not been done. he took hard core rap, his style and bridged it with americas past time, ROCK. I don't care how much autotune is there, the concept is nothing short of brilliant and anytime you can sell the lyric \\"coke boy with a guitar\\" you've done it.     As for his ability to play the guitar or lack thereof, get real people. he's not slash, hendrix, or any of those that could shred before him. He's an entertainer first and foremost and he entertained the hell out of this album.
0061703257|2.0|What a total disappointment.  This book was exciting, even captivating until the end.  Then it became a major let down.  I wont spoil it for you, but I suggest stopping at the end of chapter 20 and making up the ending yourself.<br /><br />Another thing about this book that I did not enjoy was the authors severe lack of vocabulary.  Why do so many authors these days feel they need to drop the \\"f-bomb\\" everywhere.  Mr. Lehane apparently thinks it is a very useful word because it is everywhere in this book.<br />The use of this word did not help build characters, help move the plot, or add anything useful to the story.  Poor writing in my opinion.<br /><br />Also, this is not a book for kids.  The author chooses to throw random x-rated sexual memories into the story that are a waste of printed letters at best.<br /><br />Too bad the ending was so terrible, even with the other shortcomings mentioned above this could have been a great read.  Instead it was a great build up to a disappointing ending that left me wishing I had stopped at chapter 20.

0553593544|5.0|This is my first Robert Ludlum book, and I have to say I enjoyed it a lot. I like this book for several reasons. Firstly, it's interesting. Bourne is a man who's on more than one \\"Wanted\\" list, and yet he has no idea why. He travels the world searching for the answer to a question that's simple to seemingly anyone but him--who am I?     Secondly, you learn to love the characters. Jason's companion is the witty Marie St. Jacques, a member of the Canadian government who's eager to help him in recovering his memory. And Jason himself is probably the most complex character in the book. When he fights, he hears phrases in his head that he's never heard before--and when he sees a person's face, memories flood his mind. Simply reading, you're experiencing what he's going through. When he's in danger I'm so distressed I have to skip ahead, find out if he's actually okay, and then go back to read what I missed!    Thirdly, it's very well written. At points it gets so amazingly detailed that my head hurts trying to comprehend what the author is describing, but at other times it's very helpful in understanding the story line. The characters are so well described that by the end of the book you feel like you know them, and the plot is completely unpredictable.    I can't think of anything else I didn't like about this book besides from the fact that it's a little too detailed. Its plot is amazing, even though sometimes it's a tad confusing, and definitely can't be copied unless someone got sued...! Robert Ludlum did an amazing job writing this book, and I can hardly wait to read the next one.
B002PEP4EG|4.0|Overall, an interesting read.  The book focuses on a human-centered approach to design and problem solving.  A large emphasis is on the use of participant observation and other social anthropological research methodologies (e.g. want to improve the experience of air travelers?  follow a bunch around from the minute they leave their house until they leave their destination's airport).  Furthermore, the book places a great deal of emphasis on seeking out outliers rather than the \\"average\\" customer or user--the idea being that observing extreme users can yield very interesting insights into functionality and user needs, some of which would remain unknown if you just focused on average users.  Finally, the book suggests ways for all sorts of business to create environments that lend themselves to innovation and ideation by incorporating some of the lessons of designers and design thinkers.  Even business service firms can benefit from a research and development approach akin to some of the world's leading consumer goods companies (e.g. Proctor & Gamble).  The book certainly could have been shorter--too many random examples and way too much of what seemed like a forces tie-in with environmentalism--but overall a thought provoking read.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|I'd only heard about this show and thought it might be good as I'd like some of the music David Foster has been involved with.  What a fantastic show this was and I only wished i'd been able to see it in person - bit too far to travel for one show from Australia.  Highly recommend this blu-ray to all - hope another show follows at some stage in this man's fantasitc career.
0307454541|5.0|An amazing book--wonderful characters and a fascinating mystery, two actually.  The book is a little long in a few spots, but the overall story more than makes up for it.  Reminded me of a Caleb Carr novel, but in a modern setting.  Highly recommended, can't wait to read the others in the series.

B001NLKT60|4.0|Another amazing book by Larsson.  In some ways a typical bridge story in a trilogy, but an exhilarating thrill ride to be sure.  Lisbeth Salander is one of the most intriguing characters to come along in quite some time.  Eagerly awaiting the third installment.
B000WAEJZ0|5.0|Great to hear her music again before the brown influence...shoulda...woulda been the best female voice since Barbara...great mix of her best...
0307473708|5.0|A brilliant novel that I must say I came into contact because of the show, but after reading this I believe these books to be far superior.  Lindsay writes with such economy because that's the way the character lives his life and the entire book is from his perspective.  The world outlook, and way of life is meticulous, structures and no-nonsense.  It gives the book a smooth and effortless quality because you get the sense Dexter spent his younger years fast tracking his path into this life.      For the uninitiated who hear the surface of what this story is about, the appeal is two-fold.  The story functions as a mystery with a horrific twist of him being a murderer himself.  What's appealing beyond the mystery is how funny Dexter is and how normal his thoughts are, it's just the lengths to which he reconciles them that is disturbing. For this reason, it does fall on the edge of fiction, but reveals how logical the path to murder can be (for some).  Along with Bradley Denton's book, Blackburn, Lindsay shows us a murderer who we find human, and although cold, is still sympathetic because he recognizes the importance of society...and feels that he fits in somewhere on the fringe and contributes something important to it.  It's no doubt that the series is so well thought-of because the character has been so clearly presented here.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|We've seen so many thrillers in which the threat comes from something unnatural, be it a ghost, a zombie, or a masked serial killer that cannot himself be killed. This is partly why \\"Frozen\\" is such a refreshing experience - nature itself is the threat. Human beings are capable of withstanding a great deal, but there's always a breaking point, and this movie does a pretty good job of searching for it. It begs the question: What would you do if you found yourself in a similar situation? Is there anything that could be done? Or is it merely a matter of waiting to die? For something that very easily could have been a mindless shock fest, \\"Frozen\\" is instead an effective story where suspense builds from a fairly plausible situation.    As far as the plot is concerned, there isn't all that much to describe. In fact, it can all be summed up in one sentence: At a mountain resort, three college kids struggle to survive when they're left stranded on a ski lift. Everything depends on how the plot advances, and this includes character development, which is surprisingly strong. Dan (Kevin Zegers) and Lynch (Shawn Ashmore) have been friends since the first grade. Because of Dan's new girlfriend, Parker (Emma Bell), Lynch now feels that their friendship is in jeopardy; their skiing trips have traditionally been a Guys Only thing, and yet here she is, tagging along. For the first twenty minutes or so, Lynch repeatedly tells Parker, as nicely as possible, that she's in the way.    Hoping to get in one last hill before the ski lift closes for the night, the three smooth-talk their way onto the ski lift. Unfortunately, there are two lift operators, and the second one doesn't realize that the three skiers who have just descended are not the same three currently ascending the mountain. The lift is subsequently switched off. Dangling above a snowy slope on a bleak winter night, Dan, Lynch, and Parker remember, with horrific clarity, that the resort will remain closed for an entire week.You can probably imagine what they now must face. Obviously, the cold, which quickly leads to frostbite in spite of their warm clothing. There's also the heat of the midday sun, which will probably lead to sunburn. And that howling off in the distance? I can assure you that it isn't coming from rescue dogs. So what can Dan, Lynch, and Parker do? Shout for help? Try to pull themselves across the sharp wire carrying the suspended chairs? Jump off and hope they don't break their legs? Throw their ski equipment to get someone's attention? Lose control altogether? Take your pick. No matter what they decide to do, it sure as hell won't be easy.    Had the characters not been properly developed, there would be no conceivable way to successfully make this last for just over ninety minutes. Writer/director Adam Green, who had previously directed the slasher homage \\"Hatchet,\\" goes in the right direction by giving each of the three leads some well worded dialogue, most of which focuses on memories and primal emotional outbursts. There are some good moments between Parker and Lynch, who eventually understand that hating one another will get them nowhere. One of the best scenes shows Parker tearfully panicking over the fate of her new puppy, who was left alone in her apartment. Stupid, you say? What would you think about if you were in her place? Exactly.    If there is a weakness to \\"Frozen,\\" it's that some of the suspense is wasted on scenes of overbearing makeup effects, which I can't describe for fear of spoiling the plot. What I will say is that movies like this work so much better when it relies on psychological horror; the idea of falling off, of freezing, of being attacked, of losing your balance, etc. is always more effective than seeing it. Of course, there would be no resolution if nothing physical happened, so maybe it's a moot point. Regardless, I felt the human scenes were stronger than the action scenes, where the characters were reduced to little more than infernal screamers.    The long and short of it is that \\"Frozen\\" is better than I thought it was going to be. In an age when horror movies are about little more than young people dying elaborate deaths, I realized that I actually cared about these skiers and what was happening to them. While it occasionally falls victim to conventional thriller tactics, it still tries for something more, getting under your skin not through visuals so much as through the overall situation. The idea of being left alone in a hostile environment with no resources is genuinely frightening. The idea of zombies eating your brains? Fun, maybe, but certainly not frightening. There's no chance of that happening in real life, despite Max Brooks' evidence to the contrary.
0810993139|1.0|Each parent needs to decide whether or not to let their child read these books.  The humor is crude, the attitude of the main character is marginal, and there are many examples of children not behaving appropriately, especially in the school setting.  The books are funny to the 7-10 age group, and if these books get the reluctant reader reading, then good.  If your child is simply looking for a good read, remember the classics:  Henry and Ribsy, Ramona Quimby, The Mouse and the Motorcycle.  Bottom line: there is better quality reading material out there.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|This is a movie I only need to see once.  It was fairly predictable, an annoying lead character who I could care less about, and stereotypical charictures of cat food dealing thugs. When it comes to brilliant sci-fi films, I think Alien and Blade Runner, District 9 suffers from the desperation of original ideas and creativity and is part of a new generation of really bad movies.  Why watch this when you can watch more mystical and magical movies of the genre that have beautiful cinematography and offer you an escape.  There were times when I thought this was a boderline comedy, not that any of the intended jokes were funny in my oppinion.  District 9 was a hot mess to watch and I would never buy this trash yet alone watch it ever again.

Yes one can always opine that this soundtrack has a familiar sound to it and is reminiscent of James Horner's other works, but for me, this music has become immortalized in the movie and when I listen to this soundtrack, it brings to memory the passion, emotion, depth, and imagination of the film and I began to relive every single moment of the movie all over again. This was definitely money well spent. And as for the movie, well, one might always quip that the story was rather simple, perhaps unoriginal, and whatever else one might argue, but I say that this story has never been told in such a remarkable way before. This movie and music is an immersive, sensory enhanced paradise!!!!!!!
B00288KNL8|2.0|I gave this movie 2 stars only because it had a decent story line. That said it was too scary for younger children and a bit over there heads. The most disturbing thing is the 70 years old lady dressed like a stripper!! She is all but naked with a bathing suit bottom and nipple covers (and nothing I mean nothing else) on her size double ZZ breast. Why would any decent person put that in a child's movie!!! Why am I the only person who even found it disturbing? Please protect your kids from this. I am so sorry I did not cheick it out on [...] before watching it with my kids. It ruined the whole movie.
B000JQU4TW|2.0|I'm reading this for Book Club and I try not to put it down -- because I'm afraid I won't pick it up again!  While I see how good the story is, I'm sorry to admit that I find the author buffoonish in the way he goes on and on about some things -- I get the point!  I know that some of it comes down to the fact that the  book was written in 1891, but  I've read Greek plays, other authors from different eras, etc., and liked them, so maybe I just don't appreciate Oscar Wilde.

I did read EatPrayLove, and although the writer is so whiny that she is impossible to like, I did finish that one.     I find it so rich that the woman who bashed our country and our president to anyone who would listen in her first book, would suddenly find that good old United States is the only place she and her foreign husband are willing to live. I guess the USA isn't so bad after all is it?
B0027BOL4G|1.0|After reading Michael Pollan's books, which are so well researched and complete, I was looking forward to viewing Food, Inc.  I was sorely disappointed.  The film is biased, when it needn't be, incomplete and poorly executed.  For example, we see the grass farmer slaughtering his chickens, but in the Ominivore's Dilemma, this grass farmer is much more that someone who raises grass-fed chickens.  He raises an entire eco-system, one that should be discussed and promoted.  He also raises cattle and pigs, but his prohibited from slaughtering those animals on his farm.  This is never mentioned.  His story and the way that he farms is so much more interesting than the entire Food, Inc. film.  In so many scenes, I was saying to myself, \\"Yes, but . . . \\"  Yes, but that thought is incomplete, yes, but you could say so much more, yes, but what about this fact or that fact.  Essentially, Food, Inc. is lazy and superficial in fact and form; it is the People Magazine version of the Omnivore's Dilemma.  It will turn off people who it is meant to appeal to and others will simple render it a poorly done polemic.  A much better film is \\"The Future of Food\\".
B001EOOQEC|5.0|i remember when i 1st heard this album it was when it 1st came out and i was in school at the time and i had a hard time to go to the capital to buy it so i asked a pal of mine to buy and that pal had a religion restriction in buying music in general but a rock album thats twice hard i had a long long conversations with the dude till i had convinced him - how was that you might ask .. well i asked the dude to stand by the door and hand the guy in the music shop the piece of paper and money and say that he cant find a place for the car and the dude went with my trick which is a lie so the super religious dude lied and committed a sin just cause his afraid that someone from his cult might see him in the shop - i found out that the fear my pal had was from someone that might see him and tell others about him being in a music store then the music it self, i just cant understand why is it that some parents raise their children  on fear and not on understanding .. anyway all the hard work that i had to do and the hard earned money that i have spent was worth it - here i'm 18yrs later and just bought this album remastered and i'm sure i will enjoy it<br />i'm a hugh dio fan and i like dio solo albums as much as i dig his rainbow and black sabbath albums in my opinion dio is better then ozzy - no disrespect but ozzy always had the same vocal range while dio have 3 differ ranges atleast - sorry but english my 2nd language and i cant explain this part.<br />the guitar work from tony top of the bill - this is the best lineup<br />it was great that they have reunited now-days and made heaven and hell (band)
1593078684|5.0|This book is amazing. It has many illustrations that I've never seen before and that I can guarantee won't be found by simply sifting around online. Besides, it's very reasonably priced and well worth it.    There is a generous amount of colored work, all in that very familiar, very endearing Amano style that I love. Granted, his work (to me) is either the best thing I've ever seen, or very mediocre. I'm sure someone knows these style variations I'm referring to. Anyway, to those that understand, this book is gold. But, as it is a compilation of concept art for the first four installations of the Final Fantasy series, it's main focuse is on character and monster design.     What I particularly love about this book is the way that I can just prop it up when I'm working on my art school homework, and it pretty much acts as an infinite source of inspiration. That, and for my inner geek, it comes with a fabulous little index (in English) that names each character/monster/what have you and what page they are on.

B002APNQEU|4.0|Sorry but after slide it in Whitesnake<br />was never the same. 87' album was much<br />better as  Sykes fit in better but<br />the slide it in line up was best ever!<br />of course Coverdale is great & some<br />material is awesome but most is just<br />not the best & I bought this for the<br />bonus tracks and videos. Vai as great<br />as he is did not fit & it's almost<br />unbearable to listen to these solos<br />of speed if your not impressed by<br />that sort of thing. I'm not. I think<br />Coverdale is great as he proved with<br />the new Whitesnake lineup and album<br />Bad to the Bone so if your looking<br />where to start I say anything from<br />the early days to slide it in then<br />the new album. Whitesnake is still<br />great but this wasn't the best.
0312935080|5.0|So far this has been my favorite Harry Bosch novel to date and I like them all immensely. In this novel not only do you get your usual police work that you come to expect from this series but you also get some courtroom drama as Harry is on trial for violating a killers civil rights.  Michael Connelly is really developing the Harry Bosch character expertly and I find the books impossible to put down.  I like these books so much that I really dread the day that catch up with the series or Michael Connelly decides to end it.  In the meantime if you are looking for a well written engrossing police procedural, check out the Harry Bosch series.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|This movie took me by surprise as I was unaware of Beatrix Potter's life story. What a gentle yet strong woman who was much ahead of her time in Victorian England where young women were supposed to do as they were told and marry according to their parents will. Beatrix, to her credit, abhorred the pomposity of this tradition and chose to live her life her way. What ensues will enchant and amaze you as you realize this is a true story. And I was so impressed with how she chose to live her later life through conservation and giving back to her countrymen a portion of England that they can be proud of for many generations to come. A truly remarkable woman that we can all learn from and admire.Both Renee Zellweger and Ewan McGregor give beautiful performances and have a certain chemistry on screen that takes us to another place in time.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|These triggers definitely work.  They create more stability on the R2/L2 buttons of the PS3.  There will no longer be a chance where your fingers will slip off them, especially in games where the buttons need to be pressed for extended periods of time.  They also provide faster access to the buttons in FPS's, since they sit a little higher than the normal buttons do.<br /><br />They're kind of hard to get on initially, but once you get one on, the other one is very easy.  Mine have yet to fall off, and I've dropped my controller several times since.<br /><br />Overall, they work as advertised.  The triggers themselves are not worth $5.00 (more like 20 cents), but you'll definitely get more than $5.00 of use out of them.  They're sturdy, durable, and natural.
B000NQR7NO|5.0|Artic Monkeys rawk! Saw them at Coachella and bought their music- I love all of it!
B001IMFHTS|5.0|This Abbado/Beethoven cycle has been repackaged and is available at a bargain price. I would snap it up as it is generally a superb set. Symphonies 1-8 were filmed at live concerts in Rome. Abbado has a scaled down orchestra and these performances are lithe and vigorous. I cannot think of any of the eight that are not excellent interpretations. My surprize was the Seventh, the work I heard last. Taken at a generally brisk pace, is an absolute knockout; it should have you moving around with the music. The sound and filming qualities are quite satisfactory.<br /><br />The set concludes with a Ninth that was recorded in Berlin. Unfortunately this performance seems quite flat and uninspired; certainly well below the elevated Rome standard. Given the excellence of Symphonies 1-8 one can still confidently acquire this very reasonably priced cycle. I have returned to it on many occasions with undiminished pleasure.
B002WY65VU|2.0|The best thing \\"Zombieland\\" has going for it are the enjoyable performances of Harrelson and to a lesser extent Eisenberg.  Harrelson has never been more fun as the zombie slaying outlaw cowboy Tallahassee, convincingly crazed eyed and brash he easily generates most of the movie's best laughs single handedly.  Meanwhile Eisenberg`s stuttering sincere \\"every-nerd\\" shtick is genuinely likable and his anti-heroic  paranoia fueled survival through the film's more successful first act produces the movie's most unique and best executed set pieces.  The supporting girls, Stone and Breslin, are unfortunately not quite as enjoyable in dry but solid performances, they are just so obnoxiously written and predictable you may find yourself wishing for their horrible deaths by the film's end.     However, \\"Zombieland's\\" true failing is novice director, Rubin Fleischer, who doesn't really get the most out of his moderate budget.   He manages to add some stylish color by flashing the \\"zombieland survival rules\\" on the screen at key points and there's some cute narration not common to the genre; but overall this is one seriously dull production. Regrettably, his vision of Apocalyptic Americana doesn't extend beyond  stale direct to DVD standbys such as  non-descript deserted gas stations,  deserted amusement parks, deserted deserted roads, ...you get the idea, while the much hyped \\"creative\\" kills of the film's unforgivably bland zombies fall well short of the genre standard.  Fans of zombie chaos, fun or horrifying, won't find much to get excited about.    Outside of a fun but all too brief stop in a supermarket, the small scale action sequences are fairly subpar for a theatrical film with a noticeable lack of suspense; by the time of the film's climax everything is just so easy and of little consequence for our heroes that it becomes a labor to stay engaged. It is also worth noting that the overall tone is incredibly light as even the more serious moments are weightless and easilyzoomed past..  This is a light cornball comedy and target audience fans of recent zombie/comedy blockbuster \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" may be expecting something with a little more meat on its bones, or something that gets more milage out of the premise like Peter Jackson's cute gory romantic comedy \\"Dead Alive.\\"  Ultimately, Harrelson's delightfully mad performance and a goofy but chuckle producing cameo I won't spoil is the only thing saving this movie from a Sci-Fi Channel exclusive premiere.

B000KX0IOA|5.0|I loved this film, which I knew I would as I saw it in a theater when it came out, and Gandhi is one of my all time favorite people. (To bad they didn't do a four hour or ten hour :-) director's cut.)    What made this DVD wonderful for me were the featurettes and inteview with Ben Kingsley. I learned a lot more about the filming which was entertaining and informative in its own right. Parts were even moving.    The best $10.49 I ever spent.

0446619078|5.0|Did you notice 61 five star ratings before mine?.  Michael Connlley sets a standard with Harry Bosch, a detective's detective. Consistantly good novels make it hard not to read the whole set, but start at the beginning and work your way here to #4, THE LAST COYOTE.  Court room drama of the third novel is replaced by great detective work by a suspended Harry Bosch, he put his commanding officer's head through a window.  With time to spare Bosch investigates his mother's murder that is over thirty years old.  This investigation leads to political connections and lots of suspects, and all this time Harry must keep seeing the LAPD shrink, Carmen Hinojo to get clear to go back to work.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Looking forward to TRUNK MUSIC

0805091742|5.0|We manage know-how in many ways, and in a complex and dynamic world, we operate with the constant risk of serious errors and mistakes. Gawande provides a surgeon's view of risk avoidance and management with checklists.    Checklists are used in everything from aviation to athletics, and in their best form and application, they help us get things right by:    * Preparing for routine and complex activity, events  * Framing the risks ahead and how to manage them  * Engaging the team in disciplined and ready practice  * Connecting processes, methods, culture and assets  * Dispersing power to the people who are involved  * Bringing new ideas into the collective knowledge base  * Managing processes for speed, clarity and response  * Advancing vigilance, attention, judgment and humility    Doing things right improves outcomes, prevents errors, reduces risks, catches problems, patches solutions, conserves assets and balances stress. This framework of checklists will be confirming for process managers and affirming for analytic types, but there is more to the equation. The author considers systems analysis/dynamics and the science of problem solving, referencing simple, complicated and complex problems and their management. He also references the fallibility of humans as they apply knowledge and judgment in everyday work. Human behavior needs the support of checklists, plain and simple.    Checklists are required for success. That statement is at the heart of the author's argument. They guide better, smarter, faster thought and action. They enable and engage individuals and teams. And they provide the chemistry that connects foresight, insight, learning and judgment in routine and complex procedures. Checklists help land planes on the Hudson River. They help win Super Bowls. They help qualify investments. They provide for safe construction. And they are a key driver for quality and value in healthcare. What stands out in every realm is really very basic... checklists help connect teams in ways that enhance thought and action, which in turn, advance outcomes and impact.   Brilliant.
0446580945|5.0|This is my favorite by Nicholas Sparks. Mainly because this story is the story of mine and my husband's life. We met and fell in love in North Carolina as well. However, it was Fort Bragg, not Wilmington. He is in the Army. Got stationed in Germany, left me behind then got deployed. Of course there are a few differences, I don't want to ruin the book for anyone. The ending yes, is less than ideal. But it's realistic. This is a fantastic book, like all of his others.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is what the creators heard in the studio when they made these records. It is comparable to the restoration of the Sistine Chapel. All of the sudden there are colors and shades we never knew existed. Remeber, by the time we got to hear these records when they were released in America they had been compressed, altered, compressed again, and were nothing like what you hear in this boxed set. You here all the subtleties that have been lost all these years. It is simply amazing and a must have for Beatle fans old or new.

They are so funny, cause if you own a cat, you know they are true!  If you need a gift for a cat lover, they will love you forever for sharing this book with them.

B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Michael Dorsey is an unemployed actor with an impossible reputation. In order to find work and fund his friend's play he dresses as a woman, Dorothy Michaels, and lands the part in a daytime drama. Dorsey loses himself in this woman role and essentially becomes Dorothy Michaels, captivating women all around the city and inspiring them to break free from the control of men and become more like Dorsey's initial identity. This newfound role, however, lands Dorsey in a hot spot between a female friend/lover, a female co-star he falls in love with, that co-star's father who falls in love with him, and a male co-star who yearns for his affection. Dustin Hoffman is pure genius in this movie. \\"Tootsie\\" is a small masterpiece of intelligent comedy, full of emotions, love and interesting observations about the relationship between women and men.
B0027BOL4G|4.0|Although highly informative and essential viewing for those interested in where, how and what's going on with the food that lands on their dinner table, FOOD, INC. follows in the footsteps (often lockstep) of another interesting treatise on American corporate food culture, [[ASIN:B000V5IOWK The Future of Food]].<br /><br />Essentially, The Future of Food focused more directly on the Monsanto Company and how the first patent on a living thing (seeds) has changed the face of agriculture. Food, Inc. similarly rehashes this theme and includes the same information regarding Monsanto's strong arm tactics in keeping their patented seeds out of the hands of farmers who haven't purchased it. The problem, though, is you can't control the wind, and when seeds fall off trucks, or a few fly from one field to another, there's no way farmers can control it. And this is where Monsanto has done the unthinkable: they've built a group of strongmen attorneys to go after those farmers who's crops show Monsanto seeds, but haven't purchased them (nor tried to steal them, I might add). This strong arming has resulted in farmers being dragged through the court system at tremendous expense. And when you're David fighting Goliath, the odds are not in your favor if it takes two years to get to court and your attorney fees begin mounting.<br /><br />But where we begin to diverge in the two films (The Future of Food versus Food, Inc.) is in the meat department. Food, Inc. delves much more into the problems with the mass production of chickens, beef, and pigs (the three main meat staples) and how we've modified these creatures to fit our increasingly bad appetites and diets. Tyson Foods is one of the largest suppliers of chicken meat (you've probably seen their labels at your local store), but did you know that the chicken you're eating was born, grew and slaughtered in less than three months? And that the chicken you're forking into your mouth right now could probably only stand up, taking two or three steps, then collapse into a panting, feathered heap? Do you know why? Watch this film and learn.<br /><br />Another alarming trend is in beef industry where cattle are no longer allowed to graze, but are held in pens, wandering around on piles of manure, and being fed corn. Why? Because corn puts weight on much faster, but it also causes certain intestinal bacteria to flourish and, maybe mutate. Want to know why we've had so many E.Coli outbreaks in the past few decades? Watch this film and connect the dots.<br /><br />The brightest part of this film is that it is NOT anti-meat; it's anti-corporation. Big time. But only when it comes to our food. It wants you to learn why it's so important to shop at your local farmer's market. Why foods that are out of season are out of season FOR A REASON. Why corn has become so pervasive in our diets (and what its doing to our food and, in consequence, to us). Why free-range meat is much better for you (including the bacteria count). It wants to know why you're not asking why.<br /><br />This is a good eye-opener for those who eat at McDonald's every week (or day) and to those of us who shop at Piggly Wiggly or Safeway. Check out the meat before you bite into it.<br /><br />Even though Food, Inc. gave some good (but repetitive) information, it was a bit long. I think the film makers could've gotten away with about 15 minutes less time and made it just as effect in getting its message across. Still, I'm looking more closely at my food, which is what they want you to do.then collapse into a panting, feathered heap? Do you know why? Watch this film and learn.

B002QQ8HAG|3.0|...something very important, and that is THE THIRD DISC.     I am not going to review the movie, but the DVD itself. The extra material is superb. It is fantastic actually, and these are for the true admirers of fashion and VOGUE. Could there be even more? Yeah, sure... They could have included the basic bios of the subjects, more pictures, VOGUE through ages, pivotal photos from the magazine archives, even more footage with the fashion designers and models etc. Still, over 90 minutes of extra material is just great.     But you know what is even greater than this version?     The THREE DISC VERSION that Barnes&Noble has to offer.     This elusive third disc in question includes a 25 minutes of footage from the preparation of the legendary Costume Institute Gala. It is just amazing. You get a lot of Anna here, and no Grace actually. However, you get to witness the MET event preparation including the decor, some peacocks, even Naomi Campbell, Cate Blanchett and Michael Bloomberg, and more of Anna being fashion's true 'Eminence Grise'. Her influence is immense, but this third disc truly proves how prominent she is, outside the high walls of VOGUE or the intimidating fashion shows. amazon.com version of the DVD doesn't include this third disc. I suppose the moviemakers and studio cut a deal with B&N, for an even more special and exclusive release just for them.    I have learned about this edition and got excited. And I went to B&N today, and picked up my copy. It is more expensive than the 2 disc amazon edition -understandably- but so worth it.      Disc I:    Movie  Some extra materials  Production photos      Disc II:    Extra materials (with Anna Wintour, Grace Coddington, Andre Leon Talley, Thakoon etc.)      Disc III:    Footage from Costume Institute Gala preparation/red carpet

B000002UR7|3.0|Before Thom Yorke decided he hated the world and began writing about it, Radiohead debuted with modest rock and roll album in 1993. Granted, it is easy to see that these guys were art-school rockers with some ambition, but the bulk of \\"Pablo Honey\\" mixes punky, Replacements like thrashing with the them coming to prominence of grunge. It's an otherwise inauspicious debut, the dawn of a band.<br /><br />That is, except for the hit. \\"Creep\\" played off the soft-loud-soft-loud grunge blueprint with a heaping dose of pre-hipster self-loathing irony and managed to become a hit on both sides of the Atlantic. \\"You're so f---ing special,\\" moans Yorke as guitarist Johnny Greenwood's stabbing cracks the docile surface, \\"I wish I were special, but I'm a Creep.\\" Despite the fact the the band soon came to loathe the song (on [[ASIN:B000002TQV The Bends]], they slag the success of their hit during \\"My Iron Lung\\"), it did set the tone for much of what Radiohead would develop as a band attitude later.<br /><br />That said, the rest of \\"Pablo Honey\\" has a few gems to be found. The more acoustic based \\"Thinking About You\\" is as plain a song as the band's ever done. \\"Anyone Can Play Guitar\\" is pretty much a fun song, and the time-workout of \\"You\\" is a lot more complicated than it sounds at first blush. Given the incredible path Radiohead would blaze within a few years, \\"Pablo Honey\\" shows a band working to find what eventually would be a unique voice on the alternative rock pantheon.
B000J103OI|5.0|I saw \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\" in the theater the same week I saw Meryl Streep in \\"Prairie Home Companion,\\" which only increased my admiration for her performance in this movie.  The two roles could not have been more different and Miss Streep seemingly without effort appeared before me as two entirely different women (and types of women) in one week.  In my humble opinion, she is still the best actress of her/my generation and I suspect she will be as luminous at 90 as she is today.  Stanley Tucci is wonderful as well as Streep's always loyal, unsung and ultimately done wrong assistant.  If you've been smart enough to follow Tucci's career, then you'll once again appreciate his amazing range as an actor in this not-so-major movie. Anne Hathaway is fine and, yes, talented but I hope she had the humility to walk around this movie set pinching herself and wondering how she got lucky enough to work with these two actors at this early stage of her career.  Any number of young actresses could have played her role.  As for her co-stars, I can't think of any that could have been better.  See this movie but, please, please, see it for the actors that matter.

B00337KM2S|4.0|**contains spoilers**<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, but as someone else said \\"something is missing.\\" As a semi-frequent traveller myself I was interested in the storyline of airports and rental car companies, lines and priority club memberships, but that of course was made more of a backdrop to the main character's relationship with himself and really no one else. I knew we would be set up with a contrite and typical \\"cherish your family and relationships\\" kind of ending so I wasn't surprised by it, but I guess I was still disappointed with it none the less. Another minor criticism is that the movie has kind of a cheap corporate feel to it, like one long commercial for Hertz, American Airlines, and Hilton Hotels.<br /><br />The movie was funny at times and was entertaining, though a bit slow-moving I thought and after waiting for a pay-off, we get the usual contrite ending of \\"cherish your family and relationships.\\" Now that I've said that twice in my review, wouldn't it annoy you if I said it another 3 or 4 times in this review? Well, that's how this movie felt to me - I've heard this all before, so I was annoyed with the film's \\"message.\\"<br /><br />Clooney is good in the role but his acting is not really memorable as it was in say \\"Michael Clayton\\" - I felt he really nailed that character role.  Although I did like the anti-climacticness of him reaching his goal of 10 million lifetime frequent flier miles. This seemed sort of realistic to me. Have you ever had a goal you had set for yourself, and once you reach it, it maybe isn't quite what you expected or it's great, but then it's over and now what? Clooney's characters goal to reach 10 million frequent flier miles was such a part of who he was that \\"going after\\" the goal was really the goal itself. So once he achieved it, it felt a little unremarkable to him, because if he isn't the guy going after that goal, then who is he?<br /><br />I liked his character but even that was a problem because in the end he felt the need to change himself. And over what? Because he got hurt by the first girl he cared about in a long time? At least the film didn't make him fall in love and love conquers all, the end. I was glad when he found out the girl he was into was married. I mean it made sense after all. The way you begin in a relationship says a lot about the relationship. If you are a \\"casual guy\\" as his character was, then you likely will attract those looking for casual relationships. Clooney's character before the girl realized this, and embraced this about himself. Who he became at the end of the film was just another cookie cutter character.<br /><br />**January 2011: I've watched this film three times now and although there are parts of the film I don't like, it is a movie I have enjoyed re-watching and have enjoyed the film more after the 2nd and 3rd viewing.<br /><br />Final Grade: BAnd over what?

B000RW3VD4|3.0|Director Oliver Stone has caught the ambitious feelings of a greedy time during the 1980's.  It is also a deja vu moment on steroids for the beginning of the 21st Century.  Greed and avarice versus human decency and the greater good is what the movie is about.<br /><br />Set in New York City, Charlie Sheen plays Bud Fox, a striving, ambitious stockbroker, doing cold calls for his firm.  Bud is from a blue-collar background who has a hard-working union boss father.  He has a deep loving respectful relationship with him.  Martin Sheen plays Carl, Bud's father (he is also Charlie Sheen's father in real life)<br /><br />Bud also admires and worships the success of Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), who has much success in corporate takeovers.  He is rich and powerful beyond the normal bounds of Bud's expectations.<br /><br />The story evolves to Bud being torn between two father figures, Gordon the Wall Street Wizard (\\"Greed is Good\\") and Carl, his loving, kind and working class man.<br /><br />As Gordon takes Bud on as his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, he shows him the \\"moves\\" that need to be done to get to the top.  Bud slowly but surely decides that this is much more fun than doing cold calls for his firm.  Lou Mannheim (Hal Holbrook), who works for Bud's firm, counsels him that easy money is a dream.  You work hard and diligent through good and bad times and that is what works.  Bud ignores the advice and stays in the fast lane, using inside information from his father as well as getting a job in night cleaning to go through other people's files for insider information.<br /><br />He moves up to an expensive apartment and a beautiful ambitious girlfriend to match (Darryl Hannah).  Gekko puts more and ore pressure on Bud to keep breaking the law of insider trading - and then undermine his union leader father, which will jeopardize his friend's jobs and lives, he can't do it.  Bud realizes that sleeping at night with a clear conscience is worth more than all the glitz and power money can buy.<br /><br />The movie has some bumps (Darryl Hannah's acting is awful as the girlfriend), but performances by Michael Douglas, Martin and Charlie Sheen make it riveting and a compelling watch.  The bittersweet twist is that we still see greed and hubris in top Wall Street and Banking firms. No lessons learned.some bumps (Darryl Hannah's acting is awful as the girlfriend), but performances by Michael Douglas, Martin and Charlie Sheen make it riveting and a compelling watch.

0375842209|4.0|The Book Thief<br />By Markus Zusak<br /><br />In Germany, just at the start of WWII, Liesel Meminger is a young girl already well acquainted with Death.  And Death, it seems, is acquainted with her.  In this haunting story, ten year old Liesel, her younger brother and her mother are all traveling to Molching where the two children will be taken in by a foster family.  It is on this trip that Death, the restless narrative voice of the book, first notices the young girl.  Given a vivid fascination with Humans, Death is momentarily distracted from his weary duty of collecting her brother's soul by the pain of this young girl's loss.  He encounters her in various ways over the next four years and each time is drawn to her life and her will to live it.<br /><br />Dropped into a world she does not understand, Liesel is adrift.  Her only connection with her former life is a book, The Gravedigger's Handbook dropped by the gravedigger who buried her brother.  It is through the kindness of her foster father, Hans Hubberman, teaching her to read this macabre little work that some semblance of understanding and happiness forms around her.  Words and the ideas behind them help her see the terrible threat the Nazis present to her new family and the people she loves.  Her love for reading grows so intense that she becomes The Book Thief, stealing books from the Mayor's wife, and even from the bonfires of condemned Jewish works.  When Max Vandenburg, a Jew to whom Hans Hubberman owes a debt of life, arrives and takes refuge in the basement, Liesel's sense of freedom and the power of the written word are put to the test.  Through all the danger, the horror and pain of war and the fear of discovery Liesel learns what it is to be human, to love, to die with honor and live with guilt and to cherish things that only the mind can touch.<br /><br />Zusak has written not only an entertaining and compelling story but also a fresh look at the destruction the Nazis did to their own people along with the world.  He has taken a look through this young girl's eyes and exposed the brutality of war in a very intimate setting.  To struggle to survive when the world is crumbling around you, the people you love are suffering and dying, the words which have given you freedom are banished and burned is an amazing feat that Liesel Meminger carries off by with bravery.<br /><br />The writing Zusak has employed might not be to everyone's liking; emotions sit on the table to be examined, sounds claw and bite the ears, and Death pauses in his narrative to makes observations and comments the characters in the story can not know.  He has given texture and feel to simple phrases, he is a Word Shaker, mixing the sounds and thoughts and memories everyone carries within them until he has created something unique but at its heart - easy to recognize and relate to.  It works for this book while it might be too overwrought and distracting in another setting.  Here, he is able to pull the reader in, awaken his or her senses and use them like a slap in the face to get a nearly physical reaction to this story.  It is a very personal book, a very disturbing book, there are no Happy Endings, no miracles, no Divine Intervention, there is only a girl who loves words and her family, and a war.  It is also a book I would recommend to anyone.as taken a look through this young girl's eyes and exposed the brutality of war in a very intimate setting.

B000FC1LOC|4.0|This book was an excellent read but the ending completely ruined it. Anna never had a life of her own and has been chained down by the burdens of her sister, why kill her when she's finally free?? The ending was just terrible. But the book is worth the read!
0061703257|4.0|I was suggested this title by a friend; and honestly it was right up my alley.  Mind bender, twisting and turning honestly haunting at specific points. I enjoyed this throughly!<br /><br />The story is this:<br /><br />Two US Marshals(Teddy Daniels and Chuck Auile) are sent to Shutter Island off the coast of Massachusetts; to investigate the  disappearance of a certified insane woman Rachel Solando, even before they get inside they notice odd things happening on the island.  The inside is intimidating and oppressing, with Teddy's only companion being his new partner he begins to doubt things, and with the approach of a storm it's added fuel for the mind warping ability of Shutter Island and Ashcliffe<br /><br />Dennis Lehane crafts a wonderful tale of mystery and intrigue, that delve into the darkest corridors of the human mind, just when you think you have his game figured out he flips it on it's head and takes you down another avenue.  This book is hard to put down, and even harder to forget as the nights press in on you, you wonder when will Ashcliffe call for you?<br /><br />The only slight twinge to this is the ending is predictable; that is not to that you shouldn't read this, it's to say if you've read books like Fight Club you might see it coming.  I however enjoyed this haunting trip into America's past
B0000A98ZP|1.0|The 'High School Reunion Collection' edition of the DVD contains a major issue: a series of forced commercials upon running the disc, before you reach the DVD menu. I could not skip past the commercials. My copy of the DVD was faulty and would slow down, then lock-up during the commercials, making watching the film impossible.

1591843162|5.0|This book is the author's unique way of telling us how to be indispensable in the contemporary workplace: be creative and give your employer and customers 150% effort with your heart. Nowadays, merely following orders and doing just enough will no longer make it. With the present technological development, more and more structured jobs are either taken over by the computer or outsourced. The jobs that remain are more unstructured and they require a lot of creativity. That is why successful workers are \\"artists.\\" There are no maps to follow because the problems that remain to be solved are mostly novel. They require us to be able to have an accurate insight and problem-solving capabilities beyond following a map. Further, since these jobs are not structured, there is room for us to give our 150% to be creative and to create value that customers and companies really want nowadays. An example that the book gives is, a waiter doing more than just serving food to customers. He/she serves the customers with all his/her heart: attending to detail and going all out to make sure that the customers have a wonderful experience eating there. It is this extra effort (the book calls it a \\"gift\\" or the work of the \\"artist\\") that sets the artist (the worker) apart.    This book further explains in detail how we can achieve the status of being the indispensable linchpin in the workplace. Conditions include being able to focus to work on our \\"art,\\" being able to deliver this \\"art,\\" being able to see the world as it is and to keep the external environment from affecting us (this is the way to keep an objective perspective and to be productive), etc. The book also closes the loop with talking about what to do if things do not work while we are trying to be an artist.     The argument presented by the author is sound and supported with facts. While I was reading it, an interesting thought came to me. If merely fitting in and being average is no longer sufficient nowadays, how about those who do not even give an average performance?    This book reminds me of one important thing: we should be unafraid of things that we should not be afraid of. This is one apsect of maturity and one of the pre-requisites of being a linchpin.

B0015KG3N2|2.0|The concept is nifty, but, alas, in the implementation, this book seems only able to exalt the Tao by denigrating other paths of wisdom.  It ridicules science and insults religion.  The \\"real\\" Tao is a balance, but this book, for all its well-meaning, falls from that balance into the \\"my way is the only way\\" fallacy.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|Having never read the book and only having seen the 1970's version of this story for comparison I really enjoyed this film.  The set decorations were well done and the film, for the most part, seamlessly blended set locations with the CGI locations.  The actors all did a fine job.  I fail to understand why so many dislike this film.<br /><br />The story, while familiar to many, was still suspenseful and moved at a good pace.  It's not an action film and so those expecting non-stop action may be disappointed.  Still there is action and great special effects.  Time travel is such an interesting concept and is something that most people have day dreamed about at one time or another.  I'm sure there are things we all wish we could go back and change.  The Morlock's are great and terrifying enemies.<br /><br />Of course there are some nitpicks to be had.  Will people still be speaking English 800,000 years from now?  Unlikely!  Could a computer still be running and functioning 800,000 years from now?  I can't imagine how!!!  Finally, given the way the geography changed over 800,000 years, which was well visualized by CGI, is it likely that the Time Machine would not emerge buried underground or underwater?  I didn't find it at all credible that the Time Machine, which does not move physical but only through time, would materialize on the surface after so many millennia<br />.<br /><br />Still, this movie tells a good story and IMO is well worth watching.  It may be a little scary for children under the age of ten years but in general is a good family film.  Also, the soundtrack is nice and probably worth obtaining as well.
1591843162|5.0|I've been a staunch fan of Seth Godin for several years.  He makes me uncomfortable unlike any other writer, and I recognize that that discomfort is tied to aspects of my own worldview and habits that warrant scrutiny.  For Seth, I believe this is a watershed book.  I have followed his blog, earlier books, and Triiibes site, and firmly believe he is one of the most important business/marketing writers of our age.  This book ties it all together with characteristic clarity and passion that are becoming Seth's trademark.  Seth's own experience as a Stanford MBA student, however, should not cloud his judgement of MBA curricula in general; his dissatisfaction with his own MBA experience becomes clear in this book, but he goes too far by extrapolating that experience to other institutions and the perspectives they encourage.  Seth's message fits pefectly with Day, Christensen/Raynor, Prahalad, and Drucker; that many MBA's fail to embody the principles he suggests reflects personal choice more than the academic rigor and focus of leading MBA programs.

B001DHXT2A|5.0|this was an excellent reboot of the hulk movie, not a sequel to the first one which was okay but was kind of slow on the action. This one has more action, a better story and a better villain. i recommend this on blue ray or dvd.

078322947X|4.0|I too have been waiting for a widescreen DVD of Sorcerer to be released.  I have read and studied all the comments about the aspect ratios of the original release and the DVD's.  According to the labeling on the old lazer disc, it was released under the transfer supervision of Wm. Friedkin at the 1.66:1 original camera negative.  I am reading this off my personal LD copy.  I have compared the picture of the LD to the DVD for cropping and P&S alterations.  There is no change or loss of picture between the two formats!  What the studio did on the DVD was to anamorphically \\"squeeze\\" the whole 1.66:1 picture into the old academy 1.33:1 format.  The DVD is not P&S.  It has been altered to fit most standard size TV's without any loss of image.  Anybody with a modern digital TV can play the DVD and select one of the TV's various zoom modes and stretch the image back to its proper ratio for viewing.  This is what I have done and this is my opinion on the DVD.  I would still like to see a new remastered BluRay with a full commentary and making-of documentary which is long overdue of this classic film.  One of my all-time favorites.
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Great \\"movie\\" very satisfied.  Bought for gifts, received fast, and I had preordered it, and they gave me a refund after I received them, because the price had gone down, Great deal. Love Amazon
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I am in the process of reading the series; I'm on the fifth book. The series is similar in many ways, but definitely has its own life, and flair. Great production values, shot on site in beautiful New Zealand landscapes, truly creates another world for the show. Has all the makings of an epic tale: war, corruption, magic, love, betrayal. I don't usually go for fantasy shows, but this one blows me away. Definitely worth the money, especially since the time slot for the show is extremely inconvenient (ABC, when you pick it up for a 3rd season, put it on at a normal hour!)
B002WCLG3O|3.0|I was never a huge fan of the video games. Not because I didn't like them or because I don' t just love the stories (I do) but mainly because I didn't own an xbox when they first came out and I was never a part of the amazing social phenomenon that it's become. Until a few weeks back I wasn't aware that the story was so huge and epic, but now that I am I'm defiantly interested in finding out more. Well, I'm still waiting for my xbox to ship from home and I don't have ready access to a lot of books at the moment, so what then? Well, there's always Korean pirate DVD stores (yeah me!), you know, the place I bought EVERY episode of Battlestar Gallactica for just over fifty bucks (DVD quality too, HUA!). On my weekly DVD run a copy of Halo Legends caught my eye as I was walking out of the store and I thought to myself `hey, what better way to get more into Halo then to watch some anime based on it?' Anime based on a popular movie or comic has become a staple, from Animatrix, to the Batman anime, to the Hulk VS movies (still need to see those). These little episodic anime's have served other franchises well in the past.<br /><br />Unfortunately Halo Legends doesn't quite live up to the story it was supposed to portray. Sure, there are moments of fun and cleverness, but through the whole thing I was just waiting to be blow away by at least ONE of the stories, and I kept on waiting until the very last episode was finished. I kept looking for a third disk or something. Nothing. That was it. There are good episodes in this little collection, a few decent ones, and a couple really, really bad ones. But nothing great, nothing that stands out and forces you to take notice.<br /><br />The first two episodes, Origins, is nothing more than a retelling of the storyline behind the Halo universe, which is great for someone like me not totally immersed in the story from the games, but it surprised me how much I actually did know after all. There's nothing here that I didn't know from one place or another, nothing about the Forrunners, the Flood, the Covenant War, was new to me. If this is the case for me I can only imagine how boring and tiresome it would be for someone who's been following Halo since the very first game, though multiple books, games, etc. Unless you're a total Halo virgin Origins won't tell you anything  knew. Plus the animation in these episodes is... what's the word? Cheap. That's the best way I can describe it. It was cheap. Not a lot of movement, not a lot of frames, just a lot of still pictures without the usual amazing background art that makes anime so great.<br /><br />Following these two episodes is `The Duel,' a story about the past of the Elites home world at the formation of their alliance with The Covenant. The main characters is apparently the Arbitrayer (sp?)of the time as he resists the alliance and fights for the independence of his race. Even without the terrible animation style this episode is done in it probably would have still been a pretty bad episode, but nothing else seems to matter when I can't even see what the hell is going on. It's done in some sort of water color style, don't know, I'm not an expert. But one does not need to be an expert to tell you that if you can't SEE what the hell is going on in a movie or TV show or whatever, then no matter what else it does right, that's the only that that is going to matter. How can I really appreciate the epic battle that takes place here if I can't SEE what the hell is going on? How can I sympathize for a character being unjustly tortured if I can't SEE her bruises and scares? If their just a bunch of lumps of indiscernible colors and shades then how can I saw I liked it?<br /><br />The Homecoming is a little better than the previous two episodes, but once again it lacks that `wow' factor the games posses. Fortunately it's done in a more traditional style of animation so we can actually SEE the action going on. The story focuses on a Spartan other than Master Chief, who is stuck battling the Covenant on an unnamed Inner Colony with a squad of UNSC Marines. As they fight their way through a ruined city to get picked up by a Pelican and evacuated, we are treated to some back story on our Spartan, how she tried to escape the training center, how she was kidnapped and replaced by a clone so no one would know she was gone. It's not a bad story, but it suffers from a few common anime faults. Like when the episodes hero (the younger version) points a gun at her clone (who has no idea she's a clone) and the clone girl just smiles and says hi. Really? If your double ran up to you and pointed a gun in your face, are you just going to sit there and say hi? Why do anime characters always do this? Moving on.<br /><br />Next we are treated to the abomination that is Odd One Out. Its dragon Ball Z and Halo neatly wrapped in one of the most absurdly idiotic anime's I've ever seen. Basically Master Chief is flying over an unknown world (for some reason) with another Spartan, #1337, who apparently despite his status as one of the world's greatest worriers has a habit of falling out the back of Pelicans in mid flight. As you might be able to tell from that alone, this isn't a serious episode. But it IS a stupid one. From ninja kids with super powers, to cavemen kids riding Dinosaurs, bumbling bad guys, full of themselves hero's, its basically a Saturday morning kids cartoon squished between a couple of drama/action based anime's. This episode really is the `odd one out' as it doesn't fit with any of the other episodes, and sucks a whole lot more then the worst of them.<br /><br />Then there's `Prototype.' It starts like dozens of animes. The fragile girls voice dying while a strong male lead stands by trying to comfort her. Anyone here see `Now and Then, Here and There'? This anime starts pretty much how that one ends if that helps anyone (probably doesn't, most who read this probably have never seen the show I'm talking about; your loss). This, along with the next episode, is probably the best of the series. A lot of action to love, some interesting character development. The main character, `Ghost,' is a soldier dealing with the loss of his platoon at the beginning of the episode and his lost humanity. They call him Ghost because he doesn't feel anything, doesn't love anything, and according to a few soldiers in this show, doesn't show much regard for their lives. It figures there would have to be mechs in this series somewhere, it's a Japanese staple after all. Plus it does kind of fit Halo, doesn't it? The mech in this episode looks a lot like a Spartan but packs a lot more heat. Though it does get kind of cheesy and emo, it's still pretty good.<br /><br />Next is `The Babysitter,' an episode about the badass ODST (Orbital Drop Shock Troopers) who jump into a planet with a Spartan (another blond hotty, apparently the Spartan program was full of them) to take out a Covenant prophet and document the `unknown alien ruins' of the planet. The reason I liked this one so much is the simple fact that it involves ODST, who other than the Spartans, are the biggest bad asses in the entire Halo universe. Sure, the Spartans are cool and all, but personally I prefer ODST troopers to the regular Halo hero.<br /><br />And lastly, rounding out the list is `The Package,' pretty poorly done CGI episode where we get to see Spartans fight together and use some new fang space fighters. This one is nothing more than a `shoot em up' episode. The animation is pretty poor by today's standards, the action power ranger ish, the dialogue cheesy at best. Nothing special to report.<br /><br />On a side note, I want to say I'm impressed with the Halo music, even if it was taken directly from the video games. Makes me want to go back and play the old ones (Halo 1 and 2) even more now.<br /><br />So, is this a set worth owning? Only if you're a diehard Halo fan.

B003102JDM|5.0|The Coen brothers just get better and better. Every little detail is important. Every faces. Every gestures. Every grimaces. A picture hanging over one's shoulders. A word within a dialogue. Every camera movement. Colors. Every-little-thing-is-worth-your-attention.    It might seem incoherent at first but it's not. The brothers may use false modesty but we know that nothing in their scripts and in their films is ever left to chance. Not even the little fable at the beginning of \\"A Serious Man\\".    And with time, it looks like they are ending their movies abruptly (\\"No Country...\\" and this last one) but in reality, it's far from being the case. It's gonna become a new thing to like within their body of work. The way they end their stories.    I won't dissect \\"A Serious Man\\" here. Others have done it with biblical proportions. I don't think it's what the Brothers want. Their message, in my humble opinion, is relatively easy. It's written at the start of the movie. Something like \\"Receive with simplicity what is given to you\\".     The main characters don't accept their faith. They are letting corruption in their lives. And they get punished at the end. Oh! They are layers of metaphores, that's for sure. The jewish people, the wrath of God, the decline of the U.S.A...    But the Brothers are also saying to receive their movie with simplicity.     Have you all read the incredible amount of lines some people have written here? But i guess it stands as an hommage to the brilliance and depth of this movie. The Coens must seriously laugh if they read \\"Amazon\\".    With all being said, i do think that \\"A Serious Man\\" is easilly one of the three best movie of the Coens. Along with \\"Fargo\\" and \\"No Country...\\".     And can someone please tell me at last if there's a darn second meaning to \\"She wants a gett\\"... \\"A what?\\"... \\"Oh! Ok. A gett.\\"    It keeps repeating and the characters seem to understand something else. Something a bit odd. Sorry, i'm french and the english language still holds mysteries.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|When I saw this film in the theater, I was less than enthused. I felt that it was confusing and that it appeared to be missing pieces of the storyline. I thought that perhaps the projectionist had missed a reel. Almost right. The film was severely cut and released to theaters in a 50 minute shorter version. This one, however, is the film it should have been. The movie actually makes sense now. Characters are understood, scenes no longer are disconnected, and you get a true feel for the period. It still suffers from excessive length, but at least the viewer can watch it in parts at home. Avoid the theatrical release DVD and buy this one.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This documentary is simply fantastic. There is no other similar to it. Worth buy it, because all episodes are so informative and beautiful in the same time, especially the episode about plants. The episodes about birds and insects are very beautiful too. I have learned a lot about animals and plants with this fascinating ten-episodes documentary. Believe me, if you buy this, you will never regret it.
B001CZJKS0|5.0|While the majority of fans probably have most of what's in this package, think about it like this...this comes with Halloween with the 12 minutes of extra tv footage, that dvd alone goes new on Amazon for 40 some bucks. This package is actually a few dollars or so cheaper. So buy this, and you can either keep the other dvds, or if you already have them, sell them individually here on amazon :)
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I enjoyed Cranford 1 and 2 with equal satisfaction and both seasons were very satisfying to me.  I like the eye to detail and settings, and the cast is amazing.  There are a few objections by some purist Cranston fans that this is a little more contrived than Season 1 but I dont agree.  The stories are very feasible and the acting superb by all,especially Dame Judy Dench.  All the characters ring true and I wept and laughed and fell in love as I watched.  It is well worth your money and your time to be in Cranford again and again. You will not be disappointed and yes, Love is the final answer.
0385495323|5.0|This book is one of the most highly-rated non-fiction books on Amazon, and for good reason.  I won't reiterate the other reviews except to say that the clarity of presentation of complex material is extraordinary.  The one caveat is that the book is now ten years old, so you'll need to look for something beyond this to bring you up to the present.
0142410349|5.0|Trying to complete a chapter book with my 7-year-old is usually an uphill battle, but he loved this one!  Not only is the story fast-paced with enough action to keep young ones wanting more, but there are also moments that require taking a step back and talking about lessons that can be learned from the text.    My son, daughter and I engaged in a long conversation about whether stealing is ever okay.  If it is okay to steal in order to provide food for one's family, and whether Mr. Fox should have ever began stealing in the first place.  We talked about alternatives to stealing and also about survival.  Does Mr. Badger give in too easily?  Is he \\"outfoxed\\" by Mr. Fox?    There's also a point when Mr. Fox calls one of his children a \\"twerp.\\"  My children discussed whether parents should call their children names, and how Mr. Fox could have handled the situation differently, especially when the young fox was being thoughtful to others.      Finally, there was the lesson about destroying nature and the effects on the ecological system.    A great story with great lessons.  This is a keeper in our home.
B002PQ7JQK|2.0|These disks are a sad product.  The quality is below standard and is not worth the price. Stop's and starts, skips , lip sync out, angle on off with pauses. Volume so low on some disks that TV sound not strong enough to hear speech. Maximum frustratration trying to watch. Will try another set to verify quality.  Took me a month to watch all disks and ran one day over 30 day return limit so I get to pay for shipping.  GRRRR...  I hope someone from Amazon reads this.
B002ZBT84G|5.0|Gil Scott-Heron's new CD \\"I'm new here\\" is apparently his first in 16 years. Unlike most here, I'm not too familiar with his earlier stuff, though I know and love \\"Angel dust\\" and \\"The bottle\\".<br /><br />With a spare production comprising haunting strings and skeletal beats, I find at times it reminds me of Trip Hop by Portishead or Massive Attack. Aged 60, and having done some time in jail and rehab, he has a lot to share with us which he does.<br /><br />Opening and closing the album are the narratives \\"On coming from a broken home\\" parts one and two. Set to string samples from Kanye West's \\"Flashing lights\\", he tells us how he came from a broken home with no strong male figure, but his grandma Lily Scott made sure he had everything to be the man he is. \\"Womenfolk raised me, and I was full-grown before I knew I came from a broken home\\" he says.<br /><br />\\"Me and the devil\\" is a gloomy Blues lament with swirling electronics and Heron's world-weary voice soulfully wrapped around the lyrics, one of the few ocassions he actually sings here.  Title track \\"I'm new here\\" is an acoustic spoken/sung piece.<br /><br />\\"Your soul and mine\\" marries ominous synths to delicate beats with a poetic narrative on the ghetto (\\"In a wilderness of heartbreak, and a desert of despair\\" go the lyrics in part).<br /><br />\\"I'll take care of you\\" is piano Blues with cutting strings and a gritty vocal performance, \\"Where did the night go\\", \\"Running\\" and \\"The crutch\\" set Heron's poetry to gloomy synths and skeletal beats, while the clever \\"New York is killing me\\" is skeletal Blues with handclaps and intermittent bursts of percussion, droning synths and Gospel-style backing vocals.<br /><br />The songs are brief with 4 interludes, and quite a number of narratives, before you realize it, the 30 minutes running time is done. This is an album that draws you in and demands you listen to every word of it's author.  Simply spectacular!
B0009MAO46|5.0|have been waiting to buy this video for my 2 sons. was not able to find it in the stores. easy to find this online and at a great price. video came in \\"like new\\" condition. very happy with this purchase.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|Overall I liked this movie, but the first third of the movie was a little bit of a surprise for me, in that Pixar decided to make this movie a little bit of a tear jerker.  Not as bad as say, when Bambi's mother dies in a forest fire, but it was a little different than what I was expecting from the previews with,\\"My master made me this collar so I can talk!\\" and \\"But, it's a talking dog!\\"  So if you have really little ones, watch this movie with them so they don't get too upset.  For everyone else enjoy (it does get progressively funnier as the movie goes on)!
0812973992|5.0|A wonderful,engrossing read.  Maybe the best book I've yet read about New York.  Can't be recommended highly enough.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|The Original Series, untouched, with no new special effects or digital enhancement. These are the shows that we watched over and over on TV waiting for yet another re-run of \\"the Trouble with Tribbles\\" or \\"The Doomsday Machine\\". The enterprise is seen dangling on a barely-hidden screen. The occasional red-shirt leans the wrong way. The phaser beams are raggedy and make their classic sound and no lens-flare ring explosions are found, let alone over-done. If you can still find them, go for it. These were what the franchise was made from.
B000OPOAJS|4.0|If you like films that grip you from start to finish and have very little dialogue then you'll like this European thriller directed by a master of the genre, the late John Frankenheimer (The Manchurian Candidate;Black Sunday). Not mentioned in other reviews of this film is that the script is ghost-written by playwright David Mamet under the name of Richard Weisz.  Also I believe that the ghost of the great noirist director, Jean Pierre-Melville hovers over this unique film. DeNiro is fine as always as the key protagonist and he's backed by Jean Reno (The Professional;Crimson Rivers), Steller Skargsgard, Natascha McElhoe, Sean McBean, Michel Lonsdale (Day of the Jackal)and Jonathan Pryce.  Full of car chases and double crosses plus the \\"McGuffin\\", this slick action film is one great chase reminscent of the great Steve McQueen action flicks of the 60's and 70's.
0061689246|5.0|I read this book both before and after the movie of the same name came out. Both of which I loved, as well as a few other books by this same author. Mirrormask was my favorite but not by far, all of the books I have read by this author have been simply fantastic. I encourage anyone to check out anything he is involved in. Most recently I have found this:<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />\\"I Wrote This For You is thought to be the long running teaser campaign for a movie and musical collaboration, of the same name, by Tim Burton, Neil Gaiman, Amanda Palmer, Maynard James Keenan and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails.<br /><br />Operating under the pseudonym \\"Iain Thomas\\" as well as occasionally \\"Jon Ellis\\" as \\"The Photographer\\" there are numerous patterns and secret messages strewn throughout the project, based on number theory (references to Fibonacci sequence are plentiful) and the Kabala, all of which hint at the collaboration.\\"
B000002ACR|5.0|With Younger Than Yesterday The Byrds continued to make inovative and mostly melodic music.  Downsides for me are C.T.A.-102 and Mind Gardens.  The rest are a delight with So You Want To Be A Rock N' Roll Star, full of energy and maybe some irony.  Less well known tracks like Have You Seen Her Face and The Girl With No Name are well worth hearing.  Time Between is an early country rock song and My Back Pages is a Bob Dylan write completely transformed.   Of the 6 bonus tracks I enjoy It Happens Each Day, Don't Make Waves and Lady Friend.  Best of the lot is Old John Robertson, with phased guitar and moog, it's all too short at under 2 minutes.  The Byrds were very close to their peak, which I suggest was their next recording The Notorious Byrd Brothers.
0143038583|5.0|One of the best books I've read in recent years.  Author Pollan swings big, and delivers.  An indictment of us, basically, as Pollan covers the entire food industry and the American public's participation in a massive scam designed to support big business.<br /><br />This terrific read will make you question every bit of food you ever consume.<br /><br />Highly recommended for all readers.  A good book for high school students interested in discovering how the world works, as well.
B00005JLEU|5.0|This is among the best of Miyazaki who is a favorite of mine and my 11 y.o. daughter,  a movie that can entrance both children and adults.  Unlike Hollywood, this movie has subtlety, complexity and detail.  It has both action and depth, and wonderful animation.  A must see.
0765356147|5.0|I first learned of Brandon Sanderson when I discovered he would be finishing the Wheel of Time series. I immediately looked him up, thinking this guy must be an experienced and amazing writer to have been deemed worthy of finishing Robert Jordan's monstrosity. And what do I find? A writer relatively new to the bookshelves with only a handful of published works. I immediately went out and bought this Trilogy. If these few novels were so good that he landed the job of finishing one of the most popular, well-loved, and well-hated fantasy series of our times, then he better be a damn good writer.<br />And, as it turns out, he is.<br />This trilogy is AWESOME! Trust me, you're bound to find something that you like about it. This fantasy isn't about the typical clash of Good vs. Evil , though in a way that's exactly what it is. That's all I have to say, I'd hate to ruin it for you.<br />Contribute to Sanderson's awesomeness and GO BUY THIS BOOK!
B002YIHO7I|3.0|Sade has a creative sound that is original and moving.  That sound is unmistakable in the first two songs on the disc.  Afterwards the distinct rhythms turn retro and simple.  Some songs are peculiarly familiar and unnecessarily drawn-out at the end.  Even with the feel of a Hawaiian and Reggae influence most of the music sounds unoriginal.     Musically they moved away from the jazzy bass and the vigorous multi-layered tempo that made Sade unique.  On the whole the disc felt like it was missing something.  Not as energetic as their previous works.      Sade herself has a voice and a style that is distinctive and all her own.  I am NOT disappointed in the music on this disc.  Just expected more \\"neo-vintage\\" Sade like that of the song `Soldier of Love.  Perhaps they lost a step with this disc, but any Sade is good and it is truly pleasing to hear new music from them.      I have a good feeling that they will create and release another album before punctuating a legacy of timeless music.
B002ZTQVGQ|4.0|Hayao Miyazaki loves and respects children; he knows them well and gives them far more credit than many of you seem to.  Bambi's mother being burned to death frightened the heck out of me as a kid, not to mention all of the other \\"acceptable\\" Disney films where characters meet violent ends, but I apparently survived this childhood trauma and matured into a healthy adult.  Parents, your children are NOT as delicate as you want to believe they are.  While not quite as compelling as Princess Mononke in my opinion, Ponyo is a beautiful movie that the whole family should enjoy together.  And here's a spoiler, both parents live!
0061900656|5.0|As a grandmother, I purchase this book for each family expecting a second child.  (There is also an \\"I'm a Big Sister\\" version).  It is a GREAT way to give the older brother a separate identity.  I highly recommend it.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|If you're looking for an HDMI cable, you really don't need anything more than this.  Admittedly, I am not a home theater expert - nor do I have a desire to become one.  That said, I do appreciate good picture/audio quality on my flat screen plasma TV, and this HDMI cable is ready to use out of the box.  Easy to install, great quality, highly reccomended.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|acceptable arm functionality, you must use tools to achieve the desired setting, but for my needs and the price is sufficient.
B002NHGG92|5.0|Stefan is the next best thing to Edward.  This show is very similar to Twilight but with subtle differences.   The story lines are very entertaining and keep you guessing as to what will happen week after week.  It has some gory scenes sometimes but what do you expect when you're dealing with vampires.  Damon is a great character on the show.  I love him almost as much as Stefan.  He's very quick-witted and plays the part of a bad boy perfectly.  I love all of his little smart-alec remarks because he's completely serious when he says them even though what he says can be so mean.  He cracks me up.  If you need your Edward fix between the Twilight series' movies, The Vampire Diaries is a great way to get it.
B002AWJEU8|5.0|steve vai where the wild thing are,is a very exciting dvd the musicians are amazing besides steve vai ann marie calhoun is one of the best violin player i`ve seen if you have to listen to violin music she`ll be the one i`ll listen too she`s georgeous and an extremely talented musician, other than that a very different live dvd vai put together theres even gags on his show , so if your a steve vai fan this should definely be in your collection, amazing
B00000IWVS|4.0|Martha Argerich has plenty of passion for Chopin. Her interpretations of his work are quite unique. Subtle changes to tempo and sustained notes can relay such different feeling, flow and emotion. I have not heard Chopin played this way before; but, am glad to have now heard this CD.
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|I watched The Killers live in my town and wanted a repeat experience.  This concert is just superb and the extras in the DVD are great.  The Killers  is definitely one of the best bands out there!
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I had my reservations about this series. Having seen some of the trailers before the series came out, I was disappointed in what I saw, but still gave the series a chance. The first four episodes were atrocious to me, simply horrible and boring. I had given up hope for the series and didn't bother to watch the rest. A dear friend of mine, who was also disappointed, but continued to watch informed me that the series had gotten better. So I have recently decided to check out the rest of season 1's  last 8 episodes.<br /><br />The Pros: The humor has tickled my funny bone, so that's good. I enjoy Tara's character to a point, as she comes off as realistic, just wish she wasn't so angry, but I do understand why she is. Lafayette is my favorite character at this point, love him. The vamp scenes in the show aren't the best, I do dislike when vampires tend to waste a lot of blood when they should be lapping up every drop simply for the sake of making them look ghoulish,  but they do hold my interest such as the \\"Judgment\\" scene in which Bill had to face his punishment. That was entertaining to me.<br /><br />The Cons: Still, not a handsome face to be seen amongst these characters. I'm sorry, I don't see how anyone can find the men in this series gorgeous. It had nothing to do with them being pale. Bill looks like a old drunk. Eric has enough bags under his eyes to go to Europe, not to mention he's just not attractive. Which hurts my feelings, cause I love Eric from the books. These are the same \\"men\\". And I'm so sick and tired of Jason's character all together. He's not cute, though his body is nice, however, that doesn't stretch with me. Not only that, I'm so bored with the sex scenes in this series, especially since so many involve Jason, a character I could care less about. Not too mention, if I wanted to see ugly people having sex, I could watch 70's porn and get the real thing.<br /><br />I've never really liked Sookie that much, but in the series she's kind of psychotic, claiming love for Bill, but kissing Sam, then getting mad at Bill for giving a damn. And it's odd that she's so accepting of vampires, but when Sam reveals who he is, it's just \\"too much for her to handle\\". Yeah, right. She comes off as stupid too. If you could read ppl's minds, and there's someone in town trying to kill you, she should have braved the negative comments and read everyone's mind every day until she found the killer. So, there was a problem with the plot, it was weak.<br /><br />So tired of Jason and his druggy V trips, I didn't know what to do. I started fast-forwarding past all things Jason, stopping only to view the interaction between him and the vampire he kidnapped.<br /><br />The special effects are just so laughable, I swear, I HATE the sound the fangs make when they come out or go in. Why, WHY do they make that ejector sound as if a tape is ejecting out of a VCR? And watching Eric and Pam \\"roll\\" away in episode four left me in stitches.<br /><br />And one more gripe. I'm sure Alan Ball thinks he's being so bold and bad with this little series, but I'm not impressed. Why is it, I have great detailed viewing of all the HETERSEXUAL sex in the series, but all HOMOSEXUAL scenes are fade to black? Why is it, we don't get to see Lafayette, (who mind you, is the cutest guy in the whole series,) have sex with men? On both occasions, he left the camera and that was that. Eric is also Bi-sexual too, will we be seeing him get freaky with men. And if memory serves me correctly, Bill and Eric have \\"had relations\\" before too, is that going to be explored. I mean, if QAF on SHOWTIME can show it, why can't TB of HBO do the same? Is it because he's black and gay? I want to know because it was quite glaring in the series how there's NO GAY SEX SCENES and TONS of straight ones! Get it together! or tone down the ugly heteros screwing.<br /><br />That being said, Overall, not as bad as I had originally thought, I am interested in season 2, hopefully it'll havea little more vampire in it and some bolder gayer scenes. .yer scenes. .
B0001L3LUE|5.0|Mr. McNamara, ex-US secretary of defense, explains after so many years involved in the politics of war, what he thinks was wrong and what was right. It is an interesting documentary in which one can be for an instant in the shoes of this controversial person. He took though decisions and developed an \\"ethics of war\\" along his life. Today, he recognizes he could have use his brilliant capabilities in something more useful than war. The film shows in an interview his reflexions after all those crude days of cold war, Vietnam, etc. Worth to watch!
0316044695|5.0|Great read.   I am a grandmother who is as un-SEAL-like as one can be, but I was riveted and fully engaged from beginning to end.   Had to have my hubby read it immediately.     My son also told me Marcus spoke at a company function, and Marcus was as dynamic in person as he is on paper.
B002RSDW80|5.0|This is a keeper! Never boring!  As a person who used to watch Julia Childs every Saturday on tv, I enjoyed Meryl Streep's perception of her; but then, what could Ms Streep ever do wrong as an actor?  Also, learning some of her back ground was a plus.    Sarah Strickland
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|Why not zero stars?  This movie is fine for my son.  I went and saw Antichrist tonight, and I was looking around at the audience and all of a sudden I thought about this movie.  Now I saw this movie on a plane, without my son.  My thought was this: I am tired of adults talking about how excellent pixar movies are.  And then I thought about adults talking about Harry Potter and Twilight, and how ... good they are.  Neither are that good, unless you haven't read Bram Stoker's Dracula or... well pick a book.  I can forgive teenagers and pre-teens for reading these books, I can't forgive adults who seem to pride themselves on their appreciation of movies that were meant for kids. There is no literary parallel.  Pixar is not to film what Watership Down is to literature.  No.  If you are an adult and Up resonates with you- then you are truly not grown UP. If you can appreciate it for your children that is different, but really - your kids don't need this. What I mean to say here is grow up.
0545140315|4.0|This is a really cool book.  It actually combines three different ideas in it.  First of all, and even though it's a romance book, it's the friendship idea which is found throughout the whole book.  Second, it's the heartbreaking of a teen girl by a boy that she thought was the man of her dreams and her husband-to-be.  And third, it's the actual love story, a friendship which evolves to a love story through its ups and downs.<br /><br />I won't give away spoilers because I know most people don't like to know the story before they read it but I will just say that Penny Lane, the main character, is a energetic girl, a true friend and the leader type.  You get to read about her friendship with two girls (an existing an old friendship being revived), the bond created by a group of girls through a Club, her heartbreak by a boy and her friendship, flirting and romance with another boy.<br /><br />It was a great book, enjoyable and fun with not just one but many stories developing that you cannot find your self being bored reading it.  I would definitely recommend it for reading.

B000NQRE0K|5.0|** A REVIEW FOR THE \\"BLU RAY\\" VERSION **<br /><br />Re-watching 1995's \\"Braveheart\\" on a 2009 BLU RAY - you're struck by several things...<br /><br />The downsides - Mel Gibson's truly awful mime of a Scottish accent (title above)...his ludicrous hair and wigs...and it just goes on for too long.<br /><br />Upsides - Mel was also the most handsome man on the planet at the time of filming, Patrick McGoohan was chillingly brilliant as Longshanks The King, it had loads of tremendous support actors throughout (Brian Cox as Wallace's Uncle, Brendan Gleeson as Hamish his friend, Angus MacFayden as the Scottish King in waiting, David O'Hara as a fighting clansman, Ian Bannen as the Leper and the mad-eyed James Cosmo). And to top it all off - you get both Catherine McCormack and Sophie Marceau in the same film - easily two of the most beautiful women in the world. And of course there's also James Horner's haunting musical score - a beautiful air played on the Pipes which kicks in at key moments in the story; it can still bring a tear to your eye and a quickening to the pulse...<br /><br />But most of the time you are seriously impressed with the cleaned up PRINT - because on BLU RAY - \\"Braveheart\\" is BEAUTIFUL to look at - it really is. Apart from a few lines in the opening shots of the Highlands, the transfer is almost faultless throughout and really adds to your enjoyment of the scenery, the costumes and the fantsically well-staged battle scenes. In fact, I also now remember why I liked it so much at the time - it had passion and fire - like \\"Gladiator\\" did - and still does.<br /><br />The original bonus material remains intact, there's two extra hours of added-on special features and the whole 2-Disc set now comes in a tasty outer card wrap (like the Bond titles).<br /><br />On BLU RAY \\"Braveheart\\" is a very handsome thing indeed - a sweetheart. And it has never looked this good and that's for damn sure.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />PS: for other superb restorations on BLU RAY see also my reviews for - \\"The Italian Job\\", \\"Saturday Night, Sunday Morning\\", \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\", \\"Zulu\\", \\"North By Northwest\\", \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", \\"The Dambusters\\" and \\"The Prisoner - The Complete (TV) Series In High Definition\\", \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"Snatch\\", \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"The African Queen\\"aturday Night, Sunday Morning\\", \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\", \\"Zulu\\", \\"North By Northwest\\", \\"Cool Hand Luke\\", \\"The Dambusters\\" and \\"The Prisoner - The Complete (TV) Series In High Definition\\", \\"Goldfinger\\", \\"Snatch\\", \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"The African Queen\\"
B000FA5TTW|1.0|I finished the book yesterday much anticipating it to hit its stride and become interesting.  The book felt like it peaked in the first chapter and I spend the rest of it waiting and hoping for a revenge that never comes.  I would only reccomend this to people wanting to imagine what life would be like for your family and community if you were murdered, but it is certainly not a page turner.

B002YIHO7I|4.0|I have been a fan of Sade since her very first cd. I have to say I do like this one. Its a good solid piece of work. It is better than Lovers Rock. I still don't like that one. This is very good music.
B0000AUHPB|3.0|Truthfully, I had such a difficult time getting into this movie that I have not finished it. The opening, where Rosano Brazzi is drivin the curvy road led me to believe it was going to be a great movie, but then there was way too much talk and not enough action, so much so that I didn't even finish the film.
B002N5N4EE|5.0|I have been watching this series for the past two years. I own all seasons to date and the more I watch, the more in love I am with Ghost Whisperer. I watch this show because Jim Clancy reminds me of my husband. He is kind and compassionate and blatently in love with Melinda.  Jim is the type of man that all men should aspire to become. Men that are strong and supportive, but who have their own interests and passions.<br /><br />  The dialog between Jim and Melinda is extrodinary, they share their joys and sorrows, doubts and dreans, even their fears are expressed with openness and kindness. The writers of this show should get awards.<br /><br />  I have recently purchased the fourth season. I held off for about three months since completing the third season because someone told me that something bad happens in the fourth. Even though the fourth season was difficult to watch, I am inspired by Melindas courage to keep moving forward. I truly enjoy the fact that Melinda does have an unusual way of helping others deal with grief.<br /><br />Excellent cast, believable experiences, Excellent TV series
B002T921AC|1.0|I can't believe that this is what music has become. He's an okay singer; I'll give him that. If he and I were hanging out with a group of friends and someone decided he should sing something for us, I would be alright with that. However, if someone said \\"hey, why don't you sing for us and I'll give you millions of dollars and fans,\\" I would not be alright with that. The only reason these types of throw away pop stars persist is because of the record companies. They know they can exploit the young girl fan base and make a quick buck, year in and year out. That being said, anyone who has a brain developed enough to discern ANY type of quality in music should take whatever precautions required to never have to hear a note of this garbage. If you are 12, I don't blame you. If you are Usher or a record label head, I do.
0312370849|1.0|Can all book burning be bad?  This thing deserves its own pile.  My copy won't end up in my woodstove, but it will be dumped.  It's as though the author [title used lightly] read about a less well known part of the Holocaust and had an idea [drum roll for light bulb being lit]:  write about it, toss in some anti-French sentiment [have we not left the \\"American Fries\\" moment behind?]; use as themes the story of a precocious Jewish child in 1942 who won't be named until about a third way in [spoiler here, \\"Sarah\\"], a forty-five year old American [Julia] in 2002 who lives in Paris, whines about the Parisians and her French in-laws, misses her plush life in the States, whines about her French husband, tolerates her husband's abrasive behaviors because he is, after all, French, and his being great in bed makes up for it, has a precocious eleven year old daughter, a luxe life in France, and a lifelong focus on her physical appearance.  The author tosses in a yearning romance, stereotypes of both periods, offers not a single character who is not annoying [to include both young girls] or of interest.  Apparently an apartment in Paris then/now is so worth it that abiding in one with an appalling history is swallowable.  Although the historical event itself is referred to repeatedly, with the author's own hysterical and dramatic spin, it gets lost, which is a great shame.  The author took a real piece of history, enveloped it in her whipped cream/sugar spun imaginative view, and left this reader sorry to have wasted the price and the time spent.  Whoops, forgot to mention that underneath the nonsence, she's a rotten writer, failing especially in plot, dialogue, character development.  The author resorts to deus ex machina to move things along so that the reader gets repeatedly wacked with \\"didn't see that coming\\" moments, unexpected but dull.  And then there are all the predictable sub plot digressions, the tortured \\"should I/should I not\\" and \\"What Could This/He/She Mean\\" flits.  Phooey.
B0000024YL|4.0|This music brought back some memories. The music was always great - these two always had a great blending of voices. Part of the album was recorded live. They improvised a little bit from the originals on the live recordings, and naturally they were excellent, but I'm a stick-in-the mud who likes the oldies exactly the way I remembered them back in my youth. Ah, well - good music no matter what.
0061231401|1.0|This book seems to be based on old comic books.  The author attempts to weave history together with current events, and overlays with an increasing series of violent adventures and scenarios.  Each more unbelievable and improbable than the previous.  And then ends the book with a gratuitous scene about a character who turns out to have been homosexual and the scene argues for the end of \\"don't ask, don't tell\\" in the US military.  Don't ask for the book, don't bother to read, don't tell anyone to buy it.

B000P6YNSE|4.0|After the utter lostness of Season 2, watching the first 6 or 7 episodes, you'd think you have been caught in a time-warp where Season 2 never died. But don't worry folks, the brutal tediousness of the beginning of the season was not to keep this season down, and in fact, it's provided the show some of its best & most underrated moments in the history of the show. Sure, it may be small pieces in a big puzzle, but almost every minute of the 2nd half of this season is simply enthralling.<br /><br />Highlight Episodes:<br />Flashes Before Your Eyes<br />The Man from Tallahassee<br />Expos&eacute;<br />The Man Behind the Curtain<br />Through the Looking Glass<br /><br />Season 3 is all about those mysterious Others, a group with the weirdest sense of motives, or lack thereof ever conceived on television. For the first 6 episodes, you got intimate knowledge of their polar bear cages, and the general complex of the zoological facility, which you would never really see again. But hey, you got a lot of tedious dialogue, a lot of Jack being stupid, Kate being the point in a love triangle/quadrangle. Make no mistake about it, if you did not watch these episodes back to back through the wonders of DVD, I feel sorry for you. It's hard enough dealing with this tediousness over a night, much less months.<br /><br />But again, all is not Lost, because the producers saw the error in their Season 2-type ways, and sought to correct them. We got some Desmond flash-forwarding with one of the most emotional moments the serious produced up until that point. We got some AWESOME Locke dialogue and interactions with Ben Linus, including a lot of Ben Linus vs. John Locke.<br /><br />And then of course, we have Nikki & Paulo. Oh, that infamous duo that was so eloquently summed up by Sawyer as, \\"Who the hell are you?\\" Sure, I wanted to slap them every moment they were breathing until they got an episode of their own, but once they did get a flashback episode, one could consider it one of the worst Lost episodes of all time, or one of its worst. There was strippers fighting crime, hilarious flashbacks that tried REALLY hard to show that this duo was there the WHOLE time (What? You didn't see them in the background doing nothing?), and really atrocious dialogue/acting. I mean, they even conceived an excuse for why Paulo was going to the bathroom in almost every previous scene we had seen him in before! But alas, these truly awful, annoying characters were literally buried alive, set to some of the most inappropriate clapping I've ever done. Oh, Nikki & Paulo, how will I ever get by without you? Just fine actually.<br /><br />Heck, the producers actually made Charlie likable again, right before they killed him off. I mean, they tried so hard to make him a jerk last season, and here he is making the top 5 moments of his life, and heck, we actually like him again! What's worse is, we genuinely root for him! Oh, how easy we forget. Sure, Jack & Kate are basically the same as last season, continuing their characters' downward spiral. But hey, Sawyer is as hilarious as ever, Hurley is as lovable as ever, and hey, we finally did away with full-time flashbacks! Oh Lost, how far you came in such a short span of time.<br /><br />Overall, watching this season is one of the most satisfying of the show, especially since you get such plentiful, awesome moments after sitting through so much tediousness at the beginning. Underrated, Season 3 will always have a special place in my heart, if only for the reason that it truly made what Lost became later.e was strippers fighting crime, hilarious flashbacks that tried REALLY hard to show that this duo was there the WHOLE time (What?

B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I really enjoy listening to Huge and Drew on this cd.  I think they should have done more singing together and their movie  together was great.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|alicia has come a long way from the girl with braids who sang stevie wonderish/70s soul music to the woman<br />who has seem to be more comfortable in her own skin. element of freedom has a bit of an 80s soft rock, adult<br />contemporary, prince style to it. it debuted at #2 which proves that changing her usual sound was risky. it has<br />a nice theme to it and i love the colors. her use of metaphors with love and the \\"sea\\" is beautiful. i found<br />half of the songs to be either outstanding or that grabs my attention, the rest are just okay. i love alicia keys<br />though. she's one of the talented, brightest stars out there. i guess i feel more drawn to this album than the others because i love 80s music and i can identify with the theme more.<br /><br />1. \\"Love Is Blind\\" (4/5)-it sounds kinda weird and different but i like it.<br /><br />2. \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\" (3.5/5)-didn't like it at first but the more i listen to it..it doesn't sound so bad.<br /><br />3. \\"Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart\\" (5/5)-epic intro. \\"let's do it baby\\". she sounds ready. try sleeping<br />with a broken heart is my favorite...i guess it's partially because i can relate to the title.<br /><br />4. \\"Wait Til You See My Smile\\" (4/5)-it reminds me of the music in the early 80s, but i dont' know about this song. i love the beats...but i don't feel the song itself is enough to give it 5 stars<br /><br />5. \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\" (4.5/5)-she sounds very cute in this song. i love how she plays the<br />piano. one person on here pointed out that it kinda sounded like force md's tender love. now that i think about<br />it..yes, it does.<br /><br />6. \\"Un-thinkable (I'm Ready)\\" (5/5)-i like this song alot. it sounds very sensual. and hearing drake's<br />deep vocals in the background ain't bad either. maybe she should release this as the next single.<br /><br />7. \\"Love Is My Disease\\" (4/5) -i'm liking the reggae beats.<br /><br />8. \\"Like the Sea\\" (5/5)-great song<br /><br />9. \\"Put It in a Love Song\\" (featuring Beyonc&eacute;) (5/5)-i didn't like it at first, but it grew on me. bey and<br />alicia really have great chemistry together. they compliment each other nicely.  this song has girl power<br />written all over it. i can't wait to see their video!<br /><br />10. \\"This Bed\\" (5/5)-the background beats is a very nice throwback to prince's music and the 80s.<br /><br />11. \\"Distance and Time\\" (3/5)- it's a nice song with simple, plain beats.<br /><br />12. \\"How It Feels to Fly\\"(4/5)-sounds similar to distance and time, but i like it a lil bit better<br /><br />13. \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\" (5/5)-the best song on the album. it's one of the songs<br />where you feel patriotic and proud of where you came fromey and   alicia really have great chemistry together. they compliment each other nicely.  this song has girl power   written all over it. i can't wait to see their video!    10. \\"This Bed\\" (5/5)-the background beats is a very nice throwback to prince's music and the 80s.    11. \\"Distance and Time\\" (3/5)- it's a nice song with simple, plain beats.     12. \\"How It Feels to Fly\\"(4/5)-sounds similar to distance and time, but i like it a lil bit better    13. \\"Empire State of Mind (Part II) Broken Down\\" (5/5)-the best song on the album. it's one of the songs   where you feel patriotic and proud of where you came from
0061733199|5.0|The book was bigger than I thought from other reviews, but it's still a good piece of gear.
B00319ECHE|4.0|It seems the initial reaction of many reviewers is to try and compare \\"Mechanize\\" with previous Fear Factory releases, namely, \\"Demanufacture\\" and \\"Obsolete\\".  Any true Fear Factory fan already knows that those two albums can never be duplicated. So, if you're expecting to pop this disc in and hear another \\"Self Bias Resistor\\", \\"Zero Signal\\", \\"Shock\\" or even \\"Smasher/Devourer\\", than I'm sorry. Prepare to be disappointed.   Truth be told, there is little that \\"Mechanize\\" and those other two amazing albums have in common. And that's not necessarily a bad thing.  \\"Mechanize\\" stands on its own.  \\"Mechanize\\" earns its merits by appeasing longtime fans with plenty of FF's trademark sounds (Dino's machine-gun riffing and Burton's multi-layered vocals), while mixing in fresh elements to win over new listeners (Hoglan's drumming is an entirely new take on the FF sound).   Songs like \\"Fear Campaign\\", \\"Powershifter\\" and \\"Christploitation\\" best highlight the direction that the band's headed in -- more complex guitars and more \\"hands-on\\" drumming.   While there are still some keyboards and samples mixed in as background fodder, effects are overall far less prevelant than on any other disc. (With the exception of \\"Transgression\\" -- a mess all it's own.)  There's a little rust on \\"Mechanize\\", but that's to be expected. I'm sure touring and future recordings will shake some of that rust. I also think that the best music from this version of FF is still to come.  Overall, this is a strong return for the duo of Cazares and Bell. The music is definitely FF, and that's what should be important.
B000P12LWY|5.0|i love the tudors series - and i love amazon - they give a very good discription of the product, in detail - you can not find a better price on their products they sell - and their service is great. i'm 100% sold on amazon. the tudors series is the greatest - lots of action, sex and great great acting. really brings the era to life.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|Harry Potter books have captured the hearts and minds of many people around the world for a reason. The further into the story the books delved the more remarkable the characters and the story line became. One would think that the movie would try to capture this spirit; but, alas, not this time. It was extremely disappointing to watch this film. I'm not sure where the director for this film - David Yates - was dug up, but I have never seen anyone mutilate the story as successfully as this man has done. In my opinion the movie didn't show a story, it flashed a bunch of flash cards (episodes) that were quite mediocre in their content. The scenes were a collection of action shots that had very little joining them together.     The second biggest gripe I have with this director is miscasting of characters. He was a director in previous Harry Potter film and I didn't care for his choice of Dolores Umbridge, but this time he managed to outdo his previous poor choice - the character of Professor Slughorn was completely miscast and misrepresented in comparison to the character shown in the book. Professor Slughorn was one of my favorite characters in this book - his wit, his shrewdness, his talent in potion making, his charisma, his little weaknesses (love of good wine, good food and love of the company of the \\"movers and the shakers\\") all of it completely gone... No reason, just crossed out from existence. Watching the Slughorn's character in the film, you constantly wonder, why would Dumbledore - the greatest wizard of all - would pick such a feeble excuse for a human being teaching these remarkable kids? Oh, yea, it's just because he had this memory. But then why did this looser teach Harry's parents? According to the film, who knows... If you've read the book you know that Slughorn was extremely talented, and even though he belonged to Slytherin house and had his weaknesses, he had principles and was not going to give them up. That was the reason why Dumbledore chose him - his strength of character and his talent, and of course having a special memory was an \\"icing on the cake\\". But you'll find none of this information in the film.    My third huge complain is Snape. Throughout the previous films Alan Rickman has captured the audiences with his Snape - stealthy, quiet, coiled up like a snake, striking like a cobra - you could see the passions and hate shining through his eyes. He held his students in the \\"iron fist\\"; order and discipline reigned in his classroom.  This film however made me constantly think \\"Is this Snape? What the heck happened to him?\\" (and then I would back up and say \\"Oh, yea, 'wonderful' film director, that's what happened to him\\").  In the bathroom when Harry cursed Malfoy with Snape's curse and walked away, Snape saw it all and has not done a thing, didn't punish Harry, didn't get other teachers involved as he's done in the past at the slightest hint of Harry's misbehavior (and here, mind you, someone almost got killed), didn't torment him, nothing... Just healed Malfoy as if nothing happened and everyone went on their merry way... And of course the ending - where in the book you see all the passions raging inside the man, in the movie Snape just matter-of-factly tells Harry \\"I'm the Half Blood Prince\\" and walks away, he might as well told Harry \\"Never mind this whole wizard war thing, I'll just go get a sandwich\\" Where is the passion, where is the climax????    The whole Harry/Ginny and Ron/Hermione love stories were as flat, gray and lifeless as a piece of cardboard. I'm not even sure why they were included in the movie, because after looking closely these scenes didn't seem to serve a purpose. They didn't add any depth to the characters (again due to the 'wonderful' director's skills), didn't add anything new or interesting to the story. Probably they were used in hopes to appease the 'chick flick' lovers.        Having said all that, I still gave the movie 1 star because of the special effects. They werenot bad, I did like the way the pensieve and memories were depicted. However, that alone can't make a film.  Considering that David Yates will film the last 2 films in the series, I don't think I'll be going to see them in the movies; will wait for the dvd to come out and borrow from a friend.
0553381687|3.0|This is a review of the \\"Song of Ice and Fire\\" series, not just the first book.<br /><br />I struggled with how to rate this.  Full disclosure:  I stopped reading this series halfway through the third book, just couldn't finish.  That is not to say that I think it's a bad series, it's just not for me.  While I appreciate that GRRM included serious themes, (especially in a genre that tends to be very formulaic) it was just overwhelmingly dark.  I found myself opening the book every night with the question \\"well, I wonder who will get raped tonight?\\".  I made it past the twincest (especially hard for me as I am a twin), infanticide, torture, etc... but the part I couldn't get over was GRRM killing off EVERY single character I liked.  Look, I understand that the books are about war, and people die in war, but you spend literally 1000 pgs getting attached to a character only to see them die.  And not just die, die in awful, horrible ways for no discernable literary reason.<br /><br />I suppose I would say that as long as you know what you're getting into with these, go for it.  The world GRRM created is vast, impressive, and absorbing.  He writes well and the story is unique to be sure.  It just wasn't for me.

B000B5OD4I|2.0|This is a really nice solid watch - looks and feels great (gets compliments from time to time).    Some reviewers have commented on the lightness of the strap. They are right, it feels a little weird at first to have a light strap and heavy watch. Don't worry, you'll get used to it very quickly.    However, after about a year of use with no problems, suddely the watch started running fast. Now it's usual that automatics run a little fast, but this is ridiculous - 20 minutes per day.    Being up to 20 minutes out on any given day simply isn't acceptable. There's no way I'd use it as a dive watch - wouldn't trust it to tell me whether there was gas left in my tanks. I sent it back to seiko - who serviced it and there has been no improvement. Time to send it back again...    Worth buying anyway because of it's great look and feel, but you'd be gambling that you get one which doesn't run fast.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|i can almost see arcade fire playing a moon lit concert with a band like neutral milk hotel, in a hot and sweaty setting in the midst of a glowing southern american grove of some sort. people arriving on their feet and leaving long after stunned by the almost spiritual awakening they had just experienced. this music here is moving, not only to the fans of it, but to other striving bands who want to make something creative, new and daring. this is a work of art that bleeds heart, and originality. it's loud when its feeling confident, and soft when it's vulnerable, almost as if it lives. the arcade fire raised the bar so high for themselves here it almost hurts whatever comes after this album (i.e. neon bible) because it wont be topped. yet if they do someday top this i wont be surprised. highly enjoyable, and greatly important in todays world of music. thank god for cd's like this that remind us all of what a wonderful and new experience modern music can still be.
0061730327|4.0|This is a truly inspirational book and also one of amazement.  Thankfully this 14 yo boy was discovered.    The book provides a glimpse into farm life that has seen little change for generations.  The view into this life is truly extraordinary, especially for city folk like myself.  It makes you want to live a more simple life, but certainly not in the same existence as this boy and his family.  It's truly a harsh environment.  Anyway, from there you learn the hardships of the boy and his family.  The amazing part is how this boy creates a windmill from scraps and uses it to power various devices within his home and village.  From there, he is discovered and things really begin to take off.    It's an amazing story and peeks into the life seldom seen or appreciated/respected.  The book is an easy read.  Highly recommended.

0887307280|1.0|Old book that does not even mention the internet.  While systems are important in a business, it must be run using new technology tools otherwise you are out of business fast because your competitor will take market share from you.  This was a good book in the 1990's but not now.  Because of the forms in the back of the book it appears to be a lead generation tool for their $12000 per year consulting program.

A lot of speculative science, and a lot of interesting historical facts.  But the middle is pretty good and fun. Classic Dan Brown. Don't miss it.

0743289692|2.0|As a sympathizer with today's Muslims, as they reel under the blows of militant imperialism, I picked up this provocative title for insight into opposing views. Ayaan's story -- the cruelty against women in Somalia, and her dash to freedom -- is moving and inspiring. It's a forceful reminder of the need for moderate and progressive Islam to supplant extremism and anachronism.<br /><br />Ayaan has exchanged a world view where Islam has all the answers to the reverse, a blind faith in the West. She can't see Islam as another religion in the Abrahamic tradition, a brave effort burdened by the human vices and cultural baggage we all struggle under. Religions are only as good as their membership. Despite today's need for reforms on women's rights, Islam did pioneer values of equality, brotherhood and religious tolerance six centuries before the Catholic Inquisition.<br /><br />People don't realize how much today's Middle East is the fruit of centuries of Western influence. It is Saudi oil wealth that funds the spread of Islamic fundamentalism, and it was the British who replaced the moderate, civil Hashemite dynasty with the Saudis and Wahhabis in the late 18th century. Then in the 20th, Britain broke Arabia off from cosmopolitan Turkey, to become their dependency.<br /><br />All classic divide-and-conquer doctrine -- extremism isolates a rival power from potential allies, according to \\"Islamic Fundamentalism: Fostered by US Foreign Policy,\\" chapter 15 of 9/11 Synthetic Terror: Made in USA, by W. G. Tarpley. Also, in Terrorism and the Illuminati, David Livingstone writes, \\"Islam does not pose a threat to the West. It is the contrary that is correct. Islamic terrorist organizations are hotbeds of impostors in service of Western imperialistic objectives.\\"<br /><br />Nor is the empire averse to using liberal ideas for the same ends, the way British intrigue used the Enlightenment figures whom Ayaan admires to foment the French Revolution and topple France, their greatest rival. Similar tactics are used today to excite gullible idealists against any government that does not bow down to the money masters' scheme of things.<br /><br />In our time, the US put Saddam and the Taliban in power to crush the left, then used them as a casus belli to take over their oil and gas. And the American Enterprise Institute has drafted Ayaan as a token cheerleader for these wars. I was shocked to find her beating the drums on her blog to escalate the war on Afghanistan. Her own autobiography documents all too well how women and children suffer the most from war.<br /><br />Ayaan's worst suffering in Africa came not from Muslim men, but from the absence of her father Abeh, a moderate, enlightened Muslim. Here again there is a geopolitical dimension. Abeh was a freedom fighter against the Somali dictator Siad Barre -- a Marxist atheist. History's worst mass murderers -- Jingiz Khan, Stalin, Hitler, Pol Pot -- were either atheist or agnostic. The problem is not religion, but that people are so easily duped. Religion is just one of many factors used by the unscrupulous to divide and conquer.<br /><br />Ayaan gives a fascinating anecdote of Siad Barre's last days, how he sent his death squads on false-flag operations, massacring people and writing in blood that it was done by the rival clan. We all know the result, the disintegration of Somalia into genocide, famine and warlordism. Yet it doesn't occur to Ayaan that 9/11 was also a false flag op? Enough has been written on 9/11 for an intelligent person to take notice.<br /><br />On his return, unfortunately, Abeh brings the final straw, arranging her marriage -- against her wishes. Much as one sympathizes with her flight to freedom, no doubt the ancient custom of matchmaking served a useful purpose, and might be welcomed even today, as long as free choice is respected. Young people in the West spend man-years of time and energy to find a mate. Yet the result is a disastrous divorce rate, which further weakens our social fabric. Ayaan herself is apparently single and childless.<br /><br />She is mistaken that there is nothing the West could learn from the East, or that Islamic countries are congenitally incapable of reform. A few years ago, Morocco's new King reformed the family law to reinstate the rights of women. Although it will take time for the culture to adapt, there has always been a great constituency for progress in the Islamic world, which cannot afford to hobble half its population, as Ayaan says. The crux is that Western imperialism has always lined up to subvert, destabilize or crush progressives, because only they have the potential to liberate their countries from today's neo-colonialist regime.<br /><br />I only hope Ayaan's work helps mobilize those progressive forces, rather than becoming a another alibi for the oppression of Muslims by the powers that be -- capitalizing on another divide-and-conquer front, men against women? More provocateur than peacemaker, she is still a great writer, and I hope she writes more. (I've offered to publish her next book, about an encounter between Mohammed and Enlightenment philosophers, but got no reply.)<br /><br />I hope she also reads more from alternative views. There IS another, very different slant on things, and the Western media, even the NYT bestseller list, can not be blindly trusted to tell you about it! That viewpoint is more effectively suppressed in the West than by any repressive regime.<br /><br />Ayaan does lack information needed to interpret events. I lost her on the equation, 9/11 = zero God. The Enlightenment thinkers she admires believed in a Creator, for the simple Reason that the universe could not create itself. Ayaan's expedient, that life somehow just creates itself, earns no marks for analytical curiosity faced with the ultimate mystery -- why does anything exist in the first place?<br /><br />For me, 9/11 was a huge marker in an opposite direction. It laid bare the unfathomable depravity of the rulers of the West. The proofs are manifold and overwhelming, beyond a shadow of doubt: 9/11 was a war pretext made in USA. WTC Towers 1 and 2 -- and #7, the collapse covered up by the media -- were all destroyed by controlled demolition and nanothermite, not airplanes. The alleged Muslim hijackers were fakes or patsies...<br /><br />Ayaan could have saved herself and her Dutch hosts a world of trouble by absorbing two Mohammedan teachings -- to respect other people's beliefs, and speak to people in terms they understand. Two tips on social hygiene that also happen to be values held by Dutch politicians. You don't get through to people by shock, by insulting what they hold sacred.<br /><br />Muslims do need persuasive voices to help distinguish between what is timeless in their faith, and what is old cultural baggage. Islam came into the world in the 7th century, in the depth of the Dark Ages, a time of extreme cruelty and ignorance. So the claim that Islam's dispensations regarding women were meant to protect them is not an empty one. Even today, women still need protection, but of a different kind for a different time.<br /><br />To sum up, Infidel is a masterpiece -- as anti-Islamic propaganda. As an autobiography, it is a tale of great promise, but great disappointment -- a story of a well-meaning young person who got in over her depth, fell into a trap, and became a tool for the enemies of her people.ldless.    She is mistaken that there is nothing the West could learn from the East, or that Islamic countries are congenitally incapable of reform.

Ayaan's expedient, that life somehow just creates itself, earns no marks for analytical curiosity faced with the ultimate mystery -- why does anything exist in the first place?    For me, 9/11 was a huge marker in an opposite direction. It laid bare the unfathomable depravity of the rulers of the West. The proofs are manifold and overwhelming, beyond a shadow of doubt: 9/11 wasa war pretext made in USA. WTC Towers 1 and 2 -- and #7, the collapse covered up by the media -- were all destroyed by controlled demolition and nanothermite, not airplanes. The alleged Muslim hijackers were fakes or patsies...    Ayaan could have saved herself and her Dutch hosts a world of trouble by absorbing two Mohammedan teachings -- to respect other people's beliefs, and speak to people in terms they understand. Two tips on social hygiene that also happen to be values held by Dutch politicians. You don't get through to people by shock, by insulting what they hold sacred.    Muslims do need persuasive voices to help distinguish between what is timeless in their faith, and what is old cultural baggage. Islam came into the world in the 7th century, in the depth of the Dark Ages, a time of extreme cruelty and ignorance. So the claim that Islam's dispensations regarding women were meant to protect them is not an empty one. Even today, women still need protection, but of a different kind for a different time.    To sum up, Infidel is a masterpiece -- as anti-Islamic propaganda. As an autobiography, it is a tale of great promise, but great disappointment -- a story of a well-meaning young person who got in over her depth, fell into a trap, and became a tool for the enemies of her people.

B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I finally saw Cloverfield.  Yet another hand-held camera saga with batteries that never ever seem to run down... I would imagine the production costs for these are fairly reasonable.    This is a fun little sci-fi flick.  It would have been a lot better if they had scrapped the first half-hour where we were getting to know the empty headed yuppies.  That was entirely unnecessary, since these \\"characters\\" were simply window dressing.  It reminded me a lot of the old 50's science fiction movies in many ways. maybe that was intentional - who knows.  It almost felt like a parody sometimes.    We eventually get to the part where a horrifying giant creature raises havoc in Manhattan, and that's a lot of fun. I also got a lot of unintentional amusement from some of the ridiculous inconsistencies in the movie; for example, the girlfriend who was able to run like the wind after having her chest speared with a piece of rebar.    All in all, well worth a look if you like science fiction, with a bit of apocalyptic city destruction thrown in.

0345495004|5.0|I live in NY and have been to the Guggenheim Museum several times.  I knew it was designed by Frank Lloyd Wright and knew a little about him, mostly about his organic approach to architecture.  This book is the story of Wright's love affair with Mameh Borthwick Cheney, an affair that had tragic consequences.<br /><br />In 1903 Frank Lloyd Wright was hired to design and build a house for Edwin and Mameh Cheney. The two began an affair and in 1907 they left their respective spouses and children and ran off to Europe, becoming the fodder for scandal sheets for many years.<br /><br />Very little is known about Mameh Borthwick, few pictures of her survive and many of her writings have disappeared, but Nancy Horan has done a remarkable job in creating a fully realized character in this fictionalized account of her life with Wright. Mameh was an extremely bright woman, educated, fluent in several languages and a firm supporter of the burgeoning Woman's Suffrage movement. Living within the confines and mores in the early 20th century seemed to stifle her and she felt that she was not living her life but observing it passing her by. In Frank Lloyd Wright Mameh felt she had found her soul mate and was willing to give up her marriage and family in order to be with him. They lived in Europe and returned to Wisconsin where Wright built his famous home Taliesin, where after several years their life together came to a startling ending.<br /><br />I was very taken by this book almost from the start, despite the fact that in general I don't like books about adultery.  Although the book is a love story it is in no way a romance book, it is about the genius of the egotistical Wright but more so it is Mameh's story that will captivate you, in particular her naivet&eacute; in believing that her choice would eventually be accepted by society and her family.  The ending is shocking and made me cry, not something I do often while reading. This was a very compelling story and beautifully written, and I recommend it very highly.ry highly.

B00005K9LN|4.0|judas priest released british steel in 1980.i remember at the time[in 1980], hearing on the radio a rumour that the master tapes for britsh steel were stolen at the time.however all rumours aside british steel is a great album from priest and a good follow up to unleashed in the east which was released in 1979 and was their first live album.before recording began on british steel judas priest hired drummer dave holland to replace les binks.dave holland stayed with priest until 1989.british steel has many great classic priest songs on it many of which are still played today.for me the best cuts are,rapid fire,metal gods,living after midnight,breaking the law,the rage and steeler.the bonus are interesting too.if you want one of judas priest,s finest albums this is a good choice for the collection!

B000AMPZF8|5.0|What can I say about Muse? Having become intimately acquainted with the band's back-catalogue over the past few years, I'm sure their motto must be:   'When in doubt, borrow shamelessly and often!'     Thankfully, that's not always a bad thing when it comes to Muse's second studio offering, Origin of Symmetry, which is by turns a frenetic, harrowing, solemn and riotous musical adventure.  Not content to be restricted to any specific genre, Muse thought they'd give 'em all a go here.  Thus the listener is treated to a series of epics that deftly blur the lines between alternative, prog rock, grunge, goth and classical... plus a smattering of Spanish guitar thrown in for good measure.    At times Bellamy's gaspy-raspy vocal \\"style\\" sounds less emotive and more like he's in the midst of a bad asthma attack (such as on opener New Born).  That aside, New Born is one of the best songs on the album; beginning with a tentative yet haunting keyboard line then exploding into a brain-shredding guitar riff.  Along with third single Bliss, it pays due homage to past gods of rock, without being an obvious rip-off.     The same cannot be said for Citizen Erased however.  While personally one of my most beloved tracks off the album (but then again, I AM a Radiohead fan) it sounds uncannily like a really good mash-up of Paranoid Android/Kashmir.  (In contrast to later-era Muse epics, which sound like conglomerations of Bohemian Rhapsody/the Time Warp, hehe)  Also, I immediately recognised the intro to Plug in Baby, which appears to have been lifted directly from Bach's Toccata and Fugue - or at least from the Sky cover.    While Matt Bellamy certainly began his musical life as Thom Yorke's more flamboyant younger brother - it's no use protesting all you fellow Radiohead obsessives! - his not-so-gradual metamorphosis into a campy Freddie Mercury-Robert Plant hybrid arguably reached its zenith on Black Holes and Revelations and latest release, The Resistance.  However, the change frompost-adolescent wail of anguish to over-dramatic falsetto is startlingly apparent even on this earlier album.     For example on Micro Cuts in particular, Bellamy could easily pass for a psychotic Maria Callas.  For some reason he chose to sing this ENTIRE song in the highest, most blood-curdling register he could manage to sustain.  Has this guy never heard the saying \\"too much of a good thing\\"?  All props to producers Bottrill and Leckie though.  Lesser men would've burst an ear-drum during the recording process.    However for me, the tail end of the album is where things get really interesting, and possibly more original.  Darkshines, with it's sexually-charged subversiveness, slowly burned itself into my consciousness.  And who'd have guessed Muse could pull off such a stunning rendition of the jazz classic Feeling Good?  The Spanish guitar and subdued vocals on Screenager make for a welcome change of pace, but it's the odd loping rhythm and majestic pipe organ on Megalomania that provide the most unique moment on this album. (Despite the fact that the bass-line sounds exactly like 'Clint Eastwood' by Gorillaz) ;)    All in all, I'd recommend Origin of Symmetry if you like your music loud, proud and waaaaay over the top.
B0030EWB96|5.0|That's right! Not a stitch! Well, obviously, I meant unaccompanied by any other musician, just her alone on an acoustic piano, with no effects, no synthesizers, etc. What did you \\"think\\" I meant?! Huh?    Anyway, another great piece of work by the brilliant pianist, with more incredible speed, phrasing, dynamics, beauty, humour, fire and wit. It may take part of the first song, or even a couple to adjust to the unaccompanied instrument, but it soon feels quite nice! Quite natural.     Not content to simply play brilliant piano with her own unique touch, she'll imitate a stand up bass by somehow (I'm guessing) pounding on the bass strings in one song, or tapping away somehow in another, (again on the strings), to reproduce something akin to a harpsichord. Having seen the Hiromi DVDs, I can picture Hiromi stretched out, practically inside the piano to hit the strings with one hand, while simultaneously hitting the regular keys with the other! Not only is Hiromi a brilliant player, but I really enjoy her writing too, having written all but two tracks on this CD.    I now have almost all her albums, except \\"Another Mind\\" which I'll soon be getting. Since Hiromi has featured so much wonderful piano on all of these albums, I'm hoping that one of these days she'll also give us something on a Fender Rhodes and Hammond B3 (picture Hiromi playing Brian Auger's keyboards, for example). Wow! I can imagine it! But for the toally \\"acoustic\\", totally Hiromi and piano only, this CD is an absolute gem!
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|I purchased this along with the Kings of Leon live at the O2 in London, and both are great. The Killers sound great, and the picture quality is spot on. Lighting and stage design is great. It really puts on a great display - especially coupled with an HDTV and Surround sound. I've never had the chance to see them live - but this was probably the next best thing - in some ways better. The multiple angles and clean sound make the experience a little more pleasant than the sometimes rough sound at a bad theater setting.    I gave this product a 5 Star rating because I feel that it meets all the requirements for good entertainment, great sound, great picture quality, good subject matter, a full track list, and a great overall experience. If you like the Killer's, you'll love this!

0307588335|5.0|So I thought I understood the sub-prime mortgage crisis, that is until I read \\"A Colossal Failure of Common Sense\\" by Lawrence McDonald and Patrick Robinson.  McDonald's personal and professional perspectives from within the crisis shed light on one of the greatest financial tragedies of our time.   This, combined with Robinson's writing experience, makes \\"Colossal\\" a must read for anyone hoping for an insider's view of this historical event.    What I didn't understand prior to reading this book was how the decisions of so few individuals destroyed an entire world economy and so many lives along with it.  I was stunned by the apparent attitude of both the \\"body builder\\" types as well as Lehman's top brass who felt that \\"whoever dies with the most toys wins.\\"  Their inability to grasp the consequences of their actions is intolerable.     McDonald's book is more than a study of the failure of one organization.  It really represents a window into the challenges our financial system faces and how a lack of prudence can create a world-wide crisis.  It also shows the inter-dependence of our world financial systems.  No longer can the U.S. sell bad debt to a foreign investor and not feel the negative impact of such decisions.    I enjoyed McDonald's candidness in retelling personal interactions with each character in his book.  In sharing his experiences on Lehman's trading floor - both good and bad - he brought each individual in the story to life.  It's one thing to read a headline that says, \\"Sub-prime mortgage crisis is hurting U.S. economy.\\"  It's a completely different ball game when the crisis is brought to a personal level.  That's exactly what McDonald accomplishes with his book.

B00007KWHG|5.0|LETTERS...WE GET LETTERS...<br />I tell ya people, when you're a famous Seer like I am, sometimes you have to take a few hits along the way (as opposed to discussing the hits as I am here). Wanda Lovecraft from Fran's Beauty Parlor in Bayonne writes: \\"When you gonna do a review of the Four Seasons? My brother is a first cousin twice removed and a generation away from Frankie. Get with it Metamorpho, or I'll use my fake nails on you\\"! Then, if that wasn't enough to turn my blood cold, I received another from Big Bill who works for Sam's Welding and Chop Shop, outside of Cleveland. \\"My buddies and I listen to the oldies all day. They're not happy you're not reviewing our music. Take the hint\\"! Then Lao Ze wrote from China and said my reviews were lousy (!). I suppose this only proves that my selfless goal of saving the world is not so easy. Anyway......<br /><br />I actually did write a review of this selection many half-moons ago. I posted it and then it disappeared altogether. It is floating out there on the internet somewhere. The last I heard was that it could be in the Ukraine and a Russian woman is using it to keep her kids in line. Then I heard that a Cat Hospital in Brazil used it for a kitty litter liner. But, popular belief is that Oprah got it and it was implemental in her retirement. I hope not. All I need are more letters.<br /><br />Anyway, again, your Metamorpho donned his wayfarers, combed his hair into a ducktail, and made his way (with laptop in tow) to Tony's Pizzaria in Newark, NJ. I had to in order to write this. Ambiance, as you know, is very essential to doing justice to a review.<br /><br />I will state here and now that, if your pop collection means anything to you, and you want the really \\"good stuff\\" throughout the decades, then this is definitely for you. Ahhhh... what a success these guys were. And, it's still a pleasure to hear this even today. They somehow, despite writing about the trials and conditions of adolescent love, managed to make each tune a joy somehow. And, mind you, they came out at a time whereby harmonies were king, but moved doo-wop upwards on the evolutionary scale of American music. Take note, when the British Invasion hit and American groups were falling left and right, these guys continued, hit after hit. Why? Well I feel it was that the band sound contributed to the effect. The lush harmonies, the backbeat, and the fact that the song writing and groove it produced was exemplary for the times. And timing is EVERYTHING when it comes to the American, a go-go popular scene is concerned. Of course, everything has it's day. But, music of qualtiy lasts, even if it's at a time whereby half of the people on earth weren't even born yet. Thank God Metamorpho is here to inform all.<br /><br />Ahh... it's 1962 or something and all of a sudden \\"Sherry\\" hits the airwaves. How green was my valli at this point? But, good grief, that falsetto is to die for. Even today, it's one of the 7th wonders of the modern day world. (I am 8th, but who's counting?). I mean, who can ever debate today that they don't secretly feel a condsiderable charge when on \\"Big Girl's Don't Cry\\" Frankie goes the extra mile with \\"don't cry-yi-yi\\". It's easy to see the other Seasons may have been the heart of this group, but Frankie was always the soul. Also the personality.<br /><br />The topics were relevant for the teen-age audience that tuned in at the time. The motifs of: I'm not good enough for you (or you for me) but we love each other anyway; my heart aches and I want you back (Ronnie); don't leave, we have something valuable here (Save it For Me, Let's Hang On); pride (Walk Like a Man, Big Man in Town) and I could go on and on about how pleasurable teen angst was back then. The Four Seasons had their hand on the pulse of young America. Bob Gaudio, their main songwriter, was also an essential element for the success of this group.<br /><br />The Four Seasons were. perhaps, one of the most successful groups of the 60's and their legacy will live on in the annuls of popular music. Distinctive, harmonic, falsetto filled, they were, and remain, an icon of popular music. There's not a lot of music out there that gives you real joy. This one does and does not disappoint. Get it. I guarantee a smile will cross your face.<br /><br />Now, I hope that I won't get any more letters from the above fans. However, I am sure that there will be other disaffected fans who will write. I tell ya people, being all things to all people is a constant uphill battle.

1582701709|4.0|There have been many books written on thinking and how it affects our lives. Look at Bernie Siegel's books where he has known patients with terminal illnesses become cured through love, positive thinking and self healing. There's also the book, As a Man Thinketh which talks about how we become what we think about. Even the Bible talks about how we are what we devote ourselves to -- your heart is where your treasure is. The Secret isn't new, I think this incarnation of it has caught on because it's been cleverly marketed. Some people here say it's a load of bunk, but I can attest that in my own life I have noticed that depressive thoughts begets depression and I have even been told my therapists that if you're depressed the best way to get out of it (aside from medications when necessary) is to force yourself. One doc told me that I can't wait for the depression to lift before taking action, I have to take action and THEN the depression will lift. He was right. I have had times in my life where I've felt really good about myself, I've thought myself as a healthy person and during those times had little to no illness. Then I've had times I've thought myself as a sick person and was plagued with symptoms and problems. And that's ten years before The Secret was even published. I don't know about the spiritual or religious aspects but I think that you really can change yourself and your health etc. by the way you think. The Bible even says to capture your thoughts and to think about whatever is true and pure and good. And that advice is 2000 years old. So don't be too quick to cast The Secret aside. It may not be perfect and it's really fallen into the whole \\"super capitalism/greed\\" scheme of things but your thinking really can dictate how you feel and what you produce, and who wants to be around you and so on.

I have bought this book for more than a dozen people and received glowing reviews from all the recipients. Anyone who is a small business owner and who wants to grow their business, or anyone who is thinking of starting a business should read this book. Way to go Michael!

This documentary was a showcase to his inner soul, thanks from a new fan.
B000002BBY|5.0|I'm a little older and its been a few years but I still remember the impact this had when it came out. I was a very young 29 and I felt like I was part of a movement during the summer of 95 that believed in Oasis, that was championing their rise to greatness. It had nothing to do with the hype surrounding them, and there was alot, but for what they were, a truly great rock band riding high on a record for the ages. I think this was the last time that I felt connected musically to something this important. After 15 years I can still listen to this record in its glory, still as powerful and poignant as it was in 95 when it came out. \\"Definitely Maybe\\" is also a great album that attracted myself and many to the then brilliant Oasis. Morning Glory blasted Oasis forward into another realm of artistry and equally importantly onto American radio. I agree with many of the reviews here, that this album needs to be listened to in its entirity, rather than as a bunch of songs randomly  shuffled around in ones IPOD. What I consider to be  the \\"Epics\\" on the disc, Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, Roll With It, Some Might Say,  stand on there own no doubt. The stuff thats in the middle is equally brilliant, acting as vital connectors. I love every single song on this album, because like Abbey Road or Exile on Mainstreet, all the songs that are there... are supposed to be there and in order, for a reason, never to be messed around with as downloadable units tossed into someones sea of MP3s. I loved, also,  the fact that against considerable odds, Oasis were able to put a signifigant dent in the American market. No British band even came close to making this type of impact and there were some good ones. Saw them play all of both albums at a summer festival in Barrie Ontario, summer of 96 and I felt and still feel that I was witnessing history. Oasis at that time were the biggest and best band on the planet. Unfortunately that would all end a short while later when all the beauty and simplicity went out the window with the pomp and bombast of \\"Be Here Now\\" and every other small slice of mediocrity that followed.    Man...they were good and I am glad I was there to witness it all first hand.    FYI  The only thing they ever did that comes anywhere near this brilliance is \\"The Masterplan\\" (B-Sides and outtakes). A stunning collection of songs that blows everthing else anyone was doing in 98, away. Thats how good they were folks.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This is an exceptional movie! Temple Grandin has made it possible for me to actually understand why my son gets upset when there is a sudden or loud noise, or even when I am talking a bit loudly sitting next to him. It does cause extreme pain. The visual and increased sound the movie links together at different moments throughout the movie give us a clear understanding that I had not been able to reach on my own. Temple's mother shows us that people with autism/asperger's syndrome are indeed \\"different, but not less\\".  Something I have been trying to get across to many people throughout the years. Seeing how Temple's mother would not give up made me realize I am not alone. The public school district psychologist told me my son would never have an IQ past 1st grade level. I would not accept that! I worked with him, got him into a Christian school that was open-minded and open-hearted. This year he will graduate from a christian college prep school with minor modifications and attend college next year.  Temple and her mother are great examples that anything is possible......just don't give up.  Those who have enjoyed this movie and have been inspired by it will also enjoy seeing a movie also released this year called, \\"Adam\\".
1449536689|4.0|A diamond is stolen from the English country estate of Lady Verinder and the renowned Sergeant Cuff is brought in from London to help solve the case. The diamond, said to bring bad luck to its owner because it was stolen from a temple in India, was given to Lady Verinder's daughter, Rachel, on her 18th birthday. It was bequeathed to Rachel from her uncle (who stole it when he was a young soldier) on his death. The story unfolds through several narrators, all of whom know a piece of what happened. As each of them writes his or her side of the story, the reader gets just a little more information that helps to solve the mystery.    Considered to be the first detective mystery, The Moonstone by Wilkie Collins offers a glimpse into the times it was written--the 1860s.  It was published serially, with new pieces of the story unfolding one section at a time for around six months. It reveals the understandings held about English ladies and gentleman, especially the thought that no well brought up young man or woman could ever commit a crime. It touches on a common occurrence at the time, the looting of jewels by English soldiers from temples in India. And, it's fun to read once you get into the rhythm of Collins's writing style (writers at the time were paid by the word, so you won't find sparse descriptions and conversations here).    Each narrator brought a different perspective and style that was refreshing, and each break kept the story moving in unexpected ways. My daughter and I both found it fun to guess what had happened the night of the theft and in the days following it. My guesses were invariably wrong, but that didn't stop me from developing new theories as the story progressed. My daughter's guess about the culprit was right, although neither of us anticipated some of the twists and turns The Moonstone took before the mystery was actually resolved.    The Moonstone is longer reading for mother-daughter book clubs, but it is easily divided into two separate sections that can be discussed at two different meetings. Groups could read The Loss of the Diamond, then gather to discuss their theories about what happened. They could also write predictions down and compare them to what actually happened during the rest of the book when they meet again. I recommend The Moonstone for reading groups with girls aged 14 and up.

B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Hardware compatability first: This Blu-ray movie played flawlessly in my homebuilt entertainment PC with an LG blu-ray player and a Radeon 4650 AGP (HDCP compliant) video card.<br />Okay, now the movie review: I am a long time fan of well done cartoons, either traditionally cell inked (or watercolored, as with \\"Lilo & Stitch\\") or computer generated, and for many years Disney and then Pixar have set the standard for animation quality.  \\"Up\\" succeeds where some recent CG cartoons like \\"Cars\\" have, in my opinion, failed, because good animation alone is not enough.  Not only is \\"Up\\" beautifully crafted, it has a strong and engaging storyline that, in typical Disney tradition, operates on two levels: one for the youngsters (the histerically funny bird, the dogs), and one for adults (the grieving widower).  Are there holes in the plot?  Of course there are: in a movie where a house is pulled off its foundation by helium-filled balloons, what do you expect?  It's a cartoon!<br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone looking for some quality \\"escape\\" time, either in standard definition DVD or Blu-ray (which I treated myself to for the improved graphics).<br />By the way, my kids are grown and on their own --- I collect these movies for myself.
B00337KMAA|5.0|UP IN THE AIR<br /><br />STARRING: George Clooney, Vera Farmiga, Anna Kendrick, Jason Bateman, Danny McBride, Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey, J.K. Simmons, Zach Galifianakis and Sam Elliot<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jason Reitman and Sheldon Turner; based on the novel by Walter Kern<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Jason Reitman<br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Comedy<br />Release Date: 23 December 2009<br /><br />I wouldn't say George Clooney is one of the best actors as far as range is concerned; but he is a long way from the worst and is certainly one of the most likable. Clooney brings his own charisma to the screen that's nothing short of A-list status. It's his unique delivery and charming personality that makes him so enjoyable to watch and there is no shortage of either in the hilarious comedy, Up in the Air.<br /><br />Clooney plays Ryan Bingham; a guy who's more comfortable in a three piece suit than he would be in his pajamas or lounge-wear. He has fired so many people throughout his career that he can't remember the last time he actually hired someone.<br /><br />He is exceptional at this. He's a fire extinguisher to ruckuses and potential lawsuits. His company is so enthralled with his `tact' of letting people go, that they spend a small fortune sending him all over the country to do so, for other companies.<br /><br />It's because of this lifestyle that Ryan prefers being `up in the air' than down on the ground. `Up in the air' meaning the amount of time he spends flying to and from cities to fire people. There are perhaps half a dozen or more additional metaphors to be found in the title; one of the biggest being that his character lives `up in the air' instead of in reality with the rest of us.<br /><br />He has no wife, no kids, no pets and no friends. What little family he has, barely considers him relevant. His home is an absolute joke and is less appealing than the frequent hotels he spends more than two thirds of every year, living in. He has only his career and the occasional one night stand here and there; forming from a few cocktails at whatever hotel's bar he spends his evening at.<br /><br />It's at one of these said locations, that he meets his match, Alex; played delightfully by Vera Farmiga. Thank God someone has finally given her the Oscar nomination she has been so deserving of!<br /><br />Farmiga plays Alex to be every bit as pathetic as Ryan, in reference to their similar tastes and personalities. Naturally, neither of them wants any sort of a commitment. With all of that as un-satisfying as it may sound to the majority - Ryan couldn't be happier.<br /><br />His world is flipped upside down however, when his company grows weary of the financial strain that this brings to them each fiscal year. They hire an uptight young woman straight out of college, with her hair pulled back just a little too tight, to put a new plan in motion.<br /><br />The woman is 23-year-old Natalie Keener, played magnificently by Anna Kendrick. Her plan is to ground the twenty-something employees they fly around excessively to fire people. They will instead, do all of their terminating electronically via web-cam. Sounds thoughtful huh?<br /><br />Ryan is crushed to say the least. We get the sad-puppy-dog-Clooney face that we have all become familiar with, as he sits in his chair barely able to breathe during this little conference. Whatever will he do? What will his life become if he is to be stuck in the same location day in and day out? Ryan can't and won't let that happen.<br /><br />He challenges the youngster in front of their boss, played terrifically by Jason Bateman. Ryan outsmarts her, but in the end is put side by side with her to finish out the last few clients that are to be let go in person. This scene is very smartly written, well acted and hysterical, as was the entire film.<br /><br />In addition to enjoying his job to the fullest extent possible, Ryan's other goal is to reach a certain amount of frequent flyer miles. The number is so disgusting that I won't even share it with you. Should Ryan hit his target number, he will be awarded with a string of nuances, and will be among an elite single digit number of people to have done this, in the world.<br /><br />On their last few firing frenzies together, we learn a lot about Ryan and we learn a lot about Natalie and hopefully a thing or two about ourselves. They help each other with personal problems and character flaws, which are to be expected, but it's never predictable or corny. There are some very nice twists rolled into the second and third acts as well, including a major one, that I never saw coming.<br /><br />The film is full of laugh-out-loud moments that couldn't have been better written. The story moves along at 100 miles an hour and we are never bored even for a second. I've heard some people consider it to be a comedy / drama, and it does contain some dramatic elements; but it's very much a comedy, to me.<br /><br />Clooney definitely has some competition from the other nominees, in regards to taking home the Oscar, but we will see what happens. Up in the Air is well deserving of every single nomination it received and it could easily walk away with several of them.<br /><br />I liked writer / director Jason Reitman's first film Thank You for Smoking, I loved his second film Juno, and this was his best one yet. The man is severely talented and with these three perfect films under his belt, it's safe to say the sky is the limit for him. Don't worry I won't be overly cheesy and say that his success will bring him `Up in the air.' That would be too much.ll be awarded with a string of nuances, and will be among an elite single digit number of people to have done this, in the world.

B002ZG997C|1.0|In short - this movie is horrible!  First off, it has a blatant fundamentalist-evangelical theme.  Mad-Max after the Rapture.  Make a religious propaganda movie all you want but inform the audience what they're getting themselves into.  I feel I was dupped into watch something that made me feel very uncomfortable.  In reading the many positive reviews here, it strikes me as troubling how many people have no trouble with the fundamentalist message of this flick - it didn't even seem to register. Have fantasies of violence paired with a dubious religious agenda really become this mainstream? Is the new brand of hero a guy with a bible in one hand and a gun in the other?  Even if it weren't for all the evangelizing this movie is just a bad movie.  Too many scenes with drawn-out gratuitous camera shots, dialog that is often cartoonish and so corny it made me cringe, over-the-top fight scenes (Kill Bill without the humor) and gratuitous violence (which I have no problem with were it not used to transport a religious agenda), a whole array of preposterous scenes: an old husband and wife team shooting it out with thugs using their cache of submachine guns, thugs shooting up a farmhouse with an arsenal of guns, bazookas & gatlin guns (!) only to miss the 2 main characters standing behind a wooden wall, hero being shot pointblank but not suffering a scratch (God protected him I guess), a teenage girl turning into the new road warrior without training, silly voice-overs, a civilization subsisting on almost no water, a guy taking 30 years to walk across the US, cannibal couple living in the middle of the waste lands but miraculously stocked up on a constant supply of fresh meat, thugs destroying their only bar in town just for the sake of destroying it (where d'we go to have a drink now boss...duh), awkward scenes abound (the saying-grace at breakfast scene), Hero shooting a crappy self-made kids bow with lethal precision and then neglecting to retrieve his valuable arrows in a land where everything is scavanged, and on and on.

0307454541|1.0|I guess those who rated this book highly must have been accountants or museum curators. I say that because this is the dryest book I've ever read. I strained to read it and only continued because I thought there must be something a the end that made the drudgery of reading this worthwhile. But no, there wasn't. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a regurgitation of what may be financial historical fact coupled with droning and monotonous character descriptions. I've read good books and bad ones, but this is the first time I felt my money was completely wasted. There's a story in it, but it's just too difficult to wade through the dryness to get it.
B000FA5TTW|3.0|I was a little dissapointed with this novel for a few reasons:<br />1. The ending (which I don't want to spoil for anyone who hasn't read it yet)<br />2. Its been said that you can always tell a great story by the emotional effects it has on you, and although we are left angry or upset, the stories that have strong emotional effects on us are supposed to be the best. Unfortunatly, this was not the case with this novel. I was upset and loving it for the first half of the book, as is natural, but the Mother is a character that I despise in the novel and I feel like that last half of the book just made me angry at the Mom and ready to finish the book so I could move on to another one.<br />3. I was hoping Sebold would go into more detail about Heaven and describe the people in more detail. I was also dissapointed with the image of Heaven Sebold presented.<br />4. Once Susie had been dead for a few years, the story moves WAY too fast and I felt left behind, like I was hurrying to keep up and understand, and much of the passion felt for the characters early on is lost in the vague last half of the book.<br />5. It gets a little weird in some parts when we follow Susie into the private lives of her family and friends. I feel more like a peeping tom or a stalker than an innocent little girl.<br />6. The MOST dissapointing part of the book for me was the Ruth/Ray/Susie sex scene that was awkward and felt sleezy and inappropriate, not to mention completly unbelievable in a negative way.<br /><br />Overall, I do not regret reading this book because it is inspirational and a very unique plot with a deceased narrator. Also, I did fall in love with Susie's little brother and her father. They are truely great characters.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have always used a portable flash unit on my old slr's. Just popped them on the hotshoe and presto, instant lighting. However, with the newer DSLR's, the built in pop up flash is inadequate and just too weak. The Nikon SB-400 added to my Nikon D-40 makes all the difference in the world. I am not a professional, but take my photography seriously. This is the easiest to use, basic flash I have ever used. Combined with the electronics of the D-40 and the bounce capabilities of this flash. it makes this flash a no-brainer. Do yourself a favor and get it if you require basic (but excellent) results in your photographic endeavors. I have no reservations in highly recommending this flash unit. Pricewise, it knows no peers. You will not be disappointed.

I'm ordering Season One and Three today. Too bad I will have to wait a long time before Season Four is available on Amazon. I love history(even embellished), but in summary for this series, I'll just say that I would love for Jonathan Rhys Meyers to reach over in my bed and call me \\"sweethot\\"(sweetheart).
0446567337|5.0|I was able to get this book for 4bucks and some change, and with shipping and handling i spent less than 9 dollars! There is no way I could have got this good of a price at one of the book stores and the gas it would cost just to get to the book store. This is a great book, just like most of Nicholas Sparks's books. Its not a long read but I was able to finish in with in 48 hours. My friends and I swap books all the time and my friend that I let borrow the book got it done in 2 days too. You just dont want to put it down. I would rather have the original book cover than the movie picture, not that Channing Tatum isnt nice to look at, but thats just my personal preference. I love buying things from Amazon, for the most part, I am able to get things at cheaper prices than I can at the store or whatever. Happy shopping!

014241493X|4.0|I have turned into a John Green addict, and this book, this book was the cause of it. I had heard of John before, but he was really hyped and I remember a few years ago when Paper Towns came out there was so much promotion for it it kind of make me want to stab myself. It was everywhere, then the whole two covers thing, and at the time I was purely anti-contemporary fiction (Thank you Courtney Summers for showing me the error of my ways), it just wasn't my thing. And then I met Emilee and the deafening scream I heard all the way from Texas when she found out I hadn't read any of his stuff. So naturally, not willing to risking someone so awesome being angry at me, I saw it at the Flea Market and it became mine seconds later. I read it in December, and since then I have devoured Looking for Alaska and am working my way through An Abundance of Kathrines, and all I can wish for is that John could learn to write just a little faster. All I have left after this is Will Grayson, Will Grayson... and you know what? It's not enough. Not to mention it's not OUT YET!<br /><br />Anyway, I suppose you want to know something more than how much I'm in love with John & his writing/books/etc. So, Margo Roth Spiegelman? I wish she was my friend. The beginning when you first meet her and she starts her crazy tirade with Quentin, you get such a strong sense of personality that I think although she's only (pfft) a literary character it's hard as hell not to be drawn to her. The same could also be said for Quentin, but with Q instead of just seeing the character and liking it you're on a journey together. Because both of you will be undeniably drawn to Margo Roth Spiegelman, and you know what? Neither of you really have clue as to why. And in the end, I had no idea either, in fact I kind of sort of wanted to hit her with a car. But I still loved the character, it's a very topsy turvy world we serve.<br /><br />The most amazing thing I think John manages to pull off in his books is that he doesn't merely tell a story, and he doesn't just tell you about a bunch of characters, he brings those characters to life. Every word and every action anyone does jumped off the page and played through like a movie inside my head. The mystery of the entire book and the girl that is Margo Roth Spiegelman is completely intriguing, which surprised me of all people (and I'm sure a few others) since I live all but two hours from the main setting (Orlando, Florida) of the book. You'd think it would be less interesting, less intriguing, but it's not, it made me look at places I've been and things I've seen in a completely different light. Florida got a little less boring and mundane after reading this book, and I may have gone on a trip or two finding an abandoned mental hospital. Or not, I mean,... Anyway.<br /><br />Either way, whether you live in Florida or not, despite my avoidance of Paper Towns in the beginning it really is a book that needs to be read. If you like reading, you should read it - and if you don't... then why are you here? Hmm.. But honestly, I've read all of John's books (actually finished An Abundance of Kathrines between writing this!) and if you need an introduction to the man and author that is John Green, start with this book, you won't regret it.tell a story, and he doesn't just tell you about a bunch of characters, he brings those characters to life.

B002AT8KB0|5.0|The Road Warrior is a pretty incredible film that is not only the best of the Mad Max Trilogy, it's actually the only one of  the three that can be called a film of true quality.  The first Mad Max was nothing more than laughable B-movie fodder, while Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome was simply a watered-down mutation of the second film for the gullible American audience and the greedy Hollywood executives hallucinating on dollar signs.  This second film, The Road Warrior, stands on its own two feet-and it stands the test of time.   The Road Warrior is far from your average action movie.  Unlike the glamorized violence of movies like Die Hard or Lethal Weapon, this film presents us with violence that is brutal, ugly, and unapologetic in its nihilism.  Dr. George Miller's direction is ungodly in its brilliantly calculated madness.  One can say that it has its own Chaos Theory.   The Road Warrior succeeds, not just in the action, but also in the acting.  The cast manages  to flesh out its off-beat characters with a script of very little dialogue.  This is especially true with the character of Max, who is at the center of all this mayhem and who must have the least amount of dialogue of all the other main characters(the Feral Boy being the exception).  As Max, a charismatic and very young Mel Gibson gives a strong performance of quiet rage and smugness that gives his character the self-possession of a watchful cobra.  It's easy to see, in retrospect, how this young actor became a star.   I know that as of late, many people have been hurling various expletives towards Mr. Gibson since his 2006 DUI arrest.  He has been called a bigot and a drunk. I find it puzzling that Mr. Gibson is now Public Enemy No.1 by saying some insensitive comments (and no, I don't believe that he abused Oksana like she claims) while people like Woody Allen, Roman Polanski and Stephen Collins seem to get sympathy from both people in the industry and joe public.  I simply don't get it.
B002ONC9NC|4.0|In \\"An Education\\" in 1961 an English sixteen-year-old honors student, a cello player, Jenny (beautifully interpreted by Carey Mulligan) is waiting in the rain for a bus. A man (actor Peter Sarggaard) at least twice her age charms her into a ride home in his spiffy sports car. Gradually she falls for him; he buys her gifts, talks her middle class parents (the father played skillfully by Alfred Molina)into a concert with supper afterwards, a night away in Oxford, and a weekend in Paris. She gradually learns that not only is he a charmer, but he's a dodgy scam artist barely skirting the law.<br /> The father wants her to go to Oxford, but he knows how expensive it is. When the charmer proposes marriage, the father thinks that this rich guy may be able to provide his daughter with a decent future, and he won't have to foot her university bills.<br /> This all calls for your suspension of disbelief. The film has too many implausibilities and improbabilities for a discerning viewer to countenance. Sure the older guy likes girls, is obsessed by them, gets his kicks from them. That's believable enough, but his scams seem invented by a lazy screenwriter, and the girl and particularly her bourgeois family's acquiescence don't seem to compute. The father is a tough old bird who seems to give in too easily.<br /> The teacher at the school is very good as is Emma Thompson in a small role as headmistress. The acting is uniformly excellent, the photography is swell, but the final packaging seems a little too glib. Worth seeing, but it's all a little too pat.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|I'm not a big fan of Idol, especially once the preliminaries are over and the comically bad singers no longer appear.  The one season I gave a chance to was the one David Cook won.  He was one of the few contestants I really respected.  He would take older hits from the 70s and 80s, rearrange them and make them sound like hits again.  I was really happy when he won and was really excited for his first album.  Alas, like so many other forgotten Idols, he went down the paved road of so many before him and became just another bland \\"star\\".  America doesn't need any more pedestrian pop (or, in the case of Cook, rock) stars that put out bubble gum pop songs that put up one or two \\"hits\\"  on the charts because so many people are gullible and listen to what Ryan Seacrest and others like him tell them are \\"hit songs\\" and then, those \\"artists\\" are rarely heard from again.  I enjoyed \\"The Time of My Life\\" when it came out but \\"Light On\\" was generic and dull.  \\"Permanent\\" is one of the few songs on the album that has a story behind it and thus, it isn't cookie cutter and mundane.  Sad thing is, it's the exception, not the rule.  Download those two songs (\\"The Time of MY Life\\" and \\"Permanent\\") but don't buy the CD.  We don't need to reward mediocrity in this country any more than we already do.
1591843162|5.0|This book is the most important call to action for our time. Nobody has his finger on the pulse of today's world in the same way as Godin. He is therefore indispensable.     This book is about you though. It forces you to look at yourself and ask that profound question from the title: Are you indispensable? If your answer is no, Godin urges you to discover your genius and he will convince you that you too are a genius and can, strike that, must be indispensable.    Godin's book is a gift. Read that section on the gift and you will look at what you do differently. I love this book.

B001DXS4E2|4.0|This 1942 classic, which introduced the world to one of the best-loved Christmas songs, follows the escapades of two entertainers, Jim Hardy and Ted Hanover (the incomparable Bing Crosby, and Fred Astaire), Ted's flighty dance partner, Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale), and a young ingenue named Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds), amid great  songs by Irving Berlin, great dance numbers by Astaire, Dale, and Reynolds, and of course, Crosby's classic vocals.    Our story begins as Ted is on his way to work one snowy evening.After stopping to cavort with a group of boys dancing for their supper, we see the delightful fruits of his onstage collaboration with Jim and Lila, under the appreciative eye of  club manager Danny Reed(Walter Abel).    The two have worked for years and made a habit of trying to win over ladies that each of them have had their eyes on.But soon, Jim tires of performing and takes a leave of abscence to take up farming.     Soon, he returns to the stage, and while watching Ted and Lila perform what has become one of my favorite Astaire routines, the firey, \\"Easy to Dance With\\", he is introduced to Linda Mason, a flower shop girl with showbusiness aspirations, who pressed Danny for an introduction at the club. She stays at the table briefly before fleeing when Ted and Lila approach Jim's table.    Lila leaves to seek better opportunities elsewhere, and Linda goes to work for Jim at his newly established Holiday Inn, where, in a now-iconic film scene, she stands by the piano and listens to Jim croon \\"White Christmas\\". Later, a drunken Ted discovers Linda in a crowd on the dance floor on New Year's Eve, and she keeps up with Ted's steps beautifully.   Jim, however realizes that Linda could be his new dance partner and that she could be just one more woman Ted seduces away from him, and tries to keep the two away from each other for as long as possible.   In the meantime, Bing leads the performers in a performance of the song, \\"Abraham\\", in a manner now considered politically incorrect. But he does incorporate his maid, Mamie(Louise Beavers) into the act as well as her two children Vanderbilt and Daphne( Shelby Bacon, Joan Arnold).     As Jim croons the Valentine Day song,   Be Careful, It's My Heart\\", Ted does encounter Linda as she dances solo on the dance floor. Another rivalry  between the two officially heats up during the new dance team's rehearsal for the Washington's Birthday number, \\"I Can't Tell A Lie\\" when Jim keeps changing the dance tempo whenever Ted tries to kiss Linda.   We follow Jim's and Linda's courtship through Easter and Independence Day, during which Linda, informed by a returning Lila that Hollywood agents would attend that  day's performance, and realizing  that Jim kept her away because he didn't want her to have a chance to go to Hollywood,finds a way to leave Lila in the lurch, confront, Jim, and quit.    With no dance partner, Ted treats the revelers to and astounding  dance number that's a real, well, firecracker!     Linda and Ted win Hollywood contracts, and are engaged by Thanksgiving. A sullen and defeated Jim is confronted by Mamie and encouraged to go to Hollywood to win Linda back, and it is a question of  whether or not Jim can overcome the obstacles to true love in time.    All's well that ends well, and on this February 22nd, I won't tell any lies. While an obvious product of its time, this musical has earned the right to be called a classic! May it leave all who view it with a fond goodbye and their hopes as high as a kite!

B002XZ62HK|5.0|This CD is excellent.  Dare I say the best Celtic Woman CD yet.  I don't know, they are all so good.  I am definitely glad I got the Deluxe Edition.  The calendar and charm are cool, but really I got this version for the extra songs.  Well worth it.  The extra songs were from the live recording of the Songs From The Heart DVD.  The only trouble is that after hearing those live recordings you will probably want the new DVD also.  You certainly won't regret that purchase either though.  It was a stunning performance!
0143171119|5.0|In 1963, David Cornwell published his third novel. Because he was then an agent for British Intelligence, he used, as his government required, a pseudonym: \\"John Le Carr&eacute;\\".<br />Graham Greene, who pretty much invented the modern spy novel, called The Spy Who Came in from the Cold \\"the best spy story I ever read.\\"<br /><br />It was.<br /><br />And the thing is, it's even better now.<br /><br />In a decade when James Bond was all the rage, \\"Spy\\" revolutionized the spy novel. The Bond books --- and, even more, the Bond movies --- were thrill rides. The suave hero never mussed his tux. He had no need to; his car had more armament than one of Patton's brigades. The explosions that went off just a few feet from him always were just background flash. And, of course, he possessed the ultimate weapon --- his deadly quips, capable of killing any villain within earshot.<br /><br />Le Carr&eacute; had no interest in superheroes. For him, spycraft was the antithesis of a glamour profession. It was thinking and planning, waiting and watching, and lying --- always lying. It operated by a single moral law: results. You may be assured that good people were betrayed along the way.<br /><br />\\"Spy\\" was an instant classic precisely because Le Carr&eacute; showed readers exactly what Intelligence is about --- sometimes a roll of film, more often a list of names, never an atom bomb in a briefcase. Even better, it revealed how the trick is done. And, most of all, it asked a question: Us and Them --- how different are we, really?<br /><br />In London, men schemed long and hard to think up ways to misdirect the Communists. In East Berlin, men much like them plotted to deceive and damage the Brits. Between them was the Wall --- and a brightly lit, barb wired checkpoint.<br /><br />The Wall is where this novel starts. Alec Leamas, a 50-year-old British agent, waits at the West Berlin checkpoint for a German --- a British agent --- who's in danger of being found out. Tonight, he's crossing over. You get the scene quickly: coffee, cigarettes, idle chatter. And then you see the man on a bicycle. He stops at the East Berlin gate, shows his papers, pedals on. But then he hears something. He pedals faster. Shots are fired. He sags, falls. Leamas, the ultimate realist, \\"hoped to God he was dead.\\"<br /><br />The career of Alec Leamas certainly is; he failed to get his man across. And this leads to an opportunity for his employers. They would love to discredit --- or, better --- destroy --- Mundt, head of German Intelligence in East Berlin. The way they'll do this? Retire Leamas. Watch him sink into booze and despair. Let him be recruited by the East Germans. And then, in his debriefings, let him present these Communists with evidence that Mundt has been taking money from the Brits --- that Mundt is a British agent.<br /><br />This is mental chess. It calls for 24/7 acting skills. And the bar is set high. Leamas, flawlessly failing. Leamas, jailed. Leamas, released and bitter. Lemeas, expertly recruited by the Germans. Leamas, credibly sneering at his new employers.<br /><br />But that's only technique. Idealism? Patriotism? Le Carr&eacute; is the first modern spy novelist because he has a hard time telling the difference between the good guys --- that's us --- and the Commies.<br /><br />Let me interrupt to tell you something important about the author. His mother left home when he was 5 years old; he didn't see her again until he was 21. His father was \\"a confidence trickster and a jailbird.\\" Le Carr&eacute; has said: ''I was a spy before they ever recruited me. If you are brought up to believe that your home is an extremely dangerous place....\\"<br /><br />In his writing, he says, 'I always try to identify with one character in a book and appoint him my secret sharer.'' Here, that character is Alec Leamas. But here, there is also a father: Control, the head of MI5. I'm not going to spoil the book for you, but I do ask you to read with one thought in theback of your head: For this writer, what does a father do?<br /><br />Levels upon levels, worlds within worlds --- the experience of reading this novel is anything but relaxing. But if you're read any of the master's novels, you know that they deliver a kind of pleasure all their own.ience of reading this novel is anything but relaxing.

B0031ZWZR2|5.0|This show is best enjoyed as high camp -- and there's really a lot of love to be had when you look at it that way. From the hammy, over-the-top acting to some of the silliest lines and plots on TV, this is the kind of show you can really get into \\"with the help of your robot friends.\\"     I understand why people don't like the half-season releases, but I'd like to point out why it's good. Strong DVD revenues are one way that a network can justify renewing a show whose ratings are on the edge -- and Flashforward is definitely such a show. If it tips the balance toward renewal I am just fine getting it half a season at a time.     One minor complaint -- the show is very pretty to look at, even if it's silly. I'd be more inclined to buy a blu-ray version -- the DVD won't be able to compete with the live broadcast.
1881273873|1.0|Actually, today I am not such a Happy Customer.      I got this book, stupidly, because it was rated high.  I received it just a couple of hours ago, and I finished reading it.  Some parts I skimmed through because I was upset how superficial this book is.  First of all, it leaves me with the impression that it's for people who pretty much never dated and on top of that have a relatively good relationship with God.  So how about those that don't have a relationship with God, let alone a good one? The book skips over important topics like forgiveness and the failures of the parents to love their kids.  Also what if you end up speaking all love languages?  One might be a love polyglot, but then the book stops being illuminating and only frustrating. It does not even have good exercises which might help you illuminate what language you speak.  The test at the end of the book is just frustrating of several languages are equally important to you.     I wish I could get my money back.  I am very disappointed that I bought it.     I would not want to give it even one star, but I suppose that the mere classification of the 5 languages earns the book 1 star.
B00116GHMM|1.0|When will record execs get it?  If I'm going to pay for something that I can easily get for free, shouldn't it be of at least somewhat higher quality?  In a market where sales are in the dump and only getting worse, shouldn't they at least TRY to differentiate?   The sound on this vinyl (and CD also) is so bad, save your money and just download it for free.  I SWEAR a two year old with his eyes on the VU meter could have done a better job.  My roommate asked what was wrong with the turntable!  This isn't transient clipping; it's not woops we got it a tad too loud - even the VOCALS are in saturation!  SWEET JESUS??!?!?!!  It really is a shame, too, because if any album out this year could have really benefited from a super mastering job, this was it.  The spaces, imaging, texturing, etc could really have been epic on this one.  And, I'm sure somewhere between the recording phase and the final factory phase it was.  I would just assume that kids bright enough to create such an interesting album would know how to run a mixer better than this.  So my assumption is that this happened somewhere downstream toward the end.  Probably some record label's recording metric for average loudness- or some other equally insipid corporate crap.  This REALLY IS A SHAME because it's a very fun album that I just can't listen to.  And there is a known, albeit quite small market (couple $mil at the most) of record collectors who would buy this based on sound quality alone.  Let's just throw that market out with the bath water.  Not that they saved even one red cent producing this garbage.  Pretty sure the cost of pressing an album with 50% clipping is no less than one with 0.0% clipping.   How far can this go?  If there were any more clipping, it would be non-intelligible.  What's even more maddening, is it's the second album I've bought this year that sounds like this.  From now on, I'll not be purchasing ANYTHING from these studios, and I'll be looking for reviews and recommendations (perhaps the turnmeup logo) to avoid wasting my money in the future.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|If you enjoyed the original Cranford series as much as I did you must see this delightful sequel.  I was so glad to see all my favorites from the first series and enjoyed meeting the new residents of Cranford.  The continuation of the original storyline was weaved in seamlessly with the introduction of the new characters and their storyline.  Judi Dench, as usual sparkles as Matty.
6305291446|3.0|H20 is mainly a follow-up on the Laurie Strode character and while the that story was handled well the film suffers from the lack of Dr. Loomis.<br /><br />H20 was actually my introduction to the Halloween series and probably the reason it took me a while to follow up by seeing the original films. The reason being that the film is a fairly generic mid-90's slasher aside from the brother vs. sister angle. The final fight and aftermath is great, but the other kills (especially the opener) are fairly boring.<br /><br />The Michael Myers character and performance are great, the only problem being that they allowed us to see his eyes and they were far from \\"the blackest eyes...the devil's eyes\\".<br /><br />Personally, I would have preferred a follow up to Halloween 4 that brought Jamie in contact with Laurie (friendly or otherwise) then Michael appearing to attack them both.<br /><br />But overall, one of the better sequels in the series.
B00337KM2S|1.0|I decided to see this movie in theaters after all the wonderful reviews about it.  Everyone seemed to rate it very highly.  First off, the intro and opening credits were horrible: the music was so awful I wanted to leave then and there, not to mention the camera views and picture quality.  After surviving this part, the movie kicks off.  None of the people were that memorable or likable.  And NOTHING happened.  I kept waiting for George Clooney to return home, to change his life, to go after the woman he loved, basically to do anything to prevent me from getting up to leave.  The only reason I stayed was because of all the reviews (which I now know to completely disregard).  It was a total waste of time and money, and absolutely pointless.  From now on, I will make my spontaneous movie-going decisions based on the OPPOSITE of the movie critics reviews.  I *strongly* recommend skipping this one.
0061864153|5.0|This is the perfect book for any Bon Jovi fan.  It offers the story of the band & how they've managed to remain successful after more than 25 years in the music business.  There are so many great photos - ranging from the VERY early days (pre-success) through 2009.  It's interesting to read about the relationship between the band members, and fascinating to learn how Jon stays motivated.  I recommend this book for all Bon Jovi fans - whether or not they enjoy reading, because the pictures are a huge part of the story.  The book is beautiful.
B002XMGGK6|2.0|What can be said about this film aside from the fact you feel that even a film with this seemingly great plot, can leave you sad and wondering \\"where is all the money for the film going\\"     Law Abiding Citizen  To me felt like every other high budget action/thriller ive seen in the past few years, its exciting but not really anything new that comes into play, nothing really over the top original, nothing you didnt expect to be solved completely by the end despite butlers performance as the criminal mastermind.    A few major fallbacks that i feel made the film not live up to the hype the trailers presented were.    Plot-While at first seemingly original and unique, after butlers character becomes the vigilante the film seems to simply follow the textbook of what a thriller movie would do, so well that to the point that you find yourself watching a seen and thinking to yourself \\"o they are going to be killed or something big is going to happen cus they are alone\\" and BAM its exactly what you think.     Jamie Foxx's   character lacks any depth or empathy, even though you see him with his family and the troubles he has at home, you find yourself lacking any knowledge or concern  for his character, and as the film progresses begin to feel like you are Honestly watching a behind the scenes version of the film, knowing full well that he really isnt the character in real life. He had a way of making you feel nothing for his character at all and more so just like you were watching an audition.    As well his characters moral and general sense of awareness seem to float in and out of him thru out the film, as he learns once incarserating Butler, and learns the hard way that butler has more cards than fox does in this hand, he still despite that fact continues to let his ego get the best of him and play down the criminal mastermind that butler is in the film, which ultimately ends in tragedy for all around him.    Finaly (to try to keep this short)   the ending of the film,really leaves more questions than answers and really makes you wonder if THIS is as safe as our prison systems are, then we are in alot of trouble. Butlers final ploy seems almost to come out of the tv show LOST as he would have seemingly in a real life scenario been under questioning or at the very least suspicion as to why you would have what you have so close to the prison.    Im giving the film 2 stars   simply for the part of the \\"police officer\\" and darby heading out into the field, while it has been done before this one was very well played out and kept you on the edge.    As well as adding Detrodetoxin (a not commonly well used or known yet deadly poison) that was used in most recent memory in the film   The serpent and the rainbow.

B001R60ESE|5.0|This is a great looking Blu-ray perhaps one of the best out currently as far as music/concerts are concerned. Whether you are a jazz fan or not, whether you like the trumpet or not, you will appreciate this blu-ray. Many a day I've come home thrown this in the Ps3, poured myself a glass of red wine and relaxed. This concert will have that effect on you, Botti's music has the ability to transform your day from stressful misgivings and burdens to blissful peace. The concert itself looks great but the sound is where it's will amaze. I also recommend Chris's other blu-ray but I think this one is slightly better. Like his previous BR Sting shines and Botti's friends and musical associates all add their own unique touch. There's a few songs that don't quite work on this BR, Josh Grobin's duet with Sting seemed a bit forced, I think Grobin over sings quite a bit on this BR actually(I guess that's his style) and Steven Tyler signing cryin' was utterly ridiculously and completely out of character for this concert. I cringe even at the thought of that song. Even with those short comings however, this concert is still amazing and truly is a must own for blu-ray music/concert collectors.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|I'm a huge John Mayer fan, I'll admit that to anyone. I've seen him in concert several times, I own every CD of his, and probably spend a few hours a week listening to his music. I was however very disappointed with John's latest offering \\"Battle Studies\\". Battle Studies is about the turbulent times we can all face in our relationships with breakups to makeups and everything else in between. It seems perfectly prescribed and marketed to the 19-22 year old girls buying most of John CDs. He'll be playing the part of the thoughtful caring guy and singing about his vulnerability. Truly this is the perfect make-out music for those 19-22 year old guys to use...guaranteed to get those young adult ladies in the mood. The candy pop shell is where this CD ends, there's no substance beneath.    This work isn't as focused as Continuum, which I believe to be John's best work by far. I love the way Continuum melded all the stylistic abilities Mayer has in his repertoire, it was both bluesy and pop...substance and cheese. This CD however just seems like cheese to me; where has the substance gone? Where did the deep blues and inspired lyrics go? It's like going from painting a Picasso to painting one of those caricatures that you could buy in the mall. Don't get me wrong, I'm grading Mayer on his previous works here, compared to the rest of the junk out there this is solid gold. I hope this was just one of those albums an artist releases sometimes to keep themselves relevant while they are really working on the master-piece. I guess in John we trust but until then I guess this will just have to do.
B000NA28I4|5.0|Watching this well-done SFX feast, it's easy to guess at the major influences of Christopher Paolini: Anne McCaffrey's Pern series, [[ASIN:0618640150 The Lord of the Rings: 50th Anniversary, One Vol. Edition]], and [[ASIN:B000FQJAIW Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (1977 & 2004 Versions, 2-Disc Widescreen Edition)]].  In fact, \\"Eragon\\" might almost be described as \\"A New Hope\\" without spaceships--but that doesn't make it any the less enjoyable.  Eragon (Ed Speleers) is a 17-year-old farmboy who's been raised by his mother's brother (Alun Armstrong) following her precipitous and mysterious disappearance from his life.  His country groans under the tyrannical rule of Galbatorix (John Malkovich), the last of a corps of dragon riders who for thousands of years were the guardians of the land and its people until they fell to quarrelling among themselves and gave him a chance to destroy them from within.  Eragon knows he'll soon be of age to be impressed into the king's army--his cousin has already headed off into the wilderness rather than meet that fate--but before he can decide what to do about it, he finds a beautiful blue object from which hatches a small dragon.  The creature grows rapidly and soon is communicating mentally with him, explaining that he is her destined Rider.  But the King and his sorcerer Durza (Robert Carlyle) know the egg has hatched, and send assassins after its Rider.  Only with the help of Brom (Jeremy Irons), an antisocial villager with secrets of his own, do Eragon and his dragon Saphira (voiced by Rachel Weisz) escape.  Then there's the matter of a beautiful young woman (Sienna Guillory) being held prisoner by Durza and the King, a band of fugitive rebels hiding in the mountains, and the young archer (Garrett Hedlund) who saves Eragon's life.    It becomes clear fairly early on that Eragon isn't a Rider because he has a dragon: he has a dragon because he's a Rider.  The ability to work magic is in him--he just needs it trained--and Saphirahas somehow sensed this (a dragon will wait forever to hatch if it has to, rather than emerge without its Rider to bond to).  There's plenty of fast action, scary villains, great costumes and armor (especially Saphira's wonderfully articulated suit), and of course splendid special effects (created, of course, by George Lucas's ILM), plus a powerful soundtrack [[ASIN:B000NI3G2S Soundtrack]] by Patrick Doyle.  Nothing's been heard so far of further film adaptations of Paolini's trilogy; I hope they're in the works!
B0019HQIFE|5.0|I'm a John Mayer fan, I'll be the first one to admit that. I started listening to his music after room for squares hit during my freshman year of college. As I grew older so then came more John Mayer music and I've kept listening.     This blu-ray really is different than anything John has done before because it combines all the aspects of his music. The Jazz band, The acoustic sing song writer and the pop artist. It's all here and John actually doesn't play many of his hits, he plays songs in his catalog that may not heard before. This is good for me because a lot of the songs don't have previously recorded live versions. There are some small filler portions of the Blu-Ray that I think it could do without but overall it's mostly just music. I have to recommend this to anyone who wants to put together a collection of any of the best music/concerts on blu-ray this one stands somewhere on the top.
1594488916|4.0|Good, quick read exposing the underside of the rare book world.  A few glaring errors made me wonder if they were intentionally included to increase the eventual value of a first edition...?  (See p. 102, where the phrase, \\"most of them do not cross the line between coveting and stealing\\" appears twice in three sentences.  See also pp. 253-254, where the word \\"Renaissance\\" inexplicably appears twice in a row.)  If you read Ann Rule's book, \\"The Stranger Beside Me,\\" and were bothered by the extent to which the author inserted herself into the gripping story of Ted Bundy, you will find the same irritation with this book.  (Personally, I don't like to be aware of the author of a book, but prefer the illusion that the book contains a world belonging only to me, the reader.)  That said, there is much to learn and much to enjoy here.  It is definitely worth reading.

B001TZQITM|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2LHKDNE84BNBM]]I have more camera/recording gadgets then I should, and I like to take them all with me at the same time. This case is great for something like that, or for carrying around your compact video camera. The camera carrying space dimensions are 6x4x3\\", so if your video camera falls into that, it will fit snuggly in the case, nestled in the hammock and be safe on any journey.<br /><br />I personally love this carrying case because of it's size. If I'm given too much space, I'll overload it. This forces me to carry the essentials without shoving extra unneeded items in it. Very manageable and unobtrusive. It doesn't fit my SLR camera(though caselogic makes some stellar ones specifically for SLRs), but I used it more to show you the size of the bag, since most have a good idea of the size of an SLR. This bag is great for neatly tucking in my Flip camera, canon powershot and all the little odds and ends that go with them. I love the waterproof EVA bottom, because I'm a klutz.<br /><br />I'm definitely becoming a huge fan of caselogic because they're coming out with some interesting, innovative designs for various uses. This camera bag will be a great addition to any gadget lover's closet.

B000F2C7TU|3.0|Lovehunter represented a significant leap ahead of Whitesnake's earlier releases Snakebite and Trouble.  While the playing on both is often on par with that of the best known blues rock acts of the day, the songs themselves and lyrics were often lacking.  That problem is not completely rectified on Lovehunter, but for the first time they have hit more often than missed.  The album actually starts off with four solid, if not quite spectacular, numbers in a row.  Both \\"Walking In the Shadow of the Blues\\" and \\"Medicine Man\\" rock convincingly; the former would remain a stage favorite for years to come.  Meanwhile, opener \\"Long Way from Home\\" is a nice, smooth mid paced rocker with an odd touch of sentimentality from DC, and \\"Help Me Thro' the Day,\\" while not written by the band, is one of the very best of the early ballads, with an outstanding instrumental outro by the always soulful Mick Moody.      It's a shame Coverdale's often duff songwriting starts to rear its fanged head come side two.  The title track, again with excellent playing (this time slide) by Moody, is the best of these songs, but even a bit too long.  \\"Outlaw\\" is akin to \\"Free Flight\\" from Trouble in affording Bernie Marsden the lead vocal. While both are interesting, neither prove to be necessarily strong material.  John Lord gets to tickle the ivories with the brief, whimsical \\"We Wish You Well\\" to end the preceedings. Other songs on side two all being throw aways; bland material with typically cliche lyrics.  If Coverdale could have combined the first fours songs here with side one of 1980's Ready An' Willing, he would have had a bonefide four-star winner.  Unfortunately, he never recorded an album consistently strong from start to finish with Whitesnake.  Having said that, check out Lovehunter along with Ready An' Willing to get the goods on the better early Snake.

Take it for what it is.<br /><br />Seriously though, Think of Star Wars when watching it.
B000UJCALI|5.0|Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances of his career as a caretaker during the winter months at an elite isolated hotel in Colorado that is closed down for the season. At this hotel (way up in the mountains) only he and his wife and son live, and what follows are weeks of hell as Jack (the name of the Nicholson character) becomes almost possessed by outside forces. He becomes arrogant, verbally assaulting, and violent, as he attempts to kill his family. Shelley Duvall is heartbreaking as the desperate wife who tries to escape this hellish hotel with her son. The film (based on the Stephen King novel) was directed by genius Stanley Kubrick who also co-wrote the script. The movie was not without its problems during production: Nicholson was not pleased with the many times in which the script was rewritten, sometimes minutes before the scenes were shot. He eventually quit memorizing pages the night before, instead memorizing the lines given to him before the camera rolled. Shelley Duvall suffered exhaustion from the emotional aspects of her character. For the baseball bat scene Kubrick demanded Shelley do it over and over for a total of 127 takes!. Duvall eventually suffered severe hair loss. When \\"The Shining\\" was originally released to theatres in 1980 the movie was pretty much forgotten, only becoming a modest success. Most critics even panned the film. However, over the last 30 years the movie has become a true classic thanks to the home video market and huge DVD sales. Truely a scary film with excellent performances, especially by Nicholson, I watched this one three times in one weekend. Very rarely do you get horror films with this kind of acting. In one word: excellent. This two disc set also contains the trailer, behind the scenes footage, commentary, and more.

B002RVZV9K|5.0|\\"It Might Get Loud\\" does the work of several documentaries. On its surface it's a staged meeting between three iconic guitarists from three distinct eras. But it's also three biographies in miniature of three individuals who were shaped by, and helped to shape, the music that we know as rock and roll. For purists there are tantalizing glimpses of musical inspiration, obscure and otherwise, and for those who simply love the look and sound of rock, there's enough detail about the guitar to delight anyone who's ever picked up a six string.<br /><br />The match-up between Jimmy Page, the Edge and Jack White is by no means an even one, nor is it meant to be. Page, with his legendary status as session man, Yardbird, and mystical guitarist of Led Zeppelin, comes across as the most enviable of the three. He's got the riffs, the money, the fame and the aura of infallibility. Even in his advancing years his English gentleman's demeanor is still suffused with a youthful spirit. So when Page launches into his signature phrase from \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" you can see how incredibly simple the structure is -- and how only Page can pull it off with the right feeling. But the film's brilliance lies in the way it shifts from one musician to the next. The Edge and White are clearly checking out Page's moves even as they betray their admiration (the look on their faces says it all). But soon the focus is on the Edge's restless, chiming sound from \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday,\\" or \\"Where the Streets Have No Name,\\" and you remember that in an era younger than Page's, another set of hands was shaping the sound of emotion and lyricism. The film goes beyond a potentially dry rendition of \\"let's jam together for the camera\\" to explore the places these three musicians came from. I liked that fact that, for the most part, the reminiscences are vivid and short. There's just enough historical detail to make it interesting, and just enough music (both archival and performed for the film) to keep you riveted.<br /><br />As comparisons go, some may question why Jack White was included with the geniuses behind Led Zeppelin and U2. White's biographical sequences are contrivances (like his trek through rural Tennessee, speaking to his nine-year-old self in the back seat of a car) but they perhaps sum up what is both fantastical and challenging about becoming a guitar hero: the allure of playing to audiences, writing songs, and devoting oneself to music squared with the possibility of failure, hardship and a life of uncertainty and obscurity. Looking backwards at the success of these men, it's interesting to note where opportunity could have been missed: if Page had gone on with his session playing for another month, if the Edge hadn't met up with his future bandmates, if White hadn't heard his first blues song. So, whether one is a White Stripes fan or not, his contribution to the film must be seen as the work-in-progress, the young man with something to prove (and something to learn from the older guys). For all of White's private truculence, he clearly appreciates his time with the other men, and it's evident that all three share a love of the guitar.<br /><br />The look of the film is gorgeous in many ways. The opening credits promise a ballsy, no-nonsense look at rock and roll's glitter and cool. The instruments paraded and played will make amateurs smile. The ordinary places where things \\"happened\\" (Headley Grange, where Zeppelin recorded several albums; the lonely scenery of Dublin where the Edge rehearsed with a fledgling U2; the Detroit streets where Jack White pounded out his first tunes) are to fans of rock what the Pyramids and the deserts of Africa are to archaeologists. This is where it all began. (See also Abbey Road in London...)<br />film, it's the truncated three-man jam of \\"The Weight,\\" the Band number that the guitarists feel their way through. The closing credits roll on early in the song, stealing some of the musical connection that was building. \\"ItMight Get Loud\\" has no real discernible peaks -- it's not a concert film, or even a dramatic story -- but it does have a pace and a logic that makes sense given the three men who star in it. Viewers may engage in musical criticisms about who should have been included (Why not Clapton, or Gilmour, Townshend or either Beck? Why not Mark Knopfler versus Dickey Betts?) but that is part of the fun of it all, like baseball fantasy picks. This is a rare and very worthwhile look at music history.discernible peaks -- it's not a concert film, or even a dramatic story -- but it does have a pace and a logic that makes sense given the three men who star in it.

B002ZG98J6|3.0|While The Lightening Thief wasn't completely butchered(NOTE; this means I have seen worse jobs done, including a movie where the heroine's love interest was turned into the villian and killed at the end of the movie!) it was very disappointing, because it could have been such a GREAT movie if it'd followed the book more.    Now, I can't make this a really good, informative review without spoilers, because....   DIFFERENCES FROM THE BOOK; (this may be pretty cryptic if you haven't read the book)   As I'm sure most people who saw the preview noticed, the kids are in their late teens instead of pre-teens. However, the movie still was made as though for younger teens and kids.    The relationship between Percy and Annabeth was ruined. Yeah it was turned into a sorta romance, with Annabeth being a ridiculously stereotypical 'tough' female who's always second best to the male characters and has a crush on Percy even though she pretends to hate him.    The water park scene was left out. So was the scene where they're attacked by monsters on the bus. So was the fight with the monsters on the bridge!    Instead of the plot being the kids trying to get safely to LA, it was them trying to get safely to LA and find the pearls in different places. In the book the pearls aren't made a big deal of.    The Medusa head; oh, oh. This is a PG movie. I don't see why a severed head, sometimes with it's eyes open, had to be flaunted for the camera every five seconds. In a scene never in the book, they fight a hydra, and win by turning it to stone. They also have to flee a hotel because someone sees it. Grover kisses the thing after it kills the hydra. And it isn't ever sent to Mt. Olympus. Nor does it quite play the same part at the end; instead Gabe opens the fridge and finds it (which is during the credits). Medusa's character is also nothing like in the book.     Instead of the villain being who it is in the book, it's Hades. How stereotypical and expected is that? The underworld inthe book follows mythology well; in the movie it's just shown as being hell. Uncreative! In the movie we meet Persephone, who we are given to understand hates Hades, hates the underworld, and is desperate for sex with people other than her husband. Chiron wasn't funny like in the book; obviously Hades wasn't anything like in the book. The dog didn't have a part at all - no, we didn't get to see a three headed dog play fetch! The way Riordan wrote about the underworld was so original and entertaining; the movie just presented an un-educated stereotype.     Percy doesn't encounter the bullies at the camp, nor is there the awesome exploding toilet scene.        We never meet the guy who is responsible, in the book, for having the lightening stolen.      We are given to understand that the kid who stole the lightening for Hades did so because his father, a god, never paid attention to him. In the movie, the gods are forbidden to have anything to do with their offspring, unlike the book. The whole `big three' and the results of them having children is never mentioned.      The showdown at the end is between Percy and Luke. The titan is never mentioned.       Instead of Percy's mom staying behind, and being freed because of Percy recovering the helmet, Grover stays behind, and is magically released by Zeus.      The reason this is getting a 3 star rating is because the casting was mostly good, the acting also mostly good, and the action was very exciting. I wouldn't bring a young child to see this - It wasn't the scary images that surprised me as the fact that there were so MANY scary scenes. For teens and adults, I think these just add to the excitement of the movie, but if you don't like intense scenes, be warned. And again I think some of these scenes, especially the severed head, would be very, very frightening to some children. Despite this, the script was written as though aimed at pre-teens.       Well the special effects were awesome if very overdone at times, butyou will cringe if you read the book.

B0032700PS|4.0|Gentle Giant member Ray Shulman once remarked that \\"In'terview\\" was the beginning of the decline for Gentle Giant. That may be but if so the band checked out with one of its most challenging works. Derek Shulman came up with the concept for \\"In'terview\\" after having to endure one too many inane questions from the media where he was asked to define the sound of the band and, he felt, the media were trying to find an easy slot so as to categorize the band.<br /><br />The \\"In'terview\\" remaster sounds less harsh than the DRT reissue of 5 years ago and, quite honestly, I feel it's an improvement over many of the previous issues (including the reissue on One Way). Shulman and mastering engineer Fred Kervorkian elected to use some compression here (selective band compression)and while this has, perhaps, less dynamic range than the earliest incarnations the duo worked from better source tapes (the original master tapes)which hadn't been used on the earlier reissues (except for the DRT). \\"In'terview\\" sounds pretty good for a modern remaster some audiophiles won't be pleased I'm sure but this isn't brickwalled and the compression that has been used isn't overwhelming. If you liked The Beatles stereo remasters I suspect you'll like the sound on these CDs as well. Ray Shulman and Kervorkian tried to make them sound as \\"modern\\" as possible without completing sacrificing the \\"feel\\" of the original album.<br /><br />We get the original liner notes from the previous DRT edition on CD but no notes on the making of the album nor do we get any bonus tracks (the DRT although it sounded slightly more harsh than this version did have bonus tracks all of which were soundboard recordings of performances the band did of the material from this album). If you can live without the bonus tracks that were on the previous edition (the digital download version of this album does have bonus material that Kerry Minnear went back and did some overdubs to finish it--two alternate versions of the \\"Intro\\" piece and it is reasonably priced but you do have to buy the whole album to get them)and are unhappy with the previous issues this is a good choice for this fine album.<br /><br />If \\"In'terview\\" marked the decline of Gentle Giant at least they were going down with a cheeky sense of humor and challenging sounding music.

B002WIDRM6|4.0|The band's smart marketing has paid off.  The advance release of the title single \\"Need You Now\\" lifted the band to the top of the country charts for five weeks.  Its Youtube instructional video of the song's guitar work encouraged coffeehouse players to further the song's spread.  The week the album was released, the band, a Grammy nominee for its 2009 debut album, performed \\"Need You Now\\" on the 2010 Grammies.  It's clear why this single has clicked; it's pure Fleetwood Mac, from the three-part harmonies lacing the chorus to the late-night, post-breakup regrets addressed in the lyrics.  All the songs on the album are strong; Dave Haywood, Charles Kelley, and Hillary Scott collaborated with varying fourth writers on most of the tracks, but there's a unity to their writing styles.  While the rest of the album is loaded with similarly layered vocals and a country-rock edge easily embraceable by fans of the Eagles, Little Big Town, Devonsquare, or Bryndle, the simple single will pop back into your head when you least -- \\"It's a quarter after one, and I'm all alone, and I need you now.\\" - expect it.  ****

Not only do they do an amazing job of capturing the essence of the disorder but they allow you to love Temple Grandin.  I have read a lot of her work and she is nothing short of phenomenal.

1400052173|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, by Rebecca Skloot, is probably the best book I've read in years.  It's the true story of an African-American woman named Henrietta Lacks, and how her brief fight with an incredibly invasive and deadly cervical cancer, ended her short life but left the world an infinite supply of living cancer cells to do research with.<br /><br />The author skillfully presents, in laymen's terms, the story of Mrs. Lacks and her incredible cells, and how they affected medical science, and the lives of her descendants who struggled to understand it all.  Skloot gets inside the tight circle of understandably bitter and paranoid remaining Lacks family members, and investigates the history of their  immortal mother, wife, sister and grandmother.<br /><br />This book will have you both applauding the accomplishments of the scientists who used Henrietta Lacks cancer cells to learn about cancer, genetics and other medical miracles that were critical vehicles used to get to where modern medicine is today;  and then teary-eyed as you read about the suffering of the deceased woman&#34;s children, who grew up abused and riddled with extreme poverty, unaware that their mothers cells were making millions of dollars for pharmaceutical companies and biological labs across the world.<br /><br />As the story unfolds, we follow  Henrietta Lacks through her childhood and young marriage, and learn of her  daughter, Elsie, who was born with mental and physical defects and ultimately was placed in a facility of horrors called &#34;The Hospital for the Negro Insane,&#34; in Crownsville, Virginia, where she suffered in over-crowded and inhumane conditions, until she died at 16, from what her records diagnose as &#34;respiratory failure,&#34; but all evidence is to the contrary.<br /><br />A large part of the story is devoted to Henrietta's surviving daughter, Deborah, and her difficulties both emotionally and physically, trying to separate truths and untruths about her mothers legacy, all with a limited educational background.<br /><br />I learned a lot from this book and highly recommend it to anyone interested in reading about an incredible woman, her unknown gift to the world, and the colorful cast of characters that survive her.tional background.

0307387178|4.0|\\"In April 1992, a young man from a well-to-do family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley.  His name was Christopher Johnson McCandless.  He had given $25,000 in saving to charity, abandoned his car and most of his possessions, burned all of the cash in his wallet, and invented a new life for himself.  Four months later, his discomposed body was found by a moose hunter.\\"    The story behind this extraordinary young man is illustrated in the nonfiction book, Into the Wild, by Jon Krakauer.  In writing this narrative Jon Krakauer brings the story of Christopher (Chris) McCandless to life.    As a college graduate of Emory University, Chris's future looked bright, however, he was an idealist, and his ideals were to live on his own and survive without the restrictions of society.  As a young boy, he was very stubborn and determined, and he strived to obtain the most out of himself.  This attitude stayed with him throughout his life.  As he came into adulthood, Chris McCandless began to find faults with society and his parents.     After graduating, he lost all contact with his family and began wandering the countryside.  Throughout his life, the wilderness enthralled him, and he was inspired to survive alone.  As an adult, he travelled through America, Mexico, and Canada; he traveled mostly by hitchhiking, after he abandoned his car.  Although he was hired for several jobs, he tried to stay away from society as much as possible.  After years of surviving hardships and travelling the country, Chris McCandless hitchhiked to the Alaskan interior where he decided to live off the land.   With a .22 caliber rifle, a camera, several boxes of rifle rounds, and a small selection of reading material, including a field guide to the region's edible plants, he enters the desolate landscape, a place he does not leave.   Although the conclusion to the story is known, I do not believe that it affects the story in any negative way.  In truth,it enhances the story; this style gives the reader a desire to find out what happened to this man.  Jon Krakauer writes smoothly, and decisively, by not having the book move chronologically.  This kept me in suspense of not knowing what direction the story is going to turn next. Although some people find this strategy of writing confusing and redundant, I believe that is serves the story well.   In the end, this bestselling book is a must read.  It includes information on the Alaskan interior and stories of other unfortunate people who were claimed by the harsh climate.  In addition, it allowed me to get to know Chris McCandless by bringing his unique ideals and ways to life.  I was also able to relate a little with the man who wanted to be free of society and wander the country alone. The Jon Krakauer writing allowed me to feel for the character, and I also felt remorse as I found out how he met his grizzly end.   As he hitchhiked to the Alaskan countryside to begin his journey, Chris met one last person, a truck driver, Gallien. Gallien was the last person to see Christopher Johnson McCandless alive and well.    \\"Gallien briefly considered stopping and telling the authorities about Alex (Chris), then he thought better of it.  \\"I figured he'd be OK, he explains. \\"I thought he'd get hungry pretty quick and just walk out to the highway.  That is what any normal person would do.\\"

B000068OCS|5.0|First things first. Can we get this in Blu-Ray please?!<br /><br />This is the most haunting film ever seen by this reviewer. I saw a few clips of this film when I was in my early 20's (back in 1983 or thereabouts). The impact, although totally subconscious, was strong enough so that I recalled it when I was 45 years old. Subsequent research led me to it, and I now own it.<br /><br />Fast forward five years.<br /><br />I attempted to absorb this film again this year, February 2010. No luck. This is, IMO, the best joining of film and music ever conceived (for this genre of course). This is a haunting piece of work that is beyond description.<br /><br />To the soul not receptive to the vibes put forth from this film, I would assume the watching to be pure torture. Such a person would probably fall asleep after five minutes or shut down their whole system and go to bed. From this reviewer's perspective though, this film cannot be described---you have to feel it.<br /><br />Subsequent to feeling it, there really are no words to describe it in detail. Depending on your mood and depth, you will either walk away with a troubled spirit, OR you will be fascinated. Or both! The filmmaker did a SUPERB job constructing this jewel to illicit both responses. Also, without the unbelievable music, which was perfect for the film, there would be no reviews for this.<br /><br />IMO, if you are open to \\"other things and thoughts\\", buy this film. Otherwise it probably isn't for you.
0792841344|1.0|The first one scared me, at times, when I was a kid, even though I thought it was silly (even back then).  I hated the ending, and all of the directors cheap tricks in his efforts to scare us.  There are great directors, some even make horror movies, but not this guy!  The sequels get ever worse.  The concept of exactly what is happening wanders aimlessly at the speed of plot. Imagine sequels worse than the 4th and 5th in the Planet of the Apes series!  The flying steel orbs worked well in the 70's, but there must be new material to pitch at us 30 years later.  Anything dredged up out of \\"Saw\\" would be an improvement.  Basically there is nothing, and no one to route for.  The tall man hopelessly overpowers the ice-cream man and the little brother, who seek to thwart his nefarious schemes to, um, destroy the world?  um, use our dead as slaves?  um, create a diversity of ever more boring flying steel balls of death? um, surgically implant more steel orbs into the ample breasts of women?  The villain wins in ever movie, even after they think they have destroyed him.  The chances of these guys actually winning are more hopeless than a character surviving a Lovecraft story, except Lovecraft stories are well-written.<br /><br />There are truly scarey movies out there.  Try \\"The Ring\\" or even the more recent \\"Paranormal Activity\\".  But the Phantasm movies deserve to be forgotten, and left in some 70's archive.<br /><br />Buy something else!

B002Y5FKUE|4.0|I found it interesting that so many reviews of this DVD were printed before the opera was released; I assume that they were based on the HD performance in a local theatre or the telecast on PBS which I saw and was the main reason I decided to buy the set.    I have seen the opera only once, in 1962, with the SF opera company during its annual visit to Los Angeles. Sutherland was making her second visit and her tenor (chosen I assume because he was tall) was Renato Cioni. I don't remember any more of the casting. My knowledge of the score was limited essentially to some ancient 78's, e.g. Galli-Curci, Schipa and Tetrazzini. Seeing the actual opera proved to be less dazzling than the worn shellacs at my disposal. Part of the problem though must be laid at the feet of Bellini. He frontloaded most of the best music in Act I. Act II is shorter and in my opinion less distinguished musically until the soprano sleepwalks her way into the the great An non credea, awakens and dazzles us with Ah non giunge. I confess that this is the only opera at which I nearly nodded off and was aroused by the cabaletta. I have no recollection of the staging or the singing other than Sutherland's, but hers is an art that has eluded me for nearly fifty years. But this is not the place to discuss the lady.    I recall reading that when Dessay was scheduled to sing Sonnambula at Santa Fe she was reported to have made some less than flattering remarks about the work. She was summarily taken to task for being a philistine since apparently even artists are not allowed to make disparaging comments about the work in which they are going to appear. As I understand it Dessay requested of Zimmerman an unconventional staging; those who are more knowledgable about the gossip and politics of the Met will not doubt correct me. At this point I will make a stand for the staging and production; I found it creative and imaginative and brought out the best of the two superstar leads. There is a great deal of joy in Bellini's music and both artists conveyed that feeling with great singing, acting and commitment. I have rated this \\"four\\" stars simply because of the casting of Pertusi as the Count; this role should be sung by a bass, and as a bass-baritone at best, the low notes were not his to deliver. An early LP recording (from Cetra) cast Siepi if I recall correctly.    The only other DVD I have seen of Sonnambula was a RAI antiquity with Anna Moffo, pre rhynoplasty, and Clabassi. It is in B & W, lip-synched and set on a sound stage no much large than the average living room. Of course there was doubtless not much budget in those days and the war had only been over a few years so fiscal restraint was the order of the day. But it was the Swiss Alps you got. I find all the fuss over Zimmerman's setting so academic and futile. And while Romani had one of the great reputations as a librettist, it has to be admitted that the story of the opera is a frail one, almost trivial. The likelihood of my seeing another Sonnambula in my lifetime is equally as frail, but I am not troubled since this production and have enjoyed each time I have viewed it.
0143034901|5.0|This book has those epic, coming of age, humorous, and quirky qualities a John Irving novel used to provide for me. This review is not to bash Irving. That statement only serves to support my point that after finishing \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", I had those same feelings of satifaction that I had after reading, \\"A Prayer for Owen Meany\\", where at the end you feel a certain sentimentality for the world and the characters you have just experienced. So obviously, I am highly recommending \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" because it is a completely enjoyable story.<br /><br />Here are some things that I really liked about this book. This book has a wonderful story arc that spans a time from the early 1900's through the mid 1950's in Barcelona, Spain. A concise summary would be that the primary character, Daniel Sempere, discovers a book by the author Julian Carax and learns that for some reason all works (and any copies of works) by this author are being destroyed. Gradually, Daniel investigates the life of Julian Carax and gradually becomes immersed himself in the events of the author's life. I might be downplaying the fact that this book is a mystery novel. It is, as there is a puzzle of sorts to figure out, however, the true highlight is the grand story with all it's characters.<br /><br />The charaters in this novel are abundant and they are outstandingly portrayed. The surrounding cast each have their own personal history and maybe even some quirks, but they come across as genuine and interesting. In particular, the character of Fermin was humorous, but the real gem in this character is the extreme wisdom he shows. There are so many instances in this book where you want to underline a line or two of Fermin's dialog in order to refer back to it because you realize the true pearls of wisdom in what he says. Overall, you get a sense that the author too exhibits wisdom in the way he integrates these characters into the story to make a cohesive whole.<br /><br />The plot and action are well thought out and executed. At the end, you feel as if you have come full circle with the characters. Only briefly, toward the middle of the novel did I feel any rambling or sluggishness in the story. The pace of this story is good even though it is moderately lengthy. The author does a good job describing the scenes and establishing a sense of place and a sense of mood. I believe there are enough \\"anxious\\" moments in this novel to satisfy the mystery aficionado even though for me, the mystery was secondary to the arcing story and the characters. Lastly, I will say that the novel ended very satisfactorily. Again, this is how a John Irving novel used to make me feel.and executed.

B002PLALCO|5.0|I liked Pink before but LOVE her now. I have never seen her live in concert but I will be next time she comes around. She lays it all on the line and seems to put on one KICK ASS show. P.S. I watched it about 10 times already.
B002NPUCP8|4.0|I've read through some of these reviews - both good and bad.  It's my belief that if reviews are strictly based on high personal expectations, or comparisons to unlike genres from where the product actually fits, they are not helpful (at least to me).  This is not a blues cd, nor does it try to be.  It's not Clapton, Santana or the like.  It is a pop album.      I cannot review Orianthi's pontential talent or previous exhibitions of her talent.  I can, however, say that this pop music album is good.  Her vocals are really good.  How often do you encounter a truly gifted instrumentalist with a really pleasing voice?  Sometimes, at best.      The song selections are \\"catchy.\\"  I am a middle-aged adult who really likes a broad spectrum of music.  I can't say that there is any innovation in the lyrics or melodies, but I can either listen to or have this music \\"playing the background\\" and enjoy it equally.    Of course, her guitar playing abilities are amazing.  Knowing that it is the vocalist who is actually the guitarist as well is what, I feel, sets this pop album apart from the rest that have been mentioned in other reviews, i.e. Kelly Clarkson, Carrie Underwood.    For what this is - a popular music album, with the intent probably being more profitability rather than critical acclaim - it's really good.
B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Its 2000 and I just get a new job. They send me to Princeton New Jersey for training. Princeton has Princeton Record Exchange--one of the biggest shops on the east coast. If you're in Calafornia, it is not the size of Aomeba, but is the Jersey equivlant.<br /><br />There is this beautiful girl working there--this is all leading to Selmasongs- and we strike up a conversation. I start to ask her out and feel an obligation to buy something, so I grab this.<br /><br />I knew Bjork and she was one of those artists I knew was great: I just never had time to delve. So I took this home where it stayed in a pile of thousands.<br /><br />Well, I just played it and it is fantastic. Selemasongs starts with a broadwayseque tune, treated with eletronics--complex eletronics that create a rhythms and counterrhyhthms. This is a thread that runs through the album.<br /><br />Bjork can do about anything, and there is a big range of styles on Selmasongs--but what makes her a great artist, and this is a common trate among great artists, is her ability to run her distinct approach through endless styles. In Bjork's case, she is one of the few artists who can take modern production and create many-layered peices. It is refreshing to hear a true artist truely taking advantage of digital technology and it's endless possibilites<br /><br />I never did get that date. But who knows how long that would have lasted. Ten years later, I have this, and so all the rejection was well worth it.

B001AI1QAO|5.0|On Land is the finest of the Ambient series or any to date. Thursday Afternoon and Neroli are excellent as well but the mood of this one is so far out in distance you never return!

B002JVWR4U|5.0|What is \\"Dollhouse?\\" It's a question that, at first, was not easy to answer. \\"Dollhouse\\" deals with an underground organization that wipes away someone's personality, leaving them in a mindless, childlike state - a doll. Then, whenever a client with enough money summons the Dollhouse's services, an Active is imprinted with a new personality, becoming whatever person the client desires. At the end of the engagement, the Active is wiped back into a doll, remembering nothing that's transpired.<br /><br />At once a dark and disturbing show, \\"Dollhouse\\" was a difficult television show to watch because it challenged its viewers, it questioned its viewers: is it possible to erase someone's soul? Is it morally right to have such technology? Is it human nature to abuse this technology? If the dolls are all ostensibly volunteers, is there such a thing as voluntary servitude or are the engagements prostitution of a most profoundly perverted nature? In a world of mindless reality shows, it's easy to see why \\"Dollhouse\\" never garnered a large viewing audience.<br /><br />The first season of \\"Dollhouse\\" led the viewer on a fascinating journey as Echo (Eliza Dushku), one of the most popular Actives, began to wake up within her doll state, developing a personality immune to the mental tampering of the Dollhouse, creating herself as a person. After the climactic season finale, \\"Omega,\\" FOX surprisingly renewed \\"Dollhouse\\" for a second season. It was in this second and ultimately final season that \\"Dollhouse\\" truly became one of creator Joss Whedon (\\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\\" \\"Angel,\\" \\"Firefly/Serenity\\")'s finest works.<br /><br />Plunging back into Echo's world, we learn that Echo is no longer quiet and quiescent. She knows who she is. She is a person. And she is determined to free herself and all of her fellow dolls from this shining, dangerous prison they have found themselves in. Joining her is Paul Ballard (Tahmoh Penikett), her handler in the Dollhouse and also her greatest ally. \\"We are lost,\\" Echo states strongly. \\"But we are *not* gone.\\" With that, \\"Dollhouse\\" takes off into one of the most mind-bending, shocking, and ultimately satisfying science-fiction sagas of this decade.<br /><br />Taking its cues from \\"Alias,\\" the second season of \\"Dollhouse\\" finds Echo and Paul pitting themselves against the insidious Rossum Corporation (the founder of the Dollhouse, taking its name from the creepy Eastern play \\"Rossum's Universal Robots\\"). This battle leads to some of the most shocking twists and reveals of the year, unveiling an insidious evil within the Dollhouse itself that shook the show to its foundations.<br /><br />Not merely satisfied with the greater scheme, \\"Dollhouse\\" devoted itself to character development as well. In the fourth episode, \\"Belonging,\\" lauded by critics and viewers alike as one of the most poignant television episodes of 2009, we learn Sierra's (Dichen Lachman) tragic and horrifying backstory, taking \\"Dollhouse\\" through one of its darkest episodes to find an unexpected and subtle beauty. The relationship between dolls Sierra and Victor (Enver Gjokaj) took on a deeply human quality as they remembered each other even beyond the wipes. Topher (Fran Kranz) had perhaps the most tragic story arc as he ultimately faced his hubris and assumed responsibility for the corruption of his technology.<br /><br />Eliza Dushku produced an amazingly strong acting streak once Echo became her own person, switching between that which was Echo and that which was not with eerie ease. Indeed, Echo posed an interesting dilemma: if Caroline (Echo's original self) was not the heroine we had once envisioned, was it murder to erase Echo to make room for Caroline? Tahmoh Penikett again played a strong role as the remarkably tragic Paul Ballard, a man brought into the Dollhouse through illusion only to find that his own \\"real world\\" crumbled even easier than fantasy.<br /><br />But Whedon again showed a remarkable ability to pick co-stars who attimes outshine the leads. Olivia Williams played Adelle DeWitt, the iron-backed head of the LA Dollhouse, whose fearsome carnival ride of emotions as she was forced to see what she had allowed herself to become was amazing in its complexity, allowing Williams to showcase a fine-honed thespian spirit (and allowing her a delicious head-to-head confrontation with guest star Ray Wise as leader of a different Dollhouse). Fran Kranz brought Topher an amazing sensitivity that allowed us to care about his character as he was brought lower than any thought possible, while Amy Acker again turned a masterful role as the troubled and ultimately tragic doll Whiskey. Miracle Laurie, who portrayed the doll Madeline Costley, stole every scene she was in with her emotive eyes as she played out a Greek tragedy upon the screen, and Harry Lennix again proved that he was perhaps the most powerful actor in the stable as Boyd Langton. The discovery of Enver Gjokaj was a true miracle of \\"Dollhouse\\" as he switched between imprints with eerie ease, twice mimicking Fran Kranz's Topher with an accuracy so profound it was creepy.<br /><br />In the end, \\"Dollhouse\\" raced toward a series finale that was terrifying in its complexity, with powerhouse episodes like \\"The Left Hand,\\" a government conspiracy thriller, \\"Meet Jane Doe,\\" which saw Echo cast out into the real world, \\"A Love Supreme,\\" featuring the return of Alpha (Alan Tudyk) as the dolls turned on their masters, and \\"The Attic,\\" where the horrors of the heart of the Dollhouse were brought to light. Ending \\"Getting Closer\\" with a hell of a plot twist that left viewers breathless, \\"The Hollow Men\\" (a wonderful allusion to the poem by TS Eliot stating \\"the world will end not with a bang, but with a whimper\\") brought the second season to a powerhouse conclusion with an episode so emotionally charged it hardly needed the heightened action sequences.<br /><br />It is here, though, that Whedon left his greatest gift to viewers. In season one, when cancellation seemed certain, Whedon created an episode titled \\"Epitaph One,\\" introducing viewers to new characters as the world was plunged ten years into the future where the Dollhouse technology had gone out of control, leaving the world in a horrifying apocalypse. It is here where season two ends, with \\"Epitaph Two: Return.\\" \\"Return\\" was a masterful series finale, bringing the series to a close and providing a beautiful (albeit unexpected) ending to each and every character. It's a wonderful send off, as each season's first twelve episodes serve as a complete story arc, allowing future viewers on DVD to watch each set of twelve episodes and then the two \\"Epitaph\\" episodes as a sort of TV movie that brought the story to a masterful conclusion.<br /><br />Featuring a cast of truly talented actors, \\"Dollhouse\\" reached new heights this season and provided some remarkable fan-favorite guest stars, featuring guest appearances from Jamie Bamber and Michael Hogan (each of \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" fame), Whedon-favorite Summer Glau (of \\"Firefly\\" and \\"Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles\\"), Patton Oswalt, Ray Wise, Alexis Denisof, Felicia Day, and returning roles from the ever-talented Reed Diamond, Miracle Laurie, Amy Acker, Alan Tudyk, and also three memorable cameos from one of the writers, Maurissa Tancharoen, as well as cameos from Dushku's real-world boyfriend Rick Fox, Olivia Williams' husband, and Dushku's older brother Nate.<br /><br />What is \\"Dollhouse?\\" It was a remarkable show that plumbed the depths of human nature and didn't flinch from the darkness it found there, a wonderful addition to the world of science-fiction, and a showcase of the power of human will over the ominous sword of technology, truly earning its place as one of Joss Whedon's greater works.<br /><br />Of course, all fans ask now is that they release a soundtrack, as the show followed Whedon's usual footprints and featured some truly amazing music.<br /><br />\\"Dollhouse\\" : Season One - Four out of five stars.<br />\\"Dollhouse\\" : Season Two - Five out of five stars.<br /><br />Also recommended: Angel, Battlestar Galactica, Alias, Tru Calling, Buffy the Vampire Slayerh One,\\" introducing viewers to new characters as the world was plunged ten years into the future where the Dollhouse technology had gone out of control, leaving the world in a horrifying apocalypse.

B001QWBM62|4.0|I am not going to type out all the features of the H4n.  Instead I will just give a brief overview of how wonderful it is.    I needed something to record my band in a live setting and I also wanted a product that would allow me to record guitar riffs via 1/2 inch jack.  The H4n does these things and so much more.    I have noticed people saying that the operation manual is hard to understand but, the  device is really simple to use after playing around with it for several hours. In other words anyone who has a small amount of comprehension to electronics will find it very simple to operate The built in effects are very good and it has a chromatic tuner that will tune a seven string guitar and I absolutely love that they thought of us seven string players.    Other users talk about hiss and noise from this unit.  The majority of these people are out recording birds and other random things and not really using the device for what it is intended for and that is MUSIC and voice.     On the downside, this unit CANNOT be used as a USB audio interface for Windows 7 64 bit. I gave it 4 stars for this reason.  Hopefully Zoom will get with the program and release drivers in the near future.  The MTR (multi track recorder) function works well but is limited in options and although you are not going to record a hit record with that function, it does work well and is better than what I thought it would be.    Overall this is a great tool for any  musician or band and has many applications and is very versatile considering price. Of course there are devices that have better sound quality but for this price there is no comparison.     So, if you are looking for a good solid recording tool this is for you.

B000LB7G00|5.0|Note to the uninitiated: this is not a replacement for your regular mouse, nor is it a gaming device (with one or two exceptions).  Its usefulness is pretty much limited to 3D modeling programs.    I mainly use this with Sketchup and sometimes with Google Earth and Adobe Acrobat.  It's great for smooth navigation and getting the exact view you want in tight spaces.  I don't end up flying off in to empty space or getting lost inside a wall like I sometimes did using the mouse.  It doesn't take long to learn to maneuver with multiple simultaneous pans and rotations.  Once you've used it, you miss it in other applications.  It works pretty well for panning around large documents in Adobe Acrobat, and I wish someone would make a Firefox plugin for it.  They do provide an SDK for anyone who wants to add 3D nav support to their software.  Check their website for the full list of supported applications.    This model is the consumer end of their product line.  If you're going to be using this professionally, skip straight to the [[ASIN:B000LB5IXC 3D connexion SpaceExplorer 3D Navigation Device with USB Interface ( 3DX-700026 )]] or the [[ASIN:B00283VWK4 3Dconnexion SpacePilot PRO - 3D motion controller - 31 button(s) - wired - USB]].  You'll want all those buttons so you don't have to move your hand between your navigator and your keyboard constantly.  I couldn't justify the cost just to mess around with Sketchup, but I have no doubt they'd pay for themselves quickly in a professional setting.    This one only has two buttons, but they're both fully programmable on a per-application and per-user basis.  (I've found them most useful for X-ray mode and Zoom Extents in Sketchup.) Your options for controlling the various axises (beyond sensitivity adjustment and reversing) are application dependent.  While it wouldn't hurt to make it just a hair heavier, it is pretty heavy and stays put when you pull up pretty well.  The included software installed painlessly and automaticallydoes the necessary configuration as you open or switch between programs so you don't have to tell it which profile to use.
0307271862|1.0|This is one of the worst books I've ever read. It's more disjointed than the numerous hacked-to-pieces victims in Chapter One. Having heard so much about this writer, I decided to pick up this new book. It starts out as a mystery, goes to some interesting history of Chinese railroad workers in the American West (presumably to tie the current mystery to the revenge of old wrongs), then turns into a bizarro mess of Maoist propaganda, via a very confused middle-aged Swedish female judge. The worst insult - the mystery of why is never solved for either the reader or the police. What an irritating waste of time.
0307271862|5.0|I was enthralled by Henning Mankell 's \\"The Man From Beijing\\".  Personally, I don't like to read \\"Inspector Series\\" mysteries, so the fact that Kurt Wallander was absent did not perturb me.  This book kept me captivated for 2 days nearly non-stop, and it is to Mankell's credit that I thoroughly enjoyed losing myself in it.<br /><br />\\"The Man From Beijing\\" is actually not a \\"new\\" novel; it has been published in many other languages and countries already.  The translation from the Swedish to English is flawless.  And the story is indeed unsettling from its very first pages; a court judge's simple oath to both truth and privacy is immediately followed by a description of a wolf on the hunt for blood.  This in turn is juxtaposed with a hunt of a different nature, that of a photo-journalist searching for a good story.  All three hunters - the judge, the wolf, and the journalist - will be grimly satisfied in short order.  What follows is a hunt of yet a different nature, this one purely for cold and final revenge.<br /><br />In Mankell's typically skilled and thrifty manner, the crime, the mystery, and the characters unfold in a rapid pace.  I particularly enjoy Mankell's writing because it has so much substance and development; he does not clutter the pages with endless simplistic dialogue.  Like each of his mysteries, this one unfolds its plot with an economy of words, saying just enough to invoke a rich and startling scenery for the reader.<br /><br />Over the course of 360+ pages the reader can understand how the sins of one's elders can span both generations and continents, and these sins can never be completely redeemed.  As the tale moves from present to past to present again, I could really appreciate Mankell's writing method.  Other authors would have chosen to reveal the past drama in dribs and drabs, perhaps a chapter at a time, but Mankell writes about each era's drama at length in large sections.  I found this technique captivating, and it keeps the reader from being inundated with so many characters that control is lost and crib notes have to be kept.<br /><br />Now, about the Communistic, dictatorial, Western-profiteering-through-blind-Consumerism diatribes that flow through the latter half of this book:  I admit I did glaze over in a few spots.  But I kept pushing through it, not taking it all too seriously; I doubt that Mankell is actually using his craft as a blatant tool here.  In fact, Communism itself has always been a bit of mystery to me and I understand it better now. I found it interesting how differing world regimes could enrich this story.<br /><br />As a reader in the US I often wonder if non-US readers find American mysteries as captivating as I do theirs.  I have a penchant for Asian, Scandinavian, and Icelandic mysteries.  Their names, landscapes, and lore are so very strange to me, so very disorienting, that they add an unnerving layer to an already disturbing story.  And Mankell's \\"The Man From Beijing\\" is deliciously disturbing.so many characters that control is lost and crib notes have to be kept.

0061020710|4.0|As far as fantasy stories are concerned, this is a solid introduction into the fantasy land of Discworld that Pratchett has created.  I enjoyed the witty banter between the two protagonists and it seemed to me that this was the focus of the story; the relationship between Rincewind and Twoflower.<br /><br />It was an enjoyable, fun book that sets itself up well for the other stories within this plot-line.

She really knows how to make the most out of those twenty minutes. It is a great workout dvd and I use it, when I am lazy to go to the gym. When there is too many people at the gym or when it is raining, or when I feel like I did not have a great work out at the gym. So buying this DVD was worth it.
0307269981|5.0|The Girl That Played with Fire is a sequel to Stieg Larsson's The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  Both are fantastic books, but I preferred this over the first.  I could not put this book down as Larsson just keeps you wanting more.  I'm ready for his third book The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets Nest that is being released in May with great anticipation.  Sadly, prior to Larsson's death, he had planned this as a 10 book series.  While the full series did not come to light, do not miss out on the excellent story telling Larsson provides in those that he completed.

B002NPUCP8|5.0|When I first got this I could hear it was a good album.  The guitar playing was great, she had good vocals on it, and overall I want to listen to the songs again and again, not just a few times.  After a few months, the songs I listen to the most, and my favorite songs on this album, are Suffocated (this one really rocks), Drive away, Feels Like Home(these last 2 have a nice slower blues like sound to them, God Only Knows (song about a loved one who died), and Bad News (a nice rockin song).  All the songs are worth it and this is a great album, every song has good guitar in it.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|I admit it.  I likes me some comic book movies and some video game movies (Iron Man and Resident Evil come to mind). I even likes me some kids toy movies (see Transformers).  They're good fun, escapist entertainment.  This movie was nothing more than a rip off of every recently released special effects blockbuster with much lower quality effects.  Remember how cheesy Daredevil was.  It's like that, only with the most painfully stupid scene I have ever witnessed in a movie.  Towards the end of the film, the villians blew up the ice on the surface of the ocean, whereupon the ice came crashing down to the bottom of the sea.  I'm all for willing suspension of disbelief, but if you are going to have magic ice that sinks like a rock, you gotta give me a reason to buy it.  Hasn't everyone on the planet seen the ice in their glass floating on the top.  Gotta go.  I'm feeling nauseous from the memory.
0060254920|5.0|my book ws delivered just as promised.  it was in great shape and delivered quickly!  good job!
0316044938|2.0|***SPOILERS***    The movie trailers got me interested in reading the book.  The beginning was chilling.  The description of Susie's rape and murder literally made me feel weak and dizzy, like I'd been punched in the stomach.  Those first few pages made me believe this was going to be a compelling and gripping story.  Not so.    Things I didn't like:    1)The only part of Susie's body that is ever found is her elbow.  It seems ridiculous that Mr. Harvey was able to cut her up in a way that only an elbow was found.  I mean, think about it.  2)If Mr. Harvey (by Susie's description) was such a \\"smart\\" criminal, why didn't he just collapse the underground hideout with Susie's body inside, since he collapsed it anyway?  Instead, he cuts her up, puts her into a seeping sack, loses an elbow and her saliva-soaked hat in the process, drags the bloody sack all over town, carelessly puts it onto the floor of his garage to seep and leak some more, then throws it into a safe and dumps it into a sinkhole.  Doesn't sound too smart to me.  (Not to mention the fact that the people who own the sinkhole never say, \\"Hey, a guy dumped a big safe with unknown contents into our sinkhole around the time that girl went missing.\\")  3)The cops go to Mr. Harvey's to investigate, but never ask to look around other than to peek into a room or two.  Completely missing the large blood stain in Mr. Harvey's garage, which remained there for years.  Duh.  4)The characters are never developed enough to make you care, or understand, anything about them.  I was confused throughout the entire book about why Susie's mother reacted the way she did.  To Susie's disappearance and death, or to everything else.  Why her eyes were like oceans.  Why she looked the way she did in photographs.  And why even introduce us to Mrs. Singh, Ray's mother?  Her character really had nothing to do with the story.  There was absolutely no character development.  5)Susie's \\"friend\\" Ruth goes around, psychically (or whatever)\\"seeing\\" pieces of unsolved crimes and writing them down in a journal.  But nothing ever comes of these \\"visions\\" or of her writings.  So what was the point?  6a)Susie taking over Ruth's body.  I wasn't sure why this happened at all.  What I was even more unsure of, is why, if Susie had the opportunity to come back to Earth for a short time, she didn't see her family.  Didn't tell someone who/where her killer was, keeping him from killing anyone else.  Didn't say, \\"Hey, guys, my body is in a safe right here in this very sinkhole you're standing next to at this very moment.\\"  Didn't tell anyone the names/locations of other victims Mr. Harvey had killed, to give their families closure.  6b)Susie taking over Ruth's body, part 2.  Instead, during her short visit back to Earth, Susie chooses to have sex with Ray, a Jr. High crush.  I found it incredibly hard to believe that a 14-year-old LITTLE GIRL, whose only sexual experience had been being brutally RAPED and murdered in her final moments of life, would like nothing more than to come back to Earth to let her crush (who is now a grown man, mind you, while she is still a 14-year-old CHILD) have sex with her in the shower of a motorcycle garage.  A rape victim, especially a CHILD, is not going to behave that way.  And yet, Ray seems completely fine with it, too.  Then, as an afterthought,  Susie tells him to read Ruth's journals...which, of course, tell him absolutely nothing (see no. 5).  So what was the point in that, either?  7)In Susie's heaven we are introduced to people that sort of never get mentioned again.  For example, I didn't see the point in introducing us to Holly, who had no story of her own and no part of Susie's experiences in the hereafter, except just happening to be there as a roommate.  Pointless.  8)Finally, the end.  As an aside, the author seems to sort of say, \\"Oh, yeah...Mr. Harvey gets hit by a falling icicle, which knocks him off balance, and he falls into a ravine and dies. Case closed!\\"  Really?  An icicle?  Come on.    The book was entertaining.  Good, but not great.  Parts of the story, such as the relationships within the family, were beautiful, sad, and brought me to tears.  I found some of Susie's descriptions of situations haunting and chilling.  However, there were a lot of holes which far outweighed the rest of the story, which rushed through years at a time then fizzled to an end.
0307269981|5.0|Love this series!  Girl Who Played with Fire is just as riveting if not more so than the first book.  Mixed feelings about anticipation of third book:  can't wait to read it, but sad it's over then.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|I had a heck of a time getting this thing to work. When I finally did, it would hang.  Tried to call Linksys (which is unfortunately Cisco now) only to be told we have to  BUY a service contract for support because this product is considered a \\"Small Business/Office\\"  product. Yeah, right!! I promptly took it back to Best Buy for a refund. Sad deal because I've  always very good luck with Linksys products AND support. Until of course, Cisco came along.
0385732554|4.0|As I began reading The Giver, I was drawn into Jonas's `perfect' world, with no disease, war, or suffering. Though his Community is strictly ruled by a Committee of Elders and there is little choice in anything, Jonas is content with his life. When he turns 12, Jonas is singled out to receive memories from the past that keep Community life simple and safe, without it's people ever realizing it. As he journeys into life outside his world, Jonas realizes that there is much more to life than what he can see.   I think Lowry does a great job of presenting sensitive issues from an innocent, unbiased boy's perspective. This book made me think, and ask myself deep questions. I would recommend it to any middle school student and higher.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm only on Day 6 but I have already lost 6 pounds!  I was going to do this video every other day and do the Biggest Loser Cardio in between BUT I have decided to do this program everyday like it says to.  I'm getting results!  Do this video like it says, find a free calorie counting website like [...] and see if you don't see any changes too. You have to watch what you eat of course if you expect to see results.  I had twins a year ago and I haven't worked out in 2 years.  I was hard at first but by the 3rd day it was a lot easier.  As for my knees, I have bad knees and they are doing fine.  I have had no problems there, I think a lot of people do because they do squats incorrectly.  I have done a lot of workouts in my time but this one is the ONLY one I have had results doing!<br /><br />I came back to give my final 30 day results.  I did this video for the full 30 days and watched what I ate.  I cut out ALL empty calories.  I love Jillian Michaels because I have went from saggy flab to a rock hard body in 30 days! There is NO cellulite on my body.  My behind is rock hard as for my legs.  My arms are more toned. I lost 14lbs and 3.5\\" on my waist.  I'm in far better shape than before I was pregnant with twins.  In fact, I think at 34 I'm in better shape than I was in High School!  Best thing about it is that it only took 30 days.  That's all you need to kick or set a habit.  I now have GOOD eating habits and I want to exercise everyday.  I highly recommend.  Stop using excuses!  It's 20 mins a day for 30 days for SERIOUS RESULTS!
B000OT8GCQ|1.0|I have read many Nicholas Sparks books and for the most part have enjoyed them. I loved the notebook and I am always hoping that he will write another book along those lines. This book is over the top and very dissapointing! I found myself skimming and skipping pages of the book and a general feeling of annoyance as I read. One of the main problems with this book is that it is so cliche it is ridiculous! Almost every page is filled with either a cliche sappy romance scene or overkill on tragedies and the worst part is the way it ends. I felt like it was a waste of my time.
B002N5N5R0|5.0|we want season 2 tocome out  by dvd sooon cant wait any idea when it will be out

B002ZG997C|1.0|This has to be the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time.  A warmed over Christian fundamentalists wet dream.  But it doesnt' stop there.  The movie is boring for long stretches, pretensiously shot in a greyish \\"artsy\\" tone, full of loopholes in its logic (not unlike actual fundamentalists) and a soaring tribute to stupidity...a world with hardly a drop of drinkable water or edible food yet somehow an endless supply of guns and ammunition...<br />I have now begun to doubt the integrity of actors that I actually liked; Washington and Oldman - did these guys read the script before signing on or were they duped?<br />If you have half a brain or even a modicum of taste avoid this movie like the plague.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I loved this movie!! Jane Austen is a favorite of mine. I would definitely have to say this is now my favorite Emma. I love the whole thing. I thought it did a great job following the book. There was a lot of detail and I loved the scenes. I thought all of the actors did a great job, they fit their roles! I just loved this movie. I have already watched it Twice and I have only had it about a week. I had seen the BBC version of Emma with Kate Beckinsale, I was not thrilled with that one, I thought the picture seemed dark like they never had enought lights for the scenes and the actors just didn't fit their characters. (I mean Emma is suppose to be a blonde!!) Now the 1996 Emma with Gwyeth Paltrow I thought was just amazing. I have to say I think the 1996 version has my favorite Mr Knightly. He was just awesome. All in all this movie is great.     WATCH this movie if you just want a funny romantic movie because it will NOT disappoint!! The first time I watched an older version of Emma I had never read any of Jane Austen's book, my friend started making me watch the movies and I just fell in love with the stories. Now I have read the books and watched many adaptations of the movies. Period films are just great!!!
B000FVQYZY|5.0|MUSE is one of the best bands of all time. Period. Being a prog rock and rock fan of music, for me they are up there with Genesis (old Genesis), Rush and the Beatles. The genius of Matt Bellamy as a song writer, gifted pianist and guitarist continues to amaze me. Obviously, I own a lot of MUSE music. Prior to purchasing this CD/DVD combo I was already obsessed with BHAR and already owned 2 copies.  What an accomplishment this album was for the band!  But to include the Absolution concert DVD in with this purchase makes it my best MUSE purchase to date, excluding concert tickets of course. The Absolution DVD is a tough one to acquire if you live in the states like me.  But at last I found it and did not hesitate to pay $70 for it. I had seen the Absolution concert on Muse's website (check it out muse.mu....it's bar none the best band website I have ever seen) and I knew I had to find it so I could blast it through the huge speakers in my living room. The version of Muscle Museum on this DVD alone makes the purchase worthwhile. Well done MUSE.
0764207407|4.0|The classic Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen is, well a classic. But the new Insight Edition with all the little extras takes it to a new level for a new generation.<br /><br />The extra tidbits of information on every page cover historical and cultural information of the time period,facts about Austen's life, themes of faith, and my favorite, comments on the books characters and plot.It's these (and more) little facts that make reading so satisfying. They really give the reader a depth into the time, characters and the authors point of view of all of it.<br /><br />Also included are discussion questions that will make this book perfect for my homeschooled high school student. I plan on buying the Pride and Prejudice Insight Edition.<br /><br />This book was provided to me free from Bethany House in exchange for my honest review.
0547258305|5.0|I have wanted to read this book long before it existed, long before it was a twinkle in Cashore's eye. I chose this book to read with my twelve year old niece (correction, a book to race through in competition with my twelve year old niece) based on reviews I found online, and couldn't have been happier with the selection. In Graceling, not only do we have an incredibly strong, capable, admirable female lead in Katsa, but also a captivating plot and wonderful cast of supporting characters.     I'm only twenty eight, but I remember that when I was my niece's age the closest thing I could find as a good, strong female role model in young adult fiction was Karana from Island of the Blue Dolphins. Now, that book is a classic and I love it to this day, but Graceling is a testament to how far we've come.    Let's hope this one becomes required reading for our daughters _and_ sons.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This DVD is everything I had hoped it would be.  We just purchased a new HD TV and wanted to enjoy something spectacular in high def. This DVD is just the ticket.  Beautiful photography and excellent narration.
B001D52XO2|5.0|For Nina Simone lovers, this collection is absolutely wonderful.  The DVD also details her life, hardships and triumphs.  Excellent collection!
0385532458|5.0|delightful characters, thought provoking stories and so very difficult to put down...book was damaged by ink splotches throughout but did not hinder the stories from being told...I was disappointed that the seller said book was in mint condition...not in my mint...
B0013URJTG|5.0|Another strong outing from one of my favorite prog bands.  Great variety.  Bonus songs and 5.1 surround add a lot as well.
B00135EUPC|5.0|I have watched this movie more times than I can count.  I purchased the soundtrack and it is absolutely amazing.  It takes you right into the movie and relaxes you.  I used to put it on when I was studying.  I highly recommend this CD!
0142000671|5.0|Here is another classic that slipped by me during my school years. What a powerful novel. It's hard to find this sort of caliber fiction in the popular market today. In a time of early rugged individualism, in the years of the Depression, here come Lenny and George. They are an oddity to the field workers they join to garner a living. It is all too transparent that the clumsy, oversized, highly-challenged Lenny needs his pal, George. He is lost without him, a walking tragedy that needs constant monitoring. What is less clear is why George continues his relationship with Lenny. Often George ponders what life might be without him. Might it be that rugged individuals experience a loneliness that is too painful?    Steinback's novel reads like a stageplay. One cannot differentiate the description of props from the description of experienced reality. Outside the text of the powerful drama, Steinbeck ends a chapter by context, noting a truck's passing on a distant road, or the noises of animals outside. The result is fascinating, enlarging the drama, and including the reader therein. Some years ago I read \\"Cannery Row\\", but I only vaguely remember it. This work will stay with me.    The characters are real, walking into the barn, and the play right off the fields as Steinbeck studied them; Slim; Candy; Crooks: Carlson. Of course, there has to be Curley, let alone his nameless wife. They all knew she was trouble, except Lennie. And therein lies the tragedy. A mouse? No problem. A puppy? Hmmm. A woman? Big problem! The tragic ending severs a relationship. But Slim offers hope, another chance.    A wonderful, powerful story of the human condition.
B002XTXFU8|1.0|Let me clear the air by saying I don't agree that this movies story was 5 or 4 star for that matter. I made the mistake of not waiting for more reviewers or opinions. Without going into details I have to say this movie was boring and so predictable. What prompted me to drop the review to one star is the quality of the DVD on Blu-ray. If you going to buy this movie please rent it first! If your expecting HD quality buy the regular DVD, its the same quality as the blu-ray. I have both top of the lines Panny 1080p 50\\" and a blu-ray player with HDMI connections. I have 50 blu-ray movies and about 400 standard DVD movies and this by far is one of the worst pictures I have ever seen. Please rent this one before you buy it and save your money. If your a movie buff like I am I hope this helped!
0439023491|2.0|I won't rehash all the comments made by those who didn't much care for this book--to do so would be repetitive--other than to say I agree with everything already pointed out in previous reviews.  The author spends nearly ALL her time telling rather than showing, summarizing rather than actually moving forward with a plot--and then recycles what is, in essence, the same plot.  Been there, done that, bought the tee-shirt.<br /><br />I never bought that Katniss was 16 to begin with--she reads much more like a 13, 14 yo girl--and her narration this time around begins to degenerate into the petulant and whiny.  While I thought HG was a terrific idea, there were big portions of that which were unnecessary and simply filler.  OTOH, the writing was better and pulled you through.  (Although, honestly, Katniss being SO oblivious about poor Peeta--what does he see in that girl--was just annoying.)  Furthermore, you knew then--as you know now--that the only time Katniss would kill anyone would be in self-defense or revenge.  She wouldn't be a heroine anyone would want to identify with if she actually were as devious and bad as her opponents.<br /><br />The cliffhanger ending was very good--but, really--I slogged through this whole book just for that?  Not worth it.  This read was drudgery, through and through--and Katniss as the leader of a rebellion won't stand up if the author can't figure out how to make her someone we'd want to follow into battle.  As of right now?  Ain't happening.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Highly recommend this DVD version of Forbidden Planet. The quality of the transfer is clean and crisp. The extras on the second DVD is worth watching. If you are a fan of 1950's science fiction movies, this is a must have for your collection.

0143038419|1.0|Italy: cute & funny, tasty; designed for Gilbert to learn Italian & sate her appetite - a fantasy we can identify with. In order to enjoy the humour, we must also wade through many ruminations regarding her addictions, unresolved guilt, bitter relationships. I wonder if she struggles with NPD? Most Bizarre Justification for Divorce on p 98 - if she persevered in her bad marriage, she'd get cancer.<br />India: ah, now we get deeper than the stomach. Snakes, evil dogs, blue lights, visits from the departed Swamiji (a fallen angel in disguise?) eventually lead to a conclusion that she must \\"abandon God, the last security blanket\\"... but oh, wait, she realises she IS God. (um, i guess you had to be there, or be her to understand.)<br />Indonesia: the self-deception complete, she has saved herself (p 344), taking on her own anger, sorrow, shame into her heart. It's as easy as your heart talking to your mind. On p 345, we are now told who was the secret voice telling her to 'go to bed' in the early weeping-on-the-bathroom-floor scene, whom she first thought might be God...but guess what? It was her future self (wiser, more mature, fully actualized)whispering to her desperate self.<br />I found her very clever in the way she could back-hand compliment herself: \\"I am so equipped to help\\" new devotees to the ashram: \\" I'm consumed with wonder at their (read, 'my') bravery for coming all the way to India\\".<br />\\"It isn't near any beaches, so the tourists (like me) who come to Ubud are a self-selecting and rather classy crowd; they would prefer to see an ancient temple ceremony than to drink pina coladas in the surf.\\"<br />More directly, she tells us she was a precocious child, & from Felipe's mouth, we are treated to praises and adorations of the unpeeled Gilbert.<br />Gilbert makes no apologies that the book is all about her, so no surprise: the inner journey starts from A. guilt-ridden unhappy self to B. self-absorbed proud-of-self self. I'm surprised she didn't include her future Self in the book's final acknowledgements for helping her present self write the book.'s final acknowledgements for helping her present self write the book.
0375703764|4.0|I chose to read this book based solely on its editorial reviews. It sounded different and potentially frightening, and I like that in a book.<br /><br />I was not disappointed. The descriptions of the house and action of the novel which centered around the house sent my imagination to a very dark, unsettling place--as did some of the other occurrences surrounding Johnny Truant, the tortured character experiencing the story of the house along with the reader.<br /><br />Those are the parts of House of Leaves that will really stick with me. The other parts, meaning the mostly fictitious academic mumbo-jumbo, were not as enthralling. Still, I read every single word. I was on the search for a deeper significance. I wasn't expecting the book to resolve everything nicely and neatly, or to make sense even, but I thought that experiencing the whole package would bring me a fuller appreciation of the work... it's like a poem; you don't just read the parts that make immediate sense. In the end, I'm still not sure if 75% of this book was really worth my time. But maybe it was. I might have to read it again to be sure.<br /><br />I strongly recommend making a friend read this book along with you. That way, you'll have someone to constantly ask: \\"What the--?\\". I really wanted to ask a lot of people that after reading this book, but I don't know anyone else who has read it. And now I'm hesitant to recommend this book to anyone, because I'm still trying  to decide what it was and if I liked it or not. In a way that makes me more able to empathize with the character Johnny Truant. We've been subjected to the same strange House of Leaves, and at least I'm not as messed up as him. I'm just kind of messed up.<br /><br />As long as you're prepared, though, I'd give this book a chance. Be forewarned: It's not just about a house. It's really a story about a young man reading the manuscript of an old man which is an academic criticism and investigation of a fictional documentary which another man made about his messed-up house.<br /><br />It's weird and somehow it gets to you. That's ultimately why I gave it four stars. I will never forget this book.p house.     It's weird and somehow it gets to you. That's ultimately why I gave it four stars.

B001VPJZFE|5.0|Missed this when it came out. Just watched it on hulu. I enjoyed it. Robert Downey Jr really is a good actor.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV (which technically isn't its title, but you can't really have an untitled album, can you?) is one of the greatest albums of the entire rock era.  After just about wearing out a vinyl copy, I decided to bite when Amazon offered a download of the mp3 version of the album for $5.  Rather than repeating endless words for the many reviews of the album, I will deal specifically with the digital download.  The downloadable album is crystal clear -- if it is not technically CD quality, it is difficult to tell.  The remastering and the Amazon version is brilliant, with the acoustic instruments of \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" sounding clear and resonant.  I have never heard any CD version of this album, so it is somewhat difficult to compare the mp3 version to other digital versions; however, it is important to note that this download lacks the overly edgy quality of some of the early digital versions of recordings from the analog era.  Excellent music, one of the great rock performances ever, excellent writing, and a solid digitalization with both depth and clarity -- what more could you ask for?  Oh, yes, at $5 it is one of the best bargains at Amazon.com.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|There is nothing more to say than this series is simply amazing.  Each disc is fascinating, breath-taking and makes you want to watch the next one immediately.  The BBC did an excellent job of putting this together and allowing the watcher the chance to see things they may never get to see or even knew existed!
B002ZBT84G|5.0|Gil is Back! This is work of someone who has seen Mister Johnson's \\"Hellhounds\\" and lived to tell about it. Thank you Sir for reminding me that Life is a Journey to be savored & examined.
B00003CXD5|5.0|This is a film that has a great cast with a equally powerful script, directed by a master.  It is without a doubt one of the best films that Bogart ever did.  It is a tightly woven adventure/drama that would be hard to beat even today.  It shows how greed can corrupt so completely that people are driven to do things they did not know they were capable of.  Still a great film after all of these years
B000X3VN46|5.0|An excellent offering from the former front-woman of Nightwish.  Softer is many aspects than the single \\"Die Alive\\" promoted, Turunen's strong and haunting vocals are definitely a welcome change from a lot of what's considered a strong female lead here in the United States.  While I went for broke and purchased the Deluxe Edition, I still found all the original offerings on the standard album to be well worth the purchase price and extremely enjoyable.  And her cover of Alice Coopers' \\"Poison\\" is priceless.  I found myself laughing with unexpected delight at her treatment of the song.      If you enjoy offerings from groups such as Nightwish, Sirenia, and Leaves' Eyes or if you're interested in hearing a different facet of the Metal genre, this is an excellent way to introduce yourself or someone else.  I am anxiously awaiting Turunen's next album.    Dan Whiskey
0312955006|5.0|Connelly just keeps turning them out, I don't know how he does it but he always has a good story and knows how to tell it so that you can't wait to turn the page.  This is another in the Bosch series and it tells a little more about what made him into the man he is.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The triggers I ordered are of good quality and sturdy.  I took some Gorilla Glue and permanently attached a pair to both of my current PS3 controllers.  I did this due to possible issues of storage for traveling.  Whether playing an FPS, Tactical , Adventure, or other title, they relieve the need and stress of having to \\"choke\\" the controller.   They also provide a more intuitive experience as you can feel the extension of the bottom triggers and don't have to remind yourself, as I do sometimes \\"OK, was that 'L1' or 'L2'?\\".  But, I'm also older and my hand-memory coordination is not what it used to be.    I would highly recommend these to anyone from casual to serious gamers.  The cost is minimal and I do enjoy my gaming experiences more just for doing a little something extra.  But, I'm also a proponent of customization as it fits an individual's needs.    Dan Whiskey
0451207521|5.0|Follett really knows how to tell a story and he always has so many interesting characters in his books.  His hero's always have flaws which make them more easy to relate to.  This time the hero's are a group of women trained to go into France before D Day to sabotage a phone exchange that will help to disrupt German communications during the invasion.  It is well done with lots of twists and turns that keep you guessing until the end.  I have given this book as a gift to a couple of people and they both really enjoyed it as well as I did.
B002QQ8HAG|3.0|I saw three fashion documentaries, Wintor, Valentino, Lagerfeld. To be Honest, the Valentino is the best one, no wonder it made the short list for the oscars...The September Issue was rush and rush throughout the movie. Lagerfeld the person is great, but the documentary just was too slow waiting for Lagerfeld's every move.
B000001GPW|5.0|This is one of the all-time greatest piano music ever performed and recorded.<br />In more recent years, two sets of collaborations have recorded some of these works and received that Grammy Award: by Abbado and Pollini; then by Salonen and Bronfmann.<br />Let me report that none of those two later award-winning recordings managed to come close, let alone surpass, this one.<br />Fricsay and Anda both share Bartok's spirit in their very veins. Just close your eyes and listen to the music.  YOu don't have to be Hungarian, nor European, to be moved and to be fully caught by the performances. This is particularly true of the diabolically difficult No. 2 Concerto. Anda managed to push aside all technical hurdles and just play 'pure music'. What rhythm, what color, what nuances! Nor do you have to be a 'classical music' lover to enjoy these works, since Bartok is a 20th century composer.<br />The wonder that Fricsay and Anda did for Bartok's concerti is that they succeeded in bringing to life the composer's creation without any intellectual or scholarly shading that pulls at interpretors of the posterior era, e.g. Claudio Abbado and Maurizio Pollini, or Salonen and Bronfman. Both Fricsay and Anda were students of Bartok and his contemproaries.<br />In this respect, these recordings would remain 'forever' the classic and the benchmark of Bartok's piano concerti.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Everything about this DVD is Christmas perfection.  Song selection, singing, music performance, set designs, and the extras on the disc are phe-nom-en-al.  If you are going to purchase only one Christmas DVD, make sure it is this one.  You will not be sorry.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I think the last time i have listened to an album so much was when i got Amy Winehouse's \\"Back to Black.\\"  I agree, the first time i heard Adele i thought she sounded exactly like Amy, however the more you listen to the songs, the more you see how they are different and Adele's songs most definitely stand on their own.  Her voice is beautiful, but the lyrics and melodies are great as well. There is one song - Melt My Heart to Stone that has 1-2 pitchy spots, but nothing horrible.  By far the best songs for me are Cold Shoulder, Hometown Glory, Make You Feel My Love, Tired, Chasing Pavements and Daydreamer, however there isn't a song that i disliked.  I definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes listening to vocal female singers/songwriters. Can't wait to see what she'll do with her next album!
0743238257|4.0|One thing you have to remember about this book is that it was written 30+ years ago.  For it's time I'm sure it was on the cutting edge, but now on many points is just wrong.  With that in mind I still think that the first two parts were great.  If they were their own book I probably would have given them five stars.  But in my opinion the last two parts pale in comparison...I wasn't even able to push myself through the last part.      I would suggest anyone read the first half of this book.  The third part was OK, but the last was downright painful...Perhaps I have just read too much in this field to be able to get past the datedness...We have learned a fair amount in the last thirty years.  While much was built on the shoulders of people like Peck, modern medicine has given us insights that couldn't even be dreamed of thirty years ago.
1881273156|3.0|\\"The Five Love Languages\\" is great, and it is a great way to learn how to love your spouse in the ways that actually allow them to experience the love you so desperately want to give.    However, the problem with this book and this concept is that it assumes you know what it means to love.    God made love, and He made it in such a way that it demands certain things.    You cannot love your spouse truly as God designed without first loving who you are in Him, without first seeing yourself as He sees you.    You must get to the core of the problem first.  You must get to the heart of the issues first.  You must start with your foundation, which is you, God, and your relationship with Him.    Then, and only then, can you begin to truly speak your spouse's \\"language.\\"    (...

B002UXRH10|4.0|I really like the intro and wish it was a full song. It is dark and mostly sets the mood for most of the rest of the album. Towards the end, the album does tend to get soft. For how dark the intro is, I expected the whole album to be dark. Stupid in Love could have been written better in my opinion. I didn't like Russian Roulette when I first heard it on the radio but now I really do like it. This song is very different and Rihanna is quite daring to even write about something so dark. I really applaud her on this one, I feel she was successful in evoking the appropriate emotions in the listeners. Rude boy is a good song to move to. Photographs is a love song that I think a lot of people can relate to. It starts off sad but ends up having a good beat to dance to. Thanks Will I Am. G4L is a bit hard but still has a feminine touch to it. Cold Case Love is one of my favorites. Justin Timberlake took part in creating this one. Overall, I think the album is excellent.
0711986746|5.0|I've been a fan of Freddie Mercury and Queen for a very long time.   A few pages in I found a marker to dot special spots to make it easier to find very special spots.   Needless to say the whole book is extremely special and loving.   Peter Freestone brings us into the life of Mr Mercury to enjoy the ups and downs of this multifaceted personality.      In all honesty there was truly alot that was humerous and found myself laughing quite abit.  The final years are delicately handeled but not enough to ebb the flow of my tears.  We all know how this story ends and wish whole heartedly that we could change the outcome.    One really does not need to be a Freddie Mercury fan to enjoy this well written biography of this multi-talented and extremely fascinating man who lived with a wicked sense of humor, generosity and love.

B0036SQZ2K|1.0|I just had to go see this movie due to the cast. I was expecting it to be funny but didn't expect much more. The film has little story, contrived plot if you can call it a plot, a dumb ending and was a general waste of time. I regreted watching it to the end.
B002UZXJA6|5.0|My wife loved her gift I got her. She plays it in the house & in her car all the time
B0000524E5|3.0|I know that the movie is kind of (okay, a lot of) stupid, but there is something about this movie that I really like.  Oh, yeah, that would be the likes of Piper Perabo, Izabella Miko and Bridget Moynahan scantily clad, dancing on a bar with booze.  Yeah, that's what I like so much about this movie.<br /><br />The plot behind `Coyote Ugly' is rather predictable and generic.  Violet wants to be a big music star but she has to fight her nerves to finally get noticed.  She shops around her demo tapes but that's kind of pointless.  When she's finally destitute she starts bartending at this crazy bar where girls act like strippers for major tips.  She's green, and pretty bad at it, but she's hot and so the owner (a pretty grounded and authentic Maria Bello) allows her to flub up as long as she keeps trying, and she does, and supposedly dancing on tables gave her the courage to face her biggest fears and just sing her heart out.<br /><br />Well, her boyfriend has to turn off the lights first.<br /><br />Like I said, this film is rather stupid, but it embraces that stupidity and makes up for it with layers and layers of fun.  The sensuality is all over the place, in a good way.  The film totally capitalizes on the draw of the actresses (I'm so glad that Jessica Simpson didn't get Perabo's role, but I'm saddened that this was basically the beginning and end of Perabo) and uses their bodies to an extreme.<br /><br />If you've never been to a Coyote Ugly, I urge you to make the trip; it's fun!<br /><br />Bello and Perabo and Goodman actually pull in really nice performances here.  Moynahan and Miko don't have a lot to do outside of be really hot, and they master that (especially Miko), so job well done.  Adam Garcia is pretty bad here.  I wish that Melanie Lynskey could get more work.  I love her, and she is SOOO talented (watch `Heavenly Creatures', NOW!).  She has yet another thankless supporting role here.  Why is it that the less conventionally attractive girls get shafted in this industry?<br /><br />Tyra Banks makes me laugh, but not because of this movie.<br /><br />All in all, I totally recommend this movie.  I mean, it's a ton of fun, and you can't go wrong with honky tonk, stripper action in bars (and the whole meaning behind the bars name is just genius).s me laugh, but not because of this movie.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|I purchased this on a recommendation and never watched the series while it aired. It's incredibly entertaining and a riot to watch. If you loved BSG, you will love Rome. Blu-ray not only looks great but also offers additional features which make it worth watching more than once.
B000EQ5TSI|4.0|I know that Beany is going to hate me for this, since he holds DePalma's original in such high esteem he actually considers the sequels to be repulsive, but I actually really like all three films in the series and feel that they play off one another rather well.  There is no denying that original 96 film is, BY FAR, the best in the series, but Woo's follow up is very engaging in its stark differences.<br /><br />Instead of playing a head game on us this time, Woo takes Hunt and his escapades in a drastically different direction.  Woo, who is well known for his unique brand of action films, makes an impressionable mark on this film, layering scene after scene with his visionary stylings and delivering a stunning array of action sequences that ooze forth with eye-catching symmetry.  The plot becomes an afterthought (unlike the original, which was all about plot).  It has been commented that this film was basically built around the action scenes, and it shows, but that is the beauty of what Woo did here.<br /><br />The original film was engaging and spellbinding because it made you think (hard), but this film is equally as engaging and spellbinding for the opposite reason, it makes you stare (hard).<br /><br />The film revolves around Hunt and a thief Nyah who fall in love after getting steamy only to have their affections tested when they join forces to smoke out Sean, Nyah's ex-lover who happens to be selling off a deadly virus.  Things get sticky (as always) and Hunt has to fight his way out, and fight he does.<br /><br />With countless action scenes that involve a freelance climb up the side of a mountain that still gives me chills; one of the best car chase scenes in movie history; a brilliant ending battle between Cruise and Scott (complete with motorcycles) and a slew of other expertly crafted espionage stuff, `Mission Impossible: 2' is totally absorbing.<br /><br />Tom Cruise, as much as I dislike him, was a perfect fit for this film, and he carried that perfect fit through all three films.  His arrogance is balanced beautifully with his dedication, and the layers of humanity given him here (no matter how forced at times) play off him nicely.  Dougray Scott makes the perfect villain and I hate that he has pretty much disappeared.  After his stint in `Ever After' I saw `heartthrob' written all over him, and then he did this and I saw versatility and really thought he would be everywhere.  Sadly, he kind of just went away.  Thandie Newton hasn't gone anywhere, and I'm happy about that.  She is totally hit or miss for me, but when she hits (like she does here), she is unforgettable.<br /><br />So, is this as good as DePalma's near masterpiece?  No, but it's a totally different film and it compliments the original.  I own all three, and like them all to varying degrees (I feel like the third film tried hard to mix the plot depth of the original with the action style of Woo's to uneven effect, but Hoffman is seethingly brilliant and reason enough to see the film).arrogance is balanced beautifully with his dedication, and the layers of humanity given him here (no matter how forced at times) play off him nicely.

0802136834|5.0|Was wonderful reading!!  I enjoy almost everything about the Tudors.  This was one of the most comprhensive readings on them that I have ever seen.  Gave lots of tidbits not known before.  Very heavy paperback but had it entirely read in about 2 1/2 weeks.

0061703257|5.0|So, I made the error of reading this book late into the night and after reading most of it and wrapping it up around 2am, I found that I had no one to share the awesomeness that this book is at that time... which sucked majorly.<br /><br />Shutter Island started a bit slow for me - I think most books start slow for me, I tend to drag around in those first introductory chapters, unless there is action, of course. But once Teddy and Chuck dock on Shutter Island and begin to learn of the missing patient I started getting into the story, I mean really into it. I had a hard time putting this book down after that. I was fascinated by the descriptions of mental healthcare in the 50's. The mystery of the missing patient, and the weird awkwardness of the doctors and orderlies had me on edge.<br /><br />Now I know most of you have seen the previews for the movie and are thinking this is a horror/scary book. I did not find it to be scary as much as I found it to be creepy. The story had this dark feel to it - there is a hurricane and most of the story takes place under heavy rain and winds. Then the setting itself, the creepy hospital full of insane patients was no help either. Reading it makes you feel chaotic - it was very fitting.<br /><br />As for the ending, woah, I did not see that one coming. When it was over, I literally had to sit there for a couple of minutes and just take it in, then rethink everything that happened... put all the pieces together... and then... wow, brilliant! There were so many twists and turns along the way that I just stumbled into that ending, blinded and pretty much blown away by it.<br /><br />This is my first Lehane novel, and it will definitely not be my last.<br /><br />If you are a fan of mystery/thrillers, I would recommend you get your hands on this book - it is nothing short of brilliant.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I was excited for this film to come out, basically for the action and the hot actors, but when I went to see it in theaters I found that it was not just an action film based on the books, it was a logical throw-around! I love those! It reminded me of the TV series House, M.D. it was definitely a great movie! I think it was more about the characters than it was about the plot (for those people who hated the plot). Although I haven't read the books, so I don't know how it related to them, I know it's always tough to satisfy book fans.
B000002IPZ|4.0|This cd seems to receive some bad reviews. Why? I don't really know. It's great!    Of course TestAmenT's two best albums are always The Legacy and The New Order, these two are untouchable in their own right, especially the former. After this point though, they took an admittedly commercial turn with Practice What You Preach. While this is a good album, I found that most of the songs were a lot slower and less heavy than they had done before, with some exceptions, Blessed In Contempt being the best.    On this album it seems to me that they tried to go back to the style of The Legacy, with more of a fast thrash assault. The only slower moments are the intro, the title track (which is one of the best anyways), and the amazing ballad known as The Legacy. Besides that we have mostly thrash in the same spirit as from their almighty first album.     The only weak point I seem to notice is that a couple songs have riffs that sound very much like they came from other TestAmenT songs. For instance Falling Fast has a riff that's quite similar to The Haunting.    This is really the last classic Testament album, the follow up would see them slowing down big time, and even though they've put out some amazing stuff since, none are quite the same style as their original four albums (although Formation came very close.) I'd recommend this one after you get the first two and The Gathering, all these are mandatory.

B002MEW7YY|3.0|\\"Lucia di Lammermoor\\" is a story set in the very early eighteenth-century, a story of the tragic results from a over-bearing brother's control over his sister.  Updating it to the Victorian period and transforming it into a ghost story do an injustice to what it was meant to be.  Peter Gelb, in his new productions, seems to favor concept over opera.  Clearly, Mary Zimmerman's concept of Lucia does not fit the concept of the opera.    Particularly annoying was the photographer's posturing his subjects during the sextet.  It is a travesty for one of opera's grandest ensemble numbers to be used only as background music for a bit of comic business.  While not the best, this would be a worthy addition to any cd collection; but is a negative dvd.
0790729652|5.0|BATMAN (1989) is the one Tim Burton film where his directorial style worked in perfect synergy with mainstream Hollywood. Many of his other earlier films, including BEETLEJUICE (1988), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1993), ED WOOD (1994), and ironically BATMAN RETURNS (1992) are 100% TIM BURTON! They are all great in that Burtonesque way. While Burton's first Batman film BATMAN has obvious Burton touches: odd and disturbing characters, dark tone, neo-noirish look, the film still manages to be generally accessible to the mass audience. It moves at a fast, breezy pace and has an epic, Hollywood feel to it, with a satisfying conclusion. But that, in this case, is not a bad thing! I have re-watched this entertaining flick so many times it isn't funny! It just works. Can't say that for many of the superhero films in this new PC, uninspired generation of films.<br /><br />I actually saw BATMAN (1989) when it first came out in movie theatres and was blown away by it's originality and scope...still am. Even more so now since it holds up 20+ years later as great entertainment. In retrospect, Michael Keaton was the perfect choice to play the fractured, flawed antiheroic Bruce Wayne AKA Batman. But I always felt he was the right choice! Keaton captures the guarded loneliness of the Bruce Wayne character, while still being very convincing as a tough guy who can hold his own when donning the cape and cowl! Mr. Burton...you made the right choice!<br /><br />The other inspired (and perhaps more obvious) choice was casting the legendary Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier AKA The Joker. Nicholson is convincing as high-level \\"yes man\\" thug Napier who through a nasty accident becomes facially scarred and assumes the Joker persona. And Nicholson really looks like The Joker in this! He has so many memorable lines that I think about all the time. The hero-villain chemistry between he and Keaton is electric.<br /><br />Kim Basinger (at her most gorgeous!) admirably plays nosy photojournalist Vicki Vale, who arrives in Gotham City to unlock the secret of the mysterious Caped Crusader who has been \\"terrorizing\\" low level criminals throughout the city. She ends up falling in love with Bruce Wayne (lucky bastard!). Basinger is the weakest link of the main actors, but she still does a good job of emoting, being simultaneously fascinated and repulsed by Batman and Joker's antics. She screams a lot, but look at the freaks she's dealing with! Can you blame her?<br /><br />The solid supporting cast includes Michael Gough (wonderful turn as Alfred, Bruce's ever-so-reliable and dependable butler and caretaker), Robert Wuhl (in an energetic turn as Vicki's fellow reporter Alex Knox), Billy Dee Williams (as DA Harvey Dent), and Pat Hingle (as world-weary Police Commissioner Gordon). In particular, Keaton and Gough have an effortless chemistry as though they have been close their whole lives. Gough came back for Schumacher's cartoonish campy films and he had none of the chemistry with either Kilmer or Clooney that he had with Keaton in the Burton ones. It was weird watching Gough's Alfred interact with those tepid versions of Bruce Wayne.<br /><br />As previously stated, I am amazed at how Burton's style fused perfectly with more conventional Hollywood touches and created something special out of it. It could have been a monumental failure, but instead ended up being a template for all future superhero films.ity to unlock the secret of the mysterious Caped Crusader who has been \\"terrorizing\\" low level criminals throughout the city.

0307271862|3.0|For anyone planning to read this book, know that the real purpose of the book is not the mystery/thriller type (Inspector Wallender) novel that Mankell normally writes.  Yes, there is a mystery here, but it's just a device to allow Mankell to pursue another purpose altogether.  Mankell has been involved in Mozambique since 1985 (seven years before the end of their civil war).  In 2009, Mozambique ranked 172 out of 182 on the UN's Human Development Index.  Zimbabwe wasn't included because it refused to supply data to the UN agency.  Mankell has written previously on the problems caused in Africa by the European Imperialism of the 19th century which left most of the continent unprepared for independence which came in the 1960s.    With all this in mind, Mankell has created a situation, where the Chinese Communist government is looking for a way to 'export' it's excess population.  Since the late 1980s, when China opened it's economy to internal capitalism, a portion of the country has seen amazing growth.  We're talking 10% growth for over twenty years.  The upper strata of the Chinese, have become very wealthy and many cities (like Shanghai and Beijing) have taken on the look of Tokyo.  But all this prosperity has been reserved to the coastal area of China, while 'deep China', the hinterlands have seen little change.      Mankell isn't the first European to write about the 'danger' that the peasantry represents to China and the governing Chinese Communist Party.  Chinese American authors have written about the HCC (High Cadre Children) and how the new 'wealth' is concentrated in their hands; and how many of the manufacturing enterprises in the 'special economic zones' are 'owned' by the People's Liberation Army.  Keep in mind that even if 200 million Chinese have a better life, that leave over one billion who still live in poverty.  At what point will the 'non's' demand their share from the 'have's'?    Based on the polemics of the Chinese that are represented in this book, the best thing they can do is 'export' Chinese peasants to Southern Africa (Mozambique and Zimbabwe) where they can labor for both the indigenous and Chinese governments. The local politicos would be paid off, the local people would be kept down by the local police and military, and China would reap the profits of the exports.  It would also be a release value for their excess population.  Think of Southern Africa as China's own Siberia, a place to send dissidents, and to exploit for its' resources.  This part is very provocative in it's vision for Africa.    But back to the book.  The first third of the book is about a massacre in a small town in central Sweden.  Nineteen of the twenty-two residents are murders with either a large knife (machete) or sword.  The killer has only one clue, a red ribbon.  A local is accused of the murders, and supposedly confesses before he commits suicide.  The book then goes off a the \\"Chinese tangent\\" and doesn't get back to the murders until the last fifty pages.      This is NOT a police procedural and a political statement wrapped in a mediocre novel (at best).    Zeb Kantrowitz

B0033TJATW|5.0|I bought this NTSC/Region 1 DVD from the secondary seller. It arrived on the earliest of the promised delivery dates, and it ran perfectly in my DVD player. So from a buyer's standpoint, I give it an A!    As for the content, I can't offer much more than other fans have said. In fact, I can't say enough! Michael looks so joyful and earnest in these pieces; you just want to eat him up! I especially liked his pseudo-live (well, I guess it's really live, but given for a preset audience) rendition of the Lennon-McCartney classic \\"Come Together.\\" His treatment is suitably funky! For comparison, go on the Web and find one of the Beatles' live performances. John and Sir Paul would have no complaints, I think.    Anyway, this Moonwalker DVD is a great buy, and I recommend it highly.  :-}  Enjoy!!!
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I bought this entire series after seeing them via Netflix. All five of them. I would call these films somewhat dark in nature. The supporting cast is superb as is the dialogue. I haven't read the books that were the basis of these films, but I imagine they are very good. I don't usually care too much for the cops and robber type films, but, these are really captivating. The only negative thing I can say is that they are too short, being made for television. Hopefully we will see more of Jesse Stone. This is the best Tom Selleck has ever done, bar none.
0316044695|5.0|This is an engaging account of Navy Seal Training and of the Tragic end to a Special Forces Mission in Afghanistan. However, anyone who buys into the author's simplistic political diatribe should be very, very careful. Below are some of the discrepancies raised by the Father of the Seal Team Leader- Michael Murphy killed during the Mission described in the book.      ****It's impossible to know if Mr. Luttrell, as the only American survivor of the attack, got his account right, but based on his knowledge of his son, Mr. Murphy contends that several things are wrong.    First, he says, as commanding officer, his son would not have relied on a vote. He might poll his men to get a sense of their feelings. He might let them think they were making the call, as long as they agreed with the decision he intended to make. Mr. Murphy said his son, who loved history, admired how Abraham Lincoln would pose a problem to his cabinet and let them think they were deciding, when he was actually guiding them to the answer he wanted. \\"Michael and I had long talks about this,\\" Mr. Murphy said.    Second, he said, he never heard Michael use the term liberal media, nor did Michael think that way. From Mr. Murphy's years as a prosecutor, he has many journalist friends. \\"Michael knew and liked them,\\" he said.    And third, he said, his son would never have seriously considered killing noncombatants.    \\"He wouldn't be able to live with himself,\\" Mr. Murphy said. \\"Michael's view was there are more good people in this world than bad, and he gave people the benefit of the doubt. He was definitely not going to kill a 14-year-old boy who would have reminded him of his brother.\\"    Mr. Murphy said that \\"even knowing the outcome\\" he was proud that his son let the herders go.****    Seems as though the author may have \\"spun\\" his account to fit a particular political viewpoint and in the process wrote a book full of red meat for ideologue partisans.

0790729377|5.0|I remember seeing \\"A Streetcar Named Desire\\" for the first time.<br /><br />It was like witnessing a revelation.<br /><br />The characters are compelling, the story is multi-level, and the cinematography is stunning.  Stanley Kowalski's animalism is matched only by Blanche DuBois' inexplicable cruelty.  Williams and Kazan collectively animate the sometimes profound differences between men and women and the result is an epic struggle, almost biblical in proportion.<br /><br />Cut to the chase:<br /><br />In the end, Blanche is reduced to nothingness.  Stanley destroys her, or rather, what little remains of her fragile personality.  There is no communion or communication between them.  Even though Blanche is his sister-in-law, Stanley does not conceal his feelings of absolute hatred for her as he violently finalizes their relationship.  Unlike the very subtle Blanche who would give anything to rid the world of him, Stanley does not hide his burning desire to destroy her.<br /><br />\\"I've always relied on the kindness of Strangers,\\" is a phrase cloaked in deception.  It is a spoken by Blanche, as if in a language completely foreign to Stanley.  And, it is the inevitable ending to this modern tragedy.<br /><br />\\"A Streetcar named Desire\\" is a still a very powerful film which will polarize many viewers along the lines of gender.  It is an exceptional story which holds up well after over fifty years.

0307387151|5.0|Terrific novel.  I have thoroughly enjoyed two previous works by McEwan:  SATURDAY and ON CHESIL BEACH, along with numerous short stories that have appeared in The New Yorker magazine.  ATONEMENT has been on the family shelf for a long time, and I had been looking forward to it.  Imagine my surprise 120 pages into the novel, when I was running out of gas.  Part I drones on in endless description and detail, something akin to an sleepy Masterpiece Theater piece on post-Edwardian England.  Perceptions and innermost thoughts of the leading characters are unfolded through excruciating stream-of-consciousness style writing.  I nearly gave up slogging through this lengthy setup for the central tragic plot.<br /><br />Suddenly, Part II commences on the road to a rescue of the British Expeditionary Force at the Dunkirk beaches, and the novel tears ahead at breakneck pace.  One can barely put it down.  In Part III, the atonement, protagonist Briony Tallis receives a lengthy letter critiquing her submission to a literary magazine's editorial staff of what amounts to McEwan's Part I.  It is a masterstroke.  Here McEwan brilliantly plays his own critic, within his own pages! He mocks his own style as too derivative of Virginia Woolf. \\"Your most sophisticated readers might be well up on the latest Bergsonian theories of consciousness, but I'm sure they retain a childlike desire to be told a story, to be held in suspense, to know what happens.\\"  Yes, precisely! The epilogue, Part IV, allows the writer to blur the storyline between fiction and reality, to continue the suspense, but also to let us know what happens.  ATONEMENT is a showcase for McEwan's creative genius.

1608201236|5.0|This finale was perhaps more romance than mystery, but that is a fitting end to Adrien's story.    The physical and emotional journey that Adrien has been through makes this finale rings true.  Having undergone abdominal surgery, I must say that Josh Lanyon hit it right on the head:  fatigue; emotional swings; wanting people around, but wanting to be alone; and above all, the intense desire to feel \\"whole\\" again.  Unveiling the scar is as hard and painful as painted.  So it's no surprise that Adrien is unable and unwilling to commit to Jake immediately, for all that he's wanted Jake to be with him openly for years.  The after-shocks of the events in \\"Death of a Pirate King\\" (not to mention the other four books) couldn't be sewn up in a single chapter.  As Jake tells Adrien (who doesn't want to hear it), Adrien hasn't yet come to terms with everything that has happened between them.    Adrien has changed, too, as Angus says.  So the question of moving forward in his relationship with Jake is not just about Jake's issues.  Adrien is learning how to love others, and to allow them to love him, albeit a trace grudgingly at times.  And not just with Jake, it's evident in his interactions with his step family, and of course his mother.  The poignant story about why he has always called his mother by her name is a wonderful moment, where Adrien experiences his mom as a whole being, rather than just a maternal, well-meaning nag.  And of course, we get our happily ever after ending with Jake!  A perfect ending for the series.
1439153663|4.0|I thought this was a beautiful read.  I especially liked the dual narration of Lavinia and Belle.  Lavinia is young and often naive, so you don't always get the full story from her point of view.  Belle gives us the darker side of the truth. Lavinia and Belle are interesting characters, but as leads, they react much as you would expect them to throughout the book.  For me, the most interesting character was Marshall, the Captain's son.  I really felt the most sympathy for him, despite his mostly evil presence in the book. He was a young impressionable boy whose only male role models (of his color) were an abusive, violent racist and a sexually abusive authority figure because his father was more in love with the sea than with his own family. I think Marshall wanted to be good, but he just didn't know how. I felt the Captain was actually a decent man, and things would have been much different if he'd spent more time at home. I did enjoy the slaves of the plantation and their interactions with each other, but they fit molds that one would expect.<br /><br />Overall, I thought this book gave us a unique point of view of slavery and life on a plantation, and it felt authentic for the time period and location (in my part of the world, no less!). The subject of enslaved white people is one that's not often explored, and I appreciated this deviation from the usual.

1596062754|5.0|I enjoyed this conclusion to the story of John Perry, Jane Sagan and Zoe Boutin. After some quiet time as colonists on Huckleberry political matters are disturbing them again. I like the interplay between John and his assistant Savitri. There were lots of humorous remarks. I like the relationship between Zoe and John too. I like learning more about Jane as she learns to be a regular, unenhanced human and how she reacts when she is enhanced again against her will.<br /><br />Then John and Jane are chosen to be the leaders of a new colonial venture. Only the Colonial Union doesn't tell them that the Conclave (a group of over 400 alien races) has forbidden non-members to colonize new planets. Nor does the CU actually send them to the planet they think they are colonizing. After some adventures including discovering that they are not alone on the planet and the aliens are hostile and learning to survive without all their electronics, the CU comes back. Roanoke colonists are in danger and not only from the Conclave.<br /><br />The story was exciting. My only complaint is that the story ended. I want to know more about these characters and what happens next.

0061968579|4.0|It's 1954.  Teddy Daniels and his partner are both FBI agents investigating a missing persons report on Shutter Island, a psychiatric facility for the criminally insane.  The missing person is a mass murderer who has escaped the mental hospital on the island.  Knitting together clues, Teddy becomes convinced that the doctors and patients are all setting him up for something, but he has no clue what, until the end.  And what an ending!<br /><br />The graphic novel is based on the book (not the film) written by Dennis Lehane.  The muddy brown & yellows are thanks to French artist Christian De Metter.  The art is important to the story, to convey the depravity and depression often associated with places like this.<br /><br />I have not read the book nor seen the movie, so I can only assume the ending is the same.  The panels are written out like a standard comic book, with no splash pages or excitement of a thrilling ending.  The story plods along in some places - the parts with no dialogue and just pictures is especially interesting and leads you on a merry mind-bending chase.<br /><br />If Dennis Lehane is making some kind of commentary on psychiatric methods, he's doing a good job.  Is it \\"therapy\\" to lock someone up, possibly for life, filling a patient with drugs and arcane and at times evaluative silly advice that does nothing to forward sanity?<br /><br />Interesting subplots:  Who is this girl that disappeared from her cell?  Why are there guards around a \\"sanitation facility?\\"  And what's the meaning of a code found in the missing girl's room?  All artfully done, all suspenseful in reading.<br /><br />There are some murder scenes, some craziness and some blood but not graphically so.<br /><br />Check out the publisher's websites, at the Tokyopop and Harper Collins websites for more info on the book and its critical reception.
0375842209|1.0|Why the large number of positive reviews? Does this mean that the book is yet another one chosen for first one book group and then another? Red flag!!! I found the narration by \\"Death\\" to be so contrived that I couldn't make it past the few pages. No matter how compelling the actual story might be, this self-counscious, annoying literary device made the book unreadable. Pay attention to the negative reviews, and spare yourself this tedious narrative.
0446615641|1.0|\\"Stone Cold\\" is my first visit with David Baldacci, and will probably also be my last.  As others have mentioned, this book forms part of a loosely continuing series about the Camel Club, a group of disparate individuals who nonetheless have specific skills to add to the group's success in variously odd undertakings.  Had I known that \\"Stone Cold\\" was NOT an effective stand-alone story, I would've attempted to read its predecessors, as I had no idea of what the Camel Club was, who were its members, what their back-stories were, or even what their personality traits, strengths and weaknesses were.<br /><br />In particular, the Conroy/Bagger interplay and its ongoing subplot needed much more recapping for a new reader.  It seemed (to me) ludicrous that someone as insecure as Annabelle could've ripped off a cold-blooded thug like Bagger to the tune of 40 million dollars, and still be standing upright.  Indeed, as the story developed, Bagger seemed to be ordering the termination of people who stood in his way with gay abandon!  And yet here's Annabelle apparently surviving in the same city as Bagger, and right under his nose!  And Paddy's involvement was totally obscure; why was he included in this story at all, other than as a convenient foil to justify Annabelle's ongoing (and annoying to the reader) bitterness at the whole world -- seemingly in general.<br /><br />In fact, all the interpersonal relationships of the main cast were so lightly drawn as to be almost incomprehensible to a first-time Stone reader.  I was actually having problems remembering who was whom, whether they were good guys or baddies, how their pasts interlocked, and even whether I was meant to like them or not.  All the characterisations were on the light side; I felt no empathy for any of them.<br /><br />It was also unwise of Baldacci to unwittingly create two major story protagonists whose backstories turned out to be too similar in nature.  Although I'm guessing that Oliver Stone was intended as the hero, I found myself cheering for Harry Finn -- whom I'm guessing was meant to be the bad guy?  Weak (lazy?) character development again.  Both these guys seemed to have bits and pieces of Jack Reacher, but it was as though each had a somehow  incomplete set of super-hero abilities, whereas we needed at least one guy of that ilk to believe in.<br /><br />And, as others before me have mentioned, Baldacci was somewhat lazy in his research.  In many cases we read of \\"a device\\" being used for some high-tech purpose, without even a passing explanation of its inner workings.  At one stage, Finn deactivates a vehicle's alarm by just pressing a device against its fender.  Baldacci doesn't even pretend to offer some sort of explanation as to how this would work -- even something technically implausible.  That's just lazy writing.  In another scene we have Finn \\"using a support device not available to the public\\" to ride on the hull of a ship.  Apparently we're meant to accept that Finn smuggled this \\"device\\" -- and himself -- into a top-security Naval base using only some forged paperwork and a disguise.  Please!<br /><br />And the recurring \\"CPU\\" was really, really tragically slack writing.  Nobody I know would ever call a personal computer box or case a CPU.  If you're going to use IT terminology, at least make it accurate.  I too dislike the single-page chapters. What a waste of trees.  Or did Baldacci's publishers demand precisely 388 pages, so he achieved that by adding lots of superfluous white space?  I didn't notice this at the time, but this book would've stayed on the shelf had I noticed, as I'm one who prefers at least a dozen pages per chapter.<br /><br />All up, a disappointing book.  I'm surprised that the blurb describes Baldacci as \\"a #1 bestselling author\\" considering the lightweight predictable plot, sketchily drawn and generally unlikable characters, the often implausible dialogue, and the unconvincing or non-existent technicalities of all the \\"devices\\" used conveniently just as they're needed.  Almost a deus ex machina?.  Almost a deus ex machina?

0446691437|2.0|The book starts of reasonably well defining our problem as resistance and how it manifests itself. Then it goes into some ways to overcome resistance which boil down to, \\"be a professional and get down to work.\\" Then the wackiness ensues. The author brings out an amalgamation of Eastern mysticism, Greek mythology, Zen Buddhism, and most any other form of spirituality you can think of to call upon to inspire you.
0061689246|4.0|Fantasy novel, mostly notable as the first independent book-length prose by the author. Plot summary you can find elsewhere, and not planning to spend too much time reviewing this one. The whole effort struck me as competent but unexciting, a coming-of-age travel adventure with a backdrop of magic and strange creatures that didn't show anything like Gaiman's full abilities. There's nothing of the edge, raw creativity or narrative power of Gaiman's Sandman or American Gods. Instead there's a basic narrative that feels too plain, too modest, to be really worth Gaiman's time. So there's enough plot twist to keep the whole thing fairly energetic and moderately meaningful, but it's still lackluster.<br /><br />Perhaps the most disappointing element was that the political intrigue surrounding the Stormhold was so stylized as to be dull, which robbed a large point of the ending of its force. On the other hand, some of the basic premises of the book are rather engaging, with the question to bring back a shooting star that is in Faerie a living being, and the town of Wall elaborates trying to ward off Faerie. This last is the most interesting element by far, and brings a touch of genuine structural excitement to the work, while it's basic the scenario imagined for the barrier between mundane and fantastical is fairly unique.<br /><br />For a long point when reading this book I was trying to figure out if this was stronger or weaker than Gaiman's most recent book, the improbably Hugo-winning The Graveyard Book. I think ultimately it's a bit weaker, though they're in the same general ballpark. The Graveyard Book was better at atmosphere, of taking a core narrative and reworking it into an effective post-urban fantasy atmosphere, for all that the villain and central conflict were much lamer than in Stardust. Both books are worth it for Gaiman devotees(which, of course, I'm on record as being) and probably will be at least tolerated by those interested in traditional-style fantasy. I still hope to see more of the other Gaiman, the mindblowing one.e to see more of the other Gaiman, the mindblowing one.
0061703257|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. Lehane has written a tight thriller, with many twists and turns that left me guessing what was going to happen next. Teddy is a character that was easy to relate to, and I can't help but wonder what choice that he made, seeing as how the ending is so ambiguous.
B001E1M8G8|2.0|This is another below-average plodder from Grisham.  Suggested tags: thriller (don't be absurd!); Italy (it's a travelogue of Italy, esp. Bologna); CIA (on a rudimentary and laughably superficial level).  Sadly, the incredible promise Grisham showed in his early career with those awesome first two books (A TIME TO KILL and THE FIRM) seems to have been slowly drained in subsequent books which were great, to decent, to passable, to misguided, to downright thoroughly disappointing.  In short, I don't know why I finished this book; it was grindingly tedious until the last fifty pages -- when it picked up considerably.  But then, I should have abandoned it for something better (Dick Francis, James Lee Burke, John Sandford, Robert Parker, Robert Crais) loooong before I discovered that.
1592332803|3.0|The chocolate cake, pancake and pie crust recipies are worth the price of this book.  I have enjoyed it a lot, but must say lemon bars w/o the eggs just aren't worth eating and tofu whipped topping is disgusting.  There are times when we must choose to go without or eat the real McCoy.  Also, some of the recipes are a little greasy, i.e. the zucchini bread should have called for applesauce exclusively and the Waffles II are slimy on the inside. Some of the recipes come out too dry, i.e. the drop biscuts.  The peanut butter cookies hinge on slightly underbaking them or they come out like cardboard.  I especially liked the author's educational section at the front of the book where she TEACHES us what certain foods do in a recipe, i.e. vinegar in the chocolate cake instead of eggs.  Because of this I have been able to redu many of my old-time favorite recipes to make them vegan.  I think the author's intent is animal rights protection vs. health conscious eating and she harps on this a bit too much.
0812973992|4.0|Immediately, I was pulled in by Colum McCann's writing and characters.  However in books like this, regardless of how good the writing is and how compelling the characters are, if something doesn't pull the vignettes together, it doesn't stand up as a novel to me.<br /><br />Colum McCann did this masterfully.  He pulled these characters together in ways that were not at all predictable, and the theme of the world turning in the midst of everyone's separate lives runs through it completely.<br /><br />Excellent, excellent book -- 4 + stars.
0743437497|5.0|What makes the story work is the depth given to characterization. Normally King's characters are pretty flat, but here some pretty intense and well rounded psychologies are pulled off. In particular Jack Torrence emerges as one of King's more effective protagonists/villains, a main of equal measure talent and frustration, deeply flawed but aware of this and trying to overcome his own propensity for alcohol and violence. And this allows the main conceit of the novel to work, perhaps better than it should. Making the violence occur not because of flaws in Jack's character but from ghosts could so easily have turned trite, or delivered what TV Tropes would call a Space Whale Aesop--a situation too rooted in the fantastic to really be relevant, and with murderous domestic violence that risks downplaying the significance of the reality in the premise. To an extent this occurs, particularly in the climax, but the major buildup makes it more complex. The final result is not Jack becoming psychotic purely on his own devices or him being bodyjacked by ghosts. Instead it's a process of corruption and seduction, at once metaphysical and deeply personal, which in itself builds up a lot of pathos on all sides.

6304936303|5.0|\\"The Last Boy Scout\\" follows the typical Bruce Willis formula that made him a household name in the late '80s. A shaky marriage, a down on his luck PI, lots of action and shooting and an eager and willing participant make this one of Bruce's best movies. In this picture Bruce plays the title role, aka Joe Hallenbeck who goes up against a ruthless killer who just happened to kill Jimmy Dix's (played wonderfully by Damon Wayans) girlfriend. I enjoy this movie because it's pure Bruce Willis. He is in nearly even scene and displays lots of dangerous action moves. I love how he takes 2 handguns and holds them up to the bad guys, that's so hot. I also like the part when he told one of the thugs \\"if you hit me again I'm going to kill you.\\" Take one guess what Bruce did... There's also an interesting subplot involving Joe's daughter (Danielle Harris, from the \\"Halloween\\" movies and the series \\"Roseanne\\"). I thought it was so funny how they spoke to each other with that puppet. If you don't mind (lots) of cussing, lots of shooting and a whole bunch of Bruce in your face than you must see this picture.

044654146X|5.0|Almost exactly a year ago, my phone rang. \\"Hi, this is Dan Senor. I am writing a book about the impact of the military on the economy of Israel. I was told that as part of my research, I needed to talk with you. Is this a good time for a conversation?\\"  And so began my involvement with the watershed book, \\"Start-up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle.\\"<br /><br />Dan Senor was told to contact me - not because I know anything about the Israeli economy - but because I have strong opinions about how American military veterans are impacting - and will in the future impact - the U.S. economy. Senor and his collaborator, Saul Singer, have written a book that I now consider a \\"must read\\" for anyone who has an interest in innovation and entrepreneurship. By almost any reasonable metric, the Israeli economy has emerged as the most innovative in the world. This book explains the complex reasons behind this unlikely success story.<br /><br />Using carefully reasoned argument and convincing case studies, Senor and Singer tell a compelling story about the unique qualities that allow Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) veterans to perform at a very high level in the business world. Some of the factors that they describe in detail involve the process by which promising Israeli high school students are selected and trained for elite military units, the unique sense of camaraderie that develops within those units and perpetuates through years of military reserve service, the willingness to challenge authority, and the sense of urgency that is part of every day life in Israel.<br /><br />Early in the book, the authors compare these characteristics with the U.S. military:<br /><br />\\"Former West Point professor Fred Kagan concedes that Americans can learn something from the Israelis. 'I don't think it's healthy for a commander to be constantly worrying if is subordinates will go over his head, like they do in the IDF,' he told us. 'On the other hand, the U.S. military could benefit from some kind of 360-degree evaluation during the promotion board process for officers. Right now in our system the incentives are all one-sided. To get promoted, and officer just has to please more senior officers. the junior guys get no input,'\\" (Page 53)<br /><br />A culture that embraces an assiduous commitment to thoroughly debriefing every aspect of performance is a hallmark of Israeli business culture that has its roots in the shared IDF experience of many Israeli entrepreneurs:<br /><br />\\"Israeli air force pilot Yuval Dotan is also a graduate of Harvard Business School. When if comes to 'Apollo vs. Columbia,' he believes that had NASA stuck to its exploratory roots, foam strikes would have been identified and seriously debated at the daily 'debrief.' In Israel's elite military units, each day is an experiment. And each day ends with a grueling session whereby everyone in the unit - of all ranks - sits down to deconstruct the day, no matter what else is happening on the battlefield or around the world. 'The debrief is as important as the drill or the live battle,' he told us. Each flight exercise, simulation, and real operation is treated like laboratory work 'to be examined and reexamined [is subjected to] rich - and heated - debate. That's how we are trained'\\" (Pages 93-94)<br /><br />Leave it to me to see evidence of Renaissance Men at work and \\"intersectional thinking\\" in operation in the way in which Israeli entrepreneurs conduct themselves. Here is one such example:<br /><br />\\"I was working on a creative project with an art graduate from Bezalel. He looked the part - long hair, an earring, in shorts and flip-flops. Suddenly a technological problem erupted. I was ready to call the techies to fix it. But the Bezalel student dropped his graphic work and began solving the problem like he was a trained engineer. I asked him where he learned to do this. It turns out he was also a fighter pilot in the air force. This art student? A fighter pilot? It's like all these worlds come colliding here -- or collaborating - depending on how you look at it.\\" (Page 183)<br /><br />The authors compare the performance of the Israeli educational system, which encouraging vigorous questioning to that of neighboring Arab countries, where rote memorization is the model<br />for teaching:<br /><br />\\"This emphasis on standardization has shaped an education policy that defines success by measuring inputs rather than outcomes. For example, according to a study produced by the Persian Gulf offices of McKinsey & Company, Arab governments have been consumed with the number of teachers and investments in infrastructure - buildings and now computers - in hopes of improving their students' performance. But the results of the recent Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study ranked Saudi students forty-third out of forty-five.\\" (Page 213)<br /><br />Israeli focus on outcomes versus the Arab world's emphasis on inputs reminds me of a recent conversation with my friend, USN Vice Admiral (Ret.) Wally Massenburg. While he headed up Naval Aviation, he pushed a paradigm shift within the naval community to begin measuring outcomes rather than inputs, and the result were dramatic. At the end of his career, he had transformed a very tradition-bound part of the U.S. Navy into an entity no known as \\"Naval Aviation Enterprises.\\"<br /><br />I have not touched with any detail on the results of my conversation with Dan Senor. He was gracious enough to include several quotations from that interview in one of the book'ss chapter. Those quotation will be the subject of a separate upcoming Blog post.<br /><br />I have been recommending this book to anyone who will listen. If you have any stake in leading innovation in any form, you will find challenge and inspiration in the pages of this book and in the practices it describe among Israeli start-up companies.<br /><br />Enjoy.<br /><br />Alending on how you look at it.\\" (Page 183)    The authors compare the performance of the Israeli educational system, which encouraging vigorous questioning to that of neighboring Arab countries, where rote memorization is the model  for teaching:    \\"This emphasis on standardization has shaped an education policy that defines success by measuring inputs rather than outcomes.

B0007PALZ2|5.0|This is a fascinating sci-fi movie with lots of twists and turns. The movie is very complex and almost haunting in it's surrealism. Bruce Willis gave one of his best dramatic performances ever as James Cole, a man sent back in time to save the world. I enjoyed the character of Kathryn Railly (played by b-movie queen, Madeleine Stowe) very much, as well, because she added both a sense of realism and continuity. Brad Pitt as the resident kook, Jeffrey Goines, was just all over the place. The guy was a little nutty but it was pretty hot when he pulled his pants down. \\"12 Monkeys\\" is the type of movie that will invoke thought and discussion. I don't want to give it away but this is also not the type of movie that is all tied up once you finish it. The 2005 DVD includes the original trailer as well as a featurette.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|The stereo box set offers the entire Beatles catalogue in upgraded remastered sound, packaged in a lovely if somewhat awkward container.<br /><br />Perhaps someone at Apple was nostalgic for the early 80s CD longbox, or they didn't get the memo that MP3's are the preferred format for music now. At any rate, this is an ideal (and somewhat more economical) way to acquire all the Beatles' music, even if it's on a format that is quickly becoming obsolete.<br /><br />The Beatles in stereo has always been a somewhat odd experience. They weren't particularly interested in the technology (spending much more time on the mono mixes of their albums until late in their career), and often the engineers seemed to have not known what to do with 2 channels. There's a lot of hard panning on the early albums, and even later recordings have various quirks. Still, overall the sound quality is superb, and certain albums in particular benefit from this latest remastering (\\"Revolver\\" now leaps out of the speakers, while \\"Pepper's\\" colorful psychedelic swirls glisten with a new sheen). It appears that some limiting or compression was used, since the recordings overall are \\"louder\\" than the previous CD versions. (With the mono box, these techniques were not employed, so in that sense the mono versions sound more of their time).<br /><br />One could argue that a true modern remix of the entire catalog should be undertaken to correct some of the stereo idiosyncrasies, but that's probably about as likely as a Paul/Yoko duets album. It's actually a miracle in itself that this box set was released, considering the labyrinth of legal proceedings that accompany any new Beatles product.<br /><br />In sum, it's nice to finally have the Beatles sounding this good, just a shame they waited until the CD's death spiral to get around to it.

I don't mind a film that gets stranger and stranger as you watch it. Hell, that's a good reason why I watch the TV show Lost lol. But the Box is a film that gets stranger and stranger without giving many answers. For a film that makes you interested in where it's going, it doesn't go anywhere too satisfying.

B00004TS0E|1.0|I believe this is the worst remake ever made! It doesn't deserve the name! The original movie was about a little girl who didn't know any fairy tales. She didn't mind because she didn't know any better.In the new movie she seems like an abused child! That is only one of the things wrong with the feel and look of this horrible thing.  The cuteness of the original is completely lost in this movie. I really really hated it. All the fun and sweetness of the original is completely missing in this one. What a shame this movie was ever made. I feel sorry for people that see this movie first (or at all) before seeing the orginal!I gave it one star because I didn't have the option to give it multiple negative stars!
B002VECM6S|5.0|I have taken a few moments to read other reviews here and I am not really sure why Sandra Bullock generates so much critical review.  Sure, she has had some roles that I did not think were that great but I really think the lady has a way of handling herself that just says - \\"I know who and what I am - take it or leave it!\\"  - and this movie fits her like a glove - and I don't mean the OJ one either.<br /><br />I could go on and on about the acting, the story, the fact that there is a lot of truth in the movie for everyone to see, and lets not forget Kathy Bates, her role may have been small but it sure came across to me.  However, what you need to do is use your own mind and a little common sense and say - hey - here is a true story with (as they say in Europe) \\"An American HAPPY END\\" go see it for yourself, if you don't you of course will never know what you missed, but in my opinion it is a BAD decison not to see this on the big screen - Bullock just made me howel when she told the coack - \\"I told you that you could thank me later, Well it is later!\\"  Do it for yourself and your family - and as for the guy from NY that gave this one star - geeze louise - Lighten UP, of course it is predictable - it is a true story and just about everyone already knows the ending - I mean would you hit Cameron's Titanic because duuuhhhh the \\"Boat Sunk?\\"

I can honestly say these two books have changed the way I view our world, people at large, people's motives, their actions & reactions, my own motives, my actions & reactions, & so on.     But, funny thing, you almost have to be \\"ready\\" to accept change in your life in order to fully appreciate the contents of these books.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|Shutter Island is a film directed by Martin Scorsese and is based on the Dennis Lehane novel of [[ASIN:0061703257 the same name]], a book I have not read which is something to clearly keep in mind.  It is a period film that takes place in the mid-1950s and follows two US Marshalls played by Mark Ruffalo and Leonardo DiCaprio, as they make their way to an island off the coast of Massachusetts that houses and attempts to rehabilitate the very worst criminally insane patients.  Scorcese uses both intense personal drama and the story's winding and mysterious premise to create a remarkable and intriguing suspense that feels like a hybrid of Hitchcock and some of Stanley Kubrick's later films.  It is a movie that will go over the heads of most of its audience during the first viewing, but to its core it is a psychological thriller that not only displays madness in a palpable frame but does so with astounding cinematic flair, and goes even further in making a commentary on the great flaws of violent men.<br /><br />Funny how some of the most savvy film critics have derided Shutter Island for lacking some of the elements I've already praised, but I can't help thinking they were preparing their judgments well in advance simply because of the film's delayed and altogether unconventional release date for an esteemed veteran filmmaker like Scorsese, who like anyone else at or near his level should release their films in the fall, just so everyone knows what movies to give awards to.  This actually might be one of my favorite Scorcese films, not only because it is one of his few movies that deviates from being simple gangster glorification, but because it is not a genre film at all.  I had a hard time pigeon-holing this movie as a horror film or just a general suspenseful drama when its means are far greater than just giving us a puzzle or scaring the hell out of us.  Either way it blows The Departed out of the water in my humble view, but then again my favorite Scorcese movies are [[ASIN:B00003CX8S The Age of Innocence]] and [[ASIN:1559409037 The Last Temptation of Christ]], so take that for what it is.  We all have our opinions I suppose.<br /><br />Scorcese is a great director but not necessarily because he makes great stories and creates cutting edge films.  It is because at times he takes already great stories and makes them into shiny and exciting films, and also because he possesses his actors so well that they almost always get the credit that he might often deserve.  For years it was Robert De Niro, who outside of the [[ASIN:B0007Y08MY The Godfather part II]] has only been truly great under Scorcese.  The same can be said for the way that Scorcese has contained the frenzied method acting of Daniel Day Lewis.  But now, and perhaps in the future surpassing both aforementioned actors, is Leonardo DiCaprio, who in my view might deliver his most touching and satisfying performance to date.  This is a guy who simply should not care whether or not the Oscars of 2010 remember his movie, because it is just another highlight in what might possibly turn out to be the greatest Hollywood career of his generation.  Neither should the rest of the cast that includes great work from Max Von Sydow, Ruffalo, Emily Mortimer, Michelle Williams, Ben Kingsley, Jackie Earle Haley, and Ted Levine.<br /><br />Shutter Island also captures New England in a way that few films have and growing up there myself certainly helps my appreciation of that.  Its cinematography is what we've come to expect from Scorcese's films but that doesn't mean it shouldn't go without specific praise.  The movie is visual perfection in addition to being a challenging, perplexing, and powerful motion picture. Despite a curious release date, and one that keeps it from competing in a 2009 Oscar awards ceremony that it would likely do quite well in, this is a layered commentary and an impeccably well-made production, and I must give it my highest recommendation.IN:B00003CX8S The Age of Innocence]] and [[ASIN:1559409037 The Last Temptation of Christ]], so take that for what it is.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Movie Review:<br />If you've seen anything from Tarantino before then you know his style.  I happen to be a fan of his work and therefore found this movie to be very entertaining.  If you're looking for a historically accurate movie then you may want to look elsewhere.  This movie is to entertain and entertain only.  With that said Tarantino once again creates a story full of witty dialog and enough action to satisfy.  Get ready for some butt kicking fun.<br /><br />Blu-Ray Review:<br />The Blu-ray edition of Inglourious Basterds is one you shouldn't miss.  The 1080P/AVC encoded video presentation is beautiful and the DTS-MA 5.1 audio is just as impressive.  It isn't packed with special features but has enough to entertain you for a while.  Combine all of that with the great Amazon.com price I think this movie is a must have in any Blu-ray library.
B0020EK4QY|3.0|Pssst.  Quiet.  The whispering President (Harrison Ford) has spoken.  Upon boarding Air Force One, with the hope of catching a few precious hours to himself and his T.V., the whispering President comes under attack in an attempted hijacking by Russian strong men (led by superb actor Gary Oldman).  The plot thickens as Air Force One is taken by force and makes a remarkable series of 20 wheel drifts through Rammstein Air Base Slalom Course in West Germany.  Shortly thereafter, the George Washington hair-doed Vice President (Glenn Close- I always get her mixed up with Merryl Streep!) tries to negotiate with the hijackers, but to no avail.  Since no other man will step up to the job (bloody wimps), the rubbery-faced President has to defeat the hijackers on his own.    Despite constantly looking dazed and confused, especially after kissing his robust secretary in exchange for sending a FAX, the whispering President manages to usurp the hijackers and kill their esteemed leader.  I was saddened to see the former German U-boat commander, now a General by the name of Radek, die only footsteps from freedom from a Russian prison.  William H. Macy offers to upgrade the exterior of Air Force One with a nice Tru-Coat, but Wade doesn't think it's a good deal.  But hey, it's a good action flick and is worth a watch.  Over and out.

B000JMKNV0|5.0|Since previews for this movie are tantalizing and intriguing, I wanted to read this book.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but OH MY GOSH!  Shutter Island took me on a trip I haven't been on in quite a while.  The protagonist, Teddy, is gritty but likeable; Chuck is a charmer; and the inmates on Shutter Island (including the staff!) are definitely worth \\"meeting.\\"  I started reading in the evening--big mistake!  I had to finish; I could not wait until the next day.  And so, Dennis Lehane made me a bit tired at work today, but I am grateful.  This story is a Kindle-Klicker (page turner).  (Yes, there are some flaws, but they do not ruin the tale.) BUY THIS BOOK!  Read with exhiliration.  But don't start reading it if you have something else you should be doing or before bedtime.  If you enjoy classic King, Criminal Minds (tv), classic Koontz, or just plain having your toes curled up, you'll love this story.

B0037DBM86|5.0|Admittedly this is my first full album I've heard from Karnivool, my only experience previously with them is a few songs off of Themata which I found to be decent but nothing garnering the purchase of the album.  That being said, this album is the perfect cohesion of so many sounds and styles from many of my favorite bands (Porcupine Tree, Riverside, darker Katatonia influences can be heard, just to name a few).     From start to finish its very easily accessible yet lyrically deep and musically quite complex.  Normally an album will take me several listens through to really strike me but with this I was instantly hooked and coming back for more. You simply need to hear this album if you are into any form of rock or looking to expand into more complex and deep music.  I cannot wait to see what these guys come up with next.    I recommend checking out the music video for \\"All I Know\\", its so beautiful and goes so well with the song it shouldn't be missed.

B0030Y11XS|2.0|Once again we go on a familiar journey as Roger Moore finds outrageous situations to provoke thought. A lot of the stuff is biased and one sided. For instance, we see a foreclosed family getting evicted but there has to be more to the story. What did they do with the money they got from the bank using their home as collateral? He seems to pick out the worst of society and then blames it on the government. For instance, the closed factories of Flint Michigan are shown. Who told GM to build Hummers and gargantuan beasts of steel that fall apart and nobody wants to buy? He should visit a Toyota factory in Tennessee or a Honda factory in Ohio where they are building quality cars that people actually want to buy and have no regrets about. This DVD is entirely one sided but it has a lot of Roger Moore humor to get a point across. It's obvious he hates George Bush and Ronald Reagan but doesn't mention that it was Bill Clinton who deregulated the banks so they can essentially do Casino gambling with our money. I'm no fan of big business or the banks but both sides of the story needs to be portrayed for fairness. In Roger Moore's world he makes up our mind for us and then spends the whole film justifying his position. This is not a great documentary but it is funny and entertaining.
B001QU0756|5.0|Reviewers born after the 1960's will probably not appreciate the expansiveness of such albums as Tales from Topographic Oceans and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway (from Genesis). It was a period in pop music that spawned from early Jazz Fusion where musicianship and nonformulaic composition were briefly exalted.     Something the Grunge movement wished it could have been more like. So many brilliant albums bubbled to the surface and peaked in radical creativity before Rock music lost its soul and went back to work in corporate cubicles.    Sorry if the ten-twenty minute long tracks test your attention span or don't fit into commercial radio format.    We were trying for good back then. Not popular.

0764207407|5.0|Having never even glanced at a Jane Austen novel, I was afraid that reading this book would not be fun. Yet I found myself caught up in the story of two sisters, one levelheaded(sometimes hiding her emotions) and the other very dramatic. This is a tale of sisters who struggle to learn what love is truly about and of their unending loyalty to each other.<br /><br />What made the book interesting to me were the notes added by the editors. They included Historical and cultural details, information on Jane Austen's life, references to Sense & Sensibility in films, an unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters and themes of faith drawn from the novel and Jane Austen's life. I actually caught myself laughing out loud as I read some of the side notes. The comments helped lighten the tone of the book and made it painless and even fun to read. If I were homeschooling my daughter, I would definately use The Insight Edition! If you are a die-hard Jane Austen fan or a novice like me, this edition will show you why Sense and Sensibility is considered a classic.<br /><br />*Bethany House supplied this book free of charge as part of their book review program. All opinions expressed are my own.

B00003CXPD|5.0|There's not much new about the theme of Billy Elliott, that of the strength of love and of being true to oneself. But this is a fresh new take, with its focus upon an eleven year old boy from a gritty mining town who wants to become a ballet dancer. Jamie Bell is winning as the novice dancer, and Gary Lewis as his coal miner dad does well with the struggle to come to terms with his wish for a better life for his son and his puzzlement about his choice of profession, which he views as rather \\"poofy\\", of course. First rate acting, the gritty background of the mining town, the taut dialog, and the T-Rex soundtrack all work to make this movie a winner. IMO, suitable for family viewing and highly recommended as such.

B002Y5FKUE|5.0|This was my first Bel Canto opera at a cinema and I pleasantly surprised that I was transported into Bellini's magical realm of pathos in such an environment. Yet, the sheer commitment to the musical integrity of Bellini's masterpiece by the conductor and singers was able to deliver the essence that lives in these melodic lines. I would have preferred a more lush production of this opera, for it would have been more aesthetically pleasant, yet this did not matter so much in the end. I admire Miss Dessay's performance and ease of projecting a believable, endearing Amina, Bravo! It is rare to find a singer who will persevere in making this performance one that we can show to future generations and say: this is what Bel Canto is meant to be. Mr Florez does justice to his character as well...How lucky we are that this unique performance was capture on video! If you love opera, this is one video you must see or own!
0061091480|5.0|Your Erroneous Zones is and excellent book to read as a first step towards self improvement. I always keep a copy or two to share with friends seeking to make changes in their life. It is a great guide for understanding why people do what they do. This book helps us understand why people do what they do even when it seems so counter productive to their own good. I really like the lists. Dyer is quite to the point. I have also read several of his other books, but this remains my favorite.    Knowing the why of things makes it easier - for me at least - to make appropriate changes in my own behavior as well as improving my understanding of others. When I realized I had again given away my personal copy, I had to buy another. I like to refer to it every now and then, to figure out changes in myself or others. Circumstances and my own decissions have brought many cahnges into my life inthe past decade. Now that things have finally reached a balance, precarious perhaps, butt a balance none the less,, I think it time for a refresher read for myself.  Sometimes we are so busy making decisions we do not always see the big picture. It's time for me to look again.

B0029LHW68|2.0|30 Seconds to Mars debuted with an amazing album.<br /> Then it all went downhill.<br /> A Beautiful Lie got old quickly and its songs were not very discernable from anything else on the radio at the time. It really wasn't a bad album. It had some great moments, but lacked some of the soul of the first album.<br /> Then 30 Second to Mars sold what was left of it.<br /> When This is War begins, the listener is immediately left thinking, \\"I'm in for something epic.\\" And the listener is- an epic disappointment. After the third track it all begins to sound the same. Big hooks. Children singing. Corny lyrics.<br /> The last component is the one that made the rest of this album nearly unlistenable.<br /> Jared Leto isn't exactly the greatest lyricist, but his lyrics used to at least make me think just a little. The messages in the lyrics on This is War feel forced. They feel like fake emotions.<br /> I was ready to burn this CD (not as a copy, but literally burn), until I heard Stranger in a Strangeland. This song is completely different from the others, and should be the only song on the CD. Unfortunately, 30 Seconds to Mars manages to even ruin this song. The song progresses, but then it just stops. It doesn't stop abruptly and dramatically; it just stops like it just didn't know where to go. I'm left feeling like I did at the end of watching Unbreakable. Everything about it is perfect, and then all of a sudden M. Night Shayamalan says, \\"Alright, how can we wrap this up in seven seconds? No, I don't want to end it. I just want to throw every element of closure away and piss everyone off.\\"<br /> If you can get past the odd ending of Stranger in a Strangeland, download it. Download this song ONLY. You really don't need to buy this album. You don't need any more pretentious music, and you don't need some stranger's face looking at you everytime you pull it out.
B002GZQY6Q|5.0|\\"The Incident\\" by Porcupine Tree is one of the best albums I have the pleasure of owning.  I had heard mentionings of this band going back about a year and finally made the purchase on a whim.  After two back to back listenings I was transfixed, and after nearly a week the album continues to replay in my brain.  Like great films, this album is sticking with me and I am unable to shake it.  I'd say \\"The Incident\\" has the sound of Pink Floyd's \\"Animals\\" mixed with King Crimson's \\"Red\\", while maintaining a power and unpredictability all it's own that makes listening pure sonic bliss.  I can't wait to explore more albums by this outstanding outfit.    HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

B000MCIBE8|5.0|The name of this group comes from one of at least two sources, both of which Jim Morrison referenced during his lifetime.  One source is Aldous Huxley, who in the course of his investigations of human consciousness referred to \\"the doors of perception\\".  The other source is William Blake, the English poet, engraver and seer, who once said \\"There are things that are known and things that are unknown, and in between there are doors.\\"  You could make a case for either of these phrases as the real expression of this band's heart, but which one is the true one?  Morrison and the rest of them left that ambiguous.  Figures.<br /><br />It's next to impossible now to see the Doors clearly through the haze of myth that's built up around them (whether they wanted it that way or not), but there's no doubt that as a group they were more interested in questions than answers.  Their first album provided no certainty or consistent categorization whatsoever.  They covered classic blues and pre-World War II German theatrical songs, their originals mixed romance and self-destruction for maybe the first time in pop music, and of course the last number of this record combines music and poetry in a way that the Beats never imagined no matter how much speed they took.  No way to get a grip on them.  If it weren't for the fact that Morrison made a pretty good sex symbol, the audience would have hated this bunch.<br /><br />Or maybe not, come to think of it.  The Doors always played hard and melodic, and they had a very distinctive sound no matter what tune they had in hand.  This is partly because, as many others have noted, they did not employ a bass guitarist, a strategy that leaves in the musical bed a definite, often spooky hollowness that works well with their lyrical themes.  So quite apart from Morrison's showmanship, the Doors produced the kind of excitement that only the best rock music ever gets to.<br /><br />And then there are those lyrical themes.  Rock had moved away from love-song restrictions long before the Doors came along, of course, but it took this band to show everyone just how far away you could get.  It's there right from the first minutes - there's a percussion sound that combines jazz and flamenco, then in comes a groaning single-note organ line and a roaring rhythm guitar that pushes the listener's attention much faster than almost anything that had come before, and then Morrison bellows \\"You know the day destroys the night / Night divides the day\\".  If rock music can contend with metaphysics in this manner, and make you like it, nothing is off limits.<br /><br />But all of this has been pretty much settled in the 40-plus years since \\"The Doors\\" hit the record stores - you still hear \\"Light My Fire\\" on classic rock radio, after all.  I, for one, wanted to look at this record again because some critics have taken to denouncing the Doors and Jim Morrison as self-indulgent, crass, and just plain bad.  Dave Marsh once called this band the most overrated in history and declared that anyone who didn't think so must suffer from \\"a truly terminal case of arrested adolescence\\".  Wow.  Did these guys put one over on the lot of us?<br /><br />Things did get a little silly in the Doors camp from time to time, no question about it.  What can you say about some of the images in the lyrics to \\"The End\\"?  What exactly did Jim Morrison mean when he groaned \\"Weird scenes inside the gold mine\\" and stuff like that?  The phrase must have had some significance - it was used as the title of a greatest hits collection a few years later - but it's got nothing to do with anything surrounding it, comes from nowhere, doesn't develop and never comes up again.  There are plenty of such images on this album and in subsequent work by this band, I suppose because Morrison considered himself a poet and got into rock to combine poetry with music, like Patti Smith did a few years later with a little more success.  Which only goes to prove what has been pointed out for centuries - it takes more to be a poet than simply thinking that's what you are.<br /><br />At the same time - and this, I think, is where Dave Marsh and some others miss the boat - there's more to album-oriented rock than the lyrics, or even the music.  Roger Ebert famously said that a movie is never about what it's about, but rather about _how_ it's about what it's about, and the same thing can be said for the Doors.  The album isn't just about the music and lyrics, which in other hands might very well have fallen apart into parody or worse - it's about what this band does with the music and lyrics.<br /><br />To be specific, on this album the Doors came up with some songs, both originals and covers, occasionally indulging in some over-the-top lyrics and musical ideas, but developed a style of play that convinced.  It sounds dark and mysterious with frequent bursts of passion, the musical equivalent of a long, dangerous, but intriguing journey.  Jim Morrison was the most visible of the Doors by several orders of magnitude, and he had one of the most distinctive voices in rock, but without the other three he himself admitted that he turned into a sort of clown.  You might look at the cover of this album and assume it's a picture of the other three band members being consumed by Morrison's large presence - then again, you might see it as the three of them giving rise to him.<br /><br />In short, it's the performances that make this album so good, which may explain why so few other musicians cover this material - even the Doors themselves seldom reached this level of quality in later years.  Then again, most people don't get there even once.<br /><br />Benshlomo says, It's the singer, not the song.e a poet than simply thinking that's what you are.

Since that model was discontinued, Teva sent me these (I paid the price different).  This shoe fit very nicely, but not as great as the one it replaced.  This model is more ridge and is for hiking, the other one was like a jogging hiker shoe.  The Vibram sole is a lot harder then the most hiking shoe rubber.  Since this model is a low top, it is not as rigid as the high top version, but it is stiff enough.  eVent is Teva answer to Goretex.  It keeps the water out, while letting your feet breath.  My other Teva's event got wet a lot and you couldn't tell the different, this model has a nicer leather, so I might not get it was wet.<br /><br />Too bad the other Aniso is discontinued; I like that one better for my needs, but his a nice replacement.  Teva's customer services is top notch, I knew where my shoe was when I returned it and they quickly sent me an email and tracking number.

0446567337|5.0|I read this book in about 2 days, I could not put it down.  Although it is a typical love story I found the characters intriguing and likeable.  I am embarrassed to admit it but I cried in the middle and I cried in the end.  I don't know if I will feel the same way when I watch the movie.  I think the ending of this book is sad but it shows that life doesn't always end with happy endings and that love alone sometimes isn't enough, other circumstances and LIFE gets in the way.  I really feel for John's character in this book, in the way he feels for his father and Savannah.  Great book but totally cheesy/romantic and I loved it, much like I loved \\"The Notebook\\".
B002XTBE6K|2.0|Why read this review if you're already determined to disagree with me?      I, too, am an avid fan of Austen--of her novels and, if they are done really well, their film adaptations. I have seen the previous ITV Emma with Kate Beckinsale (1996), the feature film with Gwyneth Paltrow (also 1996), and this most recent version; and I have to disagree with those who say that this is the best of the three. It is, however, marginally better than the Paltrow.    This adaptation gives us pretty much the entire novel, which is the only reason I give it two stars; but it is not nearly as respectful of Austen's language as the admirably faithful Andrew Davies script of 1996 (ITV). Here, it has been \\"modernized\\", sometimes even \\"dumbed down\\"--as if today's viewers were not able to comprehend the language of Austen's day. So much of her genius lies in her unique use of language and her choice of words. Even if additional dialogue, other than what is found in the novel, must be created, the screenwriter should try to remain true to Austen's manner of speech. Davies used much of the original dialogue for the 1996 script, but what dialogue he did create is virtually indistinguishable from Austen. Emma Thompson's excellent dialogue for Sense and Sensibility was almost entirely of Thompson's own creation, as there is much less dialogue in that novel than in Austen's other works; but Thompson successfully simulated Austen's voice and the vernacular of that era.    As to the characterizations...as fine an actress as Garai is, nowhere do we find the poised, graceful, self-possessed mistress of the house that Austen created; instead, this Emma is a giggly, awkward schoolgirl, just shy of being downright cartoonish. Yes, Emma is  young; yes, she is deluded; yes, she is a conceited know-it-all; but she is never silly. Because she became mistress of the house at a very young age, she is extremely mature for her 21 years, which is why she thinks she knows it all. Her ultimate conversion (thanks to Mr. Knightly) is all the more striking because of her almost tragic self-possession. Also, Garai's posture and walk are more suited to Harriet Smith or farmer Martin's sister than to the elegant and well-bred Miss Woodhouse.     Another off-the-mark characterization is that of Mrs. Elton. She is one of Austen's greatest comic creations, but there was nothing comic about this particular portrayal; she is played as vicious rather than ridiculously self-important. (The 1996 ITV Mrs. Elton is, in my opinion, spot on.) And much as I admire Michael Gambon, I do think he was miscast as the endearingly alarmist Mr. Woodhouse.    There has lately been a trend for trying to make Austen \\"fresh\\", \\"modern\\", \\"accessible for today's audiences\\". In the effort to do so, it often happens that Austen's distinctive voice is lost. She is ALREADY timeless just as she is. Let her speak for herself. Or use screenwriters with a true ear and respect for period language--such as Andrew Davies. If Austen must be adapted to modern times, then do it all the way, as with the very clever \\"Clueless\\", or the somewhat less clever \\"Bride and Prejudice\\".     The 1996 Davies version with Kate Beckinsale still gets my vote as the best adaptation of this novel, for both script and character portrayal.

B000IFS0HM|5.0|This is a must read!  I just reread this book all in one sitting. It is such a wonderful, however tragic story.  Despite the hardships throughout the book with alcoholism, poverty and premature death there were clever and hopefully moments as well leaving me with a \\"Hurrah\\" for Frankie!  With Frankie's tribulations of an alcoholic father spending all his wages at the pub, too little or nothing to eat, loss of family and enduring Catholic School he seemed to remain unaffected by it all. An innocence of sorts. Frank McCourt's Memoir is a treasure to read and one which left me laughing, cheering and crying all at the same time.  I highly recommend it!

B000OT8GCQ|2.0|I was so disappointed with this book. It felt rushed and shallow from John's perspective. I didn't get the depth of feeling that normally accompany a plot like this. Instead it felt like a chronology of events from when they meet until the end. And although I enjoyed the premise and found the ending sad I felt it an appropriate ending. It was about the only thing I truly felt was done right. I doubt I will go see the movie now, since I only read the book because the movie looked good.

0385528752|5.0|Switch goes down many paths and paints many pictures of Change.  We're not talking about change for the sake of change.  We're talking about change for the sake of good (improving health, increasing business, serving others, teaching, increasing efficiency, saving lives, etc).  The book lays out several examples of instigating and executing change successfully where change is needed but may appear difficult.  I noticed most of the examples used in the book were real-life stories where an underdog character or group made something happen that caused a positive event to occur.  These methods were simple, effective and were deployed by people who set out to solve a problem and/or make an improvement. Simplicity seems counter-intuitive but the authors provide some great narrative and examples to point out that big change does not need big planning or extensive research.  Being creative and recognizing what actually motivates people to abandon old behavior patterns and buy into something different that will improve the situation or environment is the thread that runs through the tapestry created in \\"Switch\\".  Focusing on bright spots, keeping well away from too many options that cause Decision Paralysis and other insights add a deeper psychological nuance to the book that I enjoyed and overlooked in my own attempts to make change happen.        The Elephant and Rider analogy is used as the relational theme of struggle, cooperation and perseverance throughout the book (Our rational and emotional minds). I could relate to the stories used to illustrate what makes up change and how to make it happen when you may feel like you are up against an impenetrable wall of opposition.  It's the Elephant's directed strength and endurance that will transform that wall into a door.  But, its the Rider who must direct the initial process and map the \\"critical moves\\" to reach the goal.  Both must work in concert to achieve results.  Apart, they are ineffective.    I found \\"Switch\\" to befascinating.  Although, there were a couple stories that seemed to drag a bit.  I learned applicable lessons.  From the psychology of initializing change to the after effects of change.  The end user experience, the lives transformed, the innovation, the improvement made by an individual human with one idea, one vision that made the world different in a good way.  Casting a vision that stirs emotions and conjures up \\"feelings\\" seem to be the best way the Rider can direct the Elephant's behavior.  Often the change I wanted dies a death of a thousand cuts by way of over-analysis, too much research and no gas left in the self-control tank.     Update:   More than a week after finishing the book, I find myself referring back to it quite a bit.  Change takes time but once you recognized how to get the ball rolling and motivate the elephants, momentum builds and you are being pulled rather than pushing.  I encourage folks to read it.  If nothing else, you will come away entertained and with a few insights.  More than likely, the rider in you will be motivated to direct your elephant into a new direction.     Thanks again to Dan Tardy for sending me this great book.    Lance Cashion  [...]
B00006LI4S|5.0|Many of the reviewers have already gone deeply into individual song reviews and what they liked, what they didn't like and the nonce.  Allow me to say that this is one of the finest live solo albums ever.  David Gilmour takes a collection of songs from Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd, himself and a few others he just wanted to perform and blends them into a great DVD.<br /><br />The players and singers he surrounds himself with are first rate and the performance showcases everyone.  What is predominately showcased is the music itself.  Comfortably Numb is one of my all-time favorite songs (or in that stratosphere of musical numbers that I consider all-time greats) and the version, actually two versions, on this DVD leave no doubt to the greatness of the song.  The arrangement of it is wonderful and includes subtleties not generally heard in rock music, and yet, it kicks butt.<br /><br />David Gilmour is one of the masters of guitar tone whether playing acoustic or electric guitar and this DVD is no exception to the rule of great tone.  His relationship with the guitar is one of pure magic and, as such, brings out the magic in the performances of others.<br /><br />The additional bits are also quite excellent.  I particularly enjoyed the \\"Digits\\" as one for those of us that play the guitar.  Not many guitarists would release close up DVD images of them playing.  The \\"Home Movie\\" is also wonderful as it shows us a rehearsal of a work in process.  How good can it get?
B0015HOFZI|5.0|I purchased the Sony PS-LX300USB turntable primarily for playing our old vinyl records through an existing sound system.  The built-in preamp and USB-recording capability were features I wanted, and I've always liked the Sony brand.    After using the turntable for several weeks, I am quite pleased with it.  It works well, was easy to set up (at least as a basic record player), and the controls are simple to use.  The output cable is a little short, but otherwise it would be hard to find anything to dislike about the hardware.    The included software, Sound Forge Audio Studio 9, gave me a bit of trouble, however.  Others have commented about their difficulty in getting sound to play through the computer speakers while recording.  This happened to me, too, and it took some time to discover the solution.    First I went into my Windows XP Control Panel, clicked \\"Sounds and Audio Devices\\", then clicked \\"Audio\\", then    1- set the default playback device to my regular internal sound, and    2- set the default recording device to \\"USB Audio Codec.\\"  However, I still could not hear any sound while recording.  Audio Studio's level meters showed a strong signal coming from the turntable, but there was no sound.  Selecting \\"Monitor Recording Level\\" didn't help either.    After much frustration, I found a setting in the Audio Studio program that fixed the problem.  Here's what worked for me:    With the turntable connected to the computer via its USB cable,     1- Open Audio Studio and, on the menu bar at the top, click Options, Preferences.     2- Click the \\"Audio\\" tab.     3- Set \\"Audio device type\\" to \\"Windows Classic Wave Driver\\"     4- While there, ensure that the \\"default playback device\\" is the computer's regular sound device and the \\"default recording device\\" is \\"USB Audio Codec.\\"     5- Click OK.    Step 3 above was the key that got me working.  Perhaps this will help others that are still having sound problems.    A few other comments:     Audio Studio does a greatjob of removing pops and surface noise from the vinyl recording.  It's amazing how well it cleans up the recorded sound.  The program sometimes has difficulty detecting tracks, but one can do that manually when needed.  It would be nice if Sony's specs mentioned what stylus is used, as eventually it will need to be replaced.

B001PPLJIQ|2.0|this movie came out around the same time as revolutionary road. i compare the two as i saw both in theater closely together it felt. i found the reader to be far less surperior to revolutionary road. kate winslet is a very fantastic actress, but this movie was a poor choice for her in my opinion. she did a great job in the movie, and without her i doubt much would have been made of this movie. the writing has been seen by some as genius... well i think those people have watched and re-watched some lifetime television for women movies far too often. this movie is straight out of a teenage boys dreams, and the \\"love story\\" going on here involves a young boy who knows very little if anything about love and is feeling emotional attachment to a woman who gives him sex. there is a feeling of acceptance and perhaps adulthood that comes with that, but love? i doubt it. with kate's character, its weird to watch. it's not exactly sexy, or sweet, or romantic. i dont know what it is it's just weird. usually when there is a love story the audience pulls for something to bring them back together after losing each other. not so much here though.. i had fairly low expectations going into this movie and i was still let down. the reader? nah more like the pedophile........
B00005N6KG|5.0|This is an \\"open in-ear\\" pair of headphones, the driver does enter the ear canal but it doesn't block it. With this you can hear sounds around you while enjoying a superior listening experience. It is great for sports.    The headphones fit very easily on the head, their lightweight design means they are comfortable to wear.    The plug is both angled and with thin end, so it will not wear out too fast and it does fit in my iPhone 1G without adaptor.    To top it up, the price is a bargain.    And if that was not enough the sound quality is very satisfying!  Do not expect deep bass but the sound reproduction is excellent and well balanced.    Highly recommended.
B002BWP4A6|3.0|sigh, like most things i write about on here i dont expect most of you to relate with me here. maybe i just dont have a taste for true foreign film, but i did not enjoy this movie and it had nothing to do with the fact that it was not fast paced, or that it was in black and white. i actually really enjoyed the look that the black and white film brought. it promised a lot to me i think that never felt satisfied. i did not find the mystery of the town too curious or mind boggling and the things i did see that were obvious to understand i did not feel better off knowing about it. i did not enjoy the character of the doctor who had some very disturbing demons haunting him it seemed. all i can do is share what i was able to take away from the film. the cinematography was vibrant and alive. the town was eerie but more in a sad neglected way, not really in a mysterious caper sort of way. i did not feel attached to any character as i kept having a feeling that somewhere along the story a disturbing trait of some kind was going to reveal itself about each of them. i dont need happy endings, or feel good characters, but this film leaves something to be desired. i appreciate the artistic vision, as i did in amelie (wasnt a fan of amelie either..) but the movie did feel pointless to me. if anyone knows a movie about german people that is not about war or crazy towns people id like to know.
B001BPJJ1E|2.0|This is easily a five-star movie, one of the best \\"school days movies\\" ever made, and the audio quality is quite good, but the quality of the video is poor with scrapes on the film not repaired and carried over onto the supposedly \\"digitally remastered\\" DVD. It would also have been nice, considering the price of this item, if the disc had included subtitling for those who are hard of hearing, but the biggest problem with this product is the poor quality of the video. For a movie from the early Seventies, better prints should be available.
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|The blu-ray process has really done justice to this somewhat ancient but beloved sci-fi series and it really holds its own despite being over 40 years old.  The detail of the sets is amazing that even to this day don't look tacky or phoney (beyond what is acceptable and lovable for fans) and it is surprising that it really doesn't look its age.  I prefered the version with enchanced effects, as having seen the original series many times in its old format, the new is a breath of fresh air and the Enterprise is very plausible as a spaceship in the viewing of its adventures in our 21st century.  This series is well worth having for any fans of the original series, as its a dream come true, with our favourite characters looking wonderfully fresh and youthful (some of whom are now passed away) and full of energy. The extra 'documentaries' are also facinating. It was a series way ahead of its time and the enchanced blu-ray brings it very much to the present day for current generations to enjoy as much as we did back in the 60's when we were kids. I now have all 3 series and my kids love them!
1608201236|5.0|***spoilers for previous books in this series***<br /><br />The fifth and final book of the Adrien English Mystery Series *SOB*. It is always hard when a series ends for me, especially one so beloved as this one. It was exciting to read the final book to see where Adrien and Jake end up, and to reflect on their journey in the series and Josh Lanyon gave them a goodbye that they much deserved.<br /><br />I picked up Fatal Shadows, the first book in this series, on a whim one day. It is only 150 pages and I read it all in one sitting. I still remember reading it and thinking, who is this Josh Lanyon person and how did he write this amazing Adrien English character? I have really only had that feeling twice - the other time with Moon Called by Patricia Briggs.<br /><br />At the very end of Fatal Shadows, after the murder investigation is over, Jake turns to Adrien and says:<br /><br />\\"You know, this won't be an easy thing, Adrien.\\"<br /><br />\\"The investigation, you mean?\\"<br /><br />Jake says - \\"No. No, I don't mean that.\\"<br /><br />And was Jake so right. If any two people have worked hard to be together, it has been Jake and Adrien. Prime example, Jake gets married - to a female, during this series. It was worth it though - the heart ache, the waiting between books - Adrien is one of my all time favorite characters, and Jake - he more than makes up for his past behavior in The Dark Tide.<br /><br />Adrien's life is going through many changes. He is recovering from heart surgery, correcting a faulty valve that has plagued him most of his adult life. He is also recovering from being shot, refer to drama in book four. His on/off again lover, Jake Riordan has divorced his wife, retired from the police force and has come out to his family (Jake was very deep in the closet). Adrien has been through a lot with Jake - A LOT. He is tired and truly scared that if he puts himself into Jake's arms again, he will be hurt....again.<br /><br />Professionally, Adrien is remodeling his bookstore, The Cloak and Dagger to encompass a much bigger space. This would not be a proper Adrien English Mystery book without a dead body, and this time we discover a very dead body, dead for fifty years hidden under the floorboards, found during the renovations. Adrien has been through the wringer with dead bodies, so when questions arise to the skeleton's history and break-ins start occurring at the The Cloak and Dagger, Adrien's suspicions go on high alert. Adrien is not up to his normal sleuthing skills since recovering from heart surgery has him exhausted. Now that Jake is not on the police force he has started his own private investigation firm. Adrien hires him to track down clues and it gives Adrien an excuse to stay in contact with Jake.<br /><br />First and foremost, The Dark Tide is the perfect ending to this series. The mystery in this one is great because after the drama in the fourth book, and with Adrien so weak after his surgery, he really couldn't be running from murdering bad guys again. Finding a fifty year old skeleton in his shop, with the mystery surrounding it, is a perfect way for him to still sleuth while recovering from surgery.<br /><br />Let's face it though - what I really wanted to see was the path Jake and Adrien would take in this book. While I loved to hate Jake in previous books, I loved Jake in this book. He is out now - to everyone. I was worried how he would be able to handle it - oh, and Adrien was worried about it too :) Jake was completely understanding in all aspects of Adrien's life. He was there to make sure Adrien took care of himself after the surgery, he was there to make sure Adrien didn't get any ideas about running after leads in the investigation, and he was there to give Adrien breathing room to decide how he wanted to proceed in their relationship. We see a tender, sweet side of Jake - who knew he was so romantic? Jake's admission of love is one of my favorite lines - I'm not going to quote it here becauseit is more fun to read it when you are swept up in the book, but it is such a Jake thing to say.<br /><br />The Dark Tide wraps up the series, and although I am sad that it is done, I feel very satisfied in the events that take place and I have many rereads of the series to come.e wraps up the series, and although I am sad that it is done, I feel very satisfied in the events that take place and I have many rereads of the series to come.
B0013ND30W|5.0|This blu-ray version is absolutely captivating, both for my kids and for me.  I saw it years ago and its a wonderfully good yarn for the kids, and a classic. The detail and color is stunning and well worth the extra cost for the blu-ray.  Like all my Disney collection, my kids will enjoy these cartoons, both classic and current, for years to come, as the classics are no longer old as the quality is now equal to the latest releases.  I can now watch cartoons with my kids, which I watched from aged 4, and the kids don't even know these are old, and they get the chance to enjoy the same magic I felt all those years ago.

B000EULJLU|3.0|Uh...wel...it just seems as though the boys in Tool have run out of ideas, or at least any good ones. I never thought I'd be saying that about a one Maynard James Keenan. His lyrics here are at times utterly brilliant (Jambi, Vicarious, Right In Two) and at other times they are just plain unworthy of the mans name. The same can be said about Adam Jones' guitar playing except that for the most part it is less then present and when it is it isn't up to his classic level of riffery. One of the main thing about Tool's appeal is Keenans vocal performances and lyrical prose, and the other being Adam Jones' knack for killer oddly time riffs to acompany a pretty inventive melody. That just doesn't seem to be here on 10,000 Days. It's almost as if the boys have given up; as though Keenan is more into his side projects like Pucifer rather than Tool. This is sad, because Tool is usually a really great band, despite their annoying Metallica like fan club of followers whom I'm sure drool over this lackluster release the same way I do with all of Aerosmith's newest releases while secretly knowing and not wanting to admit that it is not worthy of the brand name.<br /><br />The point is the band could have done better, especially with the amount of down time they put in between releasing this and the previous album. So I guess when one really gets down to it, this would be by far the bands weakest release to date, worse than the debut, and worse than the ep really. A lot of this blame can rest souly on the filler tracks which are here in abundance and boggle down the good tracks as they are usually surrounded with trite; which makes me wonder if the greatest tracks on the album are even as good as I think they are or if it isn't just what I refer to as the 'Diamond in the ruff' effect. Had the album been a solid release would these tracks be this good? Chances are they would not. But oh well, I'll keep my fingers crossed for the next release that I'm sure we wont get for at least another three years.three years.
0385509456|4.0|I thought this book was funny and clever.  It had a couple of unexpected twists which made me want to keep reading and finish the book entirely in one sitting.  The book is a short read and I thought there was some definite filler material, especially throughout the train station chapter.  Overall, I think the story portrays a person with Asperger's or autism pretty well.  As a therapist who works with people with all sorts of disabilities, I enjoyed getting a perspective from \\"the other side\\". I've passed this book along to coworkers and they seem to be enjoying it as well.
B00005B36H|4.0|Lateralus had such promise and could have very well been Tool's greatest album to date, even better than my beloved Aenima. However, there is one problem with the album, and admittedly it's a rather large one at that. The entire middle section of the album is sooo overtly boring that I oftern wonder at times if the band, namely Maynard James Keenan purposely did this in his own sick twisted artistry head. But it seems more likely that Tool just created a handfull of throwaway tracks, it is possible, even for Tool; I know their Metallica-esq fan club wont agree, but dearies, it's fact.<br /><br />The first half of the album however is just damn flawless. 'The Grudge' 'The Patient' the brilliance of 'Schism' and even 'Parabola' in the center. These tracks create soundscapes of the mind and take the listener places Keenan only dreamed of taking them. The title tracks is basically as close to epic as Tool ever got, and will likely ever get in my book. 'Faaip de Oiad' closes the album and the damn thing leaves me speechless. It's the damn amazing.<br /><br />Now I simply must write about Adam Jones' guitar playing, as I honestly think the man is playing at his greatest here on Lateralus. There is no way around that. His rhythms are tight and his riffs are sharp enough to slice bread.<br /><br />Sonically the album had the right ideas had it been stripped of the little bit of filler it contains. The problem is that the filler found there in is really, really, extremely boring, dull, bland, and anyother adjective you can think of to describe blah.<br /><br />In a nutshell I have a real love/hate relationship with Lateralus, because it's 80% brilliant, and 20% puke. So even though whats bad about this album is REALLY bad, it's worth checking out because the highs of this album are flippin' goregous.

B00001OH80|5.0|Where some might think of [[ASIN:B00001OH7Z Let's Dance]] as leaning heavily toward radio pop it's an interesting surprize that this follow up,which came very close onto the previous album compared to the previous lengh of time between albums is an entirely different animal. On all of the nine tunes on this album David Bowie isn't quite as concerned with creating deliberate pop song structures and as with most of his best music the best songs on the album don't leap right out at you the first second. As with classic Bowie the tunes take time to work there way into your subconious as the melodies reveal themselves more in the middle of the song. And there is a substantial difference in musical approch as well. Whereas the previous album concentrated on hard hitting dance-rock and funk the general flavors of this album lean more toward dub/reggae and light techno-pop. The reggae influence is very prominant on the likable title song which actually does have a pretty quick hitting melody. \\"Don Look Down\\" embraces a moodier Police style flavor and that being said it makes a lot of sense that Iggy Pop co-wrote these songs with Bowie. The co-producer of this album,Heatwave's own bassmaster Derek Bramble really let himself go on this album as every song firmly lands in the domain of the rhythm section he created with the one and only Carlos Alomar and the other bass playe4r Carmine Rojas. Now some might scoff at the stripped down,somewhat synthesized texture Bowie brings to his verison of \\"God Only Knows\\" but the fact is the rhythm of the song is again guided by a more new wave flavor than the Spector-styled original and the song is completely re-harmonized. It's not until Bowie's vocals come in do you actually realize it's the same song. Bowie rocks up a Leiber/Stoller classic on \\"I Keep Forgettin'\\" in much the same and that takes you into the rock n soul style of \\"Tumble And Twirl\\"-higher octane than either Huey Lewis or Hall & Oates would've probably put to a song of the type but this along with \\"Dancing With The Big Boys\\",the hit \\"Blue Jean\\" and the tension filled rock of \\"Neighborhood Threat\\" it's one of a series of songs on this album that have a slight resemblance to what was on the previous album. Musically speaking this album doesn't deserve much of it's bad reputation in terms of quality and your appreciation of it will probably depend largely of what era of Bowie's music your more interested in.robably put to a song of the type but this along with \\"Dancing With The Big Boys\\",the hit \\"Blue Jean\\" and the tension filled rock of \\"Neighborhood Threat\\" it's one of a series of songs on this album that have a slight resemblance to what was on the previous album.

If you look at any great piece of \\"storytelling\\" (because that is essentially what the written work is, the telling of a story), like Tolkien's, McCaffrey's, Orson Scott Card with \\"Ender's Game\\", or even movies such as \\"The Matrix Trilogy\\", the characters draw you in, not the world in which it takes place. The richness of the world that you have created takes place through the \\"main\\" character's eyes     When I first saw \\"The Matrix\\" I knew that it would be interesting, because of the world created by the Wachowski brothers, but when Trinity looked at the garbage truck pulled up so it would crush the phone booth (and they had already established the \\"men in suits\\" are the \\"bad guys\\"; the woman in black leather is the a \\"good guy\\"), and she ran toward the phone booth at the same time the truck was set to crush the booth, I sat up in my chair and went, \\"Whow\\". At that moment (less than ten minutes into) the \\"story\\" hooked me, through the characters eyes, and drew me in to such a place that i would rent the movie for two months, buy a DVD player so i could get it on DVD, and watch it over and over again, and go see the two sequels back-to-back (so I wouldn't miss a thing.     Same thing when I was in the 6th grade, and we read \\"Dragonsong\\" by McCaffrey. The place is unique, but the \\"story\\" was captivating because you saw the world of Pern through Menolly's eyes, and McCaffrey only took the first 2 pages to hook you. As a result of that, I went out (well, checked out of the library) not only \\"Dragonsinger\\" and \\"Dragondrums, but the three books which were for adults. The stories were so vivid in my mind's eye, because of the characters, that I remembered the plot for each of those books 20 years after having read them. The Harper Hall trilogy I bought for my son as soon as he was old enough to read them. Not only that, but they are falling apart because I have read them so many times.     That's what great stories do. They draw you in with the characters and let you see the world through their eyes. Paoloni did that quite successfully in \\"Eragon\\", but in \\"Eldest\\" and especially \\"Brisingr\\" the characters failed and thus everything about the world of Alagaesia failed.     The main character, Eragon, doesn't develop at all. That he stays the same is incredibly disappointing because the first of the series, \\"Eragon\\", introduced us to a boy who was thrust into a position he wasn't prepared for. I thought the rest of the series would show him \\"growing up\\" and becoming a man.     Unfortunately, that never happens. Eragon remains a \\"teenage\\" punk who never grows up, despite his responsibilities. Saphira, who I have to say as a dragon she was unique, even though the part where she hatches is just a rip-off of Anne McCaffrey's books. I thought one scene in the horrible movie \\"Eragon\\" that I did enjoy was Saphira's hatching where she catches a rat, instead of Eragon feeding her. Instead that part was so unlike Saphira that it stood out. Otherwise, Saphira is actually a well-rounded character, unlike her Rider. So, why did she pick him in the first place?     When you have a main character like Eragon, he should grow and change -- especially in relation to Saphira. The best book I have read that has a relationship between a dragon and his rider is \\"The White Dragon\\" by McCaffrey. Much changed over the course of the book that Pern became a rich backdrop for exploring the relationship between Jaxom and Ruth, who both went through the course of less than a year with dramatic changes in both of them. The \\"boy\\" who started at the beginning of the story was in no way, shape or form to take over as Lord Holder of Ruatha, yet by the end of the book, he grew and changed so much that him going back to Ruatha to assume Lordship seemed inevitable, and you were cheering your guts out at the end of the book.     Those are stories where the action takes place on a distant planet, but it becomes a rich world where the characters grow and change; the emphasis is on the characters.     \\"Brisingr\\" also disappoints in relation to Arya, previously a strong and independent character, who is as foreign to Eragon as anyone would get. In the first book, which is by far the best of the series, Arya is introduced as a strong character, but independent and \\"strange\\" as the wind; which means Eragon falls for her, but she obviously will not be dominated, even while tortured and set to take her own life before going before Galbatorix. In \\"Eldest\\" she continues to be a strong character, while subtly allowing the reader seeing her through Eragon's eyes, while it is revealed that her past is surprisingly a stark contrast to how Eragon previously viewed her. It's all the things Arya doesn't say which are the real beauty of her character. In \\"Brisingr\\", Arya \\"became more human\\". In fact, except for the flying, magical boat she makes, just takes an easy way out of dealing with her past and becomes a \\"human\\" who makes light of her past around the campfire. What a cop-out that turned out to be. Eh, let's just make her \\"human\\", forget the past so she can fall in love with a boy who still has a \\"crush\\" on her, rather than layered emotion that should be present when she decides to go after him in the first part of the book.     Nasuada \\"changes\\" for no reason. All of the sudden she becomes someone who you used to root for, yet there is no defining moment as a cause for the change. The Behavior Analysis Unit of the FBI alwayd looks for a \\"stressor\\", usually the death of a loved one, or something else dramatic that once they know what it is, that's the point where there's a \\"turning point\\" that leads to them quickly narrowing their search, and becoming pro-active in their pursuit of the un-sub instead of being reactive up until that point. Nasuada never encountered such a thing, and the battle of cutting herself really became a non-factor. Why would she even have to do this with some previously unknown person who shows up out of nowhere? The more likely events would have to be something more along the lines of her being in love with Murtagh, and \\"snapping\\" because of what Eragon has to do to Murtagh. Nasuada could be the only person who truly believes there is good inside him.    That brings me to another problem with \\"Brisingr\\" -- Murtagh has become a shallow enemy whose only appearance is to show up and be a bad guy. He's just a paper cut-out of what could have been a rich character.     Galbatorix -- he is nothing more than another one-dimensional bad guy. Look, in our own history (I mean planet Earth) the \\"bad guys\\" who truly caused problems for everyone, like Hitler, Stalin, and Mengala -- actually believed they weren't doing bad things, they were \\"saving\\" parts of the human race that \\"deserved\\" to be saved. In their minds, they were the \\"good guys\\". I thought that Murtagh believed in the system of government that Galbatorix had set up, even though he recognized Galbatorix was evil. Again, another idea which could have been great, except it was discarded by the end of \\"Brisingr\\", replaced by another cardboard cut-out named \\"Galbatorix\\", who became just a plot device with no more character, just a nondescript bad guy.     In fact, this is the problem I have with \\"The Inheritance Cycle\\". The characters who are really interesting are characters who were minor in nature, but had more development than the main characters did. okay, Brom was a main character in Book 1, but the plot point where he is revealed to be Eragon's father kind of takes allthat and flushes it down the toilet. Oh, of course Brom is Eragon's father. Silly me, I didn't think that Brom acted in a way a father should treat his son, even when they traveled together for months. It would have been more interesting if Brom \\"knew\\" Eragon's father, and watched over him in Carvarhall as a debt of love towards the other man.     Angela and Solembum are two characters who I always enjoyed, yet their inclusion wasn't part of the original plan. It would have been much better finding out about the werecats, their history and origins rather than waste time with 200+ waste of pages on their \\"politics\\". I found Jeod Longshanks, again, written as a minor character more interesting than Roran. In \\"Eldest\\" I skipped the parts with Roran until he ran into Jeod.     Roran became an idiotic nightmare. How in the world did he kill so many enemy soldiers with no more than his own \\"brute strength. Paolini, take a note, nobody kills that many soldiers by themselves without magic. It's impossible. And then to get whipped by Nasuada for disobeying his \\"commanding officer\\". Geez, after seeing the way that Ajihad dealt with Orik, seemingly \\"punishing\\" him by giving him the best assignment that he thought was swell, but which couldn't be challenged by the Twins, because it was \\"punishment\\". Again, Nasuada comes across as a totally different character.     When you start out and introduce your main characters, you are setting up certain parameters for that character. As the story progresses, the characters change for better or for worse, depending on what happens to them. If Nasuada is laer on going to become a problem for the Varden, then you must show why in the previous narrative that you set up for the character all along. For instance, Nasuada could have felt \\"inadequate\\" to lead the Varden, and so therefore, all the decisions she makes turn out well, then that would open the door for her to get an inflated 'ego'. Then we would view Nasuada's \\"mistakes\\" in leadingthe Varden as something that naturally flowed from Nasuada \\"misreading\\" her success as something that became all about her.     Of the elves, Rhunon is one of the best yet she's a \\"minor\\" character. Islanzadi, Oromis and Glaedr are interesting characters, particularly how Islanzadi relates to Arya and Oromis/Glaedr relate to Eragon/Saphira. Instead we get 200+ pages of the dwarf's political infighting. Who cares about the dwarves? Especially since the better developed race; the one you really wanted to know about was the elves.     I am sorry to say that I don't recommend \\"Brisingr\\", even for those who loved the first two books. Read 'Percy Jackson & the Olympans' series. The technical aspect of writing style is woeful, but Rick Riordan does such a great job of drawing you in to Percy's world the technical aspects of writing become totally ancillary to what will draw you in, Percy Jackson and the characters he meets going along the way of his journey.      This is coming from someone who can read anything at a PhD level, yet talking about books that are written at a 5th grade level, the \\"Percy Jackson\\" series, to the 8th grade book \\"The Inheritance Cycle\\" (I would not recommend Paloni's work to anyone at the 9th grade level on).        I gave \\"Brisngr\\" 1 star out of 5, and that's only because you can't rate a 'half-a-star'. I would rate \\"Brisingr\\" as a 1/2 star out of 5.
0375714839|5.0|This book was a gift to my husband from my sister-in-law.  He loved it enough to recommend it to me.<br /><br />It is told in graphics with captions and labels and narration.  The author is a woman from Iran showing and telling about her experiences growing up during the Iranian Revolution.  It was amazing.  I learned a lot and ventured out to learn more as I read.  I even, GASP, asked my history teacher husband to give me some lessons on the time period.  That NEVER happens.<br /><br />The descriptions of family and friends is an education in itself, so many perspectives.  The book is everyone's coming of age, yet it is supremely unique.  I loved everything about it.  Looking forward to finding the film version.
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|If you are one of those people that can tolerate even a little ridiculousness in your movies, this is still not for you.   Between bullets knocking each other out of the air, flipping Dodge Vipers, and other assorted nonsense, this movie goes from action to impossible to ridiculous to silly to plain sad (the last three are unintended).   There is escapism, and there is stupid:  this movie is stupid.
B002SJIO4A|5.0|WOW!  Just watched Academy Award nominee for Best Picture \\"District 9\\".  Incredible.  It is one of the best Sci-Fi films I've ever seen...and it has \\"heart\\".  I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it won the Oscar.  A must!  Intelligent, emotional, believable, and awesome directing, editing, sound and makeup.  It contains a hint of several sci-fi classics such as \\"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\\", \\"E.T.\\", and \\"Batteries Not Included\\".  Unlike those, however, this one is much more graphic and may be too intense for the kids.  Peter Jackson's finest work.  GREAT JOB!  I want more!!!
1577314808|5.0|LOVE.... LOVE... LOVE THIS BOOK.  I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN.  THE BEST BOOK.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This film lives up to all of the accolades including Horror Film of the Year by Fangoria Magazine.  It is definitely \\"A vampire tale like no other.  Mesmerizing,\\" as stated on the DVD box.  The relationship between Oscar and Eli is profound.  The editing is perfect.  The casting is perfect.  The setting is perfect.  And the English dubbing is first class.  Five stars...hands down.  One of the most romantic horror films I have ever seen.  I, too, fell in love with Eli.  Oscar's first love is definitely his last.  He watches her back...she watches his.  A gem!
B001IB4B3W|5.0|As always Dr. Seuss does a great job. I bought this book for all my friends with small children.
0316044938|4.0|The subject matter is very harrowing and although I feel the message here is one of hope and love - it is also a very dark look at the sick and twisted mind of a killer. I'm not sure how I feel about it - but I admire the author for tackling the subject. The main character Susie is written in such a way that you can't help but love and care for her - despite knowing early on what her fate is.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I simly loved this version of Emma. I love anything Jane Austen but I'm not an Austen purist. The film was beautiful, and the characters well chosen. I thoroughly enjoyed it and have already watched it twice!
B002P5XXR0|5.0|\\"Avatar\\" is the best movie of the year, maybe even decade and I have to say the score ain't too bad. I loved the music and it's blending of classical and african music. Avatar's score comes in second after the \\"Twilight\\" score on my list of all-time best movie scores. I'm young don't hate us Twilighters, but all I can say is buy Avatar's score if you haven't done so already!
B00127RAJY|5.0|When I looked at reviews before doing this dvd and during, what really interested me was the results people have seen. With that in mind, I will tell you what I have seen:    I started out at 5'9\\" and 156 lbs, a size 8. The first month I did this dvd 3-4 times a week and I tried to watch what I ate, but in all honesty I cheated on my diet a bit too much, so I didn't see much for results. I did notice an improvement in my strength and conditioning though. I think I did levels 1 and 2 around 15 times each before moving on to level 3.    Then in February, I really started watching my diet a lot more (I aim for 1400-1600 cals a day, my BMR is 1530) and also having days where I do two of the workouts or incorporate some cardio in as well. Last time I weighed myself, I was down to 151 and my clothes are fitting really well again.    I think part of the reason I wasn't seeing results is that I don't have a big amount to lose as I am at a \\"normal\\" BMI. But I really want to gain muscle definition and hopefully at the end of this journey I will be in the mid 130's. I hope this helps someone that is in the same boat that I am!
B001FB4W0M|5.0|I purchased this for my son for his birthday because he is a huge fan of Supernatural.  We are extremely pleased and have already watched the whole season.
031606792X|1.0|Like so many, after Twilight hit the theaters I rushed to read the series for myself.  The first three books were amazing.  I easily got caught up in Meyer's writing and remembered the drama of being seventeen again.  The characters had such life (no pun intended) and I felt like I really knew them and felt my heartbreak along with the characters.    With the end of book three, my heart was breaking for Jacob.  I couldn't wait to finish off the series with Breaking Dawn.  I was disappointed in most of the book.  While there was some conflict in the story and the potential for a battle scene with vamps and werewolves, everyone ended up with a perfect happily ever after.  Bella and Edward live forever as vamps with their child in love.  Jacob finds his sole mate.  Charlie finds a love.  Everyone is happy, happy, happy.  Yuck!!!    The great \\"battle scene\\" was more about standing around talking.  No battle at all.  I'm all for romance, but not this neatly wrapped up; especially after everything the characters went through during the first three books.      There was such potential for the finally and it was a huge let down reading this book.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|I have always enjoyed Andrea Bocelli's singing. I also enjoy christmas music. When these came together I was overjoyed and obtaining a copy was natural. The selection of songs was good in that it had variety. The stage settings, creates a wonderful sense of christmas, and presentation was in keeping with the dignity of christmas while being entertaining. The ladies were charming. The voices of Andrea Bocelli and the guest stars are so good, true, rich, fulfilling and rewarding to listen to. For some undentifiable reason I like \\"What child is this \\" best in the performance and I have never seen a parralell to your presentation of \\"Jingle Bells\\"    I am so glad I bought this DVD and despite christmas being long past I watch it quite often and I enjoy it much.
B00275EGWY|5.0|It's really difficult to imagine how this film was made without any assistance from the U.S. Armed Forces, but they did it. The Army felt this was too much of an anti-war story. But I guess that depends on your point of view. Showing the horrors of war is not necessarily anti-war. It's just a taste of reality. And in this case, it's a bitter taste.<br /><br />Exploring the activites and emotions of an Army Explosive Ordinance team, The Hurt Locker was filmed in Jordan, not in Iraq. But I don't think anyone besides an Iraq War veteran will know this wasn't filmed in the war zone, with real troops and live ammunition. It feels like the real thing. Not so much documentary style as I had imagined. The actors are wonderful. The writing is crisp and concise. The photography is amazing. And the entire story is completely believable. It's no wonder The Hurt Locker rocked the 2010 BAFTA awards, winning best film, director, original screenplay, editing, cinematography and sound. I have no doubt that the film will also sweep the Oscars.<br /><br />I hate to single anyone out of this superb cast, but I have to say what a pleasure it was to see Guy Pearce in the role of Staff Sergeant Matt Thompson. I've long admired his acting, and wished to see him more often. Jeremy Renner and Ralph Fiennes also turned in predictably solid performances, which I'm sure raised the bar for the less experienced members of the corps.<br /><br />I'm told the budget for this film was only $11 million. Which, when compared to $200 million dollar blockbusters, is an unimaginably small budget. But you will never know, from watching this film, that there was any ill effect from such a thrifty production. It looks and feels like the award winning accomplishment it is. And that only adds to my admiration of director Kathryn Bigelow (James Cameron's ex-wife), and her talented crew. I just can't heap enough praise upon this gem.<br /><br />Whether you view this as pro-Army, or anti-war, or just plain shocking, you have to say this film is thought provoking, deeply emotional, and I feel, honestly presents the bravery, patriotism, and esprit de corps of the men you'll find in our military today.<br /><br />Update 8Mar; Congratulations to Kathryn, and the cast and crew for 9 Oscar nominations, and 6 Oscar awards including BEST PICTURE!thought provoking, deeply emotional, and I feel, honestly presents the bravery, patriotism, and esprit de corps of the men you'll find in our military today.

B000GTLQXU|4.0|I thought this was a very decent remake of the classic 1972 original. It has a lot of action and is very suspenseful. On New Year's Eve, a luxury cruise ship named after the Greek sea-god, Poseidon collides into a 150-foot tall rogue wave. After the ship is turned upside down, a small group of people try to make it to the surface alive. I highly recommend POSEIDON!!!
B002M9WW30|5.0|This is a great buy, the picture doesen't look that much better then the dvd but if you don't own it yet and you have a Blu-Ray it's worth the money. It's also cheaper then the dvd collection in stores. If you have any other question please comment and i'd gladly reply.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I thought this was a really good and very inspirational movie, and was a lot better than I had expected. Everybody did an awesome job. There were a lot of hilarious moments, heart-breaking moments, and heart-warming moments throughout. A homeless 18 year old named Michael 'Big Mike' Oher is a quiet and peaceful person. He keeps to himself. He is under-educated because of his past. Leigh Anne Tuohy sees Michael and offers him a room in her house. He soon becomes apart of the family, because they adopt him. The Tuohy family help him become involved in football. Other coaches from Universities see what he can do, and offer him a Scholarship. Which college will Michael pick? I highly recommend THE BLIND SIDE!!!!!!!!<br /><br />p.s. It's been awesome writing 800 reviews, and look forward to writing 800 more!
B0006GAI6O|4.0|This movie is a great drama/romance with fantastic acting and fun dance scenes!  Check it out!
0783226837|5.0|Don't get me wrong. I also loved this movie the first five times I saw it. It's a real cult classic. The small desert town of Perfection is attacked by large, underground monsters. AND THEY EAT PEOPLE. And no, it's not really a horror movie. It's more like a comic show. If you liked \\"Ghostbusters\\", \\"Evolution\\" or \\"The Blob\\", you'll gonna love this one.<br /><br />However, I have to admit that I've outgrown this movie. These days, I just yawn when I see it. Usually, I don't even watch the reruns. \\"Yeah, yeah, there's a monster beneath the hardware store. Whatever\\".<br /><br />For old times sake, however, I'll give it five stars anyway. BTW, did you know that smorgasbord is a Swedish loanword?
0465011047|5.0|As a person who is interested in both the Korean Peninsula (my sister-in-law is Korean)and the history of communism, this book provided valuable insights. I came to the book with a basic, working knowledge of life in communist countries and life in concentration/hard labor camps; this book adds to that knowledge by painting a vivid picture of life in \\"The Hermit Kingdom\\". While other reviewers have criticized the flow of the story, the language/syntax, the author's difficulty in adjusting to life in the South (as if it would be easy to go from living in a Stalinist regime to a democracy) and the fact that the book isn't a comprehensive expose of the North Korean camp system (maybe he could have done this if he had stuck around to get arrested for listening to South Korean radio broadcasts), the strength of this work is its readability, the descriptions of life in Pyongyang before the arrest, the ordeal at Yodok, the escape from the North and travels through China before arriving in Seoul, and the author's heartfelt concern for his family and the country that he had to leave behind in order to tell his story to the world. I don't think the author's intention was to win a Pulitzer Prize, but rather to alert the world of the human tragedy taking place north of the 38th Parallel.

1594488843|5.0|To all the bosses, teachers, coaches, parents: \\"Have you ever wondered why the rewards you gave or the carrots you offered did not get the results you expected?  Read DRIVE by Dan Pink.   In DRIVE, Pink makes a compelling argument, substantially reinforced by scientific evidence, that in the twenty first century, when tasks increasingly require more than just \\"rule bases behavior\\", there is a need for a new motivation model.   Pink develops the ideas behind Motivation 3.0 focused on \\"Autonomy, Mastery, and Purpose\\".  The evidence is overwhelming.    In answer to the skeptics, I observed that the Haiti earthquake triggered ample proof of Motivation 3.0 capacity for delivering amazing results.  My only regret is that I did not read DRIVE fifteen years ago when teaching MBA students and bossing hundreds of employees.  My students, my employees, myself would have all benefited immensely.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|As a Star Wars fan I was leary about the Clone Wars television show.  However, the more I watched it the more it grew on me.  I enjoyed how it expanded on characters the movies only touched on briefly (Plo Koon, Kit Fisto, etc.).      My work schedule changes constantly and I'm constantly forgetting to set a recording for the Cartoon Network broadcasts, so I was very pleased when I saw a boxed set of season one come to the stores.  However, I wasn't pleased with the price they were charging.    After shopping around in stores and online I found Amazon was selling season one for $10 less than the cheapest price I was finding in any store.  I had never bought anything from Amazon before and was very pleased with the easy to use website and the free shipping was awesome!  My DVD set even arrived several days before it was scheduled.  My sons and I are now overjoyed to watch Clone Wars episodes whenever we want.  Thank you for your quality company and unbeatable prices.
B0030BOCKK|4.0|I say it's a typical Him CD because like all of the others it takes two or three listens before you start to really appreciate it. As far as sound I'd compare it to Dark Light but without a lot the synth that that CD had. I've listened to Him since 2002 before Love Metal was released and in the 8 years I've been a fan their sound has indeed changed but I don't see it as Americanization. Where Dark Light was a bit of a new almost poppy direction, Venus Doom took the band in a more metal direction. In my opinion this CD sounds the most like a good balance of Venus Doom and Dark Light. Inevitably it does garner comparisons to all of their other CD's, but I think if this CD had been released in 2003 instead of Love Metal I would have probably enjoyed it just as much. I'll break down the CD track by track to give a breakdown of what I think.    In Venere Veritas 5/5 - A great song to open with, catchy and really sets the mood for the rest of the CD. I can't really think of another Him song to compare it to which is a good thing.  Scared to Death 4/5 - Sounds about like it could have fit very well on Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights.   Heartkiller 3/5 - Although it was the first single I think it's by far the weakest song on the CD. It's catchy but the lyrics aren't that great and I agree the Er in Heartkiller is exaggerated in an almost comic manner.  Dying Song 4/5 - A great song that is a bit reminiscent of Dark Light. Sounds a little like filler though.  Disarm Me With Your Loneliness 5/5 - A great ballad, perhaps my favorite song on the CD.  Love, the Hardest way 4/5 - A pretty catchy song that could have fit on Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights or Dark Light.  Katharine Wheel 3/5 - I'm not sure who or what Katharine Wheel is, but this song is probably my second least favorite on the CD. It doesn't really sound much like any other Him songs.  In the Arms of Rain 5/5 - One of the top 3 tracks from the CD, sounds like it could have fit well on Love Metal whichis no easy feat.  Ode to Solitude 4/5 - One of the heavier tracks on the CD, sounds a little reminiscent of Razorblade Romance.  Shatter Me With Hope 4/5 - Good song, nothing really new. Could have fit on Venus Doom though.  Acoustic Funeral 5/5 - One of my favorites. It sounds kind of like Dark Light but it's different at the same time even for Him.   Like St. Valentine 4/5 - This song sounds about like it could have fit on either Love Metal or Venus Doom.  The Foreboding Sense of Impending Doom 5/5 - A good track to end with, almost sounds a little like Greatest Lovesongs Vol. 666.    Aside from some catchy new tunes, this album doesn't really bring much new to Him's Repertoire, which is why I could never give it 5 stars, but it is definitely a good listen for non-fans, and a must have for die hard fans. Unless you're expecting to hear another Razorblade Romance or Love Metal, you won't be disappointed.
B000TGCR38|3.0|I'd seen this movie a long time ago when it was in the theatres and remembered it being a good movie. The Jewish friend I was with at the time really enjoyed it too and later bought a copy for his sister. I thought I'd surprise a new Jewish friend that I was dating and get the movie for him as he hadn't seen it and I thought maybe he'd enjoy it. Well the movie is more intense than I remembered and after watching it, he said,\\"I don't know what to say. It's not what I expected. Maybe you should just go home!\\" Not exactly the reaction I was expecting. Especially when the first friend I saw it with enjoyed it enough to buy a copy as a gift. The movie does draw you in and have you on the edge of the sofa for a good part of the movie. The actors do a great job. The subject matter is intense.
B002NWRMVS|5.0|This is a departure for Nora and on first listening I was a little disappointed, but like all really good albums it takes a few times on the cd player to be fully appreciated. The mix is different and so are the musicians but the Nora magic is still there. This is much more of a rock album than her other titles but there are still enough ballads to satisfy. To me Young Blood is the \\"hit\\" song of the album, I'm not sure what it is about but the words flow like poetry. I salute Nora for not sitting on her laurals and moving fore ward in her style, I hope her fans can keep up.

B00354Y9ZU|5.0|Linchpin is a must read for any knowledge worker active around the world today.  In Linchpin, Godin makes the case for a return to the essential value of the gift as an enabler to make a difference.  In its simplicity, the ideas contained in this book ring true and appear very obvious. The working of the lizard brain, which I was aware of after reading The War of Art, really became clear to me.    In essence, what Godin (yet again) does with Linchpin is like inventing the cat flap: really obvious once it's there, but very difficult to come up with in the first place. He is a quintessential thinker, a meta linchpin (the linch pin to linch pins everywhere) and he makes the way I look at the confusing world around me a bit better.     Thanks Seth, and looking forward to other great books.    Ben Broeckx

B00008J2PG|5.0|This movie gives an overview of the important and dangerous work that Monsignor Hugh O'Flaherty took upon himself during the German Occupation of Rome during World War II. The monsignor, portrayed outstandingly by Gregory Peck, devotes his ingenuity, contacts and time to hiding refugees and escaped allied prisoners of war (POWs). The underground network he built using religious houses, neutral embassies and the local residents was instrumental in assisting keeping thousands of people alive.    His nemesis was the Gestapo Colonel Kapple who is played impeccably by Christopher Plummer. Even though the monsignor had diplomatic immunity the pressures brought to bear on the Colonel demanded he stop all underground activity and gives orders to kill the monsignor on sight when ever he was found outside of the Vatican grounds.    `The Scarlet and the Black' shows us this historical story with a flow of non-stop suspense and excitement. History is brought alive in such a way that you wish to continue to learn more. As an extra bonus the film is filmed on location in Rome where this game of life and death was played out. There is no question that the monsignor deserved the awards the various countries awarded him, but even more important you see that even with all that he lived through and witnessed he lived the Catholic principles he espoused.     Please note that even if you are just a World War II movie buff this movie should be on your must watch list!

B000W91RUG|5.0|Finally a sitcom about scientists that does not insult your intelligence and makes you laugh until you cry. Kudos to the actors for delivering lines full of scientific terms with perfect comic timing. Try and be funny while explaining the string theory! I always wondered if people would enjoy a show about scientists - all the other ones involve lawyers,medical doctors, politicians etc. and forensic scientists are so passé (CSI anyone?). Believe me I met \\"sheldons\\" and \\"leonards\\" they do lack tact in a funny way. They live happily in their world, adorably oblivious to anything outside the lab.
1416955070|5.0|I have been reading 'supernatural' books since I was in the 8th grade and started with the cirque du freak series. I am now a senior in college and a friend had recommended the series to me. I loved it. I couldn't put the book down, had to read on to see what would happen next. I've read the whole cirque du freak series, twilight saga, house of night series, the vampire diaries series, and the immortals series by alyson noel, and by far this series was one of my favorite. It had just enough drama to keep me interested, but not too much that I thought I was watching a day-time TV drama.

B001OQCV2O|2.0|I only give two stars because of the lack of spanish subtitles. Although I can read english subtitles without problems, many people don´t have this possibility. From my humble point of view, the big risk for Sony and other companies who play with this thing of the \\"subtitles\\" is that this kind of decisions will only incentive and produce more illegal downloads than the usual. If you bring many subtitles you will not avoid that illegal activities, but I think that you will reduce some of them and also sell more movies at no additional cost. Everything counts, please remember that !!!. Many thanks and good luck for everybody !!!

Most of his books have been science fiction novels for both young adults and adults. He has written around 18 novels in total in the last 13 years. He fell for another author and married her.

She is accepting queries for most types of fiction and prefers them through snail mail. Send a query letter with the first fifty pages of your manuscript along with a SASE to:  (...)    Where to even begin? I guess I will start with my likes. I liked the storyline. It was all action adventure with jumping off buildings, breaking into secure structures, hover board races and bad guys who have superhuman strength. He created a very vivid image of what the future could look like.  The author gave us a lot to enjoy in the 425 pgs. He made sure that you felt the main character's anger and guilt and confusion and happiness. It didn't feel painfully long even though it kind of was.    On to the bad. The first time I watched Fellowship of the Ring I was seriously ticked at the cliffhanger ending. All I need is a temporary happily ever after, but just like that movie, you don't get it from this book. The other less annoying part of this book is the feeling that you are sitting through a lecture on your carbon footprint. You hear about recycling, cutting down trees, gas alternatives, and solar power. It was just a little too much for me.    Tally lives in a world of two types of people... uglies and pretties. Everyone is considered ugly until they go through an operation when they are 16. She is eagerly awaiting her turn to become a pretty and move to Prettyville with her friends and do nothing but eat, drink, and be merry. She meets a new friend, Shay, just months before her operation and learns that she is going to run away and stay ugly forever.  Tally gets a hard reality check when a special unit of Pretties denies her the operation unless she finds where the runaways have gone. She hikes through the wild world outside of her protected city and nearly dies several times.   Tally finds Smoke, the rough city of runaways, and is reunited with Shay. Shay has a crush on a boy smokey named David who is the son of the founders of Smoke. David falls for Tally and chaos arises.  Tally feels guilt for her lies to the smokies and eventually makes amends the only way she knows how. She marches off into the horizon with only her hover board... to sacrifice herself. The end. Yep, really.     Now for the romance. David falls for Tally on first sight... because she has character. Tally is intrigued by this older guy who carries himself with such ease and confidence in the wild. He gives her a gift of gloves, outdoorsman for \\"I heart you!\\" She doesn't know what to do because Shay hearts David, but within a day they are kissing goodnight and meeting his parents.     I give this book a four out of ten just because I am not willing to read 2 more 400 page books to get a hopefully happily ever after. It would be fine for 16 and up, but it does mention tangled legs in a pleasure garden and the entire Pretty town eludes to partying it up and all that goes with it. Tally does some serious growing up, but she holds out until the very end to finally be honest with David. It doesn't bode well for book two, Pretties.

B00003CXZ4|5.0|I saw this film when it first came out in theaters about 10 years ago.  As has been well described in other reviews, it's a brilliant psychological thriller that keeps you guessing as you see each scene the way the main character would- without any memory of what came before.  As the film progresses, into the past, the mystery is gradually revealed, and what we find out at the end, which is what happened at the beginning, gives new meaning to everything that came after.  Sound confusing?  Well it is.  Which is why the film is worth seeing again.<br /><br />Seeing it again after 10 years was a strange experience, and even more fulfilling than the first time.  That's because I didn't remember how the story ended (or began), so I could appreciate the unraveling of the mystery anew.  And yet, with each new plot detail revealed, I began to have vague recollections of what would happen next.  That made each scene more significant and enjoyable.<br /><br />To put it another way, when you see the film the first time, you're mostly in the dark about what's really going on until the end.  And by then you may have forgotten much of what you saw because you didn't know it mattered at the time.  Seeing it again, each detail becomes richer in meaning, the film seems deeper, and I could appreciate it on another level.<br /><br />When you get past the superficial level of the plot mystery, what remains is a meditation on how we choose who we are in the world, and the role that memory plays.<br /><br />After seeing this film, you may feel just a bit queasy, as you consider whether the foundation of your reality is as firm as you thought. We are, after all, what we know.  And we know only what we can remember.  And memory is imperfect at best, and may in fact be just a well-crafted illusion to create the world we want to live in.  In that world, the meaning we bring to each new day is just a product of the memories we carry with us.  There is a little bit of Leonard Shelby in all of us.

B002VECMAY|2.0|My husband and I just saw UP IN THE AIR, and I have to say that neither of us liked it very much.  UP IN THE AIR is a depressing, unsatisfying waste of time.  A movie should entertain me, teach me something, or make me think.  UP IN THE AIR did none of these things.<br /><br />UP IN THE AIR is the story of Ryan Bingham, a man who spends most of his life on the road:  in airplanes, hotel rooms, bars, and restaurants.  His job?  To travel from company to company firing people.  He is never in one place very long, and he has no real relationships.  He doesn't really even know his family.  His main goal in life is to reach 10 million frequent flier miles, a number only 6 people have reached prior to him.  His life is all about loyalty status and points.  But suddenly, his company decides that they are going to try to fire people via internet video conferencing, instead of face to face.  Bingham is going to be grounded, forced to actually live in Omaha, and to give up his swanky life style.  Oh my, what will happen next?  Do I even care? Uh, no...<br /><br />I am not sure what the point is to UP IN THE AIR.  For two hours, we watch this man fight to stay on the road, so he can increase his status.  He is shallow, has no attachments, and no other interests.  Even when he finally meets a woman, one who understands him, one he might actually WANT to settle down with, it turns out to all be a lie.  The viewer ends up frustrated and irritated.  After two hours of watching increasingly unsympathetic characters, I at least want the big change, the happy ending.  I felt nothing for anyone in this film, except for the people he so callously and adeptly fired.<br /><br />UP IN THE AIR is painful to watch, and IMHO, not funny at all.  Seriously, I want those two hours of my life back.  If UP IN THE AIR is the best that 2009 has to offer, then I am really glad we have moved on to 2010.
B00288KNL8|1.0|Neil Gaiman is a hack who has spun a minor talent into a long and tedious marketing blitz. His stories are badly plotted and the characters are about as deep as a thimble full of water. The worst aspect of Coraline and writer Neil Gaiman's other film efforts, such as Mirrormask and Beowulf, are their soulless, morally bankrupt quality. Gaiman's stories are best suited to disaffected youth, who lack the depth or wisdom to realize their emperor has no clothes. Gaiman tosses stories together with little thought. Despite all of the amazing visuals, Henry Selick is crippled by Gaiman's heartless story. Coraline is strangely frenetic and incredibly boring at the same time. The lack of any moral compass in Coraline makes it awful and depressing, like touring the author's subconscious and a nasty one at that; miserable, vindictive, angry and filled with resentment and futility. I would beware of showing this awful film to children, because at it's core it is an existentialist diatribe about how pointless life is... give up and be ignored and abused by your parents or become a zombie with button eyes. Coraline is a brightly wrapped package with a lump of coal inside, disappointing.
B00275EGX8|4.0|When facing a tiger, you run, hide, or face it head on. In THE HURT LOCKER, the tiger is the ever-present possibility of being blown to bits, and the main character faces it head on.<br /><br />Set in Iraq, the three men of Bravo Company's EOD (Explosive Ordinance Disposal) team have a healthy respect for roadside bombs. But despite taking all precautions, disaster strikes, leaving the team down a man. The replacement, Staff Sergeant James, is a self-confident veteran of Afghanistan whose first act is to remove the protective barrier over the windows of his barracks. He declares that he likes the sunlight and that the plywood won't protect him from an impact on the ceiling, anyway. It's the first hint that his world view might be a little different from that of the other members of the EOD. The first mission leaves no doubt of that. Upon arrival at the scene of the improvised explosive device (IED), SSgt. James refuses to use the remotely controlled robot, opting instead to wear \\"the suit\\" and search for the bomb himself. Since the bomb could be detonated at anytime from any of the buildings lining the street, SSgt. James' choice to go on foot seems insane, especially to his own men. Everyone, including the audience, is left wondering what would make a man take such unnecessary risks, but SSgt. James does so time and again. It is absolutely no surprise when, at the close of the movie, we see him returning to Iraq for another 365-day tour of duty. The simple fact is that he loves his work.<br /><br />I couldn't write this review for several days after seeing THE HURT LOCKER. I had to let it simmer on my subconscious for a while. The filmmakers wisely chose to stay away from any political statements and any kind of subjective commentary by the characters. All of the characters are 100% believable (to a civilian, at any rate), and they all seem 100% sane within the context of their own actions. This is to say that while I would not don the suit and march up to an IED, I do not see SSgt. James' willingness, nay eagerness, to do so any more insane than a racing driver who loves to roar around the track at more than 200mph. This man loved his work. It focused him and made him feel alive. And he was very good at it.<br /><br />The movie also reminded me of classics such as The Best Years of Our Lives, the William Wyler movie that depicted the difficulties of returning WWII veterans. While THE HURT LOCKER doesn't dwell on this aspect, it shows it starkly in about 3 minutes worth of scenes. The most jarring is a pair of scenes which start with a horrible incident in Iraq and switch almost immediately to SSgt. James back home in a grocery store aisle trying to decide which of 500 boxes of cereal to buy. I watched that thinking, \\"Free Willy!\\"<br /><br />Also of note is the lack of blood and guts in the movie. They didn't need it to tell the story. There was some crude language, but, and I am not exaggerating, there was more of that in Trading Places, which I watched again recently. The acting was all top-notch and believable, made doubly so by some A-List cameos who get killed after 5 minutes on screen. I sat there thinking, \\"But I liked him. I wanted to see more of him. He can't be dead.\\" As I pondered this later, I realized that perhaps that was the intended effect. Perhaps, and if so, then it was genius - this was a way to make the movie more personal.<br /><br />I also think it's worth spelling out that THE HURT LOCKER is not so much a war movie as it is a movie set in a war. The characters could have been firefighters or cops or any number of high-danger professionals, and the story would still have worked. Even so, I wouldn't change a thing.

B001993Y2C|5.0|This series is a great buy.  Outstanding production, acting and story.  But, that is well documented.  But what I do not understand is all the dings for the 'packaging'???  There is nothing wrong with the packaging at all.  It is true that each disk is not in its own personal container, but so what?  Each season is in its own box, one that fits well on the shelf with other DVD/Blue-Ray packages.  Each disk is in its own individual sleeve section within the box; and can be easily removed without disturbing or rubbing against the other disks.  As long as you don't take the sleeve unit out of a box, no problem.    So, don't let the 'package-fanatics' scare you away from getting this wonderful series.
1591843162|4.0|A linchpin is someone that does art, not work. Linchpins pour themselves into what they do--regardless if they are waiters, managers, airline attendants or accountants.  Because so few people make this emotional investment, linchpins are very scarce, and therefore invaluable and indispensable.<br /><br />One sour point--Godin fails (miserably) when he attempts explanations of why so few people pour themselves into their work.  Godin casts a confusing, contradictory blame on everything from the industrial revolution to evolution, wasting nearly a hundred pages on a poorly-constructed argument of why things are broken--not how to fix it.<br /><br />However, Godin redeems himself masterfully with the definition of art as \\"the intentional act of using your humanity to create a change in another person\\".  The author gives details, examples, and lists of attributes that a Linchpin must have. Godin's passion for making others into linchpins shines throughout the book--a book that he rightly sees as his \\"gift\\"  to us.

0451529308|5.0|I inherited my mother's copy of \\"Little Women\\" when I was young, but always had a bit of trouble reading it. It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!<br /><br />So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.<br /><br />Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequels [[ASIN:B000CDRAVM Little Men]] and [[ASIN:B000RKT0Q8 Jo's Boys]], covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.<br /><br />Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.<br /><br />It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan's [[ASIN:1853264687 Pilgrim's Progress]], a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.<br /><br />Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.<br /><br />On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.<br /><br />Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.<br /><br />As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.<br /><br />Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.<br /><br />There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo:  \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.<br /><br />But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:<br /><br />\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"<br /><br />So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.<br /><br />The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it.pected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.    There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo:  \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.     But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundatedwith letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:    \\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her.

B00361CAEE|4.0|A mildly entertaining sneak peak behind the scenes of the creation of Vogue's biggest issue (up until that date), the September issue 2007.  Viewers meet the cast of characters, namely Ann Wintour, Grace Connington, Andre Leon Talley, Sally Singer and all the other fashion forward and journalists, who put together one of the world's most popular magazines, considered to be the beacon of women's fashion.<br /><br />Wintour, who has gained a reputation as being icy reveals a slightly more personal side, without actually getting personal. This makes sense since the documentary is about the magazine she has successfully lead since the late 80's.  You definitely get the feel that the Vogue staff work hard in putting together each issue from start to finish, and that  Wintour's reputation as the Queen of Fashion is well deserved.  I cannot say the documentary is great, but I firmly enjoyed it and for those that happen to be fans of fashion I think you will enjoy it as well.
0743298039|1.0|I had to read this book for my college reading class.  I think it was one of the wrose books the school could have picked for us to read.  The book is badly written and should have never printed.  If I thougth it would help I would ask for my money back.  I don't know how old Margaret or Vida are.  I don't know what time period this story takes place in. I think the story lines are very odd and boring.  The only reason the book is this long is because the writer doesn't know how to make a point quickly.
B00333NCTM|5.0|Ok, this was one of the funniest, craziest,saddest books that I've read. I don't think I've laughed so hard while reading. Reading the words and imagining them coming out of Ozzy's mouth was a constant crackup. I would recommend this book even to people who aren't Ozzy fans just because of how interesting the story is. Its incredible to try to imagine how someone could endure so much madness.
1439175640|1.0|I ordered this book from Amazon because of the rave reviews. Everything I have tried from this book is not worth feeding to my dog and I end up throwing it in the trash. I have made 3 things from this book the Coconut Layer Cake had a strange taste when I say strange I mean NOT GOOD. The Lemon Layer Cake was one of the worst cakes I have ever tasted, the lemon buttercream icing calls for 8 CUPS OF POWDERED SUGAR!!!  The Traditional Vanilla Birthday Cake was dry as a bone. I would not recommend anyone waste money on this book. BTW, I have a home based bakery & everything I make is amazingly delicious, so I know how to cook and I followed each recipe to a T. The recipies still turned out bad.If these are the recipies The Magnolia Bakery uses they would be OUT OF BUSINESS!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout. The first couple of times it took some getting used to but it gets easier each day you do it. Your endurance will increase. Jillian really pushes you. It's like she's in the room with you motivating you to reach your goals. It consist of 3 20 minute workouts. I've done 20 minute workouts before and never have felt like I worked out enough. I've done 45 minutes of cardio on other workout dvd's and still felt like it was a waste(too many breaks). Jillian's workout makes use of every minute by combining strength, cardio and abs. After I'm done with one of her 20 minutes I feel like I've really accomplished something(breathless and covered in sweat). Once you start a workout - it's over before you know it. Keep in mind she's has personally trained 400 lb people so if they can do it so can you. I highly recommend this dvd.
1591795230|5.0|This was a wonderful explanation of how our bodies work, how cells do what they do, how the intelligence in life-forms animates itself.  I learned so much about the mechanics of the human body right down to a cellular and atomic level, all of which strongly reinforced many of my spiritual beliefs.  Lipton takes the woo-woo out of the spiritual side of life and explains it in a way that makes sense to those of us who need more than an admonition to \\"take it on faith\\".  I bought the audio version so I can listen to it over and over in the car (it takes me a while to grok the intricacies of the science) and am so glad I did. The author reads the book himself and is compelling in his presentation.    I did think it fell apart a bit at the end where I expected more than a couple of sentences on how to use the information, but he does give further resources for those of us interested in pursuing it further.
B001E57SH8|3.0|I bought this lighter based on my experience with the original Zippo lighter and the lifetime warranty.  I wanted a butane version that wouldn't foul cigars.<br /><br />Initially, I experienced inconsistent butane fuel discharge and was very disappointed.  The gas flow would range from strong to unusably low.  However, after a couple of butane refills, the issue has disappeared.  I think that it is related to incorrect or incomplete butane filling since I have noticed as the fuel level drops below the halfway mark, the issue resurfaces somewhat.  In other words, keep the lighter full for a strong flow!<br /><br />I highly recommend that you follow the instructions carefully and completely to ensure that you are filling it properly and fully.  Be aware that it may take some time to \\"break in\\" before it works well.  Remember to hold down the flint wheel to release the butane before sparking the flint!<br /><br />However, I find the price a little steep, especially considering the inconsistent performance.  It's definitely not like the Zippos of old!

B002N8A14M|5.0|Most of the time, I carry around my Nano in my pocket. I went with the hard plastic case because I didn't want it to stick to the pocket, and I haven't been disappointed (the clip can be removed, despite what @Jess says in her review - I used a small flat-head screwdriver with a little bit of effort). I haven't yet tested out the armband.    Unlike @CK1, I have had no problems connecting earbuds or other audio wires into the Nano with the case on.
B0015HOFZI|3.0|My rating mainly relates to the Sound Forge Audio Studio software, although the first turntable worked for a while (after I solved the problems of installing the audio device in a way that didn't conflict with the audio device in my Dell laptop, and the problem of getting the sound monitored while recording), but then it ceased sending any signals to the computer.  I returned it to Amazon with no questions and was sent a replacement which is still working, more or less.  The remaining problem is that I can make a sound file, lable the file and the tracks, but I can't save any of those: the file or the written lables.  The Sound Forge tutorial is variable. Some functions are easy to master with the wizard, and others are so obtuse as to be useless. I haven't given up, but getting support from Sony consumes most of a working day - even if it doesn't help. I can, however, play the sound files that I was able to record, restore and save, and they sound great.  I haven't mastered a way to put these on a CD that I can play in my car or on a player.  I see little help in solving that problem if, indeed,  I get to it!

B002HWBS96|5.0|This DVD, complete with \\"extra\\" footage, pleased a group of high school students in a session I facilitated.  Much was made of the use of mirrors as a part of the revealing of the positon that Baron Ochs finds himself in.  Despite critics of this use of mirrors and the supposed weakness of the French soprano, the final scene, famous as a highlight of all of opera, is more than given its due.  One of the few times I have cried in the theatre.
0763637084|5.0|Wow, my children love Charlie and Lola, and it doesn't get much better than this pop-up book for them.  They love the character & their british accents & I try to (sort-of) mimic them with I read the book.  Add to that Lola's quirky personality as she lists off all the foods she will not eat, and then throw in pop-up, 3-d creations of Charlie's imaginative re-creation of mundane table food and they beg for this book alllllll the time.
0393075966|5.0|A horrifying account of how market systems can fail. Very clear presentation for non-economists. Technique of description in plain language, with copious explanatory chapter notes at the end of the book works very well. The notes give technical details of and/or background to points made in the chapter. There are 62 pages of notes for 297 pages of text. This keeps the flow moving clearly, without distraction by getting into detail for those who do not understand it. But the detail is there if you want it.
B00006SKRX|5.0|What's that you say?  You need more than the genius behind Pink Floyd with Old Slowhand on lead guitar to convince you of the greatness of this album?  How about this: The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking (which a concept album about a 45-minute long sexually charged dream) has a musical intensity, energy, and raw sexuality that is not present anywhere else in the Roger Waters/Pink Floyd corpus, the contents of which is, to be honest, rather dreary in comparison.  Plus on the title song, it has Jack Palance as a biker breaking the narrator's hand followed by Yoko Ono telling him to commit suicide.  This album is one-of-a-kind!
B001GCUO5M|3.0|Two Federal Marshalls (Leonardo DiCaprio and Mark Ruffalo) travel to a spooky penal institute on a desolate island to investigate the disappearance of a prisoner.    It's very hard to write about the plot of this film in any detail without spoiling it.  Suffice to say that I was engrossed by the masterful direction (Martin Scorsese), the intriguing setting, and the magnificent cast (which includes Ben Kingsley and the always delightful Max Von Sydow).  However, I also felt that the film did not play fair with me.  Early scenes set the stage in such a way that I felt cheated by certain revelations that came later.  While those revelations did give an added dimensions to some plot points that had seemed incongruous, they also seemed to open some holes in other respects.  I will probably watch this film again someday, and it may very well improve on a second viewing.  At that time, I may find myself wishing that the editing feature on Amazon reviews allowed us to change our star ratings.
B00000AOUD|5.0|Not only does this Thick as a Brick mock other more serious concept albums lyrically, but it also mocks every other contemporary album musically!  It is a rebellion against the modern Idea of the Song and the Album in general as being an unconnected collection of songs.  There are no real tracks and the entire concerto is based on the progression of a simple musical theme.   It is, in fact, the modern paradigm of what classical composers referred to as \\"variations on a theme\\".  Leave it to the genius of Ian Anderson to let a riff run wild and take on a life of its own!  It is possibly the most experimental and yet musically palatable album out there.  It is energetic, funny, epic, and at times, even sweet.  And who doesn't love flute solos?  As an added bonus, there is a live performance on this release featuring some of the highlights of the album.    That being said, this album is very hard to listen to casually and it is certainly not for everybody, but you should definitely give it a chance, especially if you are a musician or songwriter.  Make sure you get a copy of the mock newspaper that is featured on the cover (in this release, it is the bulk of the CD-booklet so no worries there) since there are some jokes in that paper that are referenced by the lyrics.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Did the people that designed the box set ever own one? The outer casing is cool looking and good for display but can't sit up right when you remove the actual box set. Then you have to either shove you fingers into the box, which is only open from the top, to extract the DVD case which is just clear plastic DVD holders taped together-lame. Oh yeah, and if you turn the box sideways to get the DVDs out then its possible that the nice quality but unnessary shiney slippery plastic cards will fall out. On to the actually DVDs, they are blank on the top-huh and why? I would say that to cut corners they had all the DVDs made at Bubba's DVD Burning Barn but then why the nice quality plastic cards? These cards simply tell which episodes are on what disc, WHICH really should just be on top of the actual DVD like it usually is (there is a reason why most DVDs are made like that). And regarding the box you have to dig into to get the DVDs out. This could have just been done book style, cardboard front/back and attach the plastic holders inside so that you can just take it out of the outer plastic shell and just open it up.   ANYWAYS enough of that rant. I love the show and the new effects they added, like when the ship is moving in space. It all looks clean and I'm over the bad packaging. It's just that I was digging into Season 2 today and was trying to find what disc I was on and had to find what episode I had watched last on the silly cards instead of it just being on the front of the DVD.   AND I'm only ranting in case the people that produce these things ever read the reviews so they know what the people appreciate and what they do not :D
B000001EAQ|5.0|I cannot understand why everybody hates this fantastic album so much. I got it with Zooropa and Achtung Baby the other day, and I mus say that while AB is the best U2 record bar none and Zooropa is fantastic, this is an amazing album that is unfairly hated and harshly criticized. I can see why though; this was released in 97, and was two decades ahead of its time. People were too used to the same U2 that brought us I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and Sunday Bloody Sunday. U2 changed their direction with Zooropa, which did sort of shocked fans.<br /><br />Cut to 4 years later, in 1997. U2 was about to go on the extravagant \\"PopMart\\" tour, their satire on commercialism, and was about to release the unexpected \\"Pop\\". And it was harshly hated, even by U2 fans. But I just listened to it and it's a freaking amazing CD.<br /><br />\\"Discotheque\\" stars off the album and gets you in the party mood. It makes you wanna dance, it's very catchy and yet very intense at the same time. After an excellent track \\"Do You Feel loved\\", we get the album's best track: \\"Mofo\\". \\"Mofo\\" (short for \\"motherf--ker\\") is a dark techno song that shows how truly diverse U2 are. This song opened every show on the PopMart tour; I am not surprised. It even sounds great on their (amazing) Live DVD entitled \\"PopMart Live from Mexico City\\". Another great one is \\"Staring at the Sun\\", an awesome song about how we carelessly destroy the world with our stupidity, yet completely ignore it. It also holds quite a notoriety for the opening nightof the Popmart tour in Las Vegas, where Bono threw the band off and yet the band had to restart the song (footage of this can be seen on disc 2 of the Popmart DVD). It's a chill, laid back song that is a total keeper.<br /><br />\\"Miami\\" and \\"Playboy Mansion\\" are great, tongue in cheek rockers. \\"If You Wear That Velvet Dress\\" is a great song that holds a special place in my heart as it was the first U2 song I ever heard. It's a beautiful song that is an example of how amazing U2 are as an ensemble. Only two songs on here pass as filler, \\"If God Will Send His Angels\\" and \\"Please\\", but other than that, this is an excellent album that I recommend greatly. Do NOT listen to the critics, just listen to the album and decide for yourself!n ensemble.

B002T9H2L0|2.0|Something between \\"To Be Or Not To Be\\", \\"Batman,\\" and \\"The Dirty Dozen,\\" but that is to place this film in company that is way too good for it.  [I would especially apologize to Ernst Lubitsch].<br /><br />Tarantino has obviously made some fine films (\\"Pulp Fiction\\" might even be great).  But his monstrous ego appears to have led him to believe that he is to filmmaking what Bob Feller was to pitching, when he's actually more like Dick Radatz.  Radatz had a few good seasons for the Red Sox, and could throw hard, but he didn't last.  Unlike Radatz, however,  Tarantino doesn't seem to realize that being on the mound in a well-tailored uniform is not the same as pitching a good game.<br /><br />A better medium for \\"Inglourious Basterds\\" would have been a comic book.
B001JNNDBA|3.0|I know this movie is a \\"cult classic,\\" and has gotten a lot of good reviews and all, but I just didn't quite get exactly what the message was supposed to be.  It was interesting, and well acted, but the ending was just downright disappointing and left you with a \\"what was that\\" kind of feeling.  The best part of this movie, by far, was the soundtrack.  I would say rent this movie if you want to see what all of the hype is about, but I would not recommend buying it.

This season we're treated to episodes where Sheldon's fawned after (and apparently in a relationship) with a graduate student; the wrecking effect Leonard's mother has on everyone but Sheldon; Penny's fear that she's not smart enough to date Leonard, and more.  If you haven't seen this season yet, check it out.  You won't regret it!      The box set contains four DVDs, and extras, such as a blooper reel, and interviews with the cast.  A must have for any fan!

B002ZTIIXK|3.0|k.d. lang has a beautiful voice. What the producers of Recollection seemingly forgot is that she is also a superb songwriter. Filling 50% of an already abbreviated collection with covers and padding the rest with obscure soundtrack contributions and duets skews the perception of just how k.d. lang spent her commercial peak in the 1990s and early 2000s on Sire/Warner Bros. Records.    The release of Reintarnation in 2006, representing her earlier, \\"punk cowgirl\\" era, allowed for this second retrospective to focus on the expanse of her singles output beginning with 1992's \\"Constant Craving\\", when k.d. became a visible and outspoken pop culture icon possessing an exceptional singing voice and accomplished songwriting skills.    Perhaps now all involved would rather forget that the better part of a decade was then spent courting pop radio and the higher reaches of the charts with deserving but ultimately under performing singles. Regardless, the fact remains that the excellent albums Ingenue, Even Cowgirls Get The Blues, All You Can Eat, Drag and Invincible Summer were heavily promoted to the pop public with many of the best songs from these releases serviced as singles to radio stations, video networks and clubs.    Yes, \\"Constant Craving,\\" \\"Miss Chatelaine,\\" \\"Summerfling\\" and \\"You're OK\\" are included on Recollection. \\"Sexuality\\" also appears, though inexplicably only on the rarities disc of the Deluxe Version. But where are the rest of her original pop singles?    \\"If I Were You,\\"  \\"The Consequences Of Falling,\\" \\"Anywhere But Here,\\" \\"Lifted By Love,\\" \\"The Mind Of Love (Where Is Your Head Kathryn?),\\"\\"Just Keep Me Moving,\\" \\"Simple\\" and others are shut out in favor of 2 versions of \\"Hallelujah\\", a live duet with Tony Bennett and six other soundtrack or 'various artists' contributions... most of which certainly belonged instead on the rarities disc.    With the surplus of cover recordings included on Recollection, what exactly are we to recall? k.d., the \\"song stylist\\"? That is only a small --and perhaps the least interesting-- facet of this particular artist.    A more ideal collection would have consisted of one lengthier disc (16+ songs) of original singles, plus the great new recording \\"Beautifully Combined\\"; a second disc including covers and other album highlights; a third disc of TRUE rarities collecting the aforementioned soundtrack and VA cuts; and finally a COMPLETE, chronological DVD video collection.    As it stands, the k.d. lang I and many others have enjoyed for 20 years is barely visible on Recollection.

1596912863|5.0|This book was fun for me as a Jane Austen fan who adores Pride and Prejudice. Jane is given the opportunity to experience Regency England at a full immersion resort in England I enjoyed the premise of the book and Jane's foray into the Regency England experience.  I laughed at the rules and some of the ridiculous situations that occurred between the modern day and period experiences, but admit that I would have a secret desire to do this myself. The older woman pretending to be a young ingenue was hilarious! I thought it was clever how the resort planned for guests staying in character and those who fell out of character.  The ending was fun and I liked how their were some open possibilities.  I really enjoyed this, as an \\"adult\\" novel from Shannon Hale, although I have always disliked classifying some of her other novels as \\"young adult\\" when they are wonderful books for anyone.
B001PO53IO|5.0|I saw \\"The Clone Wars\\" movie on Blu-Ray and I enjoyed it.  I then purchased this set also on Blu-Ray and I was hooked on the TV program.  The mini documentaries for each episode are excellent and entertaining.  I love having multiple audio tracks in alternate languages with their corresponding subtitles.  I love the scene from episode 1 where Yoda teaches the clones about their individuality. I watched that scene five times in all the languages!  It is a beautiful scene reminiscent of the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\".  I love having two Spanish audio tracks; the original Castellano is SO COOL!!
B002K0WBYG|3.0|You know, Sandra Bullock can make even a mediocre movie like this one enjoyable.  But it's a bittersweet enjoyment watching her in a half hearted comedy like this, while waiting for the next `interesting' role to come along.  Bullock plays the uptight and unpleasant, but high flying editor of a New York based book firm, and Ryan Reynolds her long suffering assistant who actually is a nice guy with his own quietly held ambitions.  Her character is Canadian, and when (in an unlikely twist) Immigration come calling to deport her, on the spur of the moment she enlists her assistant.. to marry her.  However, this then involves a trip to Alaska to convince the Immigration authorities their sudden love is genuine.   The Alaskan scenery is gorgeous, and the cast believable - but come across as uninspired by the material.  On the plus side we have his relatives in Alaska, particularly the good value Betty White (Golden Girls) as his grandmother.  Then there's Bullock, who can do these in her sleep.  On the down side, the plot is both predictable and hard to believe (aside from the unlikely Immigration Officer, there's the eagle carrying away the dog, the Mother Earth grandma chants, not to mention the resolution).  It's one of those movies you watch with a faint smile crossing your face now and again, and afterwards you remember it had a few funny moments...  but that's about the extent of the impact it has, mostly because it takes too long to show any likeable side to either of the characters, so that in the end the will-they won't-they aspect hardly matters.  All you're left with then is the humour from the various fish-out-of-water gags as Bullock's high heeled cosmopolitan comes to terms with the wilderness and what it means to have a real family.  If harmless rom-com with no brain engaged, but perhaps some nice scenery is what you're after, then by all means rent.. but this is really quite disposable fluff, devoid of the chemistry or `je ne sais quois' that makes thesethings truly sparkle.  Scrapes a pass mark, but only if you're a Bullock fan, and even then only because the Alaskan scenery was nice.
B001IUBZAU|4.0|AC/DC hasn't lost their grind or their groove.      An excellent CD that you can listen to out of the case from the first song until the last without skipping a track.    It's that good!
B00319ECHE|5.0|I've had to get into so many other bands after Fear Factory released Digimortal it's ridiculous. Mnemic, Sybreed, Meshuggah, and even a little Static-X have all entertained my want for industrial flavored metal while i waited for FF to come back and make a good CD. This is the CD I've been waiting for. It has all the intensity of Demanufacture with the melodic underside of Obsolete. The songs here are well written, even a little unorthodox at times. Mechanize is an album that Fear Factory wrote to express their belief of the world around us. Politics, religion, and social issues seem to be the abundant subject of most songs here. Whereas Demanufacture and Obsolete dealt with an industrial world where machine rule, Mechanize seems to pick up where Digimortal left of, talking about the world around us being the world they predicted almost 15 years ago. The songs musically are great, all of them are heavy, intense and full of masterful songwriting that you've come to expect from FF. If you make one good purchase this year, I promise you it will be this one.     FEAR IS YOUR GOD !!!!!

B002TYZKIM|5.0|Most of what I would say has already been said better by others.  I just had two things to add.  First, this was not an old man, over the hill or tired.  This was a vital, talented man still doing things that no one else has done.    The only negative that I had about this DVD was the \\"documentary\\" on President Obama at the start of the DVD.  What ever your opinion of our President, I do not think it is appropriate to include a political add in a venue as non political as a Michael Jackson DVD.    Consider the Walmart version which has additional content but does not have this added clip.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|After a ten years hiatus, Sade Adu follows \\"Lovers Rock\\" album with a mellow & jazzy, \\"Soldier Of Love\\". It was always going to be tough to follow up the upbeat & almost perfect 2000 release, \\"Lovers Rock\\". However, despite going jazzy, Sade is still sharp & in control. The jazzy feel is well enfused with melodic guitar riffs & piano sounds but her singing is as distinct as ever.  Favourites tracks include, \\"Soldier Of Love\\" (title track), \\"Babyfather\\", \\"Be That Easy\\", \\"In Another Time\\" and \\"Safest Place\\". Sade  goes jazzy, but manages to pull through successfully though with a few little bruises though. Sade Adu rocks jazz!
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Here we have Triangle. A fantastic movie! I was blown away by how interesting and textured this adventure was. It's not quite what you think.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and DON'T READ the plot or ending. Knowing only deprives you of a fantastic and surprising experience!<br /><br />I'm not one to boast or promote movies, especially with how many of them SUCK, but I'm on here to tell you that you NEED TO SEE THIS!<br /><br />I was thrilled to see that so much care and work went into a project like this. You can tell this was a labor of love for both cast and crew.<br /><br />I don't suggest or recommend films much, so you can be assured this one is a winner!<br /><br />Kudos to the makers of Triangle!<br /><br />5 stars! Highly recommended!
143350393X|5.0|I have just received my ESV Study Bible, and I am amazed at its quality, accuracy, and extensive breadth of information on Scripture and Biblical history.  I enjoy that the ESV translation is faithful to the original Greek, and I appreciate its clarity.  As a relatively young Christian, having been baptized just over a year ago, this Bible is great for offering additional insight for tricky passages, and all of the maps and illustration establishes the historical context of each book.  I am more than satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend this Bible to anyone wishing to further delve into the Word.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|This adaption of Elizabeth Gaskell's classic novel far outweighs any BBC film I've seen to date. It is beautifully shot and acted. Richard Armitage who plays the leading man does a beautiful job and playing the responsible and brooding John Thornton. (I like him better than Colin Firth's, Mr. Darcy!!)<br /><br />This movie is a moving love story which also interweaves the industrial revolution in Northern England during the 1800's. I could watch the very end of the movie again and again! Great ending!<br /><br />My mother & sister did not like it. They said it was too \\"dark\\". The movie is flimed with many \\"gray\\" scenes being the cotton mills and surrounding area, always cloudy and rainy, etc. Not the most romantic of settings however the love story will haunt you. I highly recommend owning this film.
B002OHB3CG|4.0|This album is absolutely brilliant. I'm 55 years old, have seen more concerts than I can name,and have been listening to rock genre for 40 years. I have to say that this band really impresses me on many levels. Their amplified work is exceptional; and this acoustic concert is just magnificent. I only hope to see them in the United States soon. Here in the U.S. they are no where near as popular as over in Europe. PLEASE TRAVEL HERE!
B000002G23|5.0|Message In A Box: The Complete Recordings (1993) contains every song The Police ever recorded.  Well, almost every song.  A few years later some odds and ends were discovered, so this set probably contains 97% of their material.<br /><br />This set has 4 discs, with Disc 1 being their earliest material and Disc 4 being their last material.  All the classics are on this set (of course).  Songs like Message In A Bottle, Every Breath You Take, Spirits In The Material World, Walking On The Moon, Roxanne, Invisible Sun, Synchronicity II, King Of Pain, etc.<br /><br />My personal favorite disc on this set is Disc 3 because it contains my favorite Police album, Ghost In The Machine (1981).  I think this album had their best music.  Songs like Secret Journey, Darkness, Too Much Information, Rehumanize Yourself, Demolition Man, and Omegaman are somewhat unknown classics.<br /><br />This set of course contains their massive hit album Synchronicity (1983).  Songs like Every Breath You Take, King Of Pain, Wrapped Around Your Finger, Synchronicity II, etc.  My personal favorite from this album is Walking In Your Footsteps.<br /><br />If you want THE Police compilation, get this set.  Highly recommended.
B001NESPHC|5.0|I just happen to have been watching \\"Sunday Morning\\" with Charles Osgood a few weeks ago while I was getting dressed.  I heard Anthony Mason talking to a singer I did not recognize. The interview was so riveting I stopped to watch this singer. When I heard her voice I was mesmerized!!!  I immediately ordered two copies of her latest album, one to share with my brother who introduced me to jazz but had not heard a lot about this singer.  When I finally received it after the first shipment was damaged, I played it over and over and over. I took it on the road with me and listened to it over and over during my 1800 mile road trip.  I totally \\"LOVE\\" Melody Gardot!!!!!!

B0000041CZ|3.0|If you want an x-ray, black and white WTC, this is as good as any.    On the other hand, last time I checked, Bach was a living, breathing human being as well as the sublimest of musicians, and there's none of that to be found here. The performance is neurotic in the extreme, and the recording is boxy, shallow, thin and nasal, requiring considerable bass boost to bring the hands into balance. Lots of hammers, not a lot of strings, surprising for Philips. I chalk it up to the influence of the Gould recordings.    Anyway, if you'd like this music in color instead of black and white, go straight past Richter or Schiff to the superlative Samuel Feinberg set, available from Amazon.com. A little flesh and blood doesn't hurt this music at all.

B00003CXMG|5.0|Almost Famous is the world of early 70's Rock `n' Roll when that first flash of the classic rock era had passed. Rock was settling into becoming a business, but still was young enough and still had a sense of innocence about itself that William Miller (Patrick Fugit) an overachieving, yet awkward teenager can be taken seriously as a rock writer, and be assigned by Rolling Stone to tour with and write about an up and coming band. Almost Famous is also my story. An innocent drawn to a world that looks glamorous to him and where he thinks and he'll be cool. It's the story of everyone's innocence of their teenage years.<br /><br />Almost Famous is based on writer/director Cameron Crowe's own experiences. William wants to fit in and his innocence is palpable and real. On his assignment from Rolling Stone to follow the fictional band Stillwater, he finds himself locked out of the Rock `n' Roll world he worships and wishes to be a part of. Even the girls his age, the Band-aids, leave him standing on the outside. The Band-aids lead by Penny Lane (Kate Hudson), don't consider themselves groupies but more like muses for the bands, but are much more learned and experienced than William . It takes the late arrival of his favorite band Stillwater to gain him access to the Rock `n' Roll world he seeks. When William walks into that first concert he is awkward, shy, doesn't know anyone or anything about that world. By the end of the concert he's so caught up in the rush and excitement, he's shouting knowing goodbyes to the bands and roadies. William seeking to be cool he tries to impress Stillwater guitarist Russell Hammond (Billy Crudup) by introducing him to Penny without knowing they have a history. Director Crowe really hits the nail on the head with William's feelings and experience.<br /><br />William's innocence continually betrays him. When he goes to L.A. with Penny, she goes off with Russell. William follows them only to discover them making out. You can see it William's face, he's crushed. He likes Penny but doesn't think someone as glamorous and sophisticated as her would be interested in him. Russell betrays William by promising an interview that never seems to happen. Stillwater betrays William. They befriend him hoping he'll write a favorable article of them for Rolling Stone, but when Rolling Stone verifies William's truthful story, the band disavows it.<br /><br />While William's innocence betrays him he never abandons it. That theme shows itself again and again during the movie. Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Lester Bangs tells William that rock is in it's death rattle since rock has started to become a business. The rock stars portrayed in Almost Famous espouse this, notably lead singer of Stillwater Jeff Beebe (Jason Lee). If one the band's fans could save the world, \\"it means rock can save the world!\\"<br /><br />Frances McDormand as William's sincerely concerned but beleagured mother who fears she`s pushing her children away, William and daughter (Zooey Deschannel) and leads to unintentionally funny moments in her life such as when she tells a group of students \\"my son has been kidnapped by rock stars!\\" Or that Simon and Garfunkle are poets of drugs and promiscuous sex. Jimmy Fallon is almost unrecognizable as Dennis Hope the professional manager who takes over guiding Stillwater through the hazards of Rock `n' Roll. The casting of Almost Famous lives up to the title of the movie. Almost everyone in it was on the cusp of becoming stars or at the beginning of their careers.<br /><br />By the end of the tour William, who has seen and experienced more than he ever thought he could, and even understands the world better than Penny emerges with his innocence intact. He reunites his mother and sister, and when Russell shows up at William's house, William is still willing and able to get the interview from Russell that he always wanted. Even Russell and the band redeem themselves. Russell calls Rolling Stone and tells them William'sstory is true, and Stillwater rediscovers the innocence and joy of creating music when they step back from the high power business of Rock `n' Roll and go back to their roots of playing smaller venues.<br /><br />Crowe hits all the right notes in characterization and the times. Everyone seems perfect for their roles and they're delivered with sincerity that most viewers can identify with. The 70's are realistically evoked from the burbling of a bong to a light organ in a fan's bedroom. Almost Famous has a complexity in characters and plot rarely seen in movies. It's truly a movie where everything comes to together to make a near flawlessly executed film.rs the innocence and joy of creating music when they step back from the high power business of Rock `n' Roll and go back to their roots of playing smaller venues.

9626344369|5.0|PERSUASION, Jane Austen's last completed novel was written between 1815 and 1816, with final chapter revisions in August of that year. Published posthumously in late 1817 with her earlier work NORTHANGER ABBEY, each of the novels represents the alpha and omega of her writing career. Even though they are divergent in tone and topic, they each share a commonality in being partially set in Bath and display Austen's trademark play on social strata, money and courtship. Austen finished the manuscript of PERSUASION in declining health which may account for its slim size in comparison to her heftier previous efforts MANSFIELD PARK (1814) and EMMA (1816). Or, quite possibly it is exactly the length that she preferred for her story, allowing for a simpler plot and focus on fewer characters. Its size in no way diminishes it value. Some scholars consider it her finest achievement and readers have long cherished it for its jab at social mobility and moving love story.<br /><br />In 1817 Austen wrote to her niece Fanny Austen Knight in her usual ironic manner, \\"You may perhaps like the heroine, as she is almost too good for me.\\" At age 27, Anne is not your typical Austen heroine. The middle daughter of Sir Walter Elliot she is from a distinguished family of a landed Baronet. Her vain father takes their aristocratic ancestry and social position very seriously and expects his three daughters to make prominent matches. Quiet, reserved and not as pretty as her father values, Anne is often overlooked and her opinions dismissed by her family; \\"but Anne ... was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight; her convenience was always to give way -- she was only Anne.\\"  Eight years prior Anne met and fell in love with a young naval officer Frederick Wentworth. Because he did not match her social and financial status, Anne was persuaded by a well meaning family friend to reject his marriage proposal. Wentworth returned to sea and forgets her. Anne never forgets him and remains unmarried. When he returns eight years later a wealthy and successful naval hero he reenters her social sphere with heightened status. On the other hand, Sir Walter's extravagant lifestyle has out paced his income to the point of serious debt and the family must retrench, let Kellynch Hall and remove to Bath. As Anne watches the younger ladies of the neighborhood swoon and play for Captain Wentworth's affections she is painfully aware of her lost bloom of youth, deeply regrets her decision and pensively longs for his favor until a tragic accident at Lyme Regis and events in Bath renew her hopes.<br /><br />In yet another brilliant reading of a Jane Austen classic novel, British actress Juliet Stevenson interprets Austen's poignant story of fidelity and second chances with wry humor and sensitive pathos. Her depth of characterization is remarkable and I am never in doubt that she is relaying Austen's intension faithfully. Those who have previously read the novel will find new enjoyment in this beautifully produced audiobook and those new to Austen's masterpiece will be treated to an unabridged eight hours and forty three minutes of pure perfection. Such equal blending of masterful story and artistic integrity is rarely encountered and I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Laurel Ann, Austenprosearried.

B0018RWMNM|5.0|Having watched LD countless times since it first came out ( not to mention reading the book twice) I didn't think there was any way it could be improved on. But when the remastered, Bluray, 5.1 came out, I jumped. Glad I did. It's like watching it for the first time again. Great transfer and audio. Worth the purchase price.
B0002FR07O|5.0|I know that Porcupine Tree have released a lot of strong albums since this, with FOABP and The Incident being amazing albums.  Having said that I think this is my favourite PT release.  This is where I started my PT listening journey, as it were.  The music is often very moody, with less driven guitars than a lot of later material.  Still, there is a lot of PT trademarks here, Steven Wilson's sense of melody as well as his vocals being prime examples of this.  Off the official recording, my standout tracks would be Waiting phase I/II, Sever and Dark Matter.    The second CD, Insignificance, is obviously a bit more stripped back, less vocals, and less of a sense of the layers meshing quite as strongly.  Standout track to my ears would be Sever tomorrow.    Obviously I rate this CD highly, but would I recommend it?  If you are an existing PT fan and have only heard/liked the later heavier stuff, I would find it hard to recommend without reservation, I would say give it a listen first, as although it may grow on you, it is moodier, spacier in some ways and more atmospheric than later stuff, which a lot of people do not prefer.  But, by all means, you should at least give this a listen, for it may surprise you.
B002GMNLKQ|5.0|Not to be outdone on my last mediocre review of an Insomnium album, I'm writing a review for this one too!  For some reason, Insomnium albums always start out so-so for me, and the more I listen to them, the more I love them.  The clean vocals on this one were a bit of surprise, but they totally work.  Insomnium delivers on this, and they write really catchy, listenable stuff.  I'm surprised these guys are not more popular than they are!
0786852550|5.0|This book can be a little off-putting due to the brand of magic that it creates.  It is definitely darker than some of the other popular series and I would be hesitant recommending it for younger children.  However, for young adults (and adults of all ages), it is an extremely enjoyable story.  What I most enjoyed was the incredibly dry wit of Bartimaeus, and while some have critiqued the footnotes, I adored them. It is a great example of a book which, if read with an open mind, may lead to philosophical or introspective thought on a higher order than the story itself (though don't let that frighten you away, its optional). I found myself aligning far more with the summoned \\"demons\\" than with the humans in the book.  Anytime an author can create that scenario I think it points to an engaging book with at least one exceptional character, in this case Bartimaeus himself.  I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy.
B001PJRAUS|5.0|If you've read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a hundred times and watched Colin Firth over and over in the BBC production, you'll probably love LOST IN AUSTEN.  The story takes unexpected turns when a modern-day woman steps into the fictional Bennet household through a mysterious portal, and protagonist Elizabeth Bennet steps into the present day.  Will things progress as the novel is written?  Our plucky heroine makes every attempt to put things right but her very presence assures that things will go wildly wrong.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This is a review of the blu ray format.  This is a great version of the classic, and they have cleaned up the product quite a bit from the television that is aired each year.  There are two versions included.  One is the classical black and white version, and the other is a color version.  I know what you are thinking, a color version??  Yes.  I did not think this was something worth even viewing as it takes away from the classic feel and original movie.  Boy was I wrong.    I thought the picture was very clean, and the color that was added to the color version was dulled down to look as if it was really part of the original film.  I thought this was very well done, and gave it more of a warm feeling.  Take into consideration though that both versions are still in the 4:3 format.  So you will still have large black bar on the sides.  But I was amazed with how much clearer the picture was than the original TV aired version.  Not to mention the story of this timeless classic.      It is a story that life is not all about the little things that we seem to focus on far to much of these days.  That life is about friends and what you put into the world around you, and about how wonderful life really can be if you take the time to realize it.  This is a great way to preserve this classic movie.  If you have not seen it, do so, or at least watch it on tv!!

0385504225|2.0|I, like most Dan Brown fans, was excited when The Lost Symbol went on sale.  The book started off at a good pace and kept my interest but somewhere around the middle of the book the momentum came to a screeching halt. The book is wrought with pointless bantering back and forth about absolutely nothing. I agree with several other reviewers...Langdon is a useless ninny in this book, whole chapters could have and should have been done away with and the ending was a huge letdown. While I don't expect any writer to crank out a literary masterpiece everytime he/she sits down to write a book, I have to admit I expected more from Mr. Brown.
B00007L4MJ|2.0|Sadly it was not possible to view this classical masterpiece because the dvd had the wrong regioncode ( NTSC in case of PAL, necessary for Europe). Nor Amazon neither me could know this because the box didn't mention the regioncode but the disc did not mention it either. So I could not enjoy it. I cannot return the dvd because I needed to play it to find out the regioncode problem. Something to know when you're living in Europe and want to view Metropolis.

There's enough of it that a \\"radio edit\\" version or \\"clean\\" version of this album should have also been offered. My kids liked \\"boom boom pow\\" when they heard it on the radio, which is one of the main reasons that I bought the album, but I can't play the album version for them because of the profanity...I can't have my 4 and 6 year old repeating the profanity.
1401323820|4.0|This was a really fun read, and if you are a fan of the show Castle, I recommend it! It reminded me of the days when I would read anime fan-fiction online. The parallels between the book and the show are very obvious, right down to the cops working for Nikki Heat and Rook's mother, but for me, it just made it more readable.  The book is fast-paced and you can almost see the movie running in your head. There are even a few unexpected twists. It's no great work of literature, but it is exactly what it should be -- a treat. I wish I knew who \\"Richard Castle\\" actually is, but apparently it's a very well kept secret!

B002WY65W4|5.0|This was not my usual type of movie i would watch, but seeing how woody harelson was in it, I said what the heck. I loved it. Funny, and suspenseful all at once.  Enjoy
B00000JIL1|5.0|Song order is rearranged from the original for no good reason. Tisn't as good as it should be.  Tisn't.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|Two years ago, Depeche Mode was one of the headliners at the Coachella Valley Music Festival.  I was lucky enough to have attended.  As a long time fan, I have most of their recordings, but had yet to see them live.  The concert was nothing short of phenomenal.  This month, DM released their first album of new music in four years.  \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" has finally hit shelves and iTunes; it was worth the wait.<br /> The first single off the album is \\"Wrong\\".  \\"There's something wrong with me chemically/something wrong with me inherently/the wrong mix/in the wrong genes\\" Dave Gahan sings with such conviction that it seems appropriate for the song to be released first.  If you've not seen the video for the song, youtube it, it's a strange, visually compelling piece.<br /> Overall, Gahan's vocals are very close to excellent on this album.  He sounds strong and sure and glad to be singing.  This is Dave Gahan showing vocal ability like he did on 1990's \\"Violator\\" and even 1987's \\"Music for the Masses\\".  There's a couple of tracks that are likely to be the next single, \\"Fragile Tension\\" being one of them and \\"Corrupt\\" being my first choice.  I like the music of \\"Fragile Tension\\", but love the lyrics of \\"Corrupt\\".<br /> There was much brouhaha surrounding Depeche Mode's return to the use of analog synthesizers.  There were many naysayers and doubters spewing negativity at them about it.  Naturally, DM has taken an old instrument and style of music-making and turned it on its ear.  The new record hearkens back to the music of earlier albums like Speak & Spell with the grittiness of Ultra.  Depeche Mode has been together longer now than some of us have been alive, and yet they continue to be relevant.  They are not a dinosaur band that doesn't know it's time for them to retire.<br /> Though the music of this album is dark and moody, lyrically, the songs are positive and practically upbeat, well for Depeche Mode anyway.  Probably my favorite track on the CD is \\"Peace\\".  \\"Peace will come to me/I'm leaving bitterness/behind this time/I'm cleaning out my mind\\".  This song came into my life right at the time when I'm in the process of doing said cleaning in my personal life.  Thus, the song has deeper meaning for me than it may for the just the casual listener or person that only likes the singles of this band.<br /> Ultimately, though, music is an art, and what makes art relevant and wonderful and nourishing to the soul is how the soul responds to it.  I haven't had this stronf of an emotional reaction to an album since Jason Mraz released \\"We Sing, We Dance, We Steal Things\\" last year.  By the way, if you haven't picked up that CD, do so.  It hasn't been out of my CD player or off my iPod since I got it.<br /> What music makes your soul dance?  Is it Ella Fitzgerald scatting all over the place singing \\"A Tisket, A Tasket\\"?  Is it the film soundtrack of \\"Mamma Mia!\\"? Or maybe it's Mozart's piano sonata No. 16.  Whatever it may be is completely subjective.  Some music really moves me, but it's always the lyrics of a song that speak to me, to the James that is james.  Depeche Mode writes lyrics that nourish me, and this album has left me full up.<br />  I hope you'll give this album a listen.  Take a listen to the instrumental track \\"Spacewalker\\".  Maybe it's too 80's sounding for you.  Maybe you'll think it's the perfect modern update of an old sound.  So sayeth DM, \\"With all your superstitions and empty lines/I could be just like you/withdrawn but alive\\".come to me/I'm leaving bitterness/behind this time/I'm cleaning out my mind\\".  This song came into my life right at the time when I'm in the process of doing said cleaning in my personal life.  Thus, the song has deeper meaning for me than it may for the just the casual listener or person that only likes the singles of this band.

B000002H6C|5.0|Better than Master of Puppets. It was a great album but this and Ride the Lightning are their best albums by far.<br />They matured a lot on this album, it's very progressive and complex with some thrash influences. The only Metallica albums that could be consider thrash metal would be Kill 'em All & Ride the Lightning. People didn't like this album because they changed their sound but Master of Puppets is when they made a major change in their sound. Ever since Ride the Lightning they had progressive influences in their music but that's when it really showed. It's also their first album without Cliff Burton (RIP Feb 10 1962-Sept 27 1986) and he's replaced with Jason Newsted and some people said that he didn't do a very good job on bass for this album but most of it was because the production, it was very under-produced. The double bass drums are louder than most of the instruments and there's a minimum amount of bass but besides that they put a lot of effort into it, it's their most accomplished album to date. James Helfield's vocals change a lot and improve, after Ride the Lightning he stopped screaming like it did on that album a little and mostly on Kill 'em All. The overall concept to it is better than on their earlier stuff, it's a little darker too with better lyrics. This still has some influences from Cliff Burton but it has some from Jason Newsted, so it has a good variety. It's their heaviest album to date and it's before they slow their songs down, that happens on The Black Album.

B002HREKCI|5.0|(Some minor spoilers may be in this review. Nothing Amazon doesn't mention though, I think.)<br /><br />First time I've ever read a book like this before - where the characters are just normal, everyday people and nothing supernatural happens. Almost seems pretty boring. This book is anything but. I read the whole thing in about 7 hours and almost could not make myself put it down for the short periods that I had to. The story itself is gripping and it sucks you in from the first pages of the prologue. The main characters (Hannah and Clay) are very easy to relate to and you feel for them in every circumstance as you sit back, like Clay, and helplessly watch a chain of events take someone's life.. There aren't many books out there that can make me cry (in fact, I can only think of two out of the hundreds of books I've ever read), but this one had me sobbing, as well as laughing occasionally, throughout. The theme of the book is heavy, so while I would recommend this novel to everyone, I would also recommend if you're a parent buying for your or any child be sure they are ready for such a vivid tale as this. The message to be mindful of the choices you make everyday is clear, but a life is lost at the end of the story. Even if only between the pages of a book, that may be much for some youngsters.
0446581348|1.0|I decided to purchase this after the rave reviews I read here but I found this book to be a real disappointment. The instruction is extremely generic and too basic: there are no insider tips or in-depth analysis of any kind despite the 221 pages! Some of the featured looks are great, but a lot of the makeup looks somewhat slapdash and gaudy. For example many of the model's eye concealer is too light, so much so that they appear too have white rings underneath their eyes. Some of the eye makeup is seriously questionable as well, with very visible lines of demarcation and very little blending. I was really shocked and I plan to return this item.
B000002UAX|5.0|One can look back at The Beatles albums and find a great collection of work that spans seven consistent years. But if looked at in a introspective way, they become a snapshot of the band's state of mind.        Please Please Me - Help! where the days of the clean, teen, mod-top band. Rubber Soul & Revolver where the pills that opened there minds to what they could do in terms of grand techniques for making a album and Sgt. Pepper was there rocket that took there imagination more higher & more bright, it was an explosion that made everyone aware. Mystery Tour was then the sparkles that floated down & around off of Pepper. Then once all of this excitement ends, then comes the blank out stage...in the form of The White Album.        When people heard Pepper for the first time, the band was at the point where everything on the album was a great leap forward, with The White Album nothing is recognizable. Each member is in his own respected corner for making the type of song he wants in whatever way (which may answer the question of the album's blank cover...there are no boundaries.) This is like a blindfold type of album, you can't see where it's going or where it's coming from, but the experience you hear along the way is amazing yet odd at the same time.         This can also be seen as The Beatles stepping out of sight and becoming a third person view, giving way to the song \\"Glass Onion\\" about there cult as a band, but at the same time disregarding the band as a whole & focusing on what one member wants out of himself. This all adds up to a variety of sounds, to the dance around beat of \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\", camp fire folk sing-a-long of \\"Bungalow Bill\\", the loud roaring sound of \\"Helter Skelter\\" and the non-fan favorite \\"Revolution 9\\", which makes sense to have before a song like \\"Good Night\\". As \\"Revolution 9\\" sounds like a blurry dream that slowly turns into a confusing nightmare, but once it's done with, the rock a bye lullaby of \\"Good Night\\" steps in. Plus, \\"Revolution 9\\" can be shown as the highlight, because more then any other song, it in-bodies the \\"no rules free-for-all\\" spirit of the album.        With the White Album, it presents itself as a body of work that is nothing...but a free roaming net that will catch anything in its path, then it will unconsciously make the best it can with whatever it has...which is what makes the album astounding.
0143038583|5.0|It took me a long time to get through this book, but it was so worth it. Thank you, Michael Pollan, for opening my eyes!
B001MYIXAW|5.0|Just ordered this from Amazon Feb. 23rd and it arrived today from the Amazon Kansas distribution center and it does indeed have the corrected English 'Theatrical' subtitles as evidenced by the inclusion of the word, 'theatrical' in the audio portion of the video/audio specs on the back of the Blu Ray case.    Good luck all!
0425220931|5.0|I picked up this book while browsing through a bookstore, once I picked it up I couldn't put it down. The story is incredible. This book is for the musician who has grown tired of practice & bad gigs. It speaks of the philosophy of music as opposed to a \\"how to\\" book. If you are in a musical rut, this is definitely must have for you.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|I bought this for my son who is a Country music fan. He plays it all the time. I enjoy it too while we're in the car. It would be enjoyed by people who like pop or country.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|If you enjoy classical music you will definitely enjoy this cd. the artist does such a wonderful job at creating a specific mood for each song. If you've seen the movie, you already know that.
1416585710|4.0|I have to say that I really enjoyed this book.    I listened to it on tape so I wasn't as confused by the private language that husband and wife shared as many seemed to be and though the book itself jumped around a lot, in the end, everything tied together in a neat little bundle.  Expect to get through the first 100 pagees in utter confusion before you settle into the rhythm of the book and understand what is truely happening.   As usual with King books, he introduces subplots that aren't relevant to the main plot, but for a change most of these forays off the beaten track eventually thread back into the main storyline.     The book is beautifully written and the characters are nicely developed.  If you have trouble reading it, try listening to it.....the narrators voice only adds to the story.
B002W24E0G|2.0|After his excellent 4 previous cds Curran does a try at 50s rock.Its like The Stray Cats and Little Richard went to the studio after a long speed binge.There is some smokin guitar but some of the vocals sound altered with reverb and echo or are Little Richard style..The songs range from typical 50s rock, some Duane Eddy like sounds, swamp pop, even some Shangri Las feel and a few burning guitar leads. .Too bad he didnt do any Link Wray, Lonnie Mack or other covers as the original material is weak , no real standouts.With better material Curran could have made an exciteing 50s style cd instead of this one.
6305075492|5.0|To watch \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\" will mean more than just sitting do with some popcorn, a beer, and relaxing on the comfy chair. It is an experience. For a film that is 90-years old, it will mentally challenge, visually stun, and grossly entertain you for the mere 70-ish minutes that it lasts. The version watched, the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\" streamed, also provided with comic-styled flash cards that gave us this silent film's voice. Yet, with all this strength, the film isn't without its flaws. The brevity means quick segments, underdeveloped plot, and a twist that seems to come from left field. Watched within the availability of a group, there was decidedly a mixed feel about this film. Many enjoyed, and applauded, the German Expressionism used to create the world, as it has been eerily used time and time again in modern cinema (i.e. Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\"), yet others seemed to mock the unknown. They followed the film throughout the course, confused as to when it was going to wrap up, and when it did - the ending seemed more rushed than surprising. While there were both applause and nays within the group, the one element that stood out - which demonstrates the cinematic power of \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\"\\" - is that they all wanted to see it again.<br /><br />\\"Caligari\\" introduces a new viewer to the world of German Expressionism, and the creativity doesn't stop there. With bold, \\"Pee-Wee's Playhouse\\"-like doors, Burton-esque buildings, and a dream-like town, director Robert Wiene (along with his set designer and cinematographer) was well beyond the 1900s. Their vision proved that dark can be fun, that the unknown will still scare, and the mind, well, it is a terrible thing to waste. Imagine watching this film in 1920, when the cinema was still an infant. The sheer horror that audiences would have felt ooze from the screen, it is dark, it is disturbing, and - even with standards today - it is scary. Audiences beware, this is no \\"Saw\\" or \\"Hostel\\", but the creativity behind this feature is stronger than these modern \\"classics\\". The argument could even be presented that if it weren't for this film, the horror genre wouldn't exist today. \\"Caligari\\" is that impressive. For those that haven't seen, be prepared.<br /><br />This film worked because of what our group was considerably mixed on, the unknown. For me, the uniqueness of the story allowed for depth and the macabre to soak through. Couple this with the visuals, and \\"Caligari\\" transforms into more than just pioneering cinema - it becomes a grandiose story that requires several viewings in darkened rooms. The cerebral nature keeps conversation flowing and that \\"unknown\\" that I have spoken of, strong. Yet, there is a fault with this film. While I praise the story, cinematography, and the twist; the development was a bit slow at times. Perhaps it is the fast-paced nature of today's movies, but the center of this film seemed to drag and push nowhere. The pacing begins strong, with an introduction into two stranded unknowns, but as the reveal occurs, one can find themselves dozing off - questioning the reason for one scene over the other (i.e. the entire wrong murder suspect). Yes, the value of those scenes do semi-make sense, but for a 70-ish minute long film, there were moments that were difficult to enjoy. Also, perhaps it is just this special edition, but the flash-card dialogue seemed a bit too uplifting for this film. Yes, they were easy to read, yes, the first couple were fun to see, but overall, the choice of these over your typical ones created a missing sense of dread. The dark elements seemed lighter, while the light elements seemed more positive than they should have been. If there were a fault with this film, it would be these small issues. I believe that the KINO edition perhaps does a stronger job with the flash-card issues.<br /><br />Due to the brevity of this film, I don't want to sound repetitive with the elements that I loved vs. those that I could have done without, so - to wrap this review up - here are two breathtaking, and innovative, scenes from this film that will go down in cinematic infamy. The use of \\"special effects\\" to show the insanity of the word \\"Caligari\\" thus into a surprising transformation. Unique for its time, it also showed that this film not only was bold visually, but also technically. The second scene that was favored was when our suspected murder walks away with our quintessential damsel in distress.  The camera work, the artwork, the way the body looks real, but obviously isn't was planned precisely.  These are two strong scenes from an already great film.<br /><br />VIDEO:  Watched via streaming, the quality and excitement was par to that of a DVD.  Lacking the exciting special features, this gave a small glimpse into a larger world.  Eagerly I look forward to the KINO edition of this film with it's \\"restored authorized edition\\".<br /><br />VISUAL:  Watching this was like watching a projector film, it was too dark in some places, not light enough in others.  Yet, that is what worked.  This film survives on its twisted images and haunting characters, and both come across clear as bells.  Watching this film, one cannot laugh at the work created by Hollywood today, completely borrowing that of this film.<br /><br />SOUND:  This is where it gets tricky.  Watching only one version from the streaming source, I wasn't able to fully recognize the music, that is where an actual DVD will come in handy.  I plan on updating this segment as I watch from either KINO or IMAGE to see which provides the better, stronger score.  Needless to say, I wasn't unimpressed with the music here - it added to the already freaky ambiance of the film.<br /><br />EXTRAS:  Lacking, but not by fault.  Once I acquire the DVD version, I will update this.  Streaming had no special features to add to the surrounding history of this film.<br /><br />Overall, despite my minor setbacks when watching this, I loved \\"The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\\".  The visuals (again) were stunning, the story was breathtaking, and the originality of everyone involved far surpasses that of which is released today.  The closest I could come to would be Terry Gilliam, old Tim Burton, or Fritz Lang (who was originally asked to direct this film).  I suggest this to everyone, horror fanatics or not - this is just a great film and a strong piece of cinematic history.<br /><br />Grade: ***** out of *****- to wrap this review up - here are two breathtaking, and innovative, scenes from this film that will go down in cinematic infamy.

045122499X|5.0|Will someone please convince Ken Follett to write a sequel, set in the Renaissance? I just read this book on my Kindle (the perfect vehicle for a 1,000 page-plus novel) and now I must decompress before I can even imagine getting into another book. At times I wanted to strangle Follett for keeping Merthin and Caris apart, but I knew he would bring them back together at the end. And will someone please ask HBO to make the movie?
B002FOQXZK|5.0|Let me start by saying I am unabashedly absorbed in this album. I bought it about three weeks ago and have been listening to it exclusively since. It is simply incredible. As broad as the hip-hop genre has grown, I still feel like this one breaks the mold, making it tough to compare it to any other artist. The beats are clean and deep, and extremely well produced (just check the the piano on My World). Kid Cudi's flow is deliberate, not always rapping and not quite singing, but the lyrics are straight ridiculous and match the beats hit for hit. The subject matter offers a depth not often seen in hip-hop. I suppose Common, Lupe and Mos Def come to mind as similarly thoughtful lyricists (and Common even makes a cameo), but Cudi's album follows a storyline start to finish, diving into his consciousness, the world that haunted his dreams as he grew up, and takes us full circle to him overcoming his demons. It gives the album an overarching theme that ties the whole thing together, and every song is unique and sick. If you're not sure, just listen to CuDi Zone. It should give you a pretty good sample of what the album is all about. For me, the more I listen to it the more I like it... Five stars without a doubt.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|Let me tell you something: This BluRay is a \\"must have\\".  Why?? He is a 15 times Grammy winner. He'd produced or write songs that I didn't know was Foster's. And not talking about any songs, big hits. You'll enjoy music from the 70's, 80's. 90's to the present day. Disco, rock, country, jazz, new age and more. 18 big artists participate in it, and not any one, I'm talking about great singers who gives in this concert a fantastic performance. There are some new incredible talented such as Katharine Mcfee, Michael Johns and a filipine 16 years old girl Charise, It's incredible how this child sings (I'm not exaggerating when I say this girl sang the Whitney Houston's songs flawless). And the band... People, the band is breathtaking.<br />DTS sound is superb (Give 5 stars) and the picture 4 (some edge things).<br />Generally, you'll be buying a quality product for a good price. Enjoy.

1400079276|5.0|A very haunting resonant read. Murakami creates a dreamscape that grabs the reader and doesn't let go.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|The movie is great (as always) and since there is no center hinge (one disk) the chance of this case breaking is small.
B0031ZWZR2|5.0|I'm biased about the content -- I wrote the novel [[ASIN:076532413X FlashForward]] upon which this TV series is based -- but I'm also a videophile, and I was waiting with some trepidation to see how good the transfers would be, especially since they're packing five wide-screen episodes onto each of the two disks in this set.  I'm pleased to say, having received my copy today, that the transfers are gorgeous, with no sign of compression artifacts.  In fact, on my upconverting DVD player, it looks almost like true high-definition TV.  Beautiful.
B001CD6FKS|4.0|Keep in mind this is a 3 disk set and not a 2 disk set. The 3rd disk in this set is an expired digital copy. Also keep in mind that these blu-ray cases with the central hinge have a tendency to break. The first copy of this blu-ray I got from Amazon was broken. I returned it and got my money back, and then got it from Costco. That too was broken, so I took it back. There was one more blu-ray at the store, which I shook to see if it was broken. It was (the current score is 3) so I decided not to get it. I finally decided to risk getting it from Amazon again, and fortunately that one was not broken. If you can get this (or any movie) at a store, I would recommend doing it so that it is easier to return it when it is broken. You can buy blu-ray cases online, which I may have to do some day if this keeps up.
B002YIHO7I|4.0|Sade goes way back to the eighties when... MTV played music; Reagan country was alive and well; metal bands were hair spraying the ozone with glee; Michael Jackson became a pop icon... During this time Sade was tough to categorize: She wasn't new wave or r&b. She'd appear between  U2 and Prince videos (and was accepted by both fan bases.) Above all, Sade-- with her (their?) smooth seductive jazz like grooves-- was baby making music for generation Xers. Her albums, Diamond Life, Promise and Stronger Than Pride got the candles lit and romance burning...<br /><br />Fast forward twenty something years (yes, it's hard to believe!) and we have the Same Sade, the same band and basically the same groove. The title track, Soldier of Love adds a little percussive muscle to the mix, but all and all Sade still gets the blood rushing were it's needed.  The one thing that has changed the most is us, her fan base. Some of us are older (those candles have melted far too fast), some of us are plugged in (it is the digital decade after all) and some of us just want to look back to a simpler and seemingly kinder time (how quickly we forget about the cold war.)<br /><br />Soldier of Love is close enough in sound to mimic her classics and satisfy most of her old fans. Most of these songs sound like weaker, watered down versions of the eighties originals. There are a couple of tracks like Baby Father and Skin that rise to her past standards. The title track shows that the band is brave enough to tread on some new turf.<br /><br />Above all, Soldier of Love marks the return of the greatly missed Sade Adu. She looks and sounds almost the same as she did over twenty years ago. Listening to this record is kind of like like looking into a mirage: You know the fountain of youth doesn't exist; Yet, Sade makes it seem almost possible.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|Joss Whedon has a rabid fan base, and I consider myself a fan, though not an obsessed fan--but still, he gets no respect.  I feel like in another life, he is a brother to J.J. Abrams who also does brilliant work, but J.J. Abrams is more commercial and gets more ratings, so his shows stay on the air perpetually, while \\"Dollhouse,\\" Whedon's latest brain child, got cancelled mid-season.  (At least they had the decency to air the full second season.)    \\"Dollhouse\\" got off to a rocky start...it was so-so.  I honestly believe a lot had to do with the studio telling Whedon what they wanted and it clashing with his vision.  If you watch his unaired original pilot, and the altered one (and subsequent episodes) you can see where Fox tried to make it more \\"commercial.\\"    That said, this is like Whedon squared.  He originally stated he had a very clear 5 season plan for Dollhouse.  But since it was cancelled, you basically have four seasons condensed into one 13 powerful, impressive, episode season, and despite my sadness for the cancellation, the result is a near perfect season of television that pays off in spades.  It's like Whedon condensed everything knowing the \\"end was near\\" (pardon the pun) and everything we got a glimpse at in Epitaph One, goes seriously complicated, dramatic, surprising, and action-packed.  It's like taking the \\"best of,\\" and cramming four seasons into one, but every little detail, every plot twist--is thoroughly satisfying,    All those boring ho-hum episodes of season one start to come together into something truly extraordinary, and dare I say it, the ultimate Whedonesque plot (\\"end of civilization, death of characters I will leave nameless, unexpected romance, and that sharp wit he is known for--something lacking in season one--is sharper than sharp here.)    All that said, Dollhouse (particularly season 2) is one of the very rare TV shows that I instantly rewatched the entire season to see what subtleties I could pick up on, and just because, frankly it was so awesome.      Give \\"Dollhouse\\" a try, yet another brilliant show that got cancelled, but hopefully will find new life on DVD and Blu-Ray.
0802130208|1.0|I completely miss any comedic (or any other) value this book holds.  The main character Ignatius seems to be to be suffering from Autism or some other similar affliction, and I find no humor in this.  The characters may be original, but all of them uninspiring and just uninteresting.
0451228731|5.0|The technological research, character development and in-your-face style of Crichton, augmented with the page turning suspense of Dan Brown plus bits of the visionary, sarcastic, techno-social futurology of Charles Stross: Welcome to Daniel Suarez!  Amazing book! Perfect balance between topic depth and relentless action.  Great plot, very interesting ideas, deep enough characters for an action novel, excellent writing, pure fun!
B002YIHO7I|5.0|I was not a fan of Sade until this album. Sure, I like a few songs from previous albums, but Soldier of Love did me in. It's rare that I can sit and let every single track play through its entirety and push repeat album on my radio and in the car. I was sold on the title track when my friend recommended that I see the video. I went out and bought the CD the very next day.
0385474547|4.0|This book started out slow for me and it did not pick up until part two. I found all the different African names confusing and hard to keep up with. Overall the main character, Okonkwo, was quite depressing. I wish Okonkwo's daughter, Enzinma, character would have been developed more. Enzima was my favorite character throughout the entire story.<br /><br />Even though the beginning was a somewhat rough to get through, I like how the story developed. Okonkwo was such a complex character. His childhood demons followed him all his life. It was like a dark cloud hovered over his emotions. Personally, I believe that Okonkwo's broken spirit led to his horrible death. The ending really pierced me.

B000VBIEXS|1.0|Well...What can I say...after purchasing the entire remaster catalogue of this band...and then reading these reviews (after the fact).......I finally listened to this CD....what a majort disappointment...<br /><br />This was just about the absolute WORST remastering job I've ever had the misfortune of encountering..<br /><br />A total waste of money...unless you enjoy having your ears assaulted.......Altho they did a good job of reproducing the original packaging in minature....maybe the packaging folks should have mastered the sound as well????  They sure couldn't do any worse.<br /><br />Since then....I have ordered the Rhino version..as I've heard it is a pretty good mastering job. (ie faithful to the original albums sound)<br /><br />There's a lesson to be learned here:  Just because something says \\"REMASTER\\"...doesn't neccessarily mean it's an improvement (as in so many cases lately).<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I just scored a near mint copy of the RHINO/WEA version and what a difference...<br /><br />The liner notes and pics are very informative and very cool.....but the remastering is amazing...exactly like the original LP..only better....nice and full...not muddy....every track is consistent in  mix and output (unlike the SHOUT version).  The bass in nice and punchy..and very balanced with the drums, keys and vocals.<br /><br />Am listening to the disc again as I write (2nd time thru)....track 7..Karn Evil 2nd Imp...\\"cha cha music\\"....Rhino reproduces this perfectly...Shout had it all fuzzed out and distorted.....WHY???<br /><br />If you had the misfortune to purchase the SHOUT version...as many of us did.....dont despair.....the packaging is worth keeping..just for the sake of having the original in minature...but now you'll have the recording as it should be with some added reading material that gives some insight to the background of the albums cover art.<br /><br />What is really confusing to me is....SHOUT put out the other discs in traditional plastic CD cases and did an excellent remastering on each of those albums....but then..they decided to do a big turn and do an exact minature reporo of this abum...and they did it perfectly...but then completely disregarded the important portion...the actual remastered sound of the cd contents....mind baffling..<br /><br />I was also lucky enough to find this in the used market (on amazon) for about $15..worth every cent.then..they decided to do a big turn and do an exact minature reporo of this abum...and they did it perfectly...but then completely disregarded the important portion...the actual remastered sound of the cd contents....mind baffling..

B002TZS5GU|5.0|Instead of going for cheap scares and gore (which the movies does have, it just doesn't revolve around them) this movie shows the human side of a zombie / viral apocalypse, which can be scarier. And then the movie is carried by performances and it was a pleasant surprise.  Chris pine's performance was impressive. And makes you wonder. What if it was you in his shoes? would you make the same decisions in such life threatening situations? Turn against a loved one? What about a stranger who hold the key to (or threatens) your survival? How far would you go? This is a movie that makes you think while giving you a hell of a ride. And that's an A+ in my book.

B00004RFG0|4.0|The Truman Show is a pretty good show, but like the security guards who watched it religiously year after year, when it is over you'll ask yourself, \\"What else is on?\\" It had a High Concept that was executed well--that unbeknownst to Truman Burbank (Jim Carrey), his whole life was filmed 24/7 for the ultimate 'reality show.' It didn't really take off for me, though. It was like a big jet airplane taxiing down the runway, looking like it was about to take off, but it never did. Your mileage may vary. I think The Cable Guy was Carrey's Citizen Kane, so that's where I'm coming from. The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was another career milestone. Call me a fool, but I think Dumb and Dumber was classic Carrey. I thought 'Truman' was good, just not as good as some of Carrey's other stuff.<br /><br />What if anything did I like about it? I really liked Natascha McElhone as the woman he wanted, the way her eyes haunted him. Loved how he made the collage of her face from magazine pictures, and kept it as a keepsake. For some reason, she just wasn't in his official script, so she was an excellent symbol of the tragedy that was the Truman Show for Truman Burbank. It's true his life wasn't so bad, but how sad that EVERYTHING in his world was just a phony and fake movie set. Paul Giamatti has a small part that he manages to make the most of. Still, it is Miles away from Sideways. Laura Linney is pretty good as his wife, but she's no Natascha McElhone. Ed Harris is fantastic as Christof, the director of The Truman Show. Did anyone see him in Glengarry Glen Ross?<br /><br />-------------------<br />Christof: We accept the reality of the world with which we are presented.<br />===========<br /><br />Holland Taylor, who plays Charlie Sheen's mother, Real Estate Agent Evelyn Harper on TV's Three & 1/2 Men, played Truman's mom.

I myself am having a difficult time deciding whether to live with someone forever or if I want to risk getting married again.  Marriages are complicated and divorce is extremely painful.

0061914177|5.0|This is one of the best most practical business books I've read in awhile.  He really gets you thinking and literally tells you how to do everything.  I new this business transition was happening and was starting to incorporate a lot of these technologies at my existing employer, but Gary got me thinking about how I could do this for myself.  I read in two sittings.  It's worth every dime and more.  Sometimes Gary comes across a little over the top and some statements will turn you off - but that's Gary.  There were a few conflicting arguments like you have to hustle and work until 3 in the morning and get up at 6, but you have to put family first.  I don't know too many people that can survive on 3 hours of sleep and are some how working this hard and putting family first.  But look past all that, hear his message about what you can do and where business is headed, because he's right.  Then tackle it with every ounce of energy while keeping life balance.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|BATMAN RETURNS (1992) is a personal favorite of mine. It's so quirky and EXTREMELY dark, almost to the point of being nightmarish! Tim Burton's sequel to his exciting, groundbreaking 1989 BATMAN film is a rarity in that it is a sequel that is actually at the very least GOOD! And I think it's much better than good. I like the fact that BATMAN RETURNS is almost completely different from BATMAN. While BATMAN was more grandiose, stylish and epic, BATMAN RETURNS is much more deep, dark, and scary. They really are two different films at their core. BATMAN boasted two great performances in Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson. BATMAN RETURNS ups the ante and gives us FOUR great performances! Michael Keaton returns as the Caped Crusader and this time he is joined by Danny Devito (as The Penguin), Michelle Pfeiffer (as Catwoman), and Christopher Walken (as Max Schreck). This was at a time when you could populate a film with major actors/stars and it actually turn out good! Burton's casting choices in his early films are inspired and worked to perfection.    BATMAN RETURNS opens with what I think is one of the greatest openings in all of film history! We hear an ominous, downbeat score as we are drawn in to a silhouetted figure standing in a window of a mansion from a distance. Then zoom in and it is the distinguished lord of the manor, pipe in mouth, monocles on (played by none other than Paul Reubens!). Then we hear a woman (his wife) in the bedroom screaming in both agony and horror as she has just given birth to an incredibly deformed baby (we are never shown the baby, just the parents and servants horrific reactions). Months later, the parents decide to abandon the baby and during Christmastime, throw him over a bridge at the local zoo and the carriage floats into the sewers as the parents look with confusion and sadness...Then the ominous music shifts to a more recognizable score: The Batman theme, but with some slight and intricate variations from the first film and thenthe opening credits as we watch the baby carriage go through the sewers and ends up in a penguin lair. I think that Danny Elfmann's score from this sequel surpasses his original! Should have won an Oscar! I just love this opening. Then cut to present day Gotham City 33 years later.     It is the Christmas season in Gotham City and magnate Max Schreck (played with sly, cool, wicked confidence by Christopher Walken) is angling to build a new power plant and enlists the mayor's support. During the meeting, we also meet Schreck's extremely shy and underconfident secretary Selina Kyle (excellently played by the sultry Michelle Pfeiffer). Meanwhile, there are reports of a mysterious \\"Penguin\\" figure roaming the sewers of Gotham. During a tree-lighting ceremony where Schreck is giving a speech in Gotham Square, the Red Triangle Gang crashes the ceremony and terrorizing the Gothamite attendees. Commissioner Gordon (reprised by Pat Hingle) sends out the Bat signal as Bruce Wayne (again played by the great Michael Keaton) is sitting in his study alone in the dark. He sees the signal and goes to work! Batman arrives in the city and thwarts the gang for the moment, but in the melee, Schreck is kidnapped as we learn this was all planned by The Penguin (brilliant characterization by Danny Devito), as he wants Schreck to be his conduit back into normal society. He blackmails Schreck by showing proof of his dirty business dealings. Later, Selina stumbles upon papers that prove that Schreck wants to build the power plant to suck all the power from Gotham rather than supply it. Schreck pushes her out of his high-rise office and while she is motionless on the ground, she is revived by a bunch of cats and assumes the persona Catwoman. The Penguin ends up working with both Schreck and Catwoman in different capacities as each has his/her own agenda.     The chemistry among the stars is great in this. Keaton and Pfeiffer are hot together as Batman and Catwoman and simultaneously sweet when they are their alter egos Bruce and Selina. DeVito and Walken are hilarious in their scenes as they scheme to bring down Gotham City and Batman. Also, Keaton and DeVito's scenes, although few, are very emotional and powerful. The tragic irony is that both men were born rich and lost their upbringing in a normal family and that is what made them into the \\"freaks\\" that they've become. But it's like watching 2 sides of a coin as Penguin hates the world and wants it to suffer as he has, while Batman channels his anger to do good and prevent incidents that happened to him as a child from ever happening again...Fascinating!    The great thing about BATMAN RETURNS is that Burton skillfully juggles the stories of 4 main characters and forms a memorable ensemble. Each characterization is unique and singular and well performed. This is a much more introspective film that it's predecessor as there are times when you really get into the characters' psyches and see what makes them tick. But, make no mistake, there is still a good amount of action (not as much as original), but the action here all feels more natural and necessary. Burton expertly places the action sequences in healthy doses throughout the film and they are all very well executed. He was underrated as a director of action. The dark, wintry setting also gives this sequel a more dire, apocalyptic tone and feel to it. The ending scenes are very tragic and sad almost to the extent of being hopeless, rather than hopeful. The film invested a lot into the actual characters, so even though they are all villains (except Batman), you actually felt bad when they got theirs in the end because they all had viable reasons for becoming evil. Well done, Mr. Burton!
B000F5GNX8|4.0|Thanks to a recommendation from fellow Ammy-friend, Jeffrey Miller, I decided to go ahead and check out `Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang'.  I didn't know anything about this movie except that Downey Jr. was in it, Val Kilmer likes men and Michelle Monaghan was the love interest (and I'm totally interested in being in love with her) and so I was taken by surprise as the mock-noir vibe of the film set in, complete with sketchy narration and one preposterous premise after another.  Directed by a screenwriter, the film has a clever way of poking fun at the things we all tend to hate about movies.<br /><br />Clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />The film starts at an industry party (well, it starts with a children's magician act) where we meet Harry who is there with Perry where he meets Harmony.  Harry is a thief who, in an attempt to escape from the cops, stumbles into an audition for a movie and lands the role where he is paired up with private detective Perry who plays consultant for movies.  Accompanying Perry on a stakeout he happens to witness the dumping of a body that somehow happens to coincide with the suicide of Harmony's sister, instantly calling to mind a story straight out of a crime novel that happens to have ties to a very influential (and controversial) man.<br /><br />I have a few issues with the film, most of which come from the construction.  I love the way they go full force into attacking the genre and trying to pull it apart and reconstruct it, but in the process I feel like confusion is born.  Some of the plot points, while understandably unbelievable, are borderline preposterous, which kind of takes you out of the vibe at times.  I also felt that the relationship between Harmony and Harry was verging on annoying and even obnoxious, and it was a part of the film I was not a fan of.<br /><br />That said, there is also a LOT that I really liked about this movie.<br /><br />The acting, for starters, was top notch.  Even though I wasn't a fan of the scripts treatment of Harry and Harmony, both Downey Jr. and Monaghan were fantastic, especially Michelle, who really understood the balance between borderline psychotic and tactlessly seductive.  Downey Jr. had a few spotty moments, but he handled the wit of the script very well, and sold quite a few scenes that could have tanked the film had they not been handled properly (his whole lost finger scenario was pricelessly handled, and that was a part of the film that could have easily been a flaw but he turned it into a highlight).  All said and done though, I was a little disappointed with him because I expected more from an actor who I generally LOVE (his performances in `Tropic Thunder', `Less than Zero' and `Chaplin' are just a few examples of his supreme talent).  For me though, this movie BELONGS to Val Kilmer.  I have never truly been a devoted fan of his, but I have liked his work in the past (and feel that he should have an Oscar for his work in `The Doors'...because I feel he was better than Hopkins in `The Silence of the Lambs'!) and I consider this to be a shining star performance, one I never expected from him.  Not only is he effortlessly hilarious, but he gets the small nuances of his character, and he even convinces you to second guess him with his playful subtleties (and that final scene, with the face slaps, was such a nice tonal shift but so authentic).<br /><br />I totally recommend this one.  It is a modernized film noir that uses the director's knowledge of the writing process to create something that you've never seen before.  Yes, at times I found the narration (and that whole `stop-go' flow of the storyline) to be a tad distracting, but it's a small infraction.  In fact, this is one of those films that I strongly feel will continue to grow on me to the point where, in a few months or maybe a year or two from now, I'll be wishing that I gave this an A grade instead of a B+.<br /><br />Jeffrey, thanks for the recommendation!were fantastic, especially Michelle, who really understood the balance between borderline psychotic and tactlessly seductive.

0385737424|5.0|Finally a Newberry book that has a wide appeal. When You Reach Me is a fabulous book that will suck readers in much like its muse, Wrinkle in Time.<br /><br />Miranda is struggling with the loss of her best friend Sal, who began ignoring her after an odd incident while they were walking home. Her life is further complicated by her new friends, her mom's boyfriend who wants more involvement in the family and a mysterious crazy homeless man on the corner.  Then s she begins receiving notes that ask her do to things and seemingly predict the future. What should she do with these notes? Why is she receiving them?<br /><br />The story is clearly inspired by Wrinkle in Time. In fact, it tells the entire story over the book as Miranda, Marcus, and Julia talk about it. Miranda loves the book and carries a threadbare copy with her like a teddy-bear. I haven't read Wrinkle in Time since I was 10; I really want to re-read it now.<br /><br />The book is set in the late 70s in New York City. You can tell book is from a previous era by the lack of technology and references here and there. But for the most part, it's timeless. The book is really about the characters and the story. I love how Stead developed rich, 3-dimensional characters. We see their flaws and also understand why the flaws exist. The story unfolds wonderfully. I wasn't particularly surprised by the ending, but I was surprised by how Stead developed and explained the conclusion. All in all, it's a rich, satisfying story.

B002SJIO54|4.0|Johannesburg, The Present: The Alien ship drifted into a lazy orbit over Johannesburg twenty years ago. When humanity finally cut their way inside, they found roughly one million malnourished, unhealthy insect-like Aliens dwelling within. The Aliens - derogatorily nicknamed \\"Prawns\\" - were relocated into a single huge refugee camp in Johannesburg known as \\"District Nine\\". Despite an apparent instinctual affinity for technology, the Prawns are generally considered to be of low intelligence and have been marginalised, castigated, brutalised and left to die by a largely intolerant human population which treats them with suspicion, disgust and xenophobia. With Alien/Human tensions running at an all-time high, it is decided that the Prawns should be evicted from District 9, which has degenerated into a gigantic slum of shacks, poverty and crime over twenty years, and relocated to a new district far outside the city.  MNU, a private corporation which has thus far been unable to exploit the fruits of the alien technology, is contracted to enforce the eviction and do so with their usual brutal efficiency not realising that the ruthlessness of their conduct will have devastating consequences for both human and alien alike...    As one would expect, the spectre of South Africa's Apartheid years haunt virtually every frame of Neill Blomkamp's \\"District Nine\\". If you are old enough to remember the horrors of that era, you can only marvel at the bravery of Blomkamp's film; partially shot in nascent semi-documentary style, I felt an old familiar sickness in my stomach as I watched Afrikaans bureaucrats - backed up by armed bully-boys - cheerfully going about the systematic eviction of oppressed and marginalised 'pariahs' from slum-dwellings whilst throwing jocular asides such as \\"The Prawn does not really understand the concept of ownership, so evicting him is no great problem, hey?\\". The poignancy of these scenes is all the more potent when one considers that they were shot on the outskirts of Johannesburg's Soweto township (which witnessed just exactly this kind of state endorsed barbarism during the Apartheid years).       That said, there is much more to Neill Blomkamp's film than just polemic. It is a brilliantly paced action thriller, with a very dark comic streak, which puts virtually everything made by Hollywood in recent years to shame. After watching it, I was unsurprised to discover in the extras that this project was green-lit following the collapse of producer Peter Jackson's movie of the \\"Halo\\" video game. Indeed, the final sequences of the film - which, despite some awesome action, for my money were the weakest - do actually resemble the action sequences from a particularly bloody first person shooter, so one wonders whether any of the production design was carried over from the aborted film.    In terms of acting, performances for the most part are brilliant, convincing and improvisatory. Praise must go to Sharlto Copley for his turn as 'Wikus', an MNU bureaucrat who finds himself reluctantly thrust into the very heart of alien/human tensions. He makes one of the most unusual leading men of recent years (think David Brent from \\"The Office\\" cross-pollinated with an action hero and you're getting close). This really is a film which is carried as much as by its acting as its special effects.    \\"District Nine\\", along with the likes of the similarly brilliant [[ASIN:B002T9H2MO Moon]] and \\"Daybreakers\\" almost seems to be part of a new renaissance in thoughtful, philosophical independent science fiction film-making (and proof that the smartest movie-making really does seem to be completely removed from Hollywood, these days).

B002T9H2MO|5.0|The Dark Side Of The Moon, The Future: Sam Bell (Sam Rockwell) is the one man overseer of an automated mining operation which excavates and refines Helium Three - an energy source which we are informed is now responsible for meeting the needs of 70% of the world's energy requirements - using four large automated 'harvesters' which roam the planet's surface sifting the sands. Living in isolation on the moon in a largely sterile habitat with only environment computer \\"Gerty\\" (voiced by Kevin Spacey) and the occasional time-delayed message from Earth for company is beginning to take its toll on Sam, but with the end of his three year contract in sight he remains chipper; until, that is, an accident on the lunar surface causes him to question his sanity, identity and real purpose on the moon...    I thoroughly enjoyed Duncan Jones' \\"Moon\\" because it is a return to the values of the golden age of thoughtful, philosophical science fiction films which appeared around the end of the sixties and dawn of the early seventies. Jones clearly grew up adoring the likes of [[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000063UR1 Silent Running]] and Andrei Tarkovsky's [[ASIN:B00006L92F Solaris - Criterion Collection]] as much as I did, and the production design, themes and pace of his own film is quite self-consciously styled after those films - all of which which were a) actually about something other than moronic hero cliches running around with with laser guns and b) used space as a metaphor for loneliness, alienation and madness. As with these earlier films, the drama in \\"Moon\\" comes from existential torment rather than exploding aliens.     I particularly enjoyed the fact that Jones eschewed CGI in favour of model miniatures shot 'mise en scene' (with a little CGI augmentation) and kept it largely old-school. Personally speaking, models have always seemed much more realistic than CGI to me when they're shot properly. To Jones credit, he also doesn't allow the effects to overtake the film (in opposition to most mainstream sci-fi movies such as \\"Avatar\\", to use a current example, most of which really do just appear to be derivative nonsense designed to showcase the latest innovations in CGI).     Performances are good. Rockwell makes a splendidly tweaked lead and Kevin Spacey is also rather good as the disembodied \\"Gerty\\"; He doesn't quite manage to pull off the deeply sinister air of detachment elicited by Douglas Rain as the \\"HAL 9000\\" in \\"2001\\", but then I suspect that noone will ever be able to upstage Rain's portrayal of a malevolent computer - definitive portrayal of a mildly disconcerting machine intelligence that it was.     Be sure to explore the extras on this DVD as they're fascinating - and do make sure that you watch Jones' previous short film, \\"Whistle\\", which is included as an extra and which is a superbly offbeat tale of a hi-tech hitman having a crisis of conscience.     Highly Recommended.
044024367X|2.0|I couldn't agree more with the preponderance of reviews here. NOTHING TO LOSE was a slack, ill-conceived mess. Reacher seems to be devolving into a soulless thug who no longer is concerned so much with coming to the aid of the defenseless as with actively looking for trouble. He endlessly circles and infiltrates Despair searching for something - seemingly, anything - to spark his rage against the Machine. Toward that end, he wanders into a secure facility without any legal authority and demands Answers. He starts a bar fight against six beefy townsmen, which he handily wins with a round of furious elbow strikes, which Lee Child appears to regard as having cruise missile accuracy, since Reacher resorts to them more than to his fists. Reacher then caps his evening with the home invasion of an elderly couple, plunks himself down in their living room, and intimidates the wife into making him coffee - black, no sugar. We're way out-dirtying Dirty Harry here.    Meanwhile, back in Hope, whose only inhabitants seem to be a lady cop, a drygoods salesmen, and a couple of diner waitresses, Reacher drinks more coffee, repeatedly shags the cop (whose first name he never bothers to ascertain and whose soldier husband is in a permanent vegetative coma), and works out elaborate crime hypotheses by pushing condiment holders around on a table top. Oh, the suspense.    Then there's the oft-mentioned leftist drivel in support of army deserters and against all-things Bush-Cheney. A violent vigilante with a penchant for what he deems acceptable homicide gets squeamish over a little water-boarding? No way does that compute. Yet we could see this schizophrenic mix way back in THE ENEMY, wherein Child takes a thinly-disguised swipe at Dick Cheney shortly before having Reacher dispatch a colonel whose manners annoy him with a bullet to the forehead.    If it isn't time to give Reacher a dishonorable discharge from crime fiction (he CAN be hugely diverting in his mayhem), it's long past timefor his creator to retire the following personal tics :the endless, purposeless vagrancy; so little respect for women that only their surnames are worthy of notice and they rarely survive even as a memory in later books; the clothes disposal gambit and the total absence of hygienic amenities (toothpaste, mouthwash); the obsessive concern with arithmetic and geographic detail, so that climbing a wall becomes a Euclidian ordeal (at least for the reader); the intuitive crime-solving from barely discernable scraps of ephemera that makes Sherlock Holmes look mentally disabled; and, most irritatingly, Reacher's casual takeover of every police authority and crime scene he encounters.    In short, it's time for Jack Reacher to do some growing up. He was human and compelling once. Lose the sangfroid and the brutal, asocial nihilism, and he can be again

B0020EK4QY|4.0|This is a movie that's nothing more than good, silly fun.  Like any \\"Die Hardish\\" movie, you just need to relax, enjoy the ride and not think about logic. This is certainly Harrison Ford's last, really watchable movie (don't get me started on \\"Crystal Skull\\"!) and there should've been more scenes with Harrison and the always excellent Gary Oldman.  It's fast paced and never dull. If you enjoy over the top action movies where it seems like no matter how bad the situation is, it gets worse, this is one for your collection.<br /><br />The good: The picture and sound are clean and spectacular, although the special effects show some rough edges.  The sound of the F-16s (?) flying in circles is a great way to show off your surround sound.<br /><br />Now the bad: The Blu-Ray version doesn't have any extras except for Director's Commentary (which was on the DVD) and \\"Blu-Ray Live.\\"  A serious disappointment for me!<br />I subtracted a star for this. Otherwise it'd be a 5-star.<br /><br />Also, the Blu-Ray came with a Wal-Mart price sticker on it.  Whaaaat?
B002N5N5M0|5.0|The best part of Dexter is the writing. For Season 4 the best part was John Lithgow. The twists and turns, humor and plotlines are pure genius.    The only drawback is Dexter's sister. Her pathetic insecurity is tiresome. She needs to get a backbone.
0743487761|5.0|One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.<br /><br />And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.<br /><br />When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.<br /><br />Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.<br /><br />But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...<br /><br />At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").<br /><br />And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.<br /><br />\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic.a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.<br /><br />Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end.

With that said, this is WORST lil wayne CD EVER, i really havent listened to his music since Carter 2, but this is just plain crap. I knew he would auto-tune everything bcuz he cant sing worth a damn. Some of the songs sound like crap even without the words, the guitar rhythms and drum beats suck badly. I give him mad props for trying something new, its not easy switching music genres like that, I know for a fact bcuz I'm an underground rapper, rock drummer and jazz and blues saxophonist. But he needs to learn to pick his battles. I hope while he spends time locked up he thinks about WTF he did wit this ablum

0156030322|3.0|Drive is a novella. Its short. But that doesn't take anything away from the crisp story telling here. This is basically a stark examination of a brutal life lived without much care. A life of hard knocks PG-13 style.<br /><br />I have to compare this work with a few other authors, since Sallis is obviously leaning heavily upon the genre. (1) Dave Zeltserman, author of 'Small Crimes' and Edward Bunker author of 'Dog eat Dog'. This is what I would consider brutal noir. Hard unforgiving in your face writing. 'Drive' falls a long way short of this, connections were lost due to pulled punches and politically correct writing.<br /><br />(2) Lawrence Block. This is an author best known for his Matthew Scudder series. Back in his earliest days, Block wrote one great noir story after another. All of his stories were on the slow side, like Drive. But what made them exceptional was the character development. You got a feel for protagonists that you just dont find with Sallis' short effort.<br /><br />(3) John D MacDonald, Donald Westlake, & Richard Stark. Authors who at times delved into the criminal mind set inside of 'heists' that usually end up going bad. These stories are almost always told linearly, with a start, a middle, and an end. 'Drive' jumps back and forwards, its unclear where its starting, where its going, and where you are time-line wise on any given page. This is 'Drives greatest flaw in my mind.<br /><br />I liked this story on one hand, but it does not live up to the masters Sallis is trying to pay homage to. I would go after some of the early noir writers themselves if I were you instead of reading 'drive'. But if you do pick up this story, at least its short, some of the scenes are well written and it wont be a complete waste of time and effort on your part.
1416594787|2.0|As I prepared to read this volume I expected that some new compelling evidence had been found that absolutely proved evolution beyond a shadow of a doubt, however was greatly dissapointed. In summary, I did not find anything new in this book that has not already been discussed or presented before. The \\"must have\\" evidence to support evolution is the existence of transition fossils, indeed even Darwin expressed that the absence of \\"GRADATED\\" transition fossils is a \\"grave concern\\" for his theory (\\"gradated\\" is key here). Bottom line is that gradated transition fossils that show the evolution of one species into another MUST be presented. I understand the difficulty with this in that few fossils are formed, however this still does not take away that these must be presented otherwise one can easily conclude that a species was produced independently. The \\"transition fossils\\" that Professor Dawkins presents certainly could form some linkage in the so called \\"Tree of Life\\" but are some way off being the gradated transition fossils that Darwin demanded must be found. Dawkin's was right in that there is simply too big a gap to conclude that these fossils represent an intermediate species in the transition of one species to another. This is surely a fair criticism. Next we come to the evolving lizards that were supplanted on the island & that transformed in features over 37 years. Again, this only shows how animals are adaptable & have the physiological machinery to adapt to a changing environment. There is no evidence of genetic mutation combined with natural selection at work here but just a shifting of genes in the gene pool to form lizards that are more in tune for life in their new environment. Again, we do not see a transition of one species to another species, which is what must be shown for evolution through natural selection to be concluded as the driving force of the change. Another of Professor Dawkin's arguments is the high sequence homology of the genetic code across species, that he claims to prove that species descended from a common ancestor. It is a nice theory but this commonality doesn't prove this at all, but provides circumstantial evidence (weak at that). Think about it, if there was indeed a Divine Creator at work then it makes complete sense that he would use similar DNA sequences, genes & proteins across species to code for proteins that work to ensure the survivability of the species on earth. Cars manufactured by different auto companies all use wheels, exhaust pipes & carburetta's but it doesn't mean they descended from a single car. They have a designer who uses designs that simply work across different models. Of course, the Designer would extrapolate genes encoding important proteins across the whole Tree of Life - this makes absolute sense. I think the most controversial chapter is the one where Professor Dawkins argues that there can be no God based on all the wastage there is in the world....trees growing to unessessary high hights to compete, predators & prey continually competing against one another in the economy of nature to outpace the other, & (arguably the best one of all) the cruelty that animals inflict on one another. It may be worth reading the Bible here to better understand who God really is & what line of business he is in (saving man's soul). Given that God uses animals in the Mosaic sacrificial system I hardly think cruely inflicted by one animal to the next is really top of his agenda, although there are a couple of Scriptures that condemn unessessary cruely inflicted by a human to an animal (& rightly so). Most unbelievable of all is the argument that the imperfections in human physiology (back to front retina, excessively long vas deferens, lower back pain etc) support the concept that there can be no God, since God wouldn't have got this wrong is he existed. Professor Dawkin's has completely missed the amazing perfection & detail of the human body & singles out a back to front retina as a major flaw...this is truly spiritual blindness! How is your eyesight? I bet it's pretty good isn't it? So what about the lower back pain? Well, Romans 5:12 provides the answer & tells us that death (& disease) entered the human race at the Fall of Man, which provides a Biblical explanation of all the imperfections, aches, pains & diseases we unfortunately must suffer, together with mortality. Finally, I see that Professor Dawkins leave the most important question until last, that is, how did life get started in the first place. Unfortunately, evolution by natural selection demands an answer to this question in his book, but Professor Dawkin's completely minimizes the importance of this critical question, putting it down to mere chance (& a little bit of RNA). If you tried to use that rationale in a quality scientific journal, I think it's safe to say that your paper would be rejected! We must face the facts here, if you look with an open heart at the three dimensional structure of DNA (together with its perfectly entwined histone complexes) & can truly say there can be no God, you probably need to reconsider reality. We could even term a personal who thinks this as a \\"Reality denier\\". Having said all of this, I do think the book is well written & humorous in places (which is why I gave it 2 stars & not 1). The only problem is that Professor Dawkin's is fairly insulting to the very people he is supposed to be reaching out to i.e. the 40 percenters, the \\"History Deniers\\". This is probably not the best approach & shows that he probably didn't ever intend to try to change their minds but merely to vent his anger & frustration at them through his book. I think to really understand whether evolution through natural selection could have played a part in the formation of life on earth, we need to drill down to the biochemistry of life, which is something Professor Dawkins doesn't really touch upon in any depth....let's move onto \\"Darwin's Black Box\\" & resume the debate....a as a major flaw...this is truly spiritual blindness!

B0035KESBE|5.0|First off, the seller of this DVD is really an excellent seller.  They are located in the Phillipines and the shipping takes 17-21 days to America, but let me tell you:  The Wait IS Worth It!!!  I had never seen this movie until January of this year and have since watched it over 20 times.  I never realised that the \\"Smooth Criminal\\" short film was taken from this film and to see the entire video is alone worth purchasing.  The only other thing I can say about this film is that it is Michael Jackson and that alone makes this title a must own.  There are 2 different covers for this DVD and as a \\"must have everything\\" type of fan, I of course, bought them both (this seller sales both box covers, so just ask them).  Once again, buying this movie, from this seller, is by far the wisest international purchase I have ever made.  It is original in all content (both box cover, DVD and the the picture and sound quality are so clear, it is almost like Blue-Ray).  Check it out from this seller.  You will not be disappointed in ANY way.  I wish it were as easy to wish Michael back as Katie, in the movie does, and he appears.  However, he is always a lucky star!

B00338QENI|5.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is extraordinary on several levels: as a beautifully researched work of medical and scientific history, as a portrait of the profound impact of racism in America, and as a brutally honest first-person account of a writer's challenging, decade-long struggle to write a serious book. If The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks doesn't win at least one of the major awards for books published this year, I'll be hugely disappointed.<br /><br />The text on the cover telegraphs the essence of the story: \\"Doctors took her cells without asking. Those cells never died. They launched a medical revolution and a multimillion-dollar industry. More than twenty years later, her children found out. Their lives would never be the same.\\"<br /><br />Henrietta Lacks, we discover, was an ill-educated African-American woman who died of cervical cancer at the age of 31 nearly sixty years ago. She was a patient at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, home of one of the nation's most prestigious medical schools and of some of the world's leading researchers in fields such as cell culture and oncology. One of those researchers asked Henrietta's physician for a sample of her diseased cervix in faint hopes that, unlike every other tissue sample anyone to that date had ever tested, the cells he extracted would divide indefinitely,thus become \\"immortal,\\" and open up new vistas for medical research. To his and everyone else's astonishment, they did. And not only did those cells continuously divide from 1951 to the present, they proved to be so aggressive and so persistent that they contaminated every other cell culture they came in contact with -- invalidating years of medical research that was conducted before the contamination was belatedly discovered. To this day, HeLa cells, named as a contraction of Henrietta's name, constitute one of medicine's most pervasive experimental tools.<br /><br />The medical history in this book is engrossing. As Skloot amply demonstrates, it's also scientifically significant. But for me what was most powerful about The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks was the unfolding story of Henrietta's life and of the lives of her many children and grandchildren. Skloot devoted a decade to befriending and later interviewing Henrietta's daughter, Deborah, Deborah's brothers, and other influential members of the Lacks family in Virginia and Maryland. Theirs is one of the most dramatic and moving tales I've ever encountered of the profound impact of racism in our society. At Deborah Lacks' insistence, Skloot reported every incident and every conversation precisely as it occurred, with no sugar-coating. The power of her reporting is irresistible.<br /><br />Rebecca Skloot is an accomplished science journalist, but amazingly this is her first book. If she never writes another one, her contribution to the history of medicine and science will be assured.<br /><br />(From Mal Warwick's Blog on Books)fically significant.

All other Batman movies had certain flaws:  The first two Batman movies (Batman and Batman Returns by Tim Burton) focused mainly on the enemy instead of the Dark Knight itself. The previous two were just garbage.<br /><br />We see here a Bruce Wayne with fear - something that you didn't see in the previous cape crusader films - and his internal side and reaction towards his parent's death. A more focus on the man without the mask and suit.<br /><br />With an important cast that delivered exceptional performances; Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy, Michael Caine, Christian Bale and Liam Neeson (who in my opinion gave the best performance in the film); Batman Begins was the Batman movie we were all waiting for.

The plot involves around a very contrived situation: a group of actors making a war movie overseas are dropped deep into the jungle, where they will improvise action sequences for hidden cameras.  But when the director is accidentally killed, the actors convince themselves its all part of their motivation, even when they run afoul of a village full of ruthless drug producers.  Much of the comic tension in the story comes from the actors' failing to realize that they are no longer playing make-believe, but are actually engaged in a real shooting war in the jungle.  Stiller's Hollywood enthusiasm is delightfully funny, given how oblivious he is to the realities of their situation, while the others express their doubts in silly bickering.  Eventually they are captured, of course, and there's a gallant rescue sequence and a very satisfactory conclusion, despite the absurdity of it all.<br /><br />And those absurdities are really something.  Downey takes on a very challenging role, as a white Australian actor portraying a black man; overplaying the role, actually, and hitting all the stereotypical notes that make his lines incredibly funny even though he (the fictional actor, not Downey) doesn't get it.  This dovetails into an overarching theme of \\"identity\\" and \\"being yourself\\" that has to pass for the moral of the story, but in a work this crazed, who really cares?  All of the characters are more funny than convincing, so the story doesn't generate tension as much as a kind of expectancy.  So don't go in expecting a lot of deep character study - these guys are all pretty dumb, but they manage to do the right thing in the end.<br /><br />But to me the funniest part of the film was the dialogue, particularly when the actors discuss various aspects of their business.  Downey's analysis of other actors' turns as mentally challenged characters is simply priceless: so politically incorrect that one feels dirty just watching it.  Ditto Jack Black's portrayal of a heroine addict.  In other hands this material could have been tragic, but Stiller doesn't allow us to take any of it seriously.  A silly, rollicking, good-time entertainment, but not recommended for quibblers or the politically sensitive.  Four and a half stars.Ditto Jack Black's portrayal of a heroine addict.

B0000AM6JI|5.0|A Puerto Rican ex-con pledges to stay away from his former drug dealing ways but finds himself being dragged back by his past connections and the naive machinations of his lawyer and best friend. Hoping to raise enough money to get away from New York, Carlito Brigante takes on the job of running a nightclub, renews an affair with a dancer but old associates and old instincts suck him back into a world of violence and mistrust.  \\"Carlito's Way\\" is an emotional and captivating story. One of the greatest actors of our time teams up with one of the greatest directors. Pacino's portrayal of ex-gangland boss and drug dealer Carlito Brigante is powerful, moving and at times very funny. Combined with great performances from Sean Penn and Penelope Ann Miller, this movie is a roller-coaster ride of \\"will he, won't he\\" tension and heavy , though not gratuitous, violence. A modern classic, this movie has everything you could want. Love, loyalty, betrayal, sadness, comedy. Watch this movie.
B0029O08WA|1.0|This sound track was boring. The music did not help make the movie effective. Where as Twilight had a ton of help from its soundtrack! I thought the movie and sound track lacked big time. You listen to the music and there is nothing that makes you feel anything. Nothing that makes you want to rock out and feel sad or anything! Quite boring actually! What a disappointment! I hope the next one they will try to go the route they did with Twilight. It'll sell better and it'll help bring more emotion to the movie. What a waste!
B000009ED0|3.0|I only wanted one song, but since Kid Rock refuses to offer down-loadable tunes I was forced to buy the entire CD.  The song Cowboy (the reason I purchased the CD)  is a classic an the unofficial strip club anthem. I give two thumbs up for Cowboy and only one thumb up for the rest of the album.

B002N5N5M0|5.0|I have watched every episode of this series and I have to admit, season four has been the best. How often do you watch a show in which every, single episode, hell, every single scene has you on the edge of your couch holding your breather? None--with the exception of Dexter.    This season Dexter is juggling a lot--family, a home, work, finding time for his passion, and a new rival. He's got pressure from all sides. Watching him masterfully keep it all together was one of the best acting endeavors only someone as gifted as Michael C. Hall could pull off.    You know, so many people complain about how much crap is on TV. But, by far, Dexter is better than any movie I have seen in years.
B000683VI4|5.0|An old man in a nursing home reads a story to an old woman each day. The story he reads follows two young lovers named Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun. They met one evening at a carnival many years ago. Allie's parents separate Noah and Allie. They disapprove of Noah's lack of wealth, and move Allie away. After waiting for Noah to write her for several years, Allie meets and becomes engaged to a handsome young soldier named Lon. In a local newspaper, Noah's picture catches Allie's eye. He is standing in front of a fully restored, 200 year old home. The article is filled with praise for his accomplishments. Allie's heart nearly bursts. The last time she saw this house it was a rotted decaying shamble. She stood enfolded in Noah's arms in the great entryway and listened to his plans to buy and restore this house. Just the way she wanted it. With her love for Noah still alive, the picture pulls at her heart. She has to go back, see if Noah is okay, and tell him about her marriage. They both think the echo deep in their hearts, the one that has lasted all these years, is not shared by the other. The cry they could not stifle. It wasn't over for me. This movie will keep you guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole movie. The Notebook is extremely well constructed, and a truly remarkable movie.
B001TZQITM|5.0|This is a nice little bag for our Sony Handycam DCR (and I'm sure many little video and still cameras will fit nicely within it).     Given it's size, it has an impressive number of compartments (three zippered compartments on the sides of the bag; a compartment within the main storage area) and a decent amount of storage space. The camera, charger, and extra batteries all fit without a problem.    All of the walls of the bag have a solid, padded feel and the bottom of the bag is a nice rubber-ish material. You could set the bag on a wet or muddy surface and not worry about any moisture or grime seeping into your camera.    My only complaint is that the bag's strap is, well, just a strap. No padding or anything (which keeps is nice and light, I suppose).
