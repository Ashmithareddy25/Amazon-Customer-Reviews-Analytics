B00526ZKYS|4.0|So I noticed that there are several reviews here that list this book in the 1 or 2 Star category and I cannot understand how and I have no idea why!<br /><br />This book is written extremely well. There are parts that are written like poetry, its rather beautiful sometimes! Especially the little epigraphs at the beginning of each Chapter!!<br /><br />The Plot was great! Though, its true that there are a lot of dystopian novels out there right now, this one was different-ish. The world has come to believe that LOVE is a disease and \\"cure\\" it at the ripe age of 18. After the cure, you no longer feel love or pain. Its safety, they say.<br /><br />And then you meet our main character, Lena, who is terrified of the disease called love, because her mother had it. She loved not only her, but also her father, and eventually committed suicide because of it. That is, until she meets Alex and starts having feelings that are forbidden.<br /><br />So interesting and sad to live in a world without love.<br /><br />Anyways... I loved the characters. Lena is so well written and believable. Im sure this is exactly how a 17 year old would think and act and feel if in this situation! And Alex, was great.<br /><br />I do wish that I felt that it was more LOVE between Alex and Lena, not just young infatuation... but overall I was not terribly upset with the romance. I just wish it had been more.<br /><br />Overall, it was a great book, I haven't read the second, though im about to start it, and it BETTER make the ending of this one ok, or I will never read another book by this author. Cliffhangers are ok... bad endings are not.<br /><br />I want a happy ending! Even in dystopians!<br /><br />Story by Mrs Jones at: theresamjones.blogspot.com
0553386794|5.0|I never planned on reading this book series.  As if I needed another epic to mix in with my already overflowing TBR pile.  But since picking up this book, the other titles in the series shot up to the top of my queue.  It was like The Lord of the Rings all over again.  And like it, I've become rather obsessed with the screen adaptation as well.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is the first book in the series A Song of Ice and Fire.  It is set in a fictitious country called Westeros.  Several houses rule their own lands, all of them under King Robert Baratheon.  The House Stark rule the North in Winterfell.  Lord Eddard \\"Ned\\" Stark is the head of the house.  The sudden death of the Hand of the King, Jon Arryn, starts a series of events that will cause many deaths, betrayals, and wars.<br /><br />I must admit that the HBO TV series sparked my interest.  I love Sean Bean and frankly, I'll watch anything HBO.  I watched the first two episodes and was mesmerized by everything about it, especially the superb casting and acting.  Then I watched the second episode and for some reason, I lost interest.  (Maybe it's because they killed an animal, eh.)  Seasons 1 & 2 came and went until one day at Barnes & Noble, I randomly picked up A Game of Thrones and started reading.  And I haven't stopped since.<br /><br />Every single page of it is an adventure.  It is divided into chapters in the form of points of views of several characters, telling the story through their eyes and from where there are at that time.  The story goes steadily forward even if the POV changes.  My favorite characters to follow are Jon Snow, Arya Stark, Daenerys Targaryen, and Tyrion Lannister.  Jon and Arya's chapters always go by faster than the others while Daenerys' scenes happen outside of Westeros, of different cultures and ways of life.  As for Tyrion, he has such a superb mind that it is interesting how he practices his power despite his small stature.<br /><br />It blows my mind that one person has this all in his head.  Such great creativity and imagination.  And the characters are so well planned that none fade into the background.  Even the lowliest peasant has his own unique character trait that sets him apart from the rest.  And there are so many to root for, not just one hero.  It is easy to find someone to relate with because there are just so many characters.  I wonder how George RR Martin keeps track... but then again, it's his world.<br /><br />My favorite thing about this book is the relationships of the characters with one another.  Especially the Starks.  Yes, there is bloodshed and betrayal and all that bad stuff but there is also love.  Even between the two characters I despised, Cersei Lannister and her son Joffrey Baratheon, you can sense the strong love Cersei has for Joffrey even though she uses him as pawn for power.  But among the Stark family, how Catelyn and Ned love their true-born children; how Ned truly loves his bastard son Jon Snow; how Jon is with his half-siblings; and how the kids are with their direwolves... it is so touching and I think that aspect sets this apart from other fantasy novels.<br /><br />Overall, I am in love with it.  Pairing this novel to its pleasantly faithful TV counterpart, I was easily hooked and now am so into the whole Thrones universe.  I want to know what comes next, what happens to these characters I love and hate, and who wins that game of thrones.<br /><br />Rating: 5/5.<br /><br />Recommendation: Fantasy nerds unite!  Actually, if you are a book worm, I think this should be in those must-read lists.  It's not an easy read but it is worth it.is all in his head.  Such great creativity and imagination.

B005MMJ84K|4.0|So this story continue right where Delirium stops. You follow Lena on her journey to being a stronger person and finding who she really is.<br /><br />The story is told by alternating between the Now and Then. Then being right after she left Portland and entered the Wilds and everything that happened up until the Now. This shift in time periods is brilliant, it makes everything seem more real. Because in the Then, you get to see her grow from grief and anger, frustration and pain, but in the Now, Lena is already a different person-and yet still growing more.<br /><br />I loved it! She grew in the first book, Delirium, and now she continues to grow. She is strong, has faced love and love lost, has been starved and dirty and beaten. But she comes out even stronger. I LOVE the character of Lena. I know love, and I know pain from the loss of that love. and I feel it with her.<br /><br />The world in The Wilds is sad and dirty and scary, and you feel it. you feel the hunger and cold, you feel the sadness, weariness and emptiness they do.<br /><br />The writing in this book is so believable.<br /><br />This time, Lena has been tasked with following Julian, the son of the leader of the DFA- Deliria Free America. And you see their relationship grow.<br /><br />My ONLY issues with it: again, just as in the last book, the romance is very subtle. They care for each other and then love each other, after a very short time. I think it believable that there is a bond, after near death experiences, but love? real love?<br />I don't know. I felt that she loved Alex (from the first book) more than Julian... she still was mourning his death, after so long...<br /><br />Man, part of me wants to give this book 5 stars, because of the writing and the character development and... just the whole story, But part of me wants to give it 2 or 3 stars because what I wanted as the reader didnt happen until the VERY LAST page! And I feel sorta... cheated.<br /><br />I don't know, I am ANXIOUSLY and impatiently awaiting Requiem in March of next year!! (NEXT YEAR??

B005A1ER0I|5.0|I bought this not knowing what to expect. So yes it passed my expectations x100. I love this album and Thomas Bergersen's music. Homecoming is my favorite from this album. It strikes emotional memories for me and at times, draws tears.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I so impressed with all three of the books. I loved them! Couldn't put my kindle down and once I finished reading one, I couldn't wait to purchase the next one. ... for those who wrote negative reviews(specific person in mind) .. are YOU a teenager?  If you as you so wrote love to read erotic books and \\"never\\" write a bad review  could seriously think this book was so aweful it must have been written by a teenager .... there's something seriously wrong with you.... and yes,  you must live with the fact that you did not think of writting a book like this and publish it first..lol... the best news.... \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is being turned into a film.... in your face!!!
B007S1RGUQ|5.0|A sweet album with classic Bonnie Raitt renditions of familiar tunes.  Easy to slide into - like all of Bonnie's work.
B00000AF95|5.0|A great album from a great band. Like most KISS fans at this point I had my doubts. Being a die hard fan from the beginning, I was very upset to find out that Peter Criss had left & was replaced by Eric Carr. When Creatures was released I went to that show expecting to see Ace & got Vinnie Vincent instead !!!!The follow up,\\"Lick It Up\\" was great tho, but in my opinion Mark St.John was a much better fit.Too bad It did not last. MY HEART GOES OUT TO MARK ST.JOHN! YOU'LL ALWAYS ROCK DUDE!!!!
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was a really fast read! Couldn't put it down!!! Definitely made me squirm in my seat...  I have read very little Erotica, but I want my hubby to read this one! It was a little \\"edgy\\" - but hot enough to bring some new material to our bedroom. The love story in the series made it more real than just a book about a control freak who likes kinky sex.  Made me remember the beginning of any new, sexual, love affair. I recommended it to anyone who isn't already reading it!  Everybody I know seems to be talking about it or reading it!
B000ICXQF6|4.0|I was finally able to see this via streaming, and it was surprisingly good.  Brad Pitt's performance was outstanding.  There was plenty of twists and turns, that kept me guessing until the very end.  The film has held up well to the test of time, and is worth a couple of viewings to pick up on all the subtle plot twists.
B00846REIS|4.0|Are E.L James and Sylvia Day personal friends or were they comparing notes when they wrote their books?  This book is very similar to the Fifty Shades of Gray series, with a little different twist. If you liked Fifty Shades, you'll like this book. Can't wait for Book 2!
B004ZN9YNC|3.0|That's basically what this record is; for, by this point, Floyd were merely in name only and Waters had virtually relinquished control of this piece along with Michael Kamen whom had replaced the departed Richard Wright, and James Guthrie(co-producer and engineer formerly of the Wall Opus) whom are credited as joint co-producers of this project. While most of these numbers were leftovers from the Wall set 3 yrs prior, there is a significant theme which deals basically with the loss of Roger's father and the post-war world he would come of age in following father's absence. The mood that permeates throughout is somewhat bitter, pondering, sparse but also compelling in parts, which for Waters personally, is a profound achievement. Unfortunately, David Gilmour and Nick Mason are delegated to \\"session personnel\\" status for the most part, even though they are just as important musically to the construction of this record, regardless.<br /><br />The beginning first part to this record which includes The Post War Dream, Your Possible Pasts, One of the Few and When the Tigers Broke Free(included on the '04 remaster, originally appearing first in the Wall movie) has Roger laying out his anguish and frustration within the concept of War, the perils it causes and gives a most cynical view to the outside world around him. In some ways, this record moves like a movie would from strength to strength and in doing so, becomes wanting in that respect; once again, its certainly a lyrical achievement for Waters. The Gunner's Dream recalls a bit of the Wall flavor in its middle section, while Paranoid Eyes is one of the few(no pun intended) melodically driven ballads that achieves a certain empty charm to itself. Gilmour finally gets in some great guitar passages on the title cut, that features one of his trademark solos, and the uptempo, yet deadly cynical Not Now John, which would be the sole single featured from the album. Fletcher Memorial Home and Southhampton Dock also contain acertain style of passion and charm which can draw one further into the duration of the record. Two Suns in the Sunset closes out the piece with a calming quality that has Andy Newmark replacing Nick Mason and Rapahael Ravenscroft offers some fine saxophone work at the end of the number, oddly replacing perhaps, a credible Gilmour solo, which would've done just as equally well for the track, but that's only a personal note of contention.<br /><br />Overall, I think the Final Cut succeeds well as a Roger Waters solo record, a true Pink Floyd record, it is not. 1. Because of the absence of Richard Wright(although Michael Kamen does an excellent job) and 2. No input from either Wright or more importantly, David Gilmour within the songwriting aspects of the piece. The Final Cut is not one I listen to on a casual basis, but when I do \\"get into it\\", its definitely an interesting journey, nonetheless. 3 and half stars.
0143039482|2.0|I liked The Grapes of Wrath, so I decided to give this Steinbeck novel a whirl. While the book did delve deep into the characters and their personalities, the characters are completely boring and the book was a snooze fest. In fact, several times I found myself reaching for this book when I was having trouble getting to sleep some nights. Worked like a charm.<br /><br />The subject matter is drab, and the characters are less than enchanting. You can tell from near the beginning of the book that this \\"moral man\\" (Ethan) is eventually going to decide that succeeding in the world is more important to him than his ethics. Surprise, surprise, another fool sells his soul in the pursuit of wealth.<br /><br />Steinbeck is known for being a master of the English language, and I won't argue with that. The use of words and phrases in this book are obviously brilliant, however, that is ALL this book has going for it. I agree with how one other reviewer described this book as \\"a silly, tiresome book that is micro-smart, and macro-dumb, dumb, dumb\\".
B000T05R8Q|4.0|I purchased this upon its release in 2007 and I was most pleased at the inclusion of both the mono and stereo mixes of the album itself. I originally owned the EMI reissue Vinyl copy(which was the stereo version) from 1983 and still have it to this day, for safe-keeping purposes. There is no doubt as to the significance of Syd Barrett and his paramount influence on Pink Floyd as well as modern music in general and the birth of psychedelic rock music within this album. I do prefer the mono mix over the stereo one as I have found to be the case with most classic 60's albums over the course of technology's ever changing and evolving practices in the perfection of audio listening. If one puts on headphones, you can certainly hear the differences in instrumentation and vocals coming to the fore within the mono version of this historic recording as opposed to the lesser quality of its stereo mix counterpart.<br /><br />That being said, Piper at the Gates of Dawn is Syd Barrett and Pink Floyd's unknowing masterpiece debut and although Syd's time would be extremely short due to the victim of psychedelic substances and the rapid rise to fame running parallel with his gradual mental breakdown, Piper remains the template for future Floyd releases and unwittingly so, the group would continue to return to Syd for lyrical inspirations on records like Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here and The Wall, most prominently. Astronomy Domine opens the record with radio control chatter, before emerging from within Richard Wrights' keyboards and Syd's slide guitar voicings coupled with Roger Waters' solid bass lines and Nick Mason's raga-like drum rhythms. The lyrics depict of course, planetary references and space travel which makes for an otherworldly theme to delve oneself into. Lucifer Sam is a bit more grounded in its main melody line, almost sounding like a James Bond theme song in parts, yet Barrett's lyrics and vocal style help to distinguish this number into ultimate originality with a psychedelic flavor. Matilda Mother features Richard Wright on lead vocal and is a pastoral-like song flavored with interesting imagery within its lyrical scheme of a fairy tale. Barrett harmonizes with Richard within the chorus and also takes the lead vocal during the bridge parts as well. Flaming is drenched within psychedelia and seems a bit dated in spots but also is a strong number from the pen of Syd.<br /><br />Pow R. Toc H. is an instrumental replete with catcalls, whistles and bird cries backed by instrumentation that is slightly meandering in parts, but is also enjoyable after repeated listens. Other major tracks of mention are the poppy/folk numbers in The Gnome and The Scarecrow which feature Barrett at his most playful and childlike sense of innocence and imagination. Interstellar Overdrive is another classic psychedelic instrumental offering that when performed live could stretch out to 15 min or more allowing the band to open improvisation given the challenge. Chapter 24, like the previous Matilda Mother, is equally pastoral in its arrangement and appears to take quotes from the I Ching transcedental form of mind expanding religious law; interesting stuff there! Bike closes out the record in a somewhat jarring fashion, coupled with Barrett's sardonic sense of humor interlaid to boot.<br /><br />Disc 3 of this mini-box reissue features 3 Floyd singles in Arnold Layne(the band's first hit, predating Piper), See Emily Play, and the band's last single before Barrett became unglued, Apples and Oranges. The b-sides Candy and a Current Bun and Paintbox are also featured as well. There are also alternate takes of Interstellar Overdrive, a stereo mix of Apples and Oranges and an alternate version of Matilda Mother included as well. Given the extensive background of this record, Floyd freaks should definitely pick up this 3 disc set as its designed rather caringly with a cloth book style binding and also features a replica of a Barrett drawing from his art college days for added incentive. This set gets 4 stars from me for being an excellent reissue to a most classic offering from one of England's most influentual bands' of its time.

B004ZN9Q3K|4.0|After the overindulged experimental UmmaGumma set and the interesting, but uneven Atom Heart Mother disc, Meddle follows within a more successful approach and shows further growth within the band's songwriting aspects as well as an ever tightening performing unit in the process. One of These Days opens the record with an impenetrable driving bass line which is constant throughout the instrumentals' duration. Mason's drumming propels the number along with Rick Wright's ethereal keyboards and David Gilmour's winding guitar lines which sets the tone for the album's centerpiece in Echoes. Although Echoes takes up the entire second side of the record, it is certainly the precursor for the group's best selling album Dark Side of the Moon within its instrumental as well as lyrical themes and is probably one of my top favorite Floyd pieces of all time. I could dissect and point out its significances as to pre-Dark Side, but I'll leave it to the listener to discover the beauty of this classic number. The other tracks on offer, A Pillow of Winds and Fearless are delightful songs which can be overlooked upon when analyzing Pink Floyd's extensive catalogue at times, but should never be underestimated for their sense of melody and profound musical qualities. Winds is a quiet and lush acoustic number which makes the listener feel as if they were floating through the clouds with Gilmour during the tracks duration. Fearless has an acoustic driven melody of punch and is quite a melodic anomaly within the Floyd's prodious songlists; again it is just as important within their early days of constructing drawn out and fixed improvisational longer pieces, but proves they were capable of 3-4 minute shorter song structures within the process. San Tropez is written by Waters and is a cocktail-style ditty which is a bit tongue in cheek, but also entertaining enough to warrant merit. Seamus, on the other hand, seems like an outtake from the Ummagumma record previous and is basically a throwaway.<br /><br />I like Meddle upon the strength of Echoes, which is its most significant number, but the other tracks are just as worthy and makes the listening experience of Meddle a most intriguing and quality one. 4 stars
0425263908|1.0|I'm not even sure how this author got past publishing this novel. Plagiarism to the fullest. No unique imagination. It's the east coast story of Fifty Shades of Grey. It's sad to say that it's considered one of the most recommended books, if you loved reading Fifty. Reading it, I just wanted to cry.  I forced myself to finish it, constantly hoping it'll get better. I felt absolutely no connection/romance between the two main characters; as if she just rushed through the introduction scenes to get to the sex. . . . .  I guess my comparison about this book would be like the people that read Twilight and then watched the movie... HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT

B000JMKTLO|5.0|I first read Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl and enjoyed it so much that I decided to read her other two offerings.  I was not disappointed.<br /><br />This novel follows Camille, who is a reporter in Chicago. Camille herself has her own demons, in that she lost a sister when they were children.  She has been self-mutilating for years, drawing words all over her body.  In the small town where she grew up, two little girls have disappeared (months apart) and she has been sent to get the story.  She moves back in with her mother, stepfather, and much younger sister.  The demons become louder as she travels over the familiar territory of her childhood.<br /><br />There are a lot of folks who could have committed the crimes and Flynn does a good job of making every explanation plausible.  I didn't love Camille as a character, but the book did keep me intrigued.  Camille grew on me over the book and I did love her relationship with her editor.<br /><br />Very well done.  Highly recommend.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|very good rendition of the musical i have seen a dozen times in London. the music and stageing are fabulous.
B0027MJU00|5.0|The story follows Libby, who is the sole survivor of her brother's murderous rampage that took out their mother and two sisters.  Libby was 7 and testified against her brother, who went to prison for life.  Libby has been living off of the money that was raised for her during that time, but it's now gone and she has to figure out what to do to make money quickly.  She is contacted by a man who is in a group that follows her family's case and he offers to pay her if she comes and talks to them.  She is surprised to learn that the group believes that her brother is innocent.<br /><br />Flynn uses three points of view to tell the story:  Libby's, her brother Ben's, and her mother's.  I really enjoyed this tactic and it made the story deeper.  Libby is not a particularly lovable character - and really none of Flynn's characters are.  Their flaws are deep, but you can't help but get pulled into their lives.  This one, while a very long story, was hard to put down.<br /><br />Highly recommend.

B005LAII0I|4.0|We all know the story, and this version doesn't offer any stunning insights.  The evil queen is still jealous and obsessed with being the fairest in the land.  Snow White is still sweet and innocent, although a bit tougher than the traditional princess.  The dwarves are still mostly comic relief, with a few interesting twists like walking on stilts, slapping the prince, and doing Snow White's hair and makeup.  The handsome prince is still basically one-dimensional. Nevertheless, this is a fun and funny movie, from the queen's opening monolouge to the Bollywood dance at the end.  Perhaps the best thing about this movie is that it doesn't try to take itself seriously.

Ultimately, \\"Defending Jacob\\" puts a thought-provoking and poignant spin on what could have been a cliche tale, and provides a shocking ending that will leave the wheels of your mind spinning for hours afterward.

If you've seen the film \\"A Perfect Getaway\\", then you might have some idea as to how this is going to end: not until everything you believe is twisted, then turned completely upside down.  Is \\"Gone Girl\\" well-written?  Extremely.  Gillian Flynn has a beautifully graceful style all her own.  And yet, this plot - which actually feels like a lack thereof - leaves MUCH to be desired.  Ultimately, the characters are not particularly likable and the plot twists so many times that you will be left wondering, simply: WHEN WILL IT END?

B0059XTTW8|2.0|I generally consider myself a patient and open-minded film viewer. Rarely do I absolutely hate a film, and when I do it is typically a Michael Bay train wreck or a made-for-TV SyFy channel mess. If a film has some sort of true effort behind it, I can generally find something to like about it.<br /><br />Until this film.<br /><br />It was two hours of random (and poorly indicated) flashbacks, characters with no background and no reason for me to care about them, and a horrible score behind it all.<br /><br />The end, which I think was supposed to pack an emotional punch, acted more as a relief, an \\"OK, it's finally over\\" signal that I could now remove this turd from my DVD player and not feel like I didn't give it a chance due to missing something.<br /><br />If there is ANY redeeming quality, it was that the actors were very good. Sadly, the story and direction were abysmal and their talents wasted.<br /><br />I imagine that those who read the book might like this film a bit more, given that I'm sure the characters are far more fleshed out, and the story more detailed and cohesive. Sadly, this film feels more like a very long \\"CliffNotes\\" of a story, that seems to jump from one key event to another with all of the rhyme and reason and character development eliminated.<br /><br />It's not a film that rewards patience. I am plenty patient. The issue is that there's just nothing there to be patient for. It's a drama with NO DRAMA.
B005FITIF0|3.0|There are numerous things wrong with this movie beginning with the title (sounds like something Tarantino or Rodriquez would make) and ending with its 2+ hour length.  There's also plenty right, perhaps beginning and ending with bringing attention to the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of innocent people on the African continent.<br /><br />You never know how much of the depicted events of a \\"true\\" story really happen but the overview seems uncontested.  Gang member and heroin addict Sam Childers (Gerard Butler) is released from a prison stint to find that his wife (Michelle Monaghan) has retired from her lucrative pole dancing career to work as a clerk.  It seems she has found Jesus and has been reborn.  After a hellish night on smack where Sam and his best friend Donnie (Michael Shannon) nearly kill a hitch hiker, Sam also sees the light.<br /><br />After Sam's conversion he has 2 missions.  One is to build a church and nursery in his eastern Pennsylvania community and second, to help the people of northern Uganda and southern Sudan which is being overrun by the Lord's Resistance Army headed by the vile Joseph Kony.  When Sam has some success in Pennsylvania, he underestimates the violence and political issues in Africa.  He has problems raising money, so begins to borrow against his house and eventually sells his successful construction business.  Sam slips off the deep end often.  Too often for my liking.  Still, Lynn (Monaghan) and his daughter (Madeline Carroll) stick with him even though his violent rages and financial malfeasance would usually bring on a lawyer at some point.<br /><br />This is where the director (Marc Forster) and writer (Jason Keller) seem to get carried away as well.  To their credit, however they don't shy away from the violence and unspeakable horrors that transpire to this day in east Africa.  Some absurdities aside, the film moves quickly and is technically well made.<br /><br />The 1080p transfer is generally well done and consistent with recent movies.  I did notice a bit of flickering on the opening scene but that may have been an aberration.  Overall the contrast is quite good and some of the African landscape is well presented.  The film is shot in 2.40:1 aspect ratio which is carried over here.  Although I don't talk about it much above, the film has numerous scenes of gun battles including automatic weapons, rockets and bombs.  This is well layed out across the 5.1 channels all presented in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio.ent with recent movies.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|A Discovery of Witches, Deborah Harkness' debut novel was quite simply, wonderful! Once I began reading, I realized this was a vampire romance...and it surprised and delighted me!<br /><br />It was like a good vampire novel meets \\"The Da Vinci Code.\\" The protagonists were interesting and complex and the story was exciting without being too ambitious or overcomplicated. Sure, Harkness did her research on everything witches and vampires and added her own spin which held me spellbound; and losing sleep on a number of occasions! I would describe it as a modern day supernatural, romance, with adventure and mystery wrapped into an exceptionally well written book.<br /><br />Diana Bishop is not going to use her magic! (At least, that's what she keeps telling herself.) She is the last in a long line of powerful witches, with a father as powerful as her mother. Tragically, having lost her parents when she was seven years old has bittered her taste of her heritage and her magic. While researching alchemical manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, she comes in contact with a \\"volume\\" that actually recognized her magic. A little freaked out, Diana returns the book to the stacks, but it is too late - word is out that she has discovered the lost \\"Ashmole 782\\" and now all species have been made aware and are after her.<br /><br />Enter Matthew Clairmont, renowned scientist and not so well known, vampire. He has been searching for Ashmole 782 for centuries as it holds answers to secrets of his kind and others that need to be discovered. He is determined to retrieve the book Diana's magic has recalled. Matthew immediately feels drawn to Diana, feeling the need to protect her from the other creatures; despite witches and vampires being notorious separatists. They are thrown into an uneasy friendship when the worlds of witches, vampires and daemons descend upon Diana, all looking for the manuscript.<br /><br />A Discovery of Witches is one of my all-time favorite books and was clearly written to have a sequel. The conversation Matthew and Diana had when she began asking questions about what being a \\"vampire\\" entails was one of my favorite chapters! Additinoally, this novel had moments of humor and sadness and a mix of uneasiness-looking-over-your-shoulder kind of feel throughout and the writing was intelligent with wonderful intrigue, romance and history. I am ANXIOUSLY awaiting the release of the second book in July, 2012!itten to have a sequel.

B004ZISVWC|5.0|Brilliant found footage film on a subject that, to my knowledge, has never been given serious focus on the big screen. I watched this because I was thrilled to see trolls (opposed to vampires, demons, or [insert cliche monster type here]) given some attention. The documentary style was well executed, and this film does serious service for its genre. I'm pleased to see so many positive reviews for this gem of a production, and I wish there were more films out there like it.<br />I can't wait to watch it again with other people.

1451608659|2.0|Dominique Moceanu used to live a fascinating life. She won an Olympic gold medal, emancipated herself from her psycho control-freak thief father and doormat mother, and later discovered a biological sister who shares her athletic prowess. She is now a mundane suburbanite mother-wife, and the book reads as such. The writing is colorless and bland. The book's subject matters (Olympic glory, parental abuse, the Karolyi couple, a \\"drug and alcohol\\" stage which apparently consisted of having a few beers and joints with friends and trying ecstasy like one freakin' time, and her crazy father trying to hire hitmen to knock off his rivals should make one hell of a book. I don't know these authors are who assisted Dominiqe in writing this book, but their style is very bland. The details of the Karolyi abuse were interesting but not shocking. Anyone who has an ounce of human intuition could have guessed that Bela is a phony and Marta has a superiority complex. Hell, they just pulled the same stuff with Chellsie Memmel. Also, I could have done without all the \\"my kids and husband are just so special blah blah blah\\" crap because who the hell cares. I guess you'd love this book if you were twelve years old, into gymnastics, and hadn't many reading skills. If you're an adult into gymnastics, you might think it's ok. Don't get your hopes too high, though.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Why did this game get created without easier ways to get investment points?  These points are very hard to get unless you can afford to spend you own hard earned money. The game costs $4.99 to start out, then we have to spend even more for investment points & city credits. I think if you charge for a game, then the investment points should be free & plentiful  and more people would buy the game and give better reviews!! This should be worth something so fix this game, then I might buy more of your games.
B00005V9IK|5.0|INDEPENDENCE DAY was one of the huge summer blockbusters of 1996. Since then it has thrived on DVD and especially on cable, where, if it isn't on SOME channel every week I begin to worry that the Apocalypse is truly upon us.<br /><br />A fun homage to the \\"Samuel Z. Arkoff Presents American International Pictures' Hubcap-on-a-String-Against-a-Blue-Sky-Background\\" black & white alien invasion epics of the 1950s, INDEPENDENCE DAY has all the requisites: The goofy scientist who's been locked in his lab too long, the cynical government official, the smart general, the President willing to save the world by leading the good guys into battle, the cocky superheroic fighter pilot, the discredited scientist who saves the world by discovering that the aliens are fatally allergic to room freshener, the wise elder, the washed-out nutcase claiming to have been abducted by the aliens, and the pretty girl who knows it all (as an added bonus it actually has TWO).<br /><br />It also has really yicky-poo-poo slimy yuck aliens who are a cross between arthropods, cephalopods, and human beings. They want to do nothing more than kill us, of course, and to do so they have a Destructo-Ray of some sort that makes Hiroshima look like a clambake.<br /><br />After the Y.-P.-P.S.Y. Aliens wipe out four-fifths of humanity, the Discredited Scientist (played by Jeff Goldblum) comes up with his world-saving idea, which inevitably requires that he and Cocky Superheroic Fighter Pilot (Will Smith) have to sneak aboard the aliens' orbiting hubcap while the World-Saving President (Bill Pullman), who, by the way hates Discredited Scientist, leads the rest of the world into an alien-distracting battle. The day is saved by Washed-Out-Nutcase (Randy Quaid---thanks commenter!---who is maybe not acting at all). And it all happens on---wait for it!---the FOURTH OF JULY!!!!  Yay, America!<br /><br />Think these are spoilers? Don't despair. If you watched CREATURE FEATURES, CHILLER THEATER, or FRIGHT NIGHT growing up (or MST 3000, if you're younger), you've seen INDEPENDENCE DAY in one form or another. No cliche is left unused. No gaping plothole is filled in.<br /><br />And even if you've seen INDEPENDENCE DAY itself, it's a picture that, miraculously, never wears itself out. You can watch this thing 500,000 times and it's still amusing, exciting, and even, cornily, moving in spots. And though it's corny and flaky and even corn-flaky, it never fails to entertain, and that's the sign of a REALLY GREAT FILM. It's the CITIZEN KANE of its genre.<br /><br />Considering that it was budgeted at $75,000,000 and that it's brought in almost $820,000,000 since its release---we can assume that a few people have seen this movie and liked it.

B008NAFU9A|5.0|This novella was beyond wonderful!!!  This novella takes place in 1808 and sets the stage for what is to come for The Forever Girl, which is also a must read!!!  Ophelia, a maid in a wealthy household, must figure out who she is while dealing with what the universe has determined to be her destiny. All of this is brought to life by the handsome Ethan as he reveals what her life is to be. Together they must battle their inner demons as they both try to commit to the cards the Universe has dealt them.<br /><br />Ophelia makes for an extremely relatable ingenue. You can feel her passion while you live through her struggles. Rebecca Hamilton doesn't just create characters, she makes  real, relatable people for her audience to truly identify with. Wonderful writing and a wonderful author!! I highly recommend this novella!!

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this little game, never freezes up on my kindle fire. I have always been a big scrat fan since day one. guess I am just a kid at heart
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book in one sitting! Once I got past the first chapter, I was done for! The story pulled me in and I went through a roller-coaster of emotions.  The story was so \\"real.\\" Every emotion that Abby went through I felt, it gripped me and pulled at my heartstrings knowing how Travis felt about Abby and his desperation to be with her. This book had me laughing and tearing up and feeling angry all at once-it was so RIVETING!  Great story, great writing and wonderful characters.  This book is a MUST READ!
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Awesome product! It is plastic, so not quite what you want if you're looking for replicas. I find it a bit hilarious that is takes a real screwdriver to put the batteries in your sonic. The pen and UV tips are small, but I love my sonic screwdriver! It's great for teen aged people, because it's usable and fun. It's easy enough to explain why you need this!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I'm too old to appreciate this novel.<br />I can't imagine writing three novels based on the subject and I can't believe there are two more books.
B000MQ560G|5.0|The 2007 repress of this is extremely high quality, 180 gram high quality vinyl with a very nice gate fold cover. The sound is unbelievable, however I haven't heard the original pressing to compare it to. It doesn't sound compressed or distorted... I recommend picking this up. I had to order mine from Germany, and it was well worth it. The repress of Depeche Mode Music for the Masses is excellent also.<br /><br />If you are wondering if you should buy this album for the first time there is no question about it.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great free app.  Many effects and music tracks, and for 2.99 you can get more for you crazed insomaniacs.  Only thing i didn't like was some effects don't loop as smooth as they should.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|Bought this book without knowing much about it, and I can only say WOW. I think the actual style of writting is almost childlike but the content certainly isn't. Its such a hoot that a women is going to make a bucket load of cash for badly written porn, but you go girl! I wish my early twenties was that provocative but alas I only had a normal time like 99.9% of us. Read all three books in ten days, then needed a break. Ha
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|The camera continues to sway back and forth no matter how much adjusting I do. When I contacted Opteka and told them that after I watched all the videos and tried everything, they just said \\"sorry. We can't help you\\" You're better off saving the couple hundred bucks and doing steady vid the backyard way with your tripod or PVC pipes. All in all it doesn't really work and is not worth the price it costs.
B005AUWY90|4.0|Pleasantly surprised by the sequel. It's definitely a nice weekend, kick-back movie. Not quite as good as the first, but its still a lot of fun to watch.
0345803485|1.0|I had to see what all the fuss was about. But in this case, I found out what the fuss ISN'T about. I didn't even bother reading past the first book. The writing is ridiculous, and character development is poor. If you like smut, there are MUCH better books than this one! The author describes things in exactly the same manner over and over and over until you want to pull your hair out or reach for the brain bleach to erase this literary atrocity from your memory.

B002BAWIWU|5.0|This is a collection of songs that I have been trying to find for a while. Every one of these songs is great, and of course, you can't go wrong with George Harrison! Absolutely love it!
B007SGM084|5.0|Without trying to put out the spoilers for those who haven't read the entire trilogy, this was an easy read.  There are cliche type settings, repetitive phrasing which does grow irritating at times but overall, I found myself not wanting to put the book down.  Now that I have read them all, I simply want to read them again.  The exploration of two people on emotional, physical and sexual limitations is what this book boils down to.  There are parts of the story line that just feel a little too fictional, however, the book can captivate you enough to hold you.  I found Christian Grey to be a strong, sexy, dominating and controlling character who in turn, was at times a childish, weak, and a scared young man.  His character did interest me the most. Ana, had an inexperience that in this day and time seems odd, but inticing just the same.  Her character was a simple battle of a woman trying to learn how to balance the power shift between a man and woman, explore new levels about herself and her lover with little to no experience is the area so I did find myself somewhat yelling at her and her way of handling things from time to time.  But try to remember the age of the characters.  For those who feel it is impossible to be 27/28 and a billionaire mogul .... you just may not know one is all but I am sure they are out there, and most are not in the public eye enough for you to know their business so to claim this as an impossibility is presumtuous of those reviewers.  Still it is fiction.  So just let the book take you out of your day and enjoy it.<br /><br />The sexual content was quite frankly steamy (very steamy), descriptive, triggering, titilating and though many claim \\"nobody orgasms that much\\", \\"its mommy porn\\", \\"No one has that much sex\\", or claims it to be abusive .... try to read through it with an open mind.  Although BSDM is reflected in the reading it is rather light in comparison to what it could have been.  For those that feel the sex was just too much, try to remember the height of your first sexual encounters with a new partner.  If you were lucky and that partner is more than just a passing, then this read didn't include too much sex, too many orgasms and I don't see anything wrong with a little steamy suggestive reading that can take me away to another place like this read did.  Unrealistic, sure in many ways.  Seductive and leaving many of us wanting more .... absolutely.<br /><br />This is not my typical reading.  This is not normally something I would search out to read, but once involved in the book I have found myself exploring other reads that may offer me some of these aspects.  So many days we get caught up in the mundane and routines, this particular story line leaves me wanting to get back to the steamy, uninhibited sexual escapades I have with my husband.  Nothing wrong with that at all.
B005LAJ212|4.0|While not marketed (at least at first) as a night time soap, Revenge warmly embraced its soapiness a third of the way through the first season as it slowly moved from the  'who will she get revenge on this week' formula to a much more enjoyable serialized drama.  It even pays not so subtle homage to soaps that came before it.  While never as campy as Dynasty, it's almost as grand.  And while it never quite develops the family dysfunction of Dallas, it comes close.  There are some plot holes that viewers will likely need to forgive.  And if I'm being picky, the show peaked three quarters of the way through, almost as if they were picked up for additional shows with little warning.  But what really sets this show apart from most modern day soaps and much of non-soaps as well is that it wonderfully allows the two female leads to drive all story.  Emily kicks butt both mentally and physically.  When was the last time we saw a soap with such a wonderfully wounded yet strong heroine?  You won't see Emily sacrificing herself for a man like on all of the destroyed daytime serials.  You won't see her backdown to anyone, including Grayson Matriarch (played deliciously by M. Stowe) and their scenes are some of the best highlights from a very strong season.  I hope the writing gets a bit tighter in the second season.  And I hope they resist the urge to go campy and over the top.  While it can't quite be called a thinking fan's soap, it's certainly doesn't require the viewer to lower his/her IQ to enjoy.  Lovers of the strong female soap heroine should NOT miss this one!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was a excellent book. My friends and I are still screaming over how good it is. The plot is slower at first, but it picks up and the ending left me crying. (From both the sad part and the fact that I want House of Hades really bad.)<br />I'm glad that Mr. Rick Riordan  had Nico ( my favorite charicture) again, and that the plot wasn't just battles. All and all a good read<br /><br />another year oh gosh...

B005HV6Y5W|5.0|One of the things I like about this movie is that it has many layers. In the first layer we watch the story of a family. It's a simple story but very nicely told. And the actors go quite well. In a second layer, the mother and father represent more than themselves. They are the duality of the world where love and wrath co-exist. As our main character is torn apart by this duality we watch him go through an emotional journey of love and forgiveness. As the character makes that journey, he takes us along with him, helping us forgive God for this world of pain but also of love.<br /><br />The movie is beautifully shooted. The sequence of images and music takes you into an emotional state pushing you to understand the movie not just with your head but also with your heart. To truly appreciate the movie you need to go along with it, not trying to overprocess its meaning too much.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I have been so pleasantly surprised by this book, especially for it's $2.50 price tag in the Amazon store. I had just finished book five of GRRM's Song of Ice and Fire and was looking for something else to occupy my time. This was it! and it can't be passed up for that price. I never really review books, but I felt this one really deserves it and needs to be shared.<br /><br />My first thought about this book, to generalize, is Harry Potter meets Medieval Fantasy. You have a young boy who's semi-famous before he even realizes it and only increases this throughout his coming-of-age story after being thrown into a militaristic, \\"special forces\\" type order. He meets and bonds with a close group of friends who together overcome obstacles and challenges all the while solving mysteries to his parentage and past revealing bigger mysteries about the world around them.<br /><br />It really is a great read that's kept me hooked and eager to know what comes next, something many are unable to do. The characters are easy to like and grow attached to, making you really enjoy the camaraderie. I definitely look forward to future books and have found a new series to follow.<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give 5 stars, is the typos. This book really is riddled with errors, some very blatant, others subtle flow issues. Being a slightly OCD person, these can really start to add up and bug me. Luckily the story and characters are so great that it's easy to look past this.
B0086700CM|4.0|One of the better games on the market.  Fun, with some great graphics.  A good way to kill some time.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game absolutely love it! I play it every day because its sooooo much fun! cant wait for you to get this game!
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This is a really great recording.  All of the songs are great (with the exception of some drummer mishaps on a few songs).  My favorite songs are (in order) \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" (with the exception of the spaceship sounds at the end...I could have done WITHOUT that noise), \\"Ah Yeah\\", and \\"Afro Blue\\".  So, I had to rearrange the order of the music to my liking.  The ensemble \\"cast\\" on the recording is also great.  If you're looking for pure jazz, this is not it.  So, move along to something else.  This is more akin to a Hidden Beach Unwrapped recording.  However, those are cool, too.  Good music to just \\"chill out\\" to.  Anyway, you should really check it out!! You won't be disappointed.

August is a great little boy. His story is so well told. He lives in the real world, we learn of his introduction to it.<br />Buy this book,  Because I am keeping my copy.

B000T457WS|4.0|Action packed testosterone boosted flick with an unending body count and continual fist-fighting that only a man could think up. I liked it anyway, 5 thumbs up for Icecube and the rest of the cast. Just not recommended for family viewing, and definitely not for children under 16. Contrary to some of the racist viewers posting here, I thought Icecube did an excellent job, and was extremely articulate. Good job.
B002NHIK1E|5.0|I love to read so normally I would have picked up the books before I watched the show but a good friend told me the show was actually better and I think I agree. I read the first couple chapters of the first book and I have to say I much prefer Nina Dobrev's portrayal of Elena to the character in the book. Every actor on this show does such a stellar job and the writing is fantastic. The characters are incredibly well acted, the writers keep you coming back for more with unexpected twists and turns, I love their take on vampire/supernatural lore and I find myself engrossed the way I would be with a really good book. Plus, who wouldn't want to watch at Ian Somerhalder for 43 minutes? Can you say 'eye candy'? It really is no wonder why this is the CW's higest rated show.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love. Love. Love.<br /><br />Honestly I knew very little about this series or author before I started reading City of Bones.  I have now read a little online about the 'Cassandra Clare Controversy' and I couldn't care less about any of it. All I know is that I loved this book and will be reading all of the books in this series and any other books this author writes.<br /><br />I love the world she has created. I love the characters. I love the pace. I love it all.  And that is all that matters at the end of the day. If you like Fantasy and Paranormal then I would strongly suggest this book and series.
B005MVLI8A|1.0|Album and music are classic and superb...  The \\"remastering\\" is horrendous!  Terrible clipping, distortion all over the place.  If you want an easy test just purchase the MP3 versions of Lithium off the remastered edition and the original single album.  Vocals are distorted, percussion is muted by overboosted guitar and bass.  Give me a break!  There is next to no dynamic range and compression distortion everywhere.  Read the other reviews, this is noticeable even with modest listening equipment.  Skip the remastered and get the original.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I brought this book after hearing from some girlfriends and reading the reviews. Have not had the chance to read yet - but i cannot wait to have some down time to read. I can say that the ordering and delivery process were as simple as 1-2-3 and I love that. WOuld do business again.
B0088RQ4X4|3.0|Ive read the carter and carson books since I went to the boys club libery at a much younger age. When I heard of the movie I went back and reread all the books again. they were as action packed as they were when I was small, but as an adult the story did not have the excitement I expected, nor did the movie. The show would be exciteing to kids, but it did not have the character building ingredients of the original books. admittedly these ideas of fair play, good will win in the end over evil,chivelry. many ideas which in todays society are becomeing irrelevent were not present in the film. The movie was full of special effects which were great but the story lacked something.
B0087DFIOU|3.0|I'm a huge Mel Gibson fan. I bought this movie without reading what it was even about just because he is in it. I had a hard time getting into this movie. It is so far out from what I am used to comming from him. It's ok...it's something to watch...but I'll probably never watch it again. It will most likley just sit on my shelf. I was shocked it wasn't in the theater...that it just went straight to Dvd. But after watching it I see why. This would be a movie more to rent than to own in my oppinion.

B0083TXXZ4|5.0|The nerf elite hailfire is the flagship blaster for N-strike elite, and it deserves that position. The blaster itself is surprisingly small, but in the end it proves more advantageous on the field. Concerning the capacity of the blaster, it doesnt really have a set capacity, with 8 6 round clips u get 48 rounds, with 8 12 round clips u get 96 rounds, with 8 18 round clips u get 144[which is the advertised capacity].The rate of fire is astounding! I've managed to crank out almost six shots a second on it. The accuracy leaves something to be desired, but a simple fix is to squeeze a bb into the tip of the elite darts through the small hole in the tip. The range is very good for an unmodified nerf gun getting about 50-57 feet flat, but to achieve the advertised distance of seventy-five feet u must angle the gun. Also worth mention is that if you do rapid fire, there will be a 10-15 foot range decrease.<br /><br />Overall an amazing blaster,easily scoring a 9/10. Nerf, you've really out done urself this time.

Maybe not, I ordered the mp3 version for my kindle fire so I haven't read the liner notes. The songs on this album are great. If you are a Norah Jones fan you will like them. But if your name is Mirium and you messed with her boyfriend - lookout! The words are chilling but the melody sticks in your brain.

B0006ZFQNU|3.0|Time audits our labours. The Amadeus Quartet served their day honourably. These performances of Mozart's string quintets with Cecil Aronowitz were recorded in the late Sixties. How have they aged?<br /><br />The Colossi of Memnon, sad to say, are holding up better. I am no fan of the Amadeus Quartet per se. The cellist, violist and second violinist are a shade anonymous as players. Norbert Brainin is the binary opposite but he so grates on the ear - one can never mistake him for Siegmund Nissel. As an ensemble, there is a lumpiness to the playing which brings porridge to mind. It is bewildering that anyone could trumpet their virtues unless nostalgia is brought into play. For whatever reason, DG never did the Amadeus Quartet any favours; be they shrill, synthetic or shallow, their recordings are never state-of-the-art. These performances are no exception.<br /><br />Turn your attention to K 614 - a masterpiece in anyone's language. Does anyone really think this is how to play its slow movement - rough and ready with little or no surface sheen or integration in depth? Such be the rawness, the Amadeus could almost pass as a quartet fresh from the conservatorium.  K 174 is devoid of finesse. Throughout this survey, I am astounded by the inability of the Amadeus Quartet (and their ring-in) to convey \\"stillness in motion\\" - to wit, their semi-prosaic renditions of the slow movements of the C Major and the G Minor. I like their pacing in the first movement of the latter, even if they fail to convey the tempest in its recapitulation; Grumiaux and gang, among others, trump them at this point. Like so many other accounts, the performance of K 406 fails to banish memories of Mozart's original arrangement for winds.<br /><br />The Grumiaux alternative is far preferable. Longevity is theirs.

B0050XFY4O|5.0|I am giving 5 stars, however this reflects being a low budget film. The reason I say this is for the poor development of the characters. For instance, Pedro and Julietta die as if a switch had been flipped. This is was crucial and overlooked as far as the story line goes, because these were the only two people that could have interdicted this tragic and heartbreaking love story. Otherwise, it was visually pleasant, some of the music was good, and it turned me on to Hilda Hilst(which was the biggest gift for me).
B002OSY2T6|4.0|I received this as a gift. My child loves this toy. We're not crazy about toys that make noise, but I guess that's what relatives are for! The one design flaw it has is that the head and tail rotate very easily. So if the toy is laying on its side and your baby pushes the tail, chances are they are going to get whacked by the head. LIkewise if your baby is a crawler. If he crawls up to it and grabs the tail, he'll often get whacked in the face by the head. Think teeter-totter. I wouldn't necessarily call it unsafe. It'd be pretty tough for them to whack themselves too hard. And it does keep him entertained, which is all that really matters.

B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Chris Evans, Hugo Weaving, Tommy Lee Jones and Hayley<br />Atwell star in this 2011 action film based on the marvel<br />comics. A young soldier becomes a symbol for freedom<br />and faces an evil German leader. Chris is great in this,<br />it's nice to see him as another superhero and Hugo is<br />always a good villain. This dvd has nice picture and<br />sound plus some neat extras. This is a pretty good<br />comic book film I recommend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|THIS IS THE WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ! I can't believe I wasted fifteen dollars on this crap. I heard so many great things about this book and a lot of my mother's friend recommended it but they obviously do not know what quality literature is. There are so many things wrong with this book it would take me days to name them all.<br /><br />First of all, the lack of plot. At first I thought it was just slow but as I got further into the book (about 5 chapters) I realized there is no plot whatsoever! Absolutely nothing happens! They meet, Ana falls madly in love, they have sex a bunch of times, the end! I'm sorry, but plot is sort of necessary in a decent story.<br /><br />Second of all, the characters are horrible! Frankly, Ana is plain irritating. She is naive and weak-minded and if she had even a fraction of the common sense a normal woman had there would be no story! She would have heard his warning and walked away like she should have. The other characters are irrelevant. James tries to make them important to the story but they're basically extras on a movie set. They're all underdeveloped and complicated beyond comprehension. Christian and Ana must be bi-polar or schizophrenic because they change mind set every paragraph. It's impossible to keep up (as Ana states at least fifteen times in the book).<br /><br />The most annoying thing I found were all the grammatical and punctual mistakes (and there were A LOT). I found out about half way through this book that it was originally a Twilight fan-fiction. IT SHOULD HAVE STAYED A FAN-FICTION. That is the only place where this many mistakes is acceptable. How did this garbage even get published? Did they seriously not notice all these errors in editing? It's extremely distracting to read anything when you get hung up on the author's grammar mistakes.<br /><br />It's great that the author has such a broad vocabulary but she didn't have to use every single word she knows! \\"My medulla oblongata\\"? Really? What the heck is that?! I could barely make it through two sentences without having to use a dictionary or thesaurus! Using large vocabulary doesn't make your story any better! It makes the audience annoyed!<br /><br />The repetition is also annoying. Ana bites/licks her lips, rolls her eyes, smirks, whispers, says/thinks 'Oh', mentions her 'inner goddess', and says/thinks 'Jeez!' at least five hundred times in the ten chapters! Who the heck does this? Certainly not any normal person! The 'Oh' repetition bothers me the most. It's as if she has no reaction to anything! Christian basically just told her he's going to beat the living daylights out of her if she 'disrespects' him and all she can say is 'Oh.\\" WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH HER?! Dear God, and when she refers to her vagina as 'down there' and a condom as 'foil package', I wanted to shoot myself! Ana is a grown woman and she can't say vagina or condom? Really?! Grow up!<br /><br />The dialogue is barely above a third grade level. It's bland and pointless and does nothing for the characters. Dialogue is supposed to reveal something about a character or move the story forward. Since there is no plot it obviously moves the story nowhere and you don't learn anything about Christian until practically the last chapter! Ana on the other hand just spills her guts to some stranger two days after she met him! For an English lit graduate she talks like a twelve year old. I know kindergartners with better vocabulary than her. The author seemed to forget how old her characters are at points because one chapter they sound like adults and can actually have a decent conversation then the next thing you know they're two horny fourteen year olds not wanting to hang up the phone on each other. (\\"You hang up.\\" \\"No, you hang up.\\") Really? You're twenty something adults.<br /><br />Everything in the story is completely unrealistic and unbelievable. It is the year 2011, Ana is a college graduate and she still doesn't have an email address? No, notpossible. Christian is handsome, a billionaire, can play the piano, gives his money to the poor, and is great in bed. I'm sorry but no. Christian shows her his 'Red Room of Pain' and gives her that contract and basically abuses her yet she keeps coming back for more! Any woman with common sense would be running for the hills! It's completely ridiculous. Most of this sounds like something a teenage girl fantasizes about!<br /><br />Finally these so-called 'sex scenes'; they're vanilla at best. Every scene sounds the same! They're not imaginative or creative. They're pathetic. In one scene Christian basically rapes Ana and she actually enjoys it! The whole thing is demeaning and degrading to women! Christian is controlling and bossy from the beginning (which Ana states many times) and he manipulates Ana into thinking she actually enjoys the pain he inflicts. I am disgusted by this. I really can't believe people are calling this a romance novel. There is no romance! It's borderline domestic abuse! I've read better smut/erotica written by THIRTEEN YEAR OLD VIRGINS on fan-fiction sites! I'm sixteen and I've written better romances than this!<br /><br />I seriously can't believe trees had to die for THIS. It's a waste of paper, a waste of your money and your time, and a waste of your brain cells!possible.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|Each edition of the Wool series adds an additional layer of complexity and information, providing insight into previous reading.  Howey does this quite well.  The additional information is socketed into the story without being overly redundant and repetitive.  Bravo!  The characters are well-developed individuals.  The reading level is adult and complex, but the content is appropriate for younger readers.  If you are a parent struggling to find material that is appropriate for a young advanced reader, then the Wool Omnibus edition fits the bill.  In my opinion, both the reading level and content (not the plot) are comparable to the Hunger Games or Ender's Game.  And again, Bravo!

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Let me tell you what, we have probably all of Sherwood's movies and I have to say this is truly great. They have humor, drama, and action all rolled up into one film.<br /><br />They have some new actors in this one that haven't been in their others, but they are great. The whole movie is built around one tragedy that occurs in the movie. I won't tell you what it is, but you will be crying. That's the only reason that I don't like to watch this movie too often because there is a section that is so sad.<br /><br />However, the rest of the movie starts jumping after that. There are actually several great morals throughout the movie. It is a wonderful movie and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it.

Jumping about, mumbling, and feverishly tapping at the keyboard, in a manner similar to a toddler pounding bits of dried cereal into her highchair, while seemingly willing cubes of gibberish to coalesce into a super cube of rotating gibberish is pretty much how it's done in real life!<br /><br />I will now defer to those in the law-enforcement profession, who will be happy to explain why jumping off a cliff in pursuit of a person of whom you wish only to question is, in fact, proper police procedure.<br /><br />Anyway made me laugh and there was Halle Berry boobage - 3 stars!

B00005JLKB|5.0|I've been watching Smallville since day one, and even with the filler episodes it does not disappoint.<br />Smallville updates the Superman legacy into a more modern setting. I truly felt that Superman needed that, especially since before this... I mean all we had were the cartoons and not even they went into Superman's origin with this much detail.<br /><br />Tom Welling, Allison Mack, John Schneider, and Michael Rosenbaum are my favorites of this series. I recognized the woman who plays Martha Kent from previous works, but she's not exactly my favorite actress. Now I don't know if it's the actor or the character (probably both), but the Lana character in this show INCREDIBLY disappoints me. The character is the reason I have not watched Smallville as much as I have. Other than that, it's an incredible show that has twists and turns everywhere.

I love the felt on the  inside cover- it really helps to keep the screen of the Kindle clean.  I highly recommend this case!
B007XNAOS0|4.0|The parallels between Yellow and Green and Pink Floyd's album The Wall are too apparent for this critic to deny. Check this out.  They're both double albums. They're both the point in a bands career where one member of that band becomes a sole visionary for the style and musical direction of the band.  And actually, they sound pretty similar!  While Baroness has always been a heavy metal band at the core, the metal of Yellow and Green is simply window dressing and fuzzed out to the point of alt rock or grunge heaviness.  I know people are freaking out about this and I am a fan of their early stuff as well.  But listen to the First or Second e.p. Then listen to The Blue Album.  Those are so vastly different that you would think they were different bands!  It's in their genes as a band to change, and really, there can only be one Mastodon!!! If you want a heavy album, you have to look elsewhere, this time.  Who can say that next time out, they don't sprinkle in the heavy, or go all out with it!?<br />Now as for the material on this double disc, it's interesting, vast, and lush as the cover art suggests.  It's the combination of Baroness, Pink Floyd's The Wall, and Queen's of the Stone age, with nods to Crosby, Stills, Nash, and Young.  It's like heavy shoegaze bluegrass, sludge/grunge.  Basically, it's elements of songs and sounds you've heard, but recombined in a way that is fresh and unique.  And the singing is very well done, if a little redundant sounding by the end.  There are some standout tracks, \\"Take My Bones Away\\" is probably the most recognizably Baroness sounding song on both albums and \\"Board Up The House\\" is a bouncy, pop-bluegrass-grunge hybrid that could get radio play.  But really, most of the double album is bathed in a luxurious soundscape, that really is instrumentally based.  Some songs are more like notions, or passages, that have maybe one or two features before they transition to something else.  It's definitely meant to be enjoyed as an album!  Let the different themes move you.  Just like the Wall, the album's musical theme reappears here and there throughout and it's uplifting, triumphant sounding guitar gold!  If you don't have an attention span, you wont like this.  If you can enjoy a band for their actual musical merit, without bringing in preconceived notions, you will be rewarded.Let the different themes move you.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|Being a fan of LP since their glorious \\"Hybrid Theory\\" days, their albums since have not lived up to the awesomeness of the first one in my opinion. \\"Meteora\\" and \\"ReAnimation\\" weren't bad but the other two I albums, \\"A Thousand Suns\\" and \\"Minutes to Midnight\\" really were disappointments.<br /> Obviously I recognize that as humans, not just for artists like LP, we go through changes in opinions and lifestyle and that reflects on our work. Now I get to the part you want to hear, what is good in this album and why it is a step in the right direction I believe. While it lacks the frustration, energy, and screaming found in \\"Hybrid Theory\\", it has many songs that can bring about those same epic moments. \\"Lost in the Echo\\" and \\"Burn it Down\\" really tap into some of those same emotions found in \\"Crawling\\" and \\"Papercut\\". They remind me about standing up for yourself, being strong, and getting hurt from relationships both from our inner-demons and from those around us. Some songs do remain on the weak side, which I blame on LP for trying to be radio friendly.<br /> I will end with giving the album an 8/10. The messages found in these songs are deep, much like their previous albums. If you are a true LP fan like me, it really doesn't matter what they put out because you have so many good memories listening to them. If you are new to listening to LP, you may not find this very special, as I believe that it is very toned down and chill. Like I said, this album is a good step in the right direction into getting back to their old form but I am afraid that they may never go back to those glory days. Then again, Chester was 24 when HT came out, and now he's 36, so it is understandable to see the change in his lyrics.
B000F8O35U|3.0|I rented this movie last night after going years without seeing it, and I hardly remembered anything from it. I absolutely loved it and was actually more excited to watch it again than I was to watch it the first time. I understand why this DVD is so expensive, as the movie isn't available in stores, isn't on YouTube, and never plays on TV, and it may be worth your money, but keep in mind it's set to come out of the Disney Vault in just a few years (I think it'll be 2 years, since that'll be its 25th anniversary).

B000VDUWMC|5.0|An analysis of the entire human history on a mere 400 pages written by a ornithologist sounds ridiculous from the out set. Jared Diamond however puts the laughs to shame. This is perhaps the most quintessential historical book I´ve ever read - the analysis is to the point and demonstrates a sharp mind and an almost Ghoetian mastery of broad array of sciences (history, archaeology, genetics, biology, epidemiology, physics etc. etc.). If any critique should be offered, the book do become a bit repetitive in the end and could easily have been cut to 300 pages.

B005GG0MIS|4.0|At times, this book did get a little tedious and bogged down.  But, for the most part, it was fascinating.  I think that two things stood out to me.  First, no matter what the party, or ideology, all of the presidents since President Herbert Hoover have formed a close friendship once they leave the office.  They have been in the office, and understand the intense problems of the job.  They work together to help the current president.  [To be fair, President Reagan was able to offer his support only for a brief time, due to his illness.]  Second, the two presidents who caused the most problems were the two who felt that they had the most to \\"prove\\" to the world.  President Jimmy Carter has the tendency to go \\"rogue\\", and President Richard Nixon was always scheming to make something for his own benefit, rather than the current president's (and nation's) benefit, regardless of the president's party.  A good book to read if you, like me, enjoy politics.

Must read book for admirers of Lincoln.

Some parts were predictable but overall I enjoyed it.  Readers will want Chrissy to figure out a way of getting back her life and her loved ones.<br /><br />[...]
B003IKMR0U|5.0|I bought Zombie Dice after seeing it featured on TableTop (Geeks and Sundry).  I primarily play it prior to longer game sessions, while the longer game is being set up.  This is an excellent fast paced game.  It teaches valuable lessons about gambling and odds (and zombies, of course).  A game can be completed in a matter of minutes with a decisive group.<br /><br />My only complaint is that both the top and bottom of the tumbler come off.  A little glue or tape solves this, but I would have like to see a solid plastic tumbler with a removable top.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|Once I got my Iphone I was looking for a case to show off the phone and not hide it behind a thick layer of rubber. The case is pretty tough (but it's no otterbox) and the transparent case shows off my iphone perfectly and the rings on the back line up perfectly with the apple logo. I got a lot of compliments and love the case. If your clumsy and drop your phone a lot a tougher case may be a better suit.

0618680004|1.0|It really amuses me when people come up with the argument for the nonexistence of God.<br />Trying to prove God's existence in the limited fields of human learning is like looking for the city of Redmond in West Virginia. You simply can't find it there. The overwhelming proof of God's existence is shown daily by creation. For instance, it is impossible to study human anatomy without coming to a conclusion that man's complexity and highly functional state cannot be due to some random act. A highly intelligent mind must have conceived the nature and function of man; and a highly competent hand must have formed him.<br />Like the birthers who demand for more evidence of Obama's citizenship however, skeptic scientists will not be convinced by available and overwhelming evidence. No matter what evidence is presented to them--short of God appearing to them in a vision--they simply won't accept it. Even if God were to show up, they still would demand more \\"evidence\\" to satisfy their bigoted minds.<br />A simple question for these \\"learned\\" athiests is this: how do you explain the existence of the first life on earth? How did the first living cell emerge? Where does that life come from? After all, it could not have come from an explosion? Or could it? If so, how come such explosions don't produce life nowadays?<br />These \\"learned\\" psudoscientists will do well to stay withing their areas of expertise, not dabble into areas that they don't know anything about. Just because you're a scientist does not make you an authority on theological and philosophical matters.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|I bought this about a month ago. My three month old LOVES the monkey. She grins every time she sees it. It's easy to clean in the clothes washer. It takes a while to dry so I put it in the dryer on no heat or low heat and it was dry in about 30 minutes. We even bought another so we'd always have one clean.<br /><br />The only problem happened last night. Somehow during her nap my daughter managed to pull the two tags off the monkey. My husband found them in her crib next to her. I'm so glad she didn't put them in her mouth and choke! The monkey had a hole in him where the tags were and you could see the stuffing. Luckily we found it quickly and I sewed the hole up so she can still have her monkey. I cut the tags off her other wubbanub to prevent this from happening again. I wish they didn't have tags or they were sewn on better. I didn't see another review saying this had happened to anyone else but I would encourage you to check the stability of the tags often or just cut them off.

B007KWD7BK|4.0|I haven't had a bowl of ganja in just about 30 years, but I remember the general haze and buzz quite well.  This was in the mid-1980's when I quit, and among metal music there was either the classic older stuff like Sabbath or the NWOBHM and hair farmer bands to choose from.  Naturally, other bands of different genres got more attention too, like the mighty Husker Du and other real alternative bands, not that alternative slop that integrated itself with grunge in the '90s.  Stoner rock would appear in the '90's, too, and Sleep was one of the better known doom bands out there, keeping company with St. Vitus, Candlemass and Kyuss.<br />  What really set Sleep apart besides their classic album &quot;Sleep's Holy Mountain&quot; was a brave excursion indeed into a long drawn out musical voyage called &quot;Jerusalem&quot;, an album that explored Jesus and marijuana.  It was met with some alacrity, and the band decided to change the name to &quot;Dopesmoker&quot; and release the title track as the only track on the album, clocking in at an hour and three minutes long!  That's right - it's one song, and doesn't sound like a bunch of unrelated tunes glued together to call themselves one tune.  It has a central theme, and while there are movements in the tune, it's clearly a single tune.<br />  But what a heavy song.  Matt Pike knows heavy, being the leader of High On Fire, one of the most ferocious metal bands out there, and his droning guitar provides the backbone for the trip.  The drums are more simplistic, going for atmosphere, sounding Middle Eastern at times, and the bass is up front, as heavy as anything you've ever heard.  Perhaps only Electric Wizard's &quot;Dopethrone&quot; provides any comparison in the heavy competition.<br />  So the challenge is, can you listen to one song that long and not lose interest?  I would suspect a little herbal enhancement wouldn't hurt, but I like it as the straight sober 51 year old nerd I am.  It's quite a challenge to keep a song that lengthy interesting, but Sleep succeeds.  The new reissue also has a live take of &quot;Holy Mountain&quot;, a mere Ramones-length tune by comparison, clocking in at a measly 13 minutes.  Get it for the riffs, get it for the historical value.ceeds.

B006XF5BTG|4.0|A complete program to reprogram for a fit and healthy physique. Many people have asked me what to do, how to train, etc. The facts are that it's often more simple than you think, but not so easy. This book gives you everything you need to know to begin, or even advance, your travels on your road to a fit and healthy body. It addresses cardio, weights, training, schedules and routines. It also addresses the more important points of nutrition, recovery and mindset. It addresses these facets in a clear and straightforward manner that anyone can understand. The advice is sound and likely to be effective for anyone able to be consistent and follow the program. This program is not overwhelming and can be incorporated into most life-styles. Early on the author advises of the need for hard work, consistency and clear goals. One idea you will come away with is that focused SMART training will beat blind HARD training any time. Remember, NOTHING IS FREE! and following the advice given in this book is not likely to waste your time.<br /><br />Another important point: While the principles will work for anyone, they are perfectly suited for the athletes training without the use of strong anabolic compounds. In most magazines and in some books there is a considerable amount of misleading data published regarding training and nutrition that simply does not apply to anyone training without the use of strong anabolic drugs. This book is for those who are not taking that particular risk but still want maximum benefits and health. Meaning simply that you can expect to progress with this system without strong anabolic drugs.<br /><br />I hope you found the review helpful and good luck!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Most dystopian novels rest fully upon the tried and true cliches that endlessly echo somewhere between madmax and a boy and his dog.... or worse yet: Cyborg or the Terminator francise.  _Wool_ is refreshing in that the story is told with a humanity and vividness that much of this genre of science fiction lacks.  Hugh Howey's characters are amazingly well crafted.  The plot is engaging and well constructed.  The story unfolds at just the right pace and has a life of its own.  In short: Wool is a worthy read for any science fiction fan.
0765365278|5.0|I loved this book. No, I MORE than loved it; I lived it. I was there, really. The world is so vivid and new and fantastic. The characters are so real, I swear I've passed by them on my way to work. I adore this book, this world created by Mr. Sanderson. When I was young my world revolved around Harry Potter, and now in my adulthood, my imagination has once again been captured by The Way of Kings. The beginning alone had me hooked, drooling for more. There was not a moment that I was ever bored; the story skips to different character enough to keep you on your toes and guessing, but not enough to annoy you or give you that dragging on feeling. I was constantly running to my friends and boyfriend ranting and raving about what so-and-so had just done and, \\"You wouldn't BELIEVE what just happened!.\\" I would recommend this book to any fantasy lover, or any book lover in general. Interesting enough, I was actually going to pass this book by. I had just finished Mistborn by the same author, and I was in a big \\"Ehhh\\" mood over it. I had some extra dollars to spend so I figured I would give this one a shot. Heh. Next thing you know I'm sneaking extra bathroom breaks to just get a few extra pages in at work. Needless to say, I am obsessively watching the authors status bar for the next book in this series. I truly loved this book, and I hope that whoever is now giving this title a once over buys it, and loves it too.

052594527X|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring by Tracy Chevalier was the most heartbreakingly beautiful book I have ever read. The writing is so descriptive of life in Holland at Vermeer's time that you feel like you are there. You think, \\"Surely this story must have happened this way!\\" Griet is sent to live in the painter Vermeer's home as a maid and falls in love with him. This has repercussions and makes her act out in her grief. The writer really did her research on the life of Vermeer and his family and her vivid imagination paints a true picture of life at that time for a middle-class families, working-class families, and a simple maid. I read this book two times.

B004LWZWGK|4.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  I just want to give my thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />I'm fresh from the theater, having just seen The Dark Knight Rises.  For me, it's the second best movie of the three Christopher Nolan Batman movies.  These Batman movies courtesy of director Christopher Nolan are gritty, realistic, and have the feel of cop dramas, and The Dark Knight Rises is no exception.  This has both its positives and negatives, as I feel that these movies have little or no hint of being comic book movies, but at the same time, they are a new \\"realistic\\" take on the Batman character and the villains, so it's refreshing, I guess.  I'll put it this way - I like the Tim Burton movies the best, when when I'm in the mood for a more serious take on Batman, I'll reach for one of the Nolan movies.  This movie (as well as the others in the series) is heavy on violence.  This movie, I feel, is by far the darkest of the three in terms of atmosphere, grittiness, and violence.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway?<br /><br />THE.  BEST.  CATWOMAN.  EVER.<br /><br />She was superb as Catwoman.  Her looks, her attitude, her wardrobes, everything was great.  She totally kicked major you know what.  When it was announced in early 2011 that she received the role of Catwoman, the general public just said, \\"What?  I can't see her as Catwoman\\".  People couldn't see her playing Catwoman for the lamest reasons, such as the fact that she's been in comedies over the years.  Just because she's been in comedies over the years doesn't mean she can't play a serious role.  What people fail to realize is that Anne Hathaway's occupation is ACTRESS.  Actors are paid to ACT.  What does that mean?  Very simply, it means that the person should be capable of playing all kinds of different roles, in other words, be versatile.  Johnny Depp is a good example of this.  So many people seem to have a problem separating what an actor has done in the past with what they're currently doing.  It's a shame.  There is one scene in this Batman movie where Selina Kyle (Catwoman) is wearing a wardrobe that is strikingly similar to what Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) wore in Breakfast At Tiffany's (1961).  It has been known for many years that many people view Anne Hathaway as a modern day Audrey Hepburn, so I personally feel that director Christopher Nolan gave a tip of the hat to Audrey Hepburn through Anne Hathaway.  Her catsuit, I feel, was a tip of the hat to catwomen Julie Newmar and Eartha Kitt from the 1960s Batman TV series on ABC Television and to Lee Meriwether, who played Catwoman in Batman: The Movie (1966).  I added one star to my rating of this movie simply because of Anne Hathaway alone.  Anne Hathaway has received praise for her role as Catwoman and has silenced her critics and doubters with her great performance.  Back in 2007, when the general public learned that Heath Ledger would be playing The Joker, people did the same thing they did when it came to Anne Hathaway - \\"What?\\"  Then when the movie came out, people were blown away by Ledger's performance.  Personally, when it comes to live action Jokers, Heath Ledger is my least favorite between Cesar Romero, Jack Nicholson, and Heath Ledger.  My favorite is Romero.  However, I do give Ledger respect for his performance in The Dark Knight (2008).  When the public learned that Michael Keaton would be playing Bruce Wayne/Batman in the 1989 movie \\"Batman\\", people couldn't see him playing these roles and they threw a fit.  Then when the movie came out everybody shut up.  I don't know, people always seem to count chickens before they hatch.  People always seem to write somebody off early even before the person has a chance to prove his/herself.<br /><br />Tom Hardy did a great job as Bane.  I agree with a lot of other reviewers that a lot of the time it was hard to understand what he was saying with his electronically altered voice.  Other than that, his character delivered.  Christian Bale gave his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.  Morgan Freeman and Gary Oldman were good as usual.  Michael Caine was great as Alfred, as he was in the other movies.<br /><br />The musical score by Hans Zimmer is a big improvement over the two previous movies, especially when I compare it to the score of The Dark Knight.  The music isn't as repetitive as the music in The Dark Knight.  It is more epic and emotional as well.<br /><br />The overall story in this movie is on a much deeper level, more emotional, and with quite an ending, something I won't reveal in this review.  There are plots holes galore throughout the movie, but then again all three of Nolan's Batman movies have plot holes.  Also, there are things that don't make sense.  In the trilogy, Nolan made a lot of unusual changes to the whole Batman experience when it comes to the characterizations of Bruce Wayne, Batman, Alfred, The Joker, The Catwoman, etc.  A lot of the changes that were made have been hard for me and a lot of people to accept, at least initially.  I guess the best way to deal with it is that you just have to accept these changes and shift gears in your mind and tell yourself that these are Christopher Nolan movies and not comic book based movies.  I'll tell you one thing - if Bob Kane was still around he wouldn't like what Nolan did to the whole Batman universe he created.<br /><br />One thing that so many people complain about is the fact that Batman is fighting crime during daylight hours.  Gee, I didn't know that every crime out there takes place at night.  Batman is a crime fighter that answers the call no matter what time of day it is.  Let's see, Bane is up to his evil deeds during the day, but because Batman is a \\"bat\\" so to speak, bats are nocturnal, so Batman should only come out at night to fight crime.  A lot of people (especially the young people of today) have this same \\"fighting crime in daylight\\" gripe when it comes to the 1960s TV series.  How lame.  Where's common sense?<br /><br />If you want to see an interesting conclusion to Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy, then see The Dark Knight Rises.  This movie ranks second in my rankings behind Batman Begins (2005).  The Dark Knight (2008) is my least favorite.le gave his best performance as Bruce Wayne and Batman.

B0054LVP3Q|2.0|I decided to read this novel because several people mentioned how they had enjoyed it.  Unfortunately it was not as enjoyable as I had hoped it would be.  I am not bothered by the subject matter, however it basically said the same thing over and over.  I got it; you don't have any memory and every day you have to reread your diary.  The most bothersome aspect was, all of a sudden introducing the friend and wow! now everything is better.  It strikes me that the story went on and on about her life of no memory and in the last few pages memory came back and all is well.  While I do like a happy ending, I prefer when it is more realistic.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|No, you don't get the theatrical versions in this set. What you DO get is the absolute best looking releases of these films yet! The transfers look great, and many (not all) of the problems in the DVD release have been corrected. The changes to the films are sometimes quite bad (Obi-Wan's \\"roar\\" just drives me nuts), but honestly, it's a few seconds out of 12 hours.<br /><br />Plus, how can all these people give one star to the set that finally brings us so many deleted scenes from the original saga? That alone is worth the purchase for lifelong fans like myself.<br /><br />And while they're obviously not best of the saga, episodes 2 and 3 look truly stunning. Episode 3 in particular is probably the best looking blu-ray I've ever seen.

B00026WU7I|5.0|I've been a huge Dylan fan for quite a while, but had only really listened to his albums from the 60's. I recently bought this album though, and am literally listening to it on loop right now. Every song is like a mini-masterpiece, each one detailing a different emotion associated with the end of a long relationship (in this case, Dylan's marriage). It perfectly captures the wide range of emotions that come with a breakup, and it's all told in the beautiful language that only Dylan is capable of. Just an amazing album.

This is seriously my favorite book now; I never thought I'd be able to so easily learn so many great songs! I could simply not recommend this book more highly!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie McGuire knew what she was doing when she wrote this book and what she did she did is great. When I finished this book the first thing I did was click back to page one so I could start all over again. I love re-reading books but Iv'e never done that before. I was so sad to be done with this book and I wasn't ready to let Abby and especially Travis go.  This story starts when Abby is at an underground college fight with her friend were she see's Travis the bad boy on campus who every girl wants. But because of Abby's past Abby wants nothing to do with Travis but friendship. As time goes by Abby and Travis grow closer together and start a relationship. This book is Travis and Abby's love story, and it's the most intense all consuming love story I have ever read. I could not get enough of this book and never wanted to put it down. Since my first two reads I constantly come back to this book when I feel my Travis craving coming on and those craving come offten. I recommend this book to everyone I know.<br /><br />* I bought this book just after it was released, and was given an ARC of the new published book from NetGallery*

As always Jensen Ackles does a great job in these types of episodes and you feel the guilt and sadness pouring out of him.  Jo Harvelle is called to the witness stand, and after somehow avoiding confessing to the death of Amy in the last episode, Dean is found guilty and it is up to Sam to save him before Jo's ghost gets to him.<br /><br />A great and emotionally charged episode!

The story was very thin, it's mostly them two having sex like 10x a day. As far as the authors ability to keep the story fresh >FAIL< she is the most repetitive writer ever, how many times is Ana gonna blush, flush, and bite her lip? Many times you feel your reading the same thing over and over again.  Okay that being said, it's hard to put down. It is a very easy and fast read. And although not a great piece of literature, It was a very interesting and fun read.
B005Y841QC|4.0|I absolutely love Supernatural, and have watched since the beginning.  I loved the characters of Donald and Maggie Stark and this felt like an old time Supernatural episode with lots of lighthearted humor.  But like a previous reviewer remarked, it makes absolutely no sense that the brothers would let two immortal witches go who have both killed several people in just this episode alone but Dean kills Amy who saved Sam's life??  That's the only reason I gave this four stars - it's like the writers can't make up their minds!

1416562605|4.0|Balram Halwai, a successful Indian businessman, learns that the Chinese Premier will be visiting his city, Bangalore, to learn about entrepreneurship.  Balram feels uniquely qualified to share about becoming an entrepreneur.  After all, as a boy, he hailed from the impoverished rural Indian village of Laxmangahr.  Against all odds, he became a self-made man.  Delighted by the prospect of the Premier's visit, he composes a letter over seven nights detailing his rise to riches.  \\"The White Tiger\\" is the substance of this correspondence.<br /><br />As the story's narrator, Balram Halwai must be understood.  He's a simple but ambitious man.  In order to help provide for his extended family, he was pulled out of school at a very young age despite showing some academic promise.  The social system assigned him a place of little hope in life.  His greatest aspiration was to wear a kakhi uniform as a bus driver.  Thanks to a fortunate chain of events, Balram became the servant driver of a rich man.  From this new vantage point, Balram's perception was opened to previously unthinkable opportunities.  Wealth was within his grasp.  If only he had the courage for one entrepreneurial act - murder.  His tale is relayed with cynicism and dark humor.<br /><br />\\"The White Tiger\\" isn't a sociological, cultural, or civics treatise on India.  Any reader seeking an academic exploration of modern Indian culture should look elsewhere.  Therefore readers criticizing the work for its heavy-handed and overly bleak portrait of India are being unduly sensitive.  It's a work of fiction.  Yes, there are unflattering truths, but what nation doesn't have its own seedy underbelly?  Moreover, the narrator is clearly biased in his opinions as they arise out of his singular experiences.  He has a penchant for hyperbole as well.  How far can we trust a man who seriously says, \\"Our nation [...] has no drinking water, electricity, sewage system, public transportation, sense of hygiene, discipline, courtesy, or punctuality\\"?  Or who believes, \\"All these outsourcing companies [...] virtually run America now\\"?  Or who naively accepts what he read on the streets of India in a dated book about the Chinese, that they \\"are great lovers of freedom and individual liberty\\"?  And then there are his prejudices and stereotypes concerning religion.<br /><br />Balram is a difficult character.  He's an engaging narrator with a charming candor and sense of humor, but he's also bitter and tortured.  Ultimately, as is revealed in the first few pages of the book and the jacket description, he cold-heartedly murders someone who arguably treated him well.  He's a thief who extorts and bribes with impunity.  He callously disregards the safety of his own family.  And yet, he has a childlike quality.  He knows he's stained.  He knows his lofty position is ill-gotten and precariously maintained.  He doesn't defend his actions.  But during his journey he discovered that the rich and the poor both live in darkness, is he wrong to have decided that it's better by far to be rich?  He's just an entrepreneur...<br /><br />This is the brilliance of the novel.  It transcends Balram Halwai.  It transcends India.  It challenges the reader to ponder oppression, corruption, greed, racism, and various other social ills.  It challenges the reader to consider the universal human condition.  The contemplative reader is left searching his own soul.  Congratulations Aravind Adiga.  That's a prize-worthy achievement.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|I cant get enough of this show..its really great. Sam and dean are my favorite but of course dean is the one I like the most. I cant wait to watch this season again
B005P5TS5I|5.0|It was interesting to see Castiel in the role of main antagonist.  He uses his newfound power to right wrongs as he sees fit.  Dean, Sam and Bobby plot to figure out a way to stop Castiel and turn to Crowley.  They obtain a way to summon Death whom they hope will stop Castiel.  Their plans go awry as always but not before Death reveals the existence of Leviathans who previously occupied Purgatory.  The ending was not what I expected for a first episode and I couldn't wait to see Episode Two to find out about Castiel's fate as the Leviathans overpowered him.  Sam is also struggling because he can now see Lucifer everywhere due to the wall in his head crumbling.<br /><br />I suppose my biggest question - and one that never gets answered - is why exactly Dean is ready to kill Castiel.  While he did betray the brothers, they don't attempt to 'fix him' as Dean did with Sam who committed some of the same crimes as Castiel while drinking demon blood or when he was soulless Sam.  The episode did a great job setting up the rest of the season even though I missed Castiel's many funny lines.

B005TPS0WG|5.0|While Dean is healing from injuries suffered in the last episode Sam goes out on his own to investigate a case that is familiar to him.  We are introduced to Amy, and get to see how she met Sam when they were both young.  I thought that the flashbacks were the best part of this episode as it gives us a glimpse of Sam's life while Dean and his father are off hunting.<br /><br />First, Dean's actions took me completely by surprise!  I understand why he did what he did, but certainly they have let worse monsters/baddies live - the warlock and witch for example who killed a few people got live because he saved their lives.  Amy saved Sam's life and still Dean kills her and keeps it from Sam.  It didn't seem in keeping with Dean's character or what the brothers have done in the past.<br /><br />All of that aside, I agree that some of the episodes have little to nothing to do with each other.  In previous seasons there was always an episode or two where the brothers go off on several hunting trips that don't relate to the mains story arc but this is all beginning to feel a little disjointed... like a puzzle where someone is forcing the pieces together.<br /><br />It gets 5 stars, however, because it was a great performance by Dean and Sam, and the flashbacks were wonderful!

B000FCKGPC|4.0|This is the very first time I'm going to write a review for a book, as I never had the patience to write in \\"the formal ways\\" of a book report. I'm a fan of GRRM's \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" series just recently (I finished the first book just as I started watching Season 1 on HBO). I got hooked on the first 3 books, and now, I am more than half done with the fourth -- I realize why a lot of people rate this a 3-star rather than the usual 4-5 on the first three installments of the series. Here's what I can say, without going into too much details and spoilers...<br /><br />I don't think \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is a badly-written book -- GRRM is still consistent with the way he writes the story. It didn't go \\"bad\\" just because the author has given up or tried to drag it on for the sake of profit, that's for sure. He still kept his element of storytelling, and I still enjoyed it. The main reason I think why people gave it a lower rating is that because in this book he focuses on the \\"minor\\" Houses -- those who got thrown in the background during the first 3 installments. He did include the stories some of the major characters that were in the first 3 books (namely, Queen Cersei, Jaime, Sansa, Arya, and Brienne), though, but roughly 70% of the chapters are dedicated to either Pyke (the ironmen in general), Dorne, or Highgarden (possibly other locations I hardly remember). The book opens up the story of the ironmen, which I have to admit was pretty slow-paced, although I'm keeping an eye out for Asha Greyjoy. Brienne's adventures also dragged on, with not much progress halfway through the book. The \\"juicy\\" pieces for me was Queen Cersei's growing paranoia with Lady Margaery and the entire Tyrell family (Jaime somewhat got thrown in the background but he still plays a major, yet somewhat comical part in Cersei's life). Arya's adventures in Braavos is also a highlight -- I personally thought it was more like a \\"rite of passage\\" for her into seeing the real world as a kid no more. Sansa remains the graceful lady living a different life at the Eyrie, but still has her own conflicts she has to deal with -- not as bad as her ordeal with her betrothal to ex-King Joffrey, though.<br /><br />To me, \\"A Feast for Crows\\" is like, well, a feast for crows. It's the aftermath of the horrible massacre of the northmen at the Twins (the \\"red wedding\\"), and the death of a young king (King Joffrey or King Robb, your pick) -- there is more movement of alliances, the northmen survivors split up and struggling to get by with the loss of the north after the red wedding, and the foreshadowing of the collapse of House Lannister (at least maybe, because we all know that Cersei's cunning might get her out of yet another mess).<br /><br />Overall, I did enjoy the book, even though some parts of it was indeed dragging. GRRM has introduced a slew of characters that were very minor on the first 3 books, so it's sort of a \\"shock\\" for those who've read the previous books to shift into a new set of characters with a different storyline and minimal tie-in with the previous ones. GRRM could have just made the fourth book to wrap up the series for the main characters that were built on the first three, and instead created a \\"spin-off\\" series for the minor characters.<br /><br />[TL;DR] I can say, for those who are expecting to read \\"A Feast for Crows\\" because you can't wait to know what happened to the characters from books 1 to 3, better not expect much. This book is more passive than action-packed. It is still necessary to read this installment and get familiar with the new characters, because I have a feeling that they will eventually play a key part in building the story back up on the last two books for the series that haven't been published yet. These two middle books it seems (haven't read the next book but it looks like the reviews have pretty much the same tune as this one has) is more of GRRM's efforts to \\"pick through the knots\\" from the fabric of the main storybefore he slowly unravels it in the end.before he slowly unravels it in the end.
B005R9PBK8|5.0|Sheriff Jody Mills alerts Bobby that something is not right at a local hospital which leads Bobby and the brothers to investigate.  After leaving Castiels' body the Leviathans take over other people, most notably a doctor in the same hospital as Sheriff Mills.  They hint at long term plans and it appears that the Leviathans are here to stay.  The brother's lose a battle against a Leviathans after finding Bobby's house burnt down, and we find out that so far nothing the boys have tried successfully kills the Leviathans.  They are both injured at taken to the hospital where the Leviathans have created a base, and Sam continues to struggle with visions of Lucifer.<br /><br />I thought that this was a suspenseful episode despite not liking the animated Leviathans.  They remind me of typical TV monsters, slimy with a lots of teeth and nothing unique about them.  We are also left to wonder if Bobby made it out alive.  I'm actually beginning to miss the cursed objects, ghosts, and demons that the boys normally hunt.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|Loved it!  The characters were beautiful.  The setting and story seemed real.  One of the best gay movies I've ever seen.
B004VQFQ2Q|1.0|This \\"deluxe\\" edition sucks. I ordered it up from Amazon and while waiting for it to come in the mail, sold my old copy back to a local shop. Boy was that a mistake. The sound quality on this is horrible -- quiet and muffled. This is really false advertising at its finest. Many great classic albums are being remastered and expanded by major labels and called \\"deluxe edition.\\"  This is not one of them. It looks like the same style packaging as the other major labels, but it's not the same quality or intent. Some of these Sabbath expanded editions are just a money making scheme. You want the bonus disc, so you shell out the bucks. I just don't understand what source they used for the main album material because it really does sound like crap.  My old version sounded way louder, more vibrant and alive. The packaging is just stupid. It looks like the \\"real\\" deluxe editions you see, but instead of a plastic outer sleeve, it is just a sticker they applied to the digi pack.
B003XRELGQ|5.0|I read this book when I was in high school and liked it, 40 years later I will read it again and love it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I found this book to be merely an author's need for attention - nothing redeeming about any of it.  Read it to the conclusion to see if perhaps the protagonist finally comes to her senses, but was never satisfied.  Have heard from others that the 2nd & 3rd books are more of the same.  I will not be purchasing either of them and will figure out a way to delete this one from my Kindle library.
0060589280|1.0|Someone had recommended this book to me because I had lived in Geneva. It felt more like an essay for a creative writing course than a novel. I can't remember the last time I've read something so superficial.<br /><br />Neither the setting nor the characters had enough texture to be credible or even compelling. The setting felt like any city on a lake. If Geneva was word searched and replaced with Chicago or Toronto, no one would notice. The characters are just as generic. Coelho describes the love interest as \\"handsome and successful\\" and the people at a party as \\"smart and charming.\\" They lack the subtle details that make them come alive. Their insights into romance were weak.<br /><br />The least believable part of the book was the postscript where the author claims to have visited Switzerland on a book tour and met a few people who inspired the story.

B002VHI8FE|3.0|Great and diverse characters BUT the first book (over 600 pages of it) ended and I still don't know what the story's about. Milking me on to the next book is one reason I stopped reading Orson Scott Card. This book ends with the main characters (most of them) going somewhere (we don't know where) to do something (we don't know what). I expect a book to have some sort of resolution before asking me to buy the next book in the series.

B004RQVVGU|5.0|Well, it was a long time coming but it finally happened.  The original first two Ozzy Osbourne solo albums were released remastered with the original drum and bass tracks (or me and a bunch of people are really naive.  I hope not) and an extra cd with a live concert at the time.<br /><br />The sound quality on the first CD is just incredible.  I mean, it feels like Lee Kerslake could jump out of the radio any second and hit me with his drum sticks incredible quality.  The haunting rhythm section is back in full force on this version, as you can probably tell if you aren't blown away by the killer bass of \\"Believer\\" or the intense drum attack of \\"Little Dolls\\".<br />That's what I have to commend this version on, making the non-hits on this album seem more incredible by a factor of ten.  Whoever said that behind every successful band there is a great production team wasn't lying.<br /><br />I have to say, I wasn't too impressed with the extra songs.  Production wasn't of the highest value and I think the band skipped over part of the lyrics of \\"Believer\\", but hey it's still Diary of a Madman!  It is by default a five star product (unless you are talking about the 2002 \\"Remasters\\" which I would rate 3 stars.  Sure, they were bastardizations of metal masterpieces, but a bastardization of a metal masterpiece like Diary of a Madman is still leagues ahead of say a Limp Bizkit album)!  So, I don't really count the extra materials on here against it, as the extra CD would probably rank a 4 star.<br /><br />Now, if only Ozzy and Sharon could repair the blight that is the 2002 Bark at the Moon Remaster and maybe even a super duper remaster of the 1986 masterpiece \\"The Ultimate Sin\\" I would be one happy camper.<br /><br />Might include more on the review later on, but this is all I have right now.

B003J27WFW|5.0|I purchased this DVD set immediately after seeing parts of it on a cable channel at my girlfriend's house (can't remember which channel!) I had seen Rush 3 times back in the early and mid-80s - I'm a has-been, wanna be drummer - still play though!<br /><br />I just think it's very refreshing to see a band that's survived for so long, enjoyed so much success and not have it go to their heads. It was also nice to see other musician's praising the band as well - Billy Corgan (Smashing Pumpkins) was incredibly articulate and entertaining! Rush is comprised of 3 very talented, intelligent and just plain NICE guys! If you like quality rock music and you're not in a better mood by the end of \\"Beyond the Lighted Stage\\" - then you should seek professional help! :-)

B004LWZW7E|2.0|I couldn't resist.  The film certainly didn't.  The script itself is plagued with so many `time' related clich&eacute;s within the dialog (can you spare a minute, etc.) that it was laughable, which is not something this film was shooting for.<br /><br />I honestly didn't mean to come on guns blazing in the first paragraph.  I'll lighten up for a second.<br /><br />`In Time' is a science fiction film about a future time when no one ages over twenty-five.  Sadly, you only actually LIVE till twenty-six unless you're rich.  The currency is time and so the more you owe the less you live.  In order to survive you have to work your fingers to the bone and conserve your `time'.  Will is twenty-eight and lives at home with his mother.  He is a minimum wage worker and his mother, who just turned fifty, works her fingers to the bone as well, and yet they are still living on mere hours, just trying to make enough to get to the next day.  After a bar brawl, Will winds up getting his hands on over a century of `time', but certain events lead him on the run with a beautiful socialite as Time Cops try to restore order by `cleaning Will's clock'.<br /><br />The idea is interesting.  I mean, it's not `really' interesting, but it could have been promising.  Instead, the film feels rather skeletal, with no real attempt to uncover any depth in the story.  Instead, it's a lot of running around and shooting and whatnot, which doesn't help differentiate this from any other random action thriller.  That, and Justin Timberlake is hard to take seriously.  It's his voice.  It is perfectly suited for the radio, and I happen to love me so `Sexyback' but the feminine nature of his voice makes it hard to take him seriously as an actor, unless his character benefits from that `pitch'.  It doesn't here.  It's not all Justin's fault though, as no one here really manages to deliver a decent performance.  I blame the script for that because these characters are just bland and uninspired.  The set pieces are nice and the editing is sharp so as to create some nicely placed action sequences (and when Will takes revenge on some thugs it was an inspired touch) but other than that this is a borderline bore of a film that never gets proper footing.nice and the editing is sharp so as to create some nicely placed action sequences (and when Will takes revenge on some thugs it was an inspired touch) but other than that this is a borderline bore of a film that never gets proper footing.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|The simplest of ideas are often the better way to go, such is the case with this game. Very simple gameplay, connecting point A to point B, is how this game plays, but attempting to do so without the lines (Or pipes) crossing each other in addition to having to use up the entire space given provide numerous progressively challenging but fairly addicting puzzles. Good app, I shied away at first but it proved to be worth my time.

145162445X|3.0|Oh boy... not sure where to start with this one, so I'll just start. I give it three stars as in, \\"...give it an 'E' for effort...\\".<br /><br />We'll all have to re-define the word, \\"nothing\\" so that it doesn't get confused with the theoretical physicist's \\"nothing\\".<br /><br />But nothing really isn't nothing, instead it's something that nobody fully understands yet. Remember when nothing meant nothing... gee, i miss those days.<br /><br />Anyways, Krauss does a pretty good job of explaining things (though nothing really new). Of course, anytime dark energy and dark matter become the topic i get confused because we have a lot of dogmatic blabber concerning items no one undertands yet.<br /><br />Chapters 2, 5-7 i thought were good... then there is Dawkins closing the book. Lordy, as soon as i saw his name on the cover i expected he would take the topic and turn it against religious beliefs - and i was correct.<br /><br />We could all be having a discussion about socks and he would find some way to wedge the topic against religion - a subject we can neither prove nor disprove elementsof ... just like nothing from something or something from nothing, or is it something from something else? I don't know.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Unlike many here, I have become a bit of a prude, if you must. I would have read the trash had I not realized the moment she walked into the bedroom and he said he doesn't make love, he only f--- hard. yikes! So I gathered that he was going to be having weird sick sex with her. I don't care to pollute my mind in this way. Been there, read that, in my youth, but to each his own. I just agreed with the review that said you can't unread this book, and I don't need those images in my head. I like to put positive things in my head only, when given the choice. I sleep better and live more peacefully :)<br /><br />I agree with the negative reviews; before I deleted it I was thinking how much it reminded me of the juvenile vampire Bella trash, which I admit I enjoyed reading even though I laughed through much of it and \\"rolled my eyes\\" (ha ha) at Bella through most of it. And endured some mind pollution, naughty. But this hinted that it would be much more than the Twilight in terms of trash, so I couldn't read it. I ended very early on, and still agree with the negative. It didn't take long to realize you weren't really going to care about the characters, that the writing was juvenile, and wondering why the Americans were using British terms. I felt like I was reading 8th grade dream writing. On a good note, sometimes I think my own writing seems juvenile so I guess I will finish my novel and it may be a bestseller too! gasp!
B007I2BZIE|2.0|I have seen Rush on nearly every tour since the Signals tour and they have been my favorite band since Moving Pictures ruled AOR radio.  While most of their albums are still very listenable, I just don't see much longevity coming from this album.  Snakes & Arrows stands out as an opus in comparison!  Where are the melodies?  Where are any memorable hooks?  memorable drum fills?  Riffs?  (crickets....)  Also, I do believe that Neil has gotten his point across the anti-Christianity thing.  We get it, Neil.  If you don't like religion, why the focus on angels in your lyrics?<br /><br />When I saw Rush on the Snakes & Arrows tour (twice), I thought Geddy's voice had reached a certain level of sophistication, like an aged Burgundy that he so enjoys.  The engineering and production on Clockwork Angels don't come close to doing it justice.  Listen to the drum fills on Presto (such as Available Light), and then listen to this album, and you'll see exactly what I'm referring to on the production.<br /><br />I don't know if ultimately this is Rush's doing, or Nick R's, or a combination thereof, but this combination just isn't working.

B008BM9L72|1.0|I read the books to see what all the buzz was about and because I LOVE to read. I read everything from children books, young adult, historical romance, being my favorite genres paranormal, erotica and dark erotica. First I was convinced that I must have purchased an alternate versions of the books (I truly wished I had,I swear!). One that was completely bad written, slow, unbelievable, RIDICULOUS and stupid. One where the protagonist (Ana) was the most annoying, stupid, dumb and naive character in the history of books. It's amazing how this author managed to make sex scenes BORING. YES, I said boring and sex in the same sentence! Especially Christian's and Ana's first time! It was a struggle for me to finish it-( actually took me A LOT of time because I had to take breaks to read something better)-but I finished it because I made a new resolution to never leave things unfinished @_@. But this books made me wish to quit SO BADLY. At the end, I was sad. Sad because of all the things I could have been reading or doing, of the WASTED time reading such trash! Oh how much I wished it would've been an actual book instead of a digital copy so I could have the satisfaction of throwing it against a wall!!!!! Instead I just banged my head against the pillows. O_o So save your precious time and money and invest it in something WORTHY,not on this piece of crap!
B0086700CM|4.0|This would be a 5-star rating if the developer would do something about the video \\"hitching\\" that occurs on the Kindle Fire when any special animations appear on the screen while you're running.  Distance traveled notices and the star burst animation that kicks in at each 100 coins frequently causes the video to stutter.  If you happen to need to jump or slide while it's hitching you're most likely dead.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Good fun and sufficiently challenging once you get to the upper levels. Easy to learn and rather addicting. Gotta go play now!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love games that actually challenge you. this is by far one of my favorite games in a long time.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Its an ok game but you have to spend money to get any where quick and my children aren't very patience.
B0052ZQMLO|5.0|I use a Kindle 3 and I've had none of the problems other users are mentioning to set it as a default dictionary.<br />Furthermore I find it so easy to look for words, just start typing the first letters and the words appear right-away, is so much faster than looking a word in a (thick) paper dictionary. I had bought a paperback dictionary about one month before getting this (8 months before), but I tell you it's still brand new cause I've only been using the Kindle dictionary.<br />Perhaps this doesn't apply as much to Kindle 4 owners who haven't a physical keyboard, a touch screen one isn't as fast to use I suppose, I don't know, but for Kindle 3 users it's totally worth it.

B0002HZ18C|4.0|This is the first model I've built for years. I haven't built any kind of model for about 20 years or so. I thought it was going to be bigger than it actually is. The dimensions that are shown in the information seem to be corresponding with the box, not the model. The model is maybe 6 inches in length, not the 13 that it states below. This makes it a bit challenging to clean the model parts and sand them down. I've had to build up a couple spots where I took too much off but it's not a big deal, just time consuming.<br /><br />I noticed that the figures have bell-bottoms on. I looked at the bottom of the hull and noticed that the mold was made in the early 70's. They could definitely update it. Some of the pieces also had some pits in them and some pieces missing. Some of the instrucions don't exaclty match up either.<br /><br />Besides that, it is fun so far building it. I'll put up a picture of the finished product when I'm done. Try not to laugh too hard, it's been a very long time since I put a model together. I think I was 9 when I put one together last time. This is a whole new experience for me but a fun one at that.

B002BU0DPE|3.0|I bought my first pair of px21's back in september of 2011. The headphones sound and microphone quality are very nice and the ear cups make it very comfortable on your head. you can set it up so that you can use the headset on a pc and an xbox/ps3 at the same time as well so i would have given this headset 5 stars besides for 1 issue. Just 2 months after buying my px21's the right headphone went out. So hoping that it was just a coincidence i went out and bought another pair of px21's back in december and it then only took 5 months and again the exact same thing happened the right headphone went out again. Now im not the as gentle with my things as i would like but i also dont throw my headsets or anything like that. I would suggest maybe trying something else in the same price range. this headset has really sound and microphone quality but they wear out quickly.
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved this book!!  So much like Fifty Shades of Grey but I think i liked it a little better.  It was still very sexy and steamy but it did not have as much of the dom/sub stuff. I would highly recommend this book to friends!!
B00884GR0W|2.0|ok I haven't played this but I have played block story lite and it sounds like exactly the same thing. it automatically save on block story lite. or at least it does on mine. I would not spend my money on this when you can get the exact same thing for free.

B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was perfect for my daughter too. Many great characters and an intriguing story line!  I had to buy the next one immediately after I was done.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The random deal is very challenging. I like to do something in my spare time and solitaire fills the time.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|The book did not live up to the hype. It was unrealistic and completely far-fetched. I understand why it was categorized as \\"Mommy Porn\\". The book read as if it were written by a bored house wife who wanted more romance in her personal life. The were many instances where she overused phrases such as \\"hint of a smile or ghost of a smile\\". Also, Christian had to be the most screwed up character ever. To sum it up, I did not like this series.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I am not sure how I lived to be 30 without reading this book but I am glad I did.<br />Jonas lives in a society where \\"sameness\\" is a way of life. There is no individuality, no true love, no war, no famine, no weather, and no memories. No one says words they don't mean and everyone obeys the rules. When he celebrates becoming a Twelve with all of his classmates on their shared birthday he is assigned the highest honor in the community, the Receiver of Memory. He then begins the long painful task of receiving the memories from 'The Giver' from 'back and back and back'. He begins to experience loss, joy, pain, and love for the first time. He must absorb these feelings so the other people in the Community do not have to. He begins to see a way of life that no longer exists but that he thinks everyone should experience. He must then make some very difficult decisions regarding his own life. The ending was a little abrupt for my taste but still well written and allows you to draw your own conclusions (unless you go on to read the others in the series of course).<br />A good read, with a few twists I didn't see coming. It is the very definition of a dystopian novel. It is easy to forget that Jonas is only 12 as his life and memories make him seem much more mature than the adults around him. Well written and a great cautionary tale of what society can become when individuality is eliminated, every movement,thought, and dream is monitored and decisions are made for you. It also makes you appreciate the feelings and memories you wished you could forget. Without pain there is no happiness.<br />My only regret is that I had read this book earlier in life before reading other well known novels with similar premises. I definitely recommend every young adult read this book.
0517082454|5.0|If you have never read anything (short story or poem) by Edgar Allan Poe, I would suggest starting with this book. You may find that many of Poe's poems strange, depressing, or just downright weird. Some of them strike me that way as well. However, this collection contains some poems that MUST be read. My all time favorite by Poe is The Raven, which is included in this book. Others that I feel are worth mentioning are: Annabel Lee, A Dream Within a Dream, Serenade, The Sleeper, Romance, and Evening Star.
B008B8A9V8|5.0|Until seeing this book at my library, I knew of a few variations on the tried and true cast ons and bind offs, but this book opened my mind and eyes to new possibilities.  What's even better, the instructions are clear and uncomplicated.  Even my left-handed, right-brained approach to learning is not stymied.<br />When I found that I could get the book both in Kindle format and in spiral-bound format I went for both.  My Kindle goes with me when I travel, as does my knitting.  Voila!  Reference at the touch of a button.<br />Amazon.com's discounts made it possible get both at reasonable prices.<br />My only complaint is the spiral binding.  It tends to stick, making it more difficult to turn pages without damaging them.  A 3- or 5-ring binder approach would have been much better.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There are a lot of different versions of the Bible available, many off line.  The reading plans offer many chioces as well. I like the fact that the app remembers where you left off. Navagation is easy in the Bible and between the versions of the Bible. I have found this program a convient supplement to our home study.
B005DC68NI|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It got me quite excited about the indie publishing scene and fuelled some wow-this-could-really-take me-places fantasies. Throughout the book, Gaughran explains why he decided to self publish and dispels what he believes are common misconceptions about the traditional publishing and digital self publishing industries. He then guides the reader through the process of digital self publishing, encouraging writers to invest in quality editing and cover design.<br /><br />The third section of the book is dedicated to success stories of self publishers. It steers clear of the well known stars like Amanda Hocking, John Locke and Joe Konrath, and instead lets thirty-three relatively unknown self publishers tell their individual stories in their own words. As you read story after story, the over-arching message of this book is driven home: \\"Self-publishing takes work, patience and a lot of luck to succeed, but the rewards are tremendous.\\"<br /><br />And another cool quote: \\"People love discovering new writers and new stories, and they love sharing their discoveries. As long as you tell people your book is there, as long as you promote it beyond your family and friends, you have a chance. Readers will hear about your book, either from a friend, or a review, or one of your promotions on a forum, or on Facebook, or on Goodreads, or on Twitter and they will check it out.<br /><br />If they like the cover, they will read the blurb. If they like that, they will read the sample. If they like the sample they may purchase the book. If they enjoy the read, they will tell more people. This is word-of-mouth, and it's the only thing that has ever really sold books.\\"<br /><br />What didn't I like?<br /><br />I was disappointed that the book only focused on digital publishing because, unlike Gaughran, I don't believe that `print is doomed'. Perhaps it will be one day (I hope not), but we're a long way from there at the moment. Also, I was hoping for some more nitty gritty detail on the self publishing process itself. Overall though, this book offered some fantastic insights and I'm definitely glad I read it!

B006MPKE9O|4.0|This is not a book I would have selected for myself. It was a birthday present from a close relative who enjoyed it so much she wanted to share it with me - and I'm glad she did. I'm also glad that I waited until the holidays to read it, because I'm not sure I would've followed the book's complex, multi-layered plot very well if I'd read it in spits and spurts. As it happened, I read the entire 500+ pages in 72 hours while on a camping trip, burning through the pages of lyrical prose, as desperate as Daniel to unravel the mysteries of The Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />Zafon paints a rich portrait of Barcelona after the civil war, bringing to life a city and an era that I previously knew nothing about. I fell in love with many of the book's characters, particularly the eternally optimistic, slightly naive protagonist Daniel; the enigmatic subject of Daniel's fascination, Julian Carax; and Daniel's slightly crazy, lewd-but-loveable older friend Fermin.<br /><br />The plot contains two overarching stories - Daniel's and Julian's - which mirror each other and become increasingly intertwined as the book progresses. The cast of characters is quite huge, but each character plays an important part in the story. For me, The Shadow of the Wind is very much about loneliness, regret and the darker side of human nature, but is also laced with romance, kindness and love.<br /><br />It is also a book for book lovers. It captures the powerful relationship between a book and its reader beautifully, with passages such as:<br /><br />`Under the warm light cast by the reading lamp, I was submerged into a new world of images and sensations peopled by characters who seemed as real to me as my surroundings. Page after page I let the spell of the story and its world take me over, until the breath of dawn touched my window and my tired eyes slid over the last page. I lay in the bluish half-light with the book on my chest and listened to the murmur of the sleeping city. My eyes began to close, but I resisted. I did not want to lose the story's spell or bid farewell to its characters just yet.'<br /><br />Oh, that wonderful feeling of having finished a good book. Show me a book lover who can't relate to that passage!<br /><br />But although I adored this book, I also found it immensely frustrating. I had a love/hate relationship with its descriptive prose, because for every heartbreakingly beautiful passage, there were countless others that (in my opinion) could have benefited from a good prune.<br /><br />My main issue with this book, though, relates to the narrative. Although the story is predominantly told in first person from Daniel's perspective, there are large chunks that involve others recounting their memory of past events to Daniel. These memories add depth and further the plot, however they contain insights that are impossible for the person recounting the memory to have. For example, if I was telling you a story about a man I met years ago and hadn't been in contact with since, it would seem odd if I told you exactly what he was doing and precisely what he was thinking months after our last meeting. The Shadow of the Wind was riddled with point-of-view errors of this nature, and they marred an otherwise amazing reading experience for me. Zafon is obviously a masterful story teller, so I don't understand why he couldn't have applied his skills to provide us with these insights through other means.se, but I resisted.

B008KW43TE|5.0|I have been a Frank Ocean fan since the Nostalgia/Ultra & the Lonnie Breaux mixtapes. I love his honesty, creativity, rawness & originality. Have you ever wished a song would never end? \\"Thinkin bout you\\" is that song for me. I love that you can feel his desperation & longing for this person to see just how much he loves & wants to be with them. We all have been there & Frank does is it so beautifully. My favs are \\"thinkin bout you\\", \\"bad religion\\", \\"pink matter\\", \\"pyramids\\", \\"rich kids\\", \\"monks\\", all of them! Even \\"fertilizer\\". This will be on constant repeat. I can't say it enough! I love, love, love Channel Orange & Frank Ocean.
B004FQX59I|5.0|Fortunately I also have this on VHS. The thing is just better on the tape. Don't know why? Back to the movie. Fasinating! I love the fact that the guy had the balls to investigate this(in the life of the time), to bring someone to trail for JFK's assination & murder. There are parts in the movie where the hair on the back of my neck stands up! Where the Government does whatever it feels it needs to do to keep tabs on & strongly discourage & discredit (Kevin Costner's) character. Watch out for BIG BROTHER, & all his machinations. The scene in the courtroom where Mr. Garrison gives that riveting speech! Awesome! Personally, I think alot of what they showed in the movie could have happened. I don't for 1 minute think 1 bullet could have moved the way the warren commission said it did in real life. It hit too much bone ( which damages the bullet each time it hits) for it ti be in near pristine shape. I still think there was more than 1 shooter & the gov't has covered it up all these years. It's A Fantastic movie about a subject that never ends.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I've seen two different versions of this and have had it on vhs for a long time.  I was so excited to get it switched over to dvd.

034580404X|5.0|I wasn't expecting what I got. People told me, it was porn. It was not. Parts of it left me in tears. I found it to be a passionate love story about two people who fall in love unexpectedly. Yes, there is sex and lots of it. Ana, in my opinion, seems older than her years considering she's a virgin. Grey is magnetic! I fell in love with him too. My heart went out to him after learning what he went through as a child, who his mother was and how it molded his life. He is brilliant as is Ana. It was a page turner. I had a difficult time putting it down. I'm looking forward to #3 after finishing #2 in two days. I marvel at Ana's innocense and beauty having the power to change Grey and his dark side. It is a powerful lesson in good vs. evil. Good always wins! Bravo, James!!<br /><br />Grey's adoptive parents and family were amazing as well. Grace and her husband gave this young child, who seemed hopeless, a life with love, compassion and hope. These are the qualities that made him love Ana. These characters will live on in my memory...hard to forget. Now, on to #3.
B007FZ7R7W|5.0|I don't care what the critics have to say this album is truly amazing. I may be a member of Team Breezy but I wouldn't say such a thing if this album was garbage, WHICH IT AIN'T!!!. Chris blend hip hop, R&B, techno, pop, and dubstep all into this incredible sounding album that can get people up and dancing and then move them into the bedroom. Besides the sound if people actually take a chance to listen to the lyrics there are really meaningful. Despite what u may have heard it's not all about sex, of course he has some freaky songs on there (He's an R&B singer duh!!!), but the bottom line of it all is him showing his fans that he has grown up and matured into an incredible man
B000FQIRXQ|5.0|I've had this on vhs for a long time and I really wanted to switch to a dvd.  Of course, noone but Amazon had it.  Got a good price on it, received it in a short time period and it's in perfect condition.  Very good version of this story, and I have three versions.  This is my fav!
B005JCT4B0|5.0|This neat little package is a uk import, and its a pretty good deal. why get 2 of their albums when you can get all of them for the same price?<br />Pantera and disturbed are my fave bands. if your a collector, or a fan, or are just getting into pantera, i suggest you purchase this. My personal fave albums were Far Beyond Driven, and Vulgar Display of Power. They dont come in cases or with booklets like the actual albums, and they come in a small cardboard-type sleeve. still, it has all their songs. great deal if you want to save money

031620157X|5.0|I was a bit apprehensive about this book. I'm a big Chris Colfer fan and I was terrified I'd hate his book or taht it would be poorly written. I absolutely love it! I purchased both the regular book as well as the audio. I'm 28 and I listened to it in the car with my parents (both in their early 60s). They both loved it as well and didn't want me to turn it off!<br /><br />For those who don't know, the audio is read by Chris himself which is great because you really get so much more out of it when the author is reading the audio book.<br /><br />The story flows well and doesn't drag. I approached this book knowing it was written for young adults and didn't expect it to be a fantasy book written for adults. The main characters are 6th graders so it's pretty obvious.<br /><br />I loved this book. It is well written and easy to fall right into!

B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have at least four or five different versions of Emma and this is BY FAR the best one available.  Amazon had great pricing, delivery and excellent condition.  This one I've already watched four times since receiving it.  VERY well \\"fleshed\\" out storyline -- much better IMO than the other versions available.
B0059XTTW8|3.0|While the distillation of the extremely complex plot of the novel is done very efficiently here, I still question whether someone unfamiliar with either the book or the television series would be able to follow it. In essence, I question whether a two hour format is the appropriate medium for this material at all, particularly since there is so much plot (even in its reduced form) that it trades off with characterization. Of the possible moles, for instance, only Alleline has a clearly defined persona-- not because the acting is poor or unmemorable (indeed, the whole cast is a bit of an English character actor dream team), but because so much has been cut (Bland's part has been nearly excised altogether). Even when scenes remain, a good 85% of the dialog from the book is gone (a shame, this, since Le Carré's dialog is so good). This means the audience never invests in any suspects, nor has the time or data to ponder who the mole could be. It is difficult for me to imagine an audience caring one way or the other who the mole is at the reveal when he has been on screen for maybe five minutes prior to that point.<br />.<br />John Hurt makes a strong impression as Control (it is John Hurt, after all), and Gary Oldman is fine as Smiley (though I'll always imagine Alec Guinness in the role), but because the movie is never allowed to breathe, I find myself strongly preferring the television cast at nearly every point (probably because they get to do things in the television version like actually deliver dialog or remain on-screen for more than ten seconds at a time). The movie could really have used another thirty minutes or so to allow the performances to register. It could also have used an injection of the humor from the source material.<br />.<br />In the end, the book and the television adaptation are both much better, and my recommendation would be to investigate both (in that order). This version is not a disaster by any means, but neither is it terribly good (at least in comparison). A word or caution, however: though *Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy* is a spy novel, it is not a thriller. Instead it is a serious, character-driven book whose characters just happen to be spies. There are no James Bonds or Jason Bournes in sight, and if that is what one is seeking, you would do well to look elsewhere.

0375842209|5.0|When I was in the middle of reading this book, a friend told me that her teenaged son was also in the middle of it, as required summer reading for high school. Now that I have finished reading it, I am thrilled that the book has found its way onto school lists.<br /><br />Poetically written, with many arresting images and turns of phrase, \\"The Book Thief\\" manages to combine immense seriousness of subject matter with a light narrative touch. It does indeed remind me a little bit of Vonnegut and a little of Lemony Snicket, but without the nihilism of the former or the nasty snarkiness of the latter. Teenagers who have read Lemony Snicket may find the narrative style easier to absorb, but they should also recognize that \\"The Book Thief\\" is infinitely deeper and more humane than \\"A Series of Unfortunate Events.\\" It actually reminded me of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird,\\" with its foreshadowing and its images of children caught in an adult world.<br /><br />There are so many novels about children during World War II, but this one provides the perspective of ordinary, lower-class Christian Germans (both children and adults),instead of focusing on only the Jewish experience. The narrator (Death) keeps reminding and showing the reader that no matter how bad things are for the Christian German characters in this book (and almost all of them die), things were enormously worse for the Jewish Germans. The issue of collective guilt is neither hidden nor resolved; the book is going to spark some terrific class discussions!<br /><br />I am delighted to recognize a classic in \\"The Book Thief.\\"

0670022411|4.0|The writing in this book is rather dry, which quite a few people seem to think means it's terrible. But just because it's a little slow, doesn't mean it's not brilliant. Yes, it was a little hard to get into. I admit that. But it was really, very good and I'm glad I got it.<br />On the flip side, I do agree that  the prices are a little steep for kindle usage- though they have come down some.
0307352145|4.0|There was a lot to enjoy about this book. For anyone who's ever wondered if the squeaky wheel gets the grease ... check this out! I loved how the author started off with powerful examples of Rosa Parks being a quiet but powerful history maker, and then moving into the story of Dale Carnegie and how he struggled with public speaking ... quiet giants! I gave this book 5 stars because I didn't feel that he author fully explored the value of the inner life of introverts. Instead, she focused on the title - Quiet. There is more (much more!) to being an introvert than to simply being quiet. It relates to creativity, thoughtfulness, problem solving, and defining what is crucial to the self. At the same time, I'm grateful to the author to shining a spotlight on this particular topic, and I felt her writing style is what I'd call \\"magazine\\" style - which is to say, simple and easily, quickly read.
0307272702|4.0|Anyone who has ever read scientific studies on the results of the \\"Atkins\\" type diet versus the \\"conventional wisdom\\" diets will not be very surprised or gain a lot of new insights from reading this book. However, what the author does do is set the record straight about how low carb/sugar diets were the accepted mainstream conventional wisdom diets for several hundred years all the way and up to around the mid 1950s. Then a revolution occurred that resulted in nearly all the experts running off on a new nutrition trail to the point that what was once accepted wisdom is now considered a diet fad, or even dangerous to your health.<br /><br />I have one question or quibble with the facts stated in the book. That alcoholic beverages are high glycemic carbs. After reading the book, I ran across an article online by a David Hanson, Phd in which he states that the fermentation process converts all sugars & starches into ethyl alcohol, a zero carb liquid. In addition, the body processes this alcohol into an acetate, which is finally broken down into carbon dioxide & water. He maintains that the GI of beer, wine & distilled spirits is zero. I hope Mr. Taube will address this issue in his next book or update of this book.

B007SGM084|1.0|Having heard all the hype about this trilogy, I thought why not buy it and read it during vacation.  I was quite entrigued by the first 6 chapters but then, disgusted by what was written and what I was reading.  Although the story line is a good one, I don't feel all the extra, pornographic descriptions were called for.  I would not recommend this to anyone.

0385344228|4.0|I thought this book was good and did not have a predictable ending.. I think the ending left the reader to form their own opinion.  Did Jacob kill Ben? Did he kill the girl he met on vacation? These questions were never directly answered and his mom's decision at the end was something I would have never expected. It didn't wrap up in a neat bow and make you feel good.

B0083H6AQA|1.0|I was apprehensive about watching this movie because of my aversion to Robert Pattinson. But the rest of the cast are all actors and actresses I have enjoyed in the past so I gave it a shot. My first thought after watching this movie was that Mr. Potato Head could have portrayed George DuBois with a larger range of emotions. Hell any other male actor could have done this role more justice. The rest of the cast are fantastic in their portrayals and it makes Pattinson's acting the more awkward to watch. Save yourself the time and watch an old favorite instead, I personally ran to sense and sensibility for comfort.
034580404X|5.0|These books will make your boyfriend/husband seem unattentive...  They are a lot of fun to read and definitely worth getting the whole trilogy together as you can't read just one.
0345803485|1.0|Really...?  Really????  This....drivel is a best seller?<br />Wow...<br />I don't have much to say, all the other one-star reviewers have it spot on.  I pretty much just wanted to put up one more one star review so I can bring the average down that much farther.<br />The only good thing I can say about this triology (yes, I read the whole stupid thing, but only because my friend loaned me the books and I didn't have to buy them myself) is that it improved my own \\"marital relations\\" with my husband.  NOT because it got me all hot and bothered, which it DID NOT! (SHOUTY CAPITALS), But because after reading these so called hot-n-steamy sex scenes, I thought to myself.. \\"I can do better than that!\\"<br /><br />EDIT:  What I didn't mention that now I think I should have is that I found the perfect quote for this series: \\"The WORST book I couldn't put down!\\"<br />Frankly, I wanted to see how it ended. Because, if this story had a decent editor, cut out the fluff, repetition, ratcheted up the steamier spots (which woulda made the triology a short novella, but it may have been a good read), and gave the characters more than one dimension, I think this would have been a great read!  Really, I think with over-looking everything else bad about this trilogy, I think that what bothered me the most was that the characters didn't evolve throughout the trials they encountered.  They start at point \\"A\\" on page 1 and at the end they are....still at point \\"A\\".  Everything is perfect. Perfect home, prefect jobs, perfect family and friends, no problems to overcome....ever.... and they live happily ever after....<br />LAME
0062206281|4.0|The Prisoner of Heaven by Carlos Ruiz Zafón begins with a two-paragraph explanation stating that it is part of a cycle of books, which includes the Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game, and that the books can be read in any order.  Technically, one could read the books in any order and still manage to find one's way in the labyrinthine world Zaf'n has created; however, if I had read Prisoner first, I would not have fallen under the spell of Zafon's writing.<br /><br />Shadow and Angel were masterpieces.  Prisoner, though the shortest of the three, took a long time, almost halfway through the book, before it became a worthy successor to its predecessors.  But got there it did and so my advice for any old fans out there is to stick it out.  All the sinister intrigue, secrets, murder, betrayal, revenge - come in the second half of the book.  Because it connects Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game in startling revelations, you will not want to miss Prisoner.<br /><br />For those unacquainted with Zafon, do not start with Prisoner, no matter what you are told.  Start with either Shadow of the Wind or The Angel's Game and then proceed.  Prisoner is the weakest link, but it suffices for several reasons.<br /><br />First - we finally find out about Fermin, who is one of the best literary characters ever created.  Outrageous and a master of ironic hyperbole, he still has the best zingers of anyone in the book.  Prisoner is ostensibly his novel, delving into his past as prisoner #13 in an infamous prison on top of a mountain overlooking Barcelona.  But in uncovering Fermin's past, the reader also uncovers secrets of what happened to David Martin, the protagonist of The Angel's Game, as well as Isabella, the mother of Daniel Sempere, featured in Shadow of the Wind.<br /><br />\\"'Where have you come from?' asked that woman whom Fermin, in his delirium, mistook for his mother.<br /><br />\\"'From among the dead, Mother,' he whispered.  'I've come back from among the dead.'\\"<br /><br />We are also introduced to a villain so heinous that by the time Prisoner ended, I wanted to exact my own revenge on him.  Which brings me to the inspiration for Prisoner's plot that Zafon mentions throughout the narrative, The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexander Dumas.  The second half is heavily influenced by Dumas and all the better for it!  Escapes, near death, new identities, and the past coming to haunt the present.  So much so that when the book ends, on a very ominous yet thrilling note, how I wished I had the fourth book already so that I could find out what happens next!<br /><br />Despite the fact that I have been to Barcelona and did not much care for it, reading Prisoner, as I did with Shadow of the Wind and The Angel's Game, made me yearn for this dark and seductive city all over again.  The Barcelona of which Zafon writes does not exist anymore or perhaps never did but as depicted in his books, Barcelona is rich and magical place, even if very dangerous.<br /><br />Going back to the villain, a failed, wanna be writer who persecutes and tortures David Martin, a successful and talented author - Zaf'n again introduces a theme that runs through all the books.  Writing as a dark and dangerous gift which brings its owner nothing but accursed suffering.  Which I hope isn't the case for Zafon.<br /><br />\\"'...[I]f you don't trust a novelist, who are you going to trust?'<br /><br />\\"Fermin watched Martin walked off down the yard wrapped in his portable cloud of cigarette-stub smoke.<br /><br />\\"'Holy mother of God,' he murmured to the wind.\\"

B007Z9QWVK|1.0|This would be a better movie if it wasn't based on real people. The writers clearly couldn't be bothered to check up on the basic historical details at all. George III was claimed to be Edward's Father (actually George V) and he [George] died in January 1936. So you can imagine my amazement that somehow Edward managed to celebrate his June birthday in 1936 before his father died. Terrible! If you don't know anything about Edward and Wallis, you might enjoy this movie; if however, you have any idea of the truth of their story, avoid it like the plague - or else it will plague you!
0345803485|1.0|First of all I could hardly get through the terrible writting, second the fact that all these women are going crazy about this book is extreamly sad because it just shows that literature has no standards anymore, and third the only reason this book is catching like wildfire is because of the content. The content matter had its potential of being a great story, however with the poor writing and limited vocabulary I would say to not waste your money. The only reason why I got through this book is because I hate leaving a book unfinished, I will not run out to get the next book nor the third, my life is much better off knowing that I won't have to read more about this girl's \\"inner Goddess\\" or her over use of \\"oh my\\". Clearly those who rave about this book are the ones whos last book they read was in high school.

1468161660|5.0|Absolutely beautiful story that will leave you with a changed perspective on life.  I was absolutely floored when I found out the moral delima Will and Lake faced.  I continued to be floored with every twist and turn.  I love the way the book feels.  It's real life and not the sugar-coated perfectly happy endings too often seen in YA novels.  In fact, I wouldn't even categorize this book as YA.  More like a contemporary novel that just happens to be about the lives of two young people.  I could go on and on and on, but please just read the book and I promise you'll be in love.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|I purchased this to improve the sound from a pair of Sennheiser HD438 Headphone, and it has done that.  Now I can boost volume to far more than I'm comfortable with or more than it is safe to do.  But most of all the clarity of the music I listen too, classic and contemporary rock; and jazz has improved.  I can clearly hear the hi-hats cymbals and the cords of acoustic guitars.  I will confirm what many others have said in their reviews that when I use it with a laptop, I do get noisy play.  But when I listen to music with my iPad 3 and the optional iPad/iTouch connector, the music is very clean.<br /><br />The negative of this unit is that the battery isn't replaceable, once it dies and can no longer hold a charge, it will have to be replaced.  But I'm sold on headphone Amps and when my E6 no longer works, I will replace it with another higher end unit with a user replaceable battery.  But for twenty dollars, its a pretty good improvement on sound quality and I'm very happy with it.

B000ICLRJ8|5.0|For whatever reason, I wasn't expecting this Blu Ray version to be much good tho I had always enjoyed the movie itself.  Too many transfers of older movies are just done too poorly.  I was wrong.  The video transfer is really very good and there is a clear sharpness in the details without any noticeable grain.  However, and my eyes could be tricking me on this, towards the end of the film, where the gray sky is often part of the image, I would see grain there, in the sky.  Odd for me to see it there as in any of the dark scenes or even in the muted, semi desaturated colors of the landscapes, uniforms in individuals, there was no grain.  Just the sky.  Maybe it is my eyes getting older.<br /><br />The audio editing and  transfer to DTSHD 5.1 was excellent on all levels.  The surrounds don't really come in until the pilots are in the jets, but then your entire audio system is put to work throughout the remaining film with clearly directed discreet channel use  Your subwoofer will have plenty of work to do and many of the scenes are totally system demo worthy.<br /><br />I paid 6.99 for this DVD and it was well worth it.  Personally, I hate reviews that only supply book reports and opinions of the plot and characters.  I want to know about the Blu Ray's quality and that is what I focus on.  By the way, there are no extras other than commentary and a waste of space 'trailers'<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

030758836X|4.0|Wow! This book runs the gambit of reviews. I really loved it, because it had a twist I didn't see coming, and that alone made it worth the price of the book.<br /><br />The story starts off a bit slow, but soon you are wondering what happened to Amy...I won't go into details since it will spoil the story.<br /><br />As for the ending, I personally thought it was perfect since these two people were in a really crazy relationship, so for me anyway, the ending was fantastic. Not sure why there was such a strong reaction to it. I actually did find myself thinking of the story, and how crazy it was long after I closed the book. For me, that is a great gauge, does it make you re-consider your own relationship after you finished reading...in this case, the answer was yes!<br /><br />Best,<br />P

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Though I must admit this isn't my favorite of John Green's books, it is certainly as good as everyone's been talking about it.  John Green is one of those authors where all his books are funny, yet sad, deep, yet somewhat silly.  He definitely is the author I've read most of that hasn't written any series.  I recommend all of his books!

B004RE29PO|3.0|This time its war! The iconic line from the blockbuster 1986 action picture Aliens. This film is the sequel to the 1979 horror flick Alien. First of all, let me just say for the record I didn't think the film was going to compare to the original. As I sat there watching Aliens earlier today, I found myself liking Aliens more and more, and as time went on I found myself liking Aliens better than Alien. Now don't get me wrong, Alien was an awesome horror film, but with the slow pacing leading up to the moments of suspense, I thought that Aliens was a better film because of the fast paced action and the acting was incredible. Now I know why Sigourney Weaver was nominated for best actress of that year. She puts all her effort into making Ripley believeable, relateable, and a bad ass chick who kicks Aliens Asses. So to say I prefer Aliens over Alien. But of course people should see the original first because then the second one doesn't really make sense. Anyway on to the blu ray review. The tranfer was crystal clear and amazing. I thought I was watching a movie made yesterday because of how well they did on cleaning and upping the picture quality and the sound. To me the transfer looked better on this than on the Alien blu ray.(But that's just my opinion). On to the bonus features. This single disc blu ray comes with commentaries by director james Cameron and cast and crew. It also comes with the 1986 theatrical version and the 1991 special edition.(I've only seen the theatrical version). But anyway if you're an Aliens film fan then make sure to pick this up.(Oh and P.S., both The Alien and Aliens blu ray come in cheap Eco friendly blu ray cases. So if I were you I'd have some extra non Eco friendly blu ray cases on hand). This is One of the best films of the '80s so I strongly think you should watch this film. Bye, Bye now.

B00843TZJ2|3.0|I was a huge fan of Crosby, Stills, and Nash (and sometimes Young) beginning with their 1969 debut album. I attended several concerts and bought everything the guys recorded together and apart up to \\"CSN\\" (1977). Then, for several reasons, CSN's music began to grate on me and I generally stayed away, although I've retained a strong interest in the music of Crosby and his preceding band, the Byrds.<br /><br />CSN has been touring every summer for several years and I've caught a few shows. I attended their concert in Rochester N.Y. in 2009 and was disappointed that half of the tunes were from their aborted covers album. I didn't pay all that scratch to hear covers. They scheduled another appearance in Rochester as part of their 2012 summer tour and I considered attending but opted out when I heard about this DVD package. Why pay $120 for two concert tickets when I could see the same show on DVD for $20?<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this DVD. The guys play most of the big hits with some solo material, a sprinkling of new songs, and a couple of Buffalo Springfield tunes. The 5-piece back-up band (organ, drums, bass, guitar, keyboards) is tight. The venue is great (recorded at The Performing Arts Center, San Luis Obispo, CA, 4/22/12) and the editing and sound are very good. Sixty-seven-year-old Stills, ranked #47 in Rolling Stone's latest 100 Greatest Guitarists list, shows he can still play at a high level but he has lost quite a bit of vocal range. It's also evident, and I'll put this as kindly as I can with all due respect to a great musician, that he struggles with his enunciation as a result of dental work. Several years ago there were even rumors floating around that he had suffered a stroke because of his elocution difficulties but I can remember seeing signs of the problem way back in a 1991 Bob Costas interview. His hearing loss no doubt compounds the issue. However, seventy-one-year-old Crosby and a spry seventy-year-old Nash can still sing up a storm. Their spine-tingling harmonic crescendo at the end of Guinnevere is worth the price of the DVD alone. I'm not a huge fan of Nash's in-your-face social sermonizing, one of the reasons I originally lost interest in the group. Anyone remember his \\"...rules and regulations, who needs them?...\\" from \\"Chicago\\"? I'll bet Nash has made damn sure his accountants took advantage of every rule and regulation over the years.  Nash has made a very comfortable living out of criticizing the \\"establishment\\" and then retreating back to his lovely fan-financed mansion in Encino and now, in the exclusive North Shore neighborhood of Kauai, Hawaii. His new song, \\"Almost Gone,\\" which glorifies Bradley Manning, the troubled Army private who passed classified military documents to WikiLeaks, is downright nauseating. Crosby definitely got squeezed out of this concert with the lion's share of the songs written by Stills and Nash. He only has one song in the entire second set. The concert's final encore, Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, is an absolute joy to watch and listen to even though we all can sing the song backwards in our sleep.<br /><br />The DVD features a highly edited interview segment in which CSN individually gush over each other. But anyone who has kept pace with CSN knows Crosby and Nash tolerate Stills for business reasons only.<br /><br />Fans of CSN will appreciate this DVD very much. Let's face it, how much more time is left for these guys to be able to perform together? Too bad Crosby, Roger McGuinn, and Chris Hillman couldn't get together for one last go 'round as the Byrds. We're only three years away from that band's 50th anniversary but McGuinn won't be persuaded even then. And why couldn't someone have put together a DVD of one of the 2011 Buffalo Springfield concerts? Neil Young probably put the kibosh on that.<br /><br />Postscript - 8/22/13: Nash's hero, traitor Bradley Manning, was convicted of leaking classified documents and sentenced to thirty-five years in military prison. But Manning released a statement today claiming he's actually a woman and is demanding the U.S. Army provide him transgender hormone therapy and surgery. Since the Army refuses to do so maybe multi-millionaire Nash could dip into his hefty bank account and help out his hero.t Manning released a statement today claiming he's actually a woman and is demanding the U.S. Army provide him transgender hormone therapy and surgery.

B0089IGUP4|3.0|This is the fourth album by The Gaslight Anthem and in my opinion the worst of the four. While their earlier albums are raw and full of heart, this album comes off to me as overproduced and soulless. This album was completely average with maybe 3-4 stand out songs (45 is my favorite so far). I will mention that I prefer my music uptempo and raw so please take that into account when you are thinking of purchasing this album. My album preferences for these guys go (best to worst): 59 Sound, Sink or Swim, American Slang, and finally this album. I hope that gives you a brief look at this album. I will update if my feelings change.

B000VOC90Y|5.0|I just finished getting my bachelor's degree and this backpack has been with me through the entire 3 and a half years.  It still looks great!  The zippers have held up very well and never jumped their tracks.  It held my 17 inch laptop easily.  It was very comfortable (even though I have a small frame) and well padded.  The cell phone pouch held all the phones (of various sizes) that I've had over the years.  I loved having all the room.  When I was a freshman, I packed all the books I needed, papers and folders plus lunch in this thing!<br /><br />It has held up very well but has a few places of wear.  The plastic handle on the top cracked a little bit but that was no big deal because all it did was cover the cable that was the real handle.  The mesh side pockets have some pick marks but that was to be expected because the pockets always held water bottles or an umbrella.  A seam on the right shoulder strap broke but that was because I used it the most and abused it.  Despite that though it still held and works just fine.  The red paint on the plastic part are either going or gone.  Other than that, the Ibex still looks great and is just as functional as it was when I bought it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great backpack...BUY IT! :)

0062206281|4.0|I did not realize when I chose to review this novel that it was part of a series. I didn't really find it out until I read a couple of reviews for it. I could see where some questions could be answered but I in no way felt that I lost at sea, so to speak. The Prisoner of Heaven can definitely stand on its own and it has certainly piqued my interest in seeking out Mr. Zafon's first two books in this intriguing Spanish tale.<br /><br />I was drawn to the story by the promise of a bit of historical novel, a bit of a love story and the hint of mystery. It delivered on all fronts. It's a very hard book to try and describe as it is quite unlike anything I've read before. It is a dark gem full of rich characters of both good and evil and it uses my favorite novel, The Count of Monte Cristo as a reference and a reverence.<br /><br />Mr. Zafon creates a dark world for war torn Barcelona in 1939. Fermin Romero de Tores is swept up into prison for reasons never fully explained (one of those questions I mentioned above) and he meets famous author David Martin who helps him to escape with the promise that he will look after his friend Isabella and her child.<br /><br />In present day Barcelona (1957 in the book) Fermin and Daniel, Isabella's child are best friends and the book details how that came to be through Fermin's confession to Daniel when the past rises and threatens the peace of the present.<br /><br />It's a horrifying and well written tale and it is not over...another book is alluded to and I will look forward to it. The writing is exceptional; Mr. Zafon's pen sets a mood whether dark or light with words that dance on the page. He draws you into the dank, smelly prison where Fermin suffers and he celebrates the beauty of a sunset just as effectively. He is a seductive writer no matter the subject. I will most certainly seek out more of his work and keep this one in my library.
0307592731|5.0|Typically, this isn't my kind of book.  I'm more of a history or romance person.  My co-worker had mentioned this book and how good it was, so I decided I'd read it and see what I thought.  IT WAS AWESOME! I seriously looked forward to going home every night after work and reading it; I stayed up way too late most every night because I was so caught up in it. I was fantastic! I even bought one for my friend for her birthday because it reminded me of her.  If you haven't read it, read it; if you have read it, pass it on to your friends.

030788743X|5.0|Just finished a really good nerdy book called Ready Player One.  Its full of 80's trivia and music, movies, video games, and Dungeons and Dragons.  Also has elements of Tron and the Matrix, even War Games.  I'll bet this one becomes a movie. Reads very fast.  The immersive world in the book is similar to Second Life.<br /><br />- R Parsons
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After reading the first two books, the third was a must read.  I was sorry to see the series end.  In book one I was disappointed in the first third of the book and thought it was written by a teenager, but after that I really got into the story and couldn't put it down.  I would really recommend this series just on the story itself.  The sex is important in the read, but doesn't overpower the story.  I'm 65 and my daughters were really shocked to find out I had read the series as they too are reading it.  Too funny.
B007RQ3VB0|1.0|Now that vinyl is available again in new releases, I am keen to buy that and confident that a download is available for digital use. No digital is apparently available for this vinyl and I am disappointed that this restricts my listening. Content should only  have to be purchased one time. Love the record, but it would be great to hear it while I am on the subway or away from my record player. Patti, was this a bizness decision?
0553103547|5.0|One of the most amazing books I have ever read, period.  I have read many sci-fi, fantasy books and this is by far the most engaging.  I will be ordering the next book today.  If all the books are this good then this may be the best fantasy series of all time, even against Tolkien.
B003TU16AG|5.0|I would probably rate these 4 1/2 stars if I could based solely on the fact that these sandals aren't nearly as great until they are broken in. But after like a month or two of use, they are amazing! And the whole thing doesn't need breaking in, just mainly the area around the toes. I wear a pretty big size(15), and that may have a lot to do with it. Since a lot of the shoes I buy seem uncomfortable at first and one of my friends would get the same pair and loves them... Regardless, awesome sandals when they are broken in. Before being broken in they are still above average.
0452257743|4.0|This collection contains 4 Bachman novels: Rage, The Long Walk, Roadwork, and The Running Man.<br /><br />Rage:<br />A story about a troubled teen who lashes out during school, taking the class hostage. While it's a great novel, and a definite page-turner, the few hours spent in the classroom would not be enough for Stockholm syndrome to take effect which is what we see happen. Otherwise, great. 4.5/5<br /><br />The Long Walk:<br />A story about a competetion between 100 boys aged 18 and under who must walk until only one is left standing. You must keep a pace of at least 4 miles per hour. A great story. A bit long here and there. It is a \\"long\\" walk afterall. Good story. 4/5<br /><br />Roadwork:<br />A story about a man whose home is to be demolished to make way for an interstate. It follows him over the course of 3 months as he very rapidly loses his sense of reality. A great read. This one I honestly could not put down. If I could go higher I would. 5/5<br /><br />The Running Man:<br />A story about a future world where contestants, usually desperately poor and in need of any source of money available, risk their lives at the hands of \\"hunters\\" who hunt them down and kill them. They have a 12 hour head start and can go anywhere in the world as long as they mail in two tapes per day. If they make it 30 days, they get a billion dollars. No one has ever lasted 30 days. A bit reminiscent of The Most Dangerous Game. The movie is NOTHING like the book. The only similarity is the name of the main character. That's it! Back to the book... I found this book dragging on, even though it's one of the shorter ones. I couldn't wait for it to be over. It just wasn't a very good story and nothing really made me want to read it like the other three. The end is good, but it takes a while to get there. 2.5/5<br /><br />Overall:<br />A great collection. Roadwork is by far the best of the 4 even though most people claim it's a bit boring. I honestly do not understand this because I could not stop reading it. It was so engaging I just couldn't stop. If this did not have The Running Man I'd give the collection a 5, easily, due to Roadwork. But The Running Man is so bad it drops the score way down.

This movie truly captures what it was like in this time and puts it in a funny way. It teaches us to stand up for ourselves in what we beileve in. Perfect rainy day and even a date night movie!
B007SGM084|5.0|I kept hearing about this Book from all the women I work with, and they kept telling me that my wife needed to read them. I wasn't sure about it but these women at work were clearly in an \\"aggitated\\" (read horny) state just talking about these books so I thought what the hell and got these for my wife for Mother's Day.<br /><br />At first, when I gave them to my wife (we got the Kindle version), she asked me what kind of books they were, so I described them as a romance type book, like a Daniele Steele book and she immediately did not want to read them. I was a bit upset/heart broken that she didn't like my gift, and they sat there unread for about a week. One day I saw her reading the Kindle and asked her what she was reading... She told me her friend's told her to give the books a chance so she started reading them. She was immediately hooked.<br /><br />She read all 3 books in a week, and she is the type of person that takes like 2 to 3 weeks to read one book.<br /><br />Now, my wife wasn't that into sex before she read the books... we had sex 1 to 2 times a month, and we have only been married 5 years. The almost non existant sex life was a big stain on our marriage. Let me tell you, these books saved our sex life!<br /><br />Ever since she has read these books we have sex around 2 to 3 times a week... a HUGE improvement from before!!! She is more open to trying things, and she is actually adventerous now, i.e. sex outdoors!<br /><br />So, for all those guys out there whose wives are stingy in the bedroom, get them to read these books!<br /><br /> THANK YOU E.J. JAMES!!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am loving this trilogy!  I have just finished book 2 and can't wait to start the third.  I am sorry it is the last:(  Gets your blood pumping all the way through!
B00899DR40|1.0|First off, I normally wouldn't even bother with this, because I don't even listen to this type of music anyways. However, I am completely fed up with having this kid being shoved in my face, and having to hear a number of his songs from this album against my will. Not only that, but I am sick and tired of hearing him get way too much undue praise, even being referred to as \\"this generation's big musician.\\" Yes, G. Issacs, I am talking about you! Being a music aficionado with a collection of well over 700 CDs (and counting), I am by no means biased or closed-minded. You don't have to be biased or closed-minded in order to speak out against a hack like Justin Bieber. If anything, it is the other way around.<br /><br />Honestly, despite the fact that this album is distinctively different from his earlier releases, I really have to put my foot down on what so many of these \\"Beliebers\\" have been saying. Ask yourselves: What is so special and unique about him? How is he any different from anyone else whose songs are played on contemporary radio? I'll bet anything that NO ONE in the right mind will be able to think of anything to support these claims. The fact is this: He is merely the latest incarnation of the same, generic love song formula that has been in place ever since N'Sync, Backstreet Boys and NKOTB, if not earlier.<br /><br />This kid may have a voice, and I know that he plays those instruments that he seemingly taught himself to play, but that IS NOT what gets him all his money and his fame. I guarantee you that if he was as ugly as Oscar The Grouch, all else about him being the same, then he wouldn't even have a fraction of the fame that he has, if any at all. The over-emphasis on image is so obvious, it's not even funny.<br /><br />Honestly, if you MUST listen to this, then that's fine. However, I really have to take issue with those who claim, \\"Oh, he's the greatest this, he's the greatest that, he's FIRST RATE!\\" or \\"He's here to stay, he's going to go down in history!\\" To those people, I will say this: STOP IT! STOP IT RIGHT NOW!!! Dream all you want, but just because you say it, DOES NOT mean that it's true! You are kidding no one but yourselves, and you WILL regret it later on in life. Listen to some Peter Gabriel, Phil Collins, Marvin Gaye, Elvis Costello, John Coltrane, B.B. King, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, Nirvana, Tupac Shakur, Depeche Mode, Devo, Enya, Beethoven, Wagner, or any kind of contemporary independent music (an encyclopedia of bands and artists in itself) out there, and THEN tell me he's the greatest.<br /><br />To Mr. G. Issacs: If you are reading this, let me tell you right now that you are DEAD WRONG to say that Justin Bieber is \\"the big musician of this generation.\\" He is far from it. He is nowhere even CLOSE. Anyone who speaks of him in such a way is automatically ignorant, and is kidding themselves to no end. There are a countless number of musicians/bands/artists out there right now across many distinctive genres who are barely known to the general public, and yet despite the astronomical amount of talent, uniqueness and creativity they have over Justin, their music is not \\"marketable\\" enough. THOSE people are what collectively make up this generation's big musicians, NOT Justin! If anyone wants me to name any examples, just let me know.<br /><br />To Mr. Neville Ross: Don't even think about trying to start another fight with me! You've done it TWICE before, and lost miserably both times. You're not gaining anything from having a problem with someone like me who is willing to stand up for what I believe in. I am most certainly not biased, nor am I close-minded, even though you like to say that I am. Ask yourself, if I am a rock n' roll only-loving North American, then why did I mention artists like Marvin Gaye, John Coltrane, Tupac Shakur or Depeche Mode in the list above? As for Richard Wagner, I own his complete operas. Boo-ya! Please feel free to read the extended response I left you on another review on this album. I think its content should suffice. :)<br /><br />All in all, if you must listen to this album and enjoy it, I have no objections, but DO NOT proclaim that Justin Bieber is the greatest of anything, because he's not! He is nowhere even close to being \\"this generation's big musician\\" and he will never walk the same musical plateau as those greats I mentioned. I thank you for your understanding, and have a nice day! ;)ft you on another review on this album.

B006CC0YB0|5.0|This sounds to me like the album Mark Lanegan has been trying to make for years.  His first solo albums, [[ASIN:B0000035EH The Winding Sheet]] (1992) and the excellent [[ASIN:B0000035F5 Whiskey for the Holy Ghost]] (1994), were basically acoustic side-projects from the Screaming Trees.  This is the most fully realized album he's made since then, and it's not acoustic, but full-out rock.  BLUES FUNERAL is full of great songs, with strong melodies and beats, but the whole is greater than the sum of its parts -- it's a great *album*, with a cohesive sound and mood.  The mood is dark, of course.  Taking the lyrics into account, it sounds to me like a noir cyberpunk novel.<br /><br />Alain Johannes deserves a massive amount of credit.  The central band is Lanegan vocals, Jack Irons drums, and Johannes everything else!  Guitar, bass, \\"keys,\\" and production.  In fact it was recorded, mixed and produced by Johannes.  Several guest musicians make appearances, including notably Josh Homme on guitar on \\"Riot In My House,\\" lending it an unmistakable QOTSA sound.  Overall, the elements come not only from the '90s, but much from the more electronic sounding '80s, which works tremendously well, all with a bluesy ambience.<br /><br />Of course Lanegan's great voice holds it all together.  He sounds smoother than he has in the past, with a great tone -- some may miss a more ravaged, Tom Waits-type rasp, but I think the vocals perfectly suit the music.<br /><br />The dark vision is not everybody's thing.  But it is mine.  There is a recognition of darkness, of pain, of evil, that is faced head on.  For some reason it just feels right to me, I don't find it depressing, but rather somehow calming, as if a deep truth is being recognized and the third eye is opening...<br /><br />(verified purchase from Decatur CD)

His backing back smokes!!<br /><br />Don't take advantage of me has cool teases of Sunshine of Your Love and a Stones hit! Most of the tunes are from Live 97 and his recent CDs, plus several of his standards like All Over Now, Johnny B. Goode and Highway 61.<br /><br />I saw him in 1999 and thought he could not survive and tour another year, he looked that bad. I really have to hand it to his new management and band (and wife) who have kept him going and allowed him to thrive in the 21st century. It's minor miracle if you ask me.

B000ZM1MG4|5.0|We worked our way through all 100 movies of the AFI top 100. Even though Tootsie is #62 on the list, somewhere in the middle, we ended up watching it at the tail end of the process. As part of our AFI watching, for fun we were evaluating each movie on the Bechdel test. The Bechdel test is extremely simple - it really is just trying to see if a movie has two named females who ever talk with each other about something other than a male. The vast majority of AFI movies failed this test. Heck, many of them didn't even have two females with names in them.<br /><br />So I was fascinated to see how Tootsie would do, and of course to watch the movie. I've seen Tootsie several times in the past, but we were watching them fresh so we could see them all in a row and examine how they compared.<br /><br />The story here of course is one of gender reversals. Hoffman is a brilliant but tempermental actor that nobody will work with any more. He suddenly gets the idea to disguise himself as a woman so he can get work. I wish they went more into that process. In the movie, he pretty much talks to his agent (an equally brilliant Pollack), is told there's no work, and POOF the next morning he decides to be a middle-aged woman. I would have liked at least a little more insight into the progression there. But in any case, of course, the usual shenanigans erupt with women thinking he's got a strange woman going into his apartment, men being attracted to his \\"female self\\", and so on.<br /><br />The acting is brilliant here from all sides. Whether it's Murray, Lange, Garr, Coleman, Durning, Hoffman, they all are spot-on with their emotions and relationships. The dialogue is great as well. It's a joy to watch. I was laughing out loud all through it, even though I knew the story and lines.<br /><br />But what had me laughing even more was the fact that I kept thinking it was passing the Bechdel test in amazing, flying colors - because I kept getting sucked in and viewing Tootsie as a female! Up until now, pretty much every single AFI movie completely lacked female-female dialogue. Even classic strong-female movies like Annie Hall barely passed - the only time a female talked with another female was in a montage scene where one mom makes a comment and another mom makes a responding comment. It is staggering how rare a female-to-female talk is. So I kept being joyfully staggered at how women were actually TALKING in this movie - only to realize with amusement that it was actually a male-female discussion! That's the only reason it was being shown. A man was involved :).<br /><br />Still, it's hard to fault Tootsie for something that pretty much every single AFI movie has challenges with. It is sad, through, that with two spectacular actresses in it - Lange and Garr - it could still not manage to have the two have even one talk together. A movie about gender roles and how women aren't appreciated still managed not to appreciate women fully.<br /><br />So that is definitely something to ponder. But in the meantime, the movie is quite funny, very engaging, and it lifts my spirits to watch it. Well recommended.Up until now, pretty much every single AFI movie completely lacked female-female dialogue.

B000W74EQC|4.0|The Harry Potter franchise recently ended after the seven books were transformed into eight movies. Sorcerer's Stone (also known as Philosopher's Stone) was the first entry. It did well at the box office, grossing $975 million worldwide, and was the most successful entry until the final installment in the series beat it in 2011. The eight films grossed $7.7 billion worldwide, so they are enormously popular.<br /><br />Due to the popularity of the franchise, I'm going to assume that you have read J. K. Rowling's books, seen the movies, or both, so this review will contain spoilers. If you have never entered the world of Harry Potter, stop reading now.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone was directed by Chris Columbus, who was responsible for Mrs. Doubtfire and the first two Home Alone movies. The tone of this first Harry Potter movie is quite similar to those three, relying on whimsy and comedy rather than drama. That matches the tone of the book, so it is not a criticism. If you had read the first book, like me, you were probably looking forward to seeing the world of Harry Potter portrayed on the big screen. The adapted screenplay by Steve Kloves didn't disappoint.<br /><br />There's a lot to like about Sorcerer's Stone; the sets are vast, the important story elements are present, and the majority of the young actors do a good job. It's a tricky business casting children who have to develop over the course of a decade, but I don't find myself disliking any of the choices. It's great to see Hogwarts, the Hogwarts Express, Gringotts, Diagon Alley, and Quidditch brought to life.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone starts slowly and might seem overly long, but it's necessary to introduce the characters and the worlds they inhabit. I could imagine some people viewing this first installment and giving up on the franchise, but that would be a mistake. This is a vast story which starts off as a charming fantasy before quickly becoming much darker in tone. In a way, it mirrors childhood. We are initially fascinated with the world until we mature and realize that it does have plenty of problems. As the series progresses, the films grow more serious as the threat of evil increases.<br /><br />Some of the best moments include Harry first learning about the existence of Hogwarts, his initial flying lesson, and seeing the teachers demonstrate some of the spells that the children will learn. The main characters are fully realized and know a lot about them by the end of the movie.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone is a good blend of fantasy and action, with the final part of the film containing the most dramatic sequences as our three heroes try to recover the Philosopher's Stone. The music used in the movie is excellent, and the main theme itself suggests a magical setting. There are a lot of important themes in the series and I think it's generally a good example for children. The importance of friendship is one of the major messages and it all begins with the relationships between Harry, Ron and Hermione.<br /><br />The Harry Potter franchise isn't just for children. I'm 50 and I have worked my way through the books and the eight movies several times. The adults in the story are played by some of the finest British character actors. Can you imagine anyone other than Alan Rickman as Snape? Dumbledore was played by Richard Harris in this movie and the sequel, and I think I prefer his version to Michael Gambon's portrayal, although Gambon's version did work for the more serious tone present in the other movies.<br /><br />There's a whole generation of people who grew up loving Star Wars, but here's a franchise for the next generation. Sorcerer's Stone is funny and lighthearted compared to later entries in the franchise, but don't let that deter you from watching all eight movies. The adequate acting improves considerably as the children age throughout the series.mirrors childhood.

B004UID2LC|5.0|One of my most used apps. Don't have an ipod so I use this. It works great and can hold lots of songs. The only bad part about it is that it seems to take up a lot of memory. Love this app
B007L3BMGA|4.0|We've all heard the hype with the 50 shades series... So I had to buy the books to see what it was all about.<br /><br />While the writing is not going to win any awards, its a new way of thinking and is deemed socially acceptable to read for women!<br /><br />I would recommend this book so your up to date with the worldwide hype :-)
B0083GCK5G|5.0|This album artfully provokes a mood, which is a gift wielded by my most favorite bands and musicians. I imagine the mood is one which most listeners are hoping for from the Beach Boys: that of sublime, carefree, happy, summer days.  Add an oceanfront convertible ride, a warm breeze in your hair and a brooding sunset bonfire for good measure.<br /><br />My first record was Endless Summer.  Technically my parents', I high-jacked it to my bedroom and it never left.  I was hypnotized by lush harmonies and dreamy falsettos - not to mention endlessly fascinated by the album's trippy gatefold!  The music transported me out of my tiny, crowded room and launched my imagination onto a nameless beach at sunset, where I could watch the waves shimmer and the tides oscillate between both melancholy and joyful.  It was - and is -  escapism at its musical best.<br /><br />\\"That's Why God Made the Radio\\" does not disappoint.  As I sit in my office cubicle, surrounded by stacks of meeting minutes and listening to the album on headphones, I get goosebumps upon hearing the opening notes of \\"Think About the Days\\".  It's effortless to plug into the songs' energies and the aforementioned mood carries me away.  By \\"Summer's Gone\\" I feel calmed, soothed and at peace.  Although perhaps itching that much more for a vacation.<br /><br />My fears that this album would be full of affected songs which try too hard to achieve a certain sound were not realized. On the contrary, the Beach Boys seem to capture everything we love about their music most effortlessly. I would venture that the songs communicate the joy that they experience when making music together.  It is hard to not fall in love with such pure and unadulterated, musical bliss.  I'm grateful for this album and recommend it to everyone who would like to treat themselves to a beach day mentally, if not physically.
B003MC5N28|5.0|This books starts out in a setting that appears to be fairly communist society.  In other words, what one chooses to do with their life is mapped out for them by the \\"Chief Elders.\\" (Our government/lawmakers).Training starts at the year of 12.  Each ceremony to the age of twelve is fairly unique.  However, after years of careful examination-through each youth's volunteer work, community affairs, and schooling, the Chief Elders can decide the suitable role deemed fit for the individual \\"12\\".<br /><br />This is rather a dystopian society.  Family units apply for children. There is no color or emotion.  However, there is the Reciever of Memory who is an exception to the rules.  They appointed a new Reciever of Memory-Jonas.  He sees color, expresses love, and various other emotions. The Giver (the current receiver) through touch gives Jonas his memories, and some are painful.  One of those memories, that is not given to Jonas, is one that he sees his father perform.  His father's role in the community is \\"Nurturer.\\" they take care of the \\"new child\\" (infants). In a video, that Jonas is allowed to watch with the Giver, he sees his father \\"release\\" (put to death) a twin infant because he is the lesser of the weight of the two. However, the community, aside from Jonas and the receiver are ignorant of any feelings, and know nothing of what they are doing as harm, but just doing as instructed.<br /><br />Together, the Giver, and Jonas devise a plan, that will help to shed a little light on the community of their ignorance, by releasing the years worth of memories Jonas has received from the Giver back onto the community.  However, to do that, he must escape the communities borders, and travel to \\"Elsewhere\\" outside the community limits.  Instead of merely Jonas going though, he had to carry extra weight when he learned that his father was going to hand over a one year old restless child back over to the nurturing center to be released. After a year, the nurturing center deemed the new child unfit for a family unit, hence the reason for their decision.<br /><br />This obstacle of carrying a toddler along for his journey makes for an adventure.  I read this material because it is one of my 12 year olds summer reads, and I enjoyed it.  Read it to see how Jonas and the new child, Gabriel make out in the end.  Good Read.med the new child unfit for a family unit, hence the reason for their decision.<br /><br />This obstacle of carrying a toddler along for his journey makes for an adventure.

1400069289|1.0|Only the first 2-3 chapters are good.  The rest is just boring and repetitive.  It was a piece of shit, I dont recommend it to anyone.  You have to pay me to read the rest.

B0086700CM|3.0|game started lagging the more I played it.  it is fun though..managed to make it to 1% on the all time leaderboard with 4,000,000 plus points and realized the top guy had over 1 billion points.  sounds like people cheat in this game.  not fun chasing cheaters.  should fix the cheating if that's the case
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is sooooo much fun and so addicting and I love the challenge it never lags and down loaded perfect I have nothing bad to say about this and it works great on kindel fire(:
0385341008|5.0|This is a fictional book based on a situation in WWII.  The characters are very real & it is easy to forget that they are fictional. (Others made that comment, too.)<br /><br />The entire book is made up of letters of the characters corresponding to others about events in their lives.  I had trouble putting this book down & finished it quickly.<br /><br />:)  A movie based on the novel is scheduled for 2013.
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is very similar to 50 Shades of Gray! Different people, different scenario, but the same concept. It was a good read-I def couldn't put it down! I recommend it to anyone that has read the 50 series!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app kept 3 teenagers occupied for a 6 hour trip, and they still haven't finished all the games. So, I hope it will do the same for the 22 hour return trip!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|A really good game and a great buy. I love the challenge, its additive. I highly recommend this game. You'll love it!
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Excellent product.  Works very well and is easy to use.<br />Very easy to install and works seamlessly<br />Very pleased with this
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run can get really addicting and it has great graphics. :) The picture is so clear and I can play anywhere..uh. Except for walking my dog because I sort of ran into a parked truck :) Be careful! lol
B0071XO8RA|5.0|In less time than it will take to watch the inevitable version on the big screen, you can read \\"Wool,\\" the iconic post-apocalyptic stunner that captures the bleakness and despair of McCarthy's \\"The Road\\" in a brutally quick stun gun shot to the gut.  From the first startling sentence to the final revelation.  Technology, deception, treachery?  This is lean, sparse, unadorned and unapologetic, yet as poignant is it is obtuse: a beautifully crafted image of a tenacious human species clinging to not only life, but dignity - and insatiable curiosity - in a world that may just be trapped between one of two opposing tyrannies.  It's science fiction, sure, but rising way above that, \\"Wool\\" celebrates all of those human characteristics for which we'd like to be self-congratulatory.<br /><br />Yeah, stories of the end of mankind is a tired meme - been done too many times and too many times poorly.  Hugh Howey sets a new standard; raises the bar with a new level of efficiency and impact.  To say more would only detract from the fun - and the awe.  Don't be left out at the water cooler - read it now.  You've got the time.
0446693804|5.0|What a sweet story. I don't usually get that emotional with most books, but this one got me at the end. This is the type of book that lasts after you have finished reading.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Greatest Hits I, II and III The Platinum collection is awesome<br />I love Queen band and his singer Freddy Mercury RIP. They leave<br />a legacy of songs for life. Awesome group.

0385738773|5.0|This book, I had been wanting to read ever since it came out but I just didn't want to see this series end. Seeing where Wicked will take these kids next. Will they survive, or will this last book end their story.<br /><br />The plot is one of the main things that I love most about this story. I find it fast moving, and it has me never wanting to put down the book for one second. With all the twists and turns this book has and finding out what will happen to Thomas and his fellow friend has me on my toes till the very end.<br /><br />Cranks! These things literally give me nightmares. I remember after the second book, how I was having troubles sleeping and now after reading this book, I might need to sleep with a night light. (Scardey Cat! I know) This book did have something that made me gasp really loud and almost made me put it down to think about what happened. I wasn't expecting this.<br /><br />This book is filled with action, adventure, betrayal, the will to survive, and an ending that isn't happy nor sad. So make sure you check out this book and give it a try.<br /><br />I give this book 5 souls!

B00884GR0W|5.0|Everything on Block Story and Block Story Lite are sooo close to minecraft! One day my friend was on minecraft and he was building a really cool bridge. At the end, he made a pool that on one side was deep and the other was shallow. Then I did the same thing on Block Story!! But I know the other minecraft fans who have kindles and I are waiting until the get it **hint**  **hint**
B00785P2QC|5.0|awsomest game ever at first I thought it would be like yew this game sucks but it dosent I love it
1469984202|4.0|I had an interesting experience reading all 5 Wool books.  At first, I was wondering what the hell am I reading?  It started out kind of strange, I didn't really understand the environment nor the characters.  Fast forward a 100 pages or so, and I was 100% sucked in, hook, line, and sinker.  Once I understood the environment and characters a bit, I was very pleasantly surprised and couldn't put the book down.<br /><br />I must say this has been one of the best science fiction series I have read in a LONG time.  Very original with interesting characters.  I absolutely fell in love with Juliette:  Her \\"can do\\" attitude, her frailty and compassion--awesome.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this series.<br /><br />Keep up the good work Hugh!<br /><br />P.S.  Solo, aka Jimmy--My second favorite character!  You nailed trapping a 16 year old into a much older man's body and mind.
0061122416|2.0|The Alchemist has all ready been written. It is very similar to Candide which I feel is a much better book/story.

030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl has twists and turns which keep the reader intrigued. The author creatively alternates the chapters between the husband and wife. The plot was well thought out but I can't say that I loved the book. Definitely didn't love the ending. Perhaps it wasn't my style...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Love it because there are a variety of games and the farther you get along the harder the games get
B007NR9WBG|3.0|I remember seeing this movie in the theatre and I loved the first three quarters of the movie.  Towards the end it became embarrassingly slapstick as if someone else directed it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun! I love all the Ice Age movies so I think its great it is based off them. It can be a tad glitchy sometimes but overall a great game! :)
B008MEM24S|3.0|I dislike this app. it is pretty much the same as where's my water except instead of fires to boil water it is lasers. no real change in the game. I would not advise getting this.
B005K17RU0|5.0|better than most weather apps ive had. it tells you when you have any kind of advisory.  its an awesome app. would recommend to anyone!
B001S86J0I|5.0|Greatest Sci-Fi humor movie EVER!! DVD is great. I never get tired of this classic comedy. They did everything right.
140053271X|3.0|This a second generation e-reader. By adding a 16 GB micro SD card, it can store more e-books than I'll ever own. Most of my books are in PDF format. It has trouble displaying charts or images and fails totally to display an e-book in PDF form that I bought from Forbes.com. All these books display properly in PDF readers available on personal computers.<br /><br />It's other weakness is that it has minimal documentation. The topics are covered but the explanaitons leave the user with a lot of questions.
B001QWBM62|1.0|the recorder did not work out of the box, either by battery or by AC adaptor. unit returned for full credit after it was \\"lost\\" for several weeks at the receiving end. Not a good experience.
B005LAIGF0|5.0|I'm very happy that all the legal wrangling finally resolved, and that I got to see this.  I've always considered film to be a branch of literature that is not always looked upon with the same critical eye we are so used to with books.  For me, this film kicks it way up several notches in story, characters, actors, and filmography.<br /><br />I found this film an amazing experience.  Just for starters, to me, Kenneth Lonergan eye seems like my own--he shows us Manhattan on camera the way I see Manhattan as I walk about. I wonder if this is true for others.  I found this camera work so accessible, and made me feel like I feel when I'm there going about my day.  This may sound bland, but, it was remarkable that it felt like me being there taking in the city on any given day.<br /><br />The story then vividly portrays the chaos and angst of adolescence, family life, sex, relationships, tragedy, parenting, and the inevitable confrontation of the world as it works and human idealism.<br /><br />The cast was impeccable, Anna Paquin showed us  a phenomenal display of craft, as did the rest.<br /><br />I hope this film get's the recognition it deserves.<br /><br />Thank you to Kenneth Lonergan for giving this gift.  Remarkable!--Thank you!
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Kindly allow me to preface this review by saying that I literally \\"grew up\\" reading science fiction, reading hundreds of novels, from the best there was \\"way back when\\" to anything I could find on the bookshelves \\"way back then\\".  I think sci-fi is a part of my \\"DNA\\" to use an overused saying.  So, I was excited to see all the great reviews for Wool - Omnibus Edition by Hugh Howey; and my initial journey into the Wool series was satisfying, and I liked how the author built the characters and the scenes in the beginning of the Wool series.  I was also happy to see a new potential for my newly purchased Kindle (which I love).  Unfortunately, I was completely bored by the time the author took us to the war/uprising in Silo 18.<br /><br />For me, science fiction should at least have some (small) depth of science in it; but sadly all the science in Wool - Omnibus Edition by Hugh Howey can be summarized by using the words or phrases \\"IT\\", \\"servers\\", \\"pixels\\" and \\"toxins\\".  There was no scientific depth (of any kind) in the novel.  Admittedly, I did read some reviews where a number of readers praised this type of \\"shallow science fiction\\" (for a lack of a better paraphrase) as a kind of \\"science fiction without the annoying details of science\\"; Wool is certainly that, and I'm sorry to point this out to Hugh Howey, who has done well on Amazon as these novels have gone viral it seems (congrats!).  I'm happy for you Hugh; but frankly, your series was just about at the bottom of science fiction novels that I have read, and I've read some bad ones in my life.  However, I did rate it \\"Three Stars\\" because I like where Mr. Howey was trying to go with the novel; he just could not articulate the experience, depth and richness a scifi story likes \\"the Silo series\\" deserves.<br /><br />By the time we get to the uprising in Silo 18, the dialog between the characters have gone (far) downhill, and I kept reading, faster and faster, not because the novel is such a \\"page turner\\" but because I could not wait to get out of the boring dialogs and situations that did not really fit the overarching theme the author was trying or hoping (but unable) to convey.  I am a huge fan of dystopian fiction, and I have read just about every top scifi thriller about future worlds full of doom and gloom, and where a hero (or anti-hero) rises up against all odds to save (or not to save) the world, so to speak.  These are novels rich in character development and, at the same time, deep in science and ideas about humanity.  The Wool - Omnibus Edition by Hugh Howey had the potential to be that kind of novel; but it just \\"died\\" (for me) about halfway through the series and just went down, down, down from there, and never recovered.<br /><br />I also purchased First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) by Hugh Howey after reading the first two books of the series, read Part 6 immediately after Part 5, and although this is not a review of First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series), I can tell you that the downward spiral of poor dialogs in out-of-character situations continue and First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) by Hugh Howey is even less satisfying than Wool - Omnibus Edition.  I'll review that novel separately, but it is important to get some context going before closing this review.  For example, one reviewer mentions that the mystery in the Wool - Omnibus Edition of why there are no lifts (elevators) in the Silo 17 and 18 (and perhaps others not yet explored) is addressed in First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series); and indeed it is, and the explanation is very disappointing and unsatisfying - in fact, it is a bit of an insult to the genre of science fiction, in my opinion.<br /><br />This review is written, realizing that it goes against the wave of viral support for this novel for Kindle readers (I am sorry if I've upset a few fans of the series); and I do realize there is a lot of love for this book and heaps of praise for Hugh Howey as an \\"indie\\" author.  Personally, I respect Hugh Howey for writing the series, and I did read all 6 books so far, but I am honest to admit, as a long time student of hundreds of science fiction novels, that this Silo series ranks (just about) at the bottom third of my list, and is just about as poorly written as scifi goes.  The novel had potential, but that potential was lost.  More on this in my review of First Shift - Legacy (Part 6 of the Silo Series) by Hugh Howey, where the dialog, characters, science and fiction all just fall apart; and I was racing to get finished to escape such poorly written dialogs and out-of-character situations.  What a shame, because the ideas behind the Silo series, if written with more depth and in the tradition of the richness of classic science fiction, deserve much better.ey as an \\"indie\\" author.

0307887960|4.0|It has all the tips and good recipes to follow the diet.  The Diet is good and easy to follow because is like the Atkins diet but better.
0547569653|5.0|I loved Scott's book. I read it in 3 days, couldn't put it down. I loved his generous spirit, revealing his tough childhood, his triumphs and challenges as an ultrarunning legend, his beloved recipes, his joys and disappointments in personal relationships. He taught me the real meaninhg of \\"endurance\\", just when I thought I was doing my best. Now I know I can do more. Above all, I loved him for always seeking beauty, oneness and transcendence.<br />His recipe, Tamari-Lime Tempe and Brown Rice is delicious! The Red  Curry Almond Sauce was a revelation. While I was preparing it I couldn't understand how blending all the strange (to me, anyway), ingredients could make something edible. But it turned out to be delicious.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King was my favorite Disney movie since age 5. All the other movies in the Lion King series are pale in comparison. The visual enhancements make the colors far richer than my old VHS copy could ever dream to be.
B00633W614|5.0|This book was very readable from the first page.  Had trouble putting it down.  Only wish I had known that it was the second book in the series, the first being \\"Only Time will Tell\\".  Both an excellent read.  Can't wait for the next three.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|The mic works ok but the feel and the fit and finish is very poor. I am rating it so low because the batter doesn't last very long and audio quality is sub par.
0345803485|5.0|Best book ever. Sorry to all the haters out there but ya'll really need to realize this is a STORY! It Isn't reality and correct me if im wrong but i think she makes that clear in the begining of her book. I mean most of ya'll believe in REALITY Tv, and thats a bunch of bullshit, yet ya still be all over it. Now to talk about this book, humm i personally loved it. It's entertaining and it was a great source to just pass the time. It has a lot of suspence and OMG don't even get me started on Christian Grey! Def, a must read for all those who have immagination. If you don't believe me then u might believe \\"Ryan Secrest\\". That's right! Ryan Secrest. Thats the way i found out about this book, He talks about it ALMOST every morning on his radio show.
0316019984|5.0|Four year old loved this book. So amazing. Supplier very fast.I would order again from this vendor. Book is great and so fun to share with my grandson. Would make great Christmas gifts for all your people.
034580404X|5.0|I will admit at first I was not going to join the fad and read this trio of books. And now as I am finishing the 3rd I am glad I did.<br />Indeed it includes a lot of sexual acts and such but the love the characters have for each other is something we all should strive for.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like this game a lot! It is so much fun and so addicting. I recommend to anyone. Be careful because it's very addicting
B000VKW7AK|5.0|I was hesitant about ordering this box set because I own the entire Megadeth catalog already. However, there were several songs that didn't appear on any of their studio albums on here. Plus some demo versions of songs as well. The first 3 discs are a pretty good collection of material from their first 10 albums(1985-2004, and a few live versions of songs rather than studio versions which I really liked being that I own all the studio albums, and gave me more reason to buy it.<br /><br />The best reason to get this box set even if you already own every album Megadeth has made is for the last 2 discs. Disc 4 is a live concert from 1990 in Wembley stadium during the RUST IN PEACE era. The performances are incredible, and the quality is great! Disc 5 is a DVD containg a 10 song live performance from England during the COUNTDOWN TO EXTINCTION era. Once again, amazing performances on every song!<br /><br />If your new to Megadeth, this is great. The only down side for someone new to Megadeth may be the demo versions which are definately not as good as the studio versions of a few songs on here. However, there aren't many. Even if you already own all or many of Megadeth's albums, this is still very much worth getting for the live stuff alone!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|really great game gets real hard real fast though. a lot of unlockable warriors that fight alongside you and powers to use.
B008ASLNN2|2.0|I went in with high expectations for this movie because I really liked the first one.  The movie had some of the same elements that made the first one so good, but it seemed to drag on longer than it should have been.  Towards the end I couldn't wait for it to be over.  I'm sure that others will rave about it but it wasn't for me.  I will go into any future movies with more caution.
B0086700CM|5.0|thats wonderful but I think you should create a new tempels also.. you can change the rule like we hit level and you can great a map to find golds demionds so on..
0307388921|5.0|This is my favorite C. Palahniuk book. The characters are dysfunctional (like most/ all of his characters) and the story-line is awesome and original. I read this book a few years back and remember finishing it in just a few short sittings. I HIGHLY recommend this book.
B008KRJWEK|4.0|pretty. cool game. controls similar to temple run.  it's. fun and burns up your wasted time.  can't. beat it for free.
B0000026DJ|4.0|This is MUCH better than the previous two Midnight Oil albums!  Still no comparison whatsoever between this and Midnight Oil's debut and Head Injuries though- these two albums are perfection.  Diesel & Dust comes in third, however.  A distant third perhaps, but third regardless.<br /><br />How can you possibly hate \\"Beds Are Burning?\\"  I mean this song just has one of the greatest choruses of the 80's!  I even feel a ton of emotion in the lead singers voice which was severely lacking on the previous two Midnight Oil albums, and the verse melody builds wonderfully into the chorus with such ease.  \\"The time has come, to say fair's fair, to pay our rent, to pay our share\\".  I love it!  \\"Put Down That Weapon\\" is another wonderful tune, even though it takes a dangerous route by being a mid-tempo track from the mid 80's.  That right there sends up a caution flag that it has the potential to stink up the place.  However, it's great so no worries!  \\"It happens to be, an emergency, some things aren't meant to be, some things don't come for free\\" is a really memorable line.  It's the kind of singing and melodic intentions I so desperately wanted since Head Injuries.  \\"Dreamworld\\" has a decent chorus and relatively upbeat chorus (but doesn't really *rock*- or if it does, it goes undetected by my ears).<br /><br />\\"Arctic World\\" has a pretty bland verse melody and is a mediocre ballad overall, but I guess by this point I'm somewhat able to forgive a few occasional bland moments since these guys just haven't been solid songwriters since Head Injuries anyway.  Those days are gone and I accept that.  BAD lyrics too- \\"I don't want to breathe that Smithsonian air\\".  Ugh!  You know after hearing \\"Warakurna\\" I'm beginning to think this is some kind of religious rock album because just about ALL these songs share a similar theme that's common among religious music- mid-tempo \\"rock\\" guitar playing, a subtle touch of spirituality in the vocal melodies but nothing that veers in a particularly outrageous direction, and melodic just enough to get the job done.  Still a major improvement compared to whatever Red Sails In the Sunset provided at least.<br /><br />\\"The Dead Heart\\" has a nice set of vocals, but the focus here is clearly on the lyrics and the problems, promises and power of the white man pertaining to nationality.  The chorus is really good with some emotion as well \\"We carry in our hearts the true country and that cannot be stolen\\" and I find the \\"do do do do do do do\\" background vocals appealing.  \\"Whoah\\" has a decent, easy to remember verse melody and the lead singer reveals a strong spiritual connection to God.  \\"Bullroarer\\" is more of the same, and surely nothing that blows me away.  The drums were probably considered quite impressive and radically different back in the 80's but nowadays this sound doesn't really appeal to me so much.  The vocals speed along respectably but it's nothing truly fantastic.<br /><br />\\"Sell My Soul\\" (no, not mine.  It's valuable!  Let's sell yours!)  Alright I guess this confirms what I spectulated above- this *is* a religious album.  Not in the true sense, but an attempt to appeal to both the religious and non-religious alike.  Hey it works- I'm converted!  I can't help but feel that this melody is slightly tacky and uninspiring.  It loses its impact as it goes on, but it's short overall so I guess I don't really care that much.  \\"Sometimes\\" confirms that I'm glad this album has reached the end because I can't really handle a whole lot of this lead singer anymore.  He has a slight Billy Corgan whine to his voice and well, I can't tolerate a whole lot of that voice box to be honest.  The chorus is catchy enough, but sort of generic and Poison-like.<br /><br />Still, let's end this review on a happy note!  I like Diesel & Dust.  It's probably not really a 4-star album since, again, the first two Midnight Oil albums scream masterpiece, blow me away and leave me speechless.  Yeah, the highest compliment you can possibly give, I'm giving it to those first two albums!  This album just can't compare to *that* level of brilliance.  For what Diesel & Dust is however, a fairly melodic and somewhat return to form in terms of catchy vocals, I admire it.
1936719010|5.0|Steven Pressfield has once again gotten under my skin ... after he crawled through my brain!  A few years ago I read The War of Art by Mr. Pressfield where he defined the 'It' that stands in the way of an artist's actually employing their creative self to do what they were meant to do.  That \\"It\\" was, and continues to be, Resistance.  While I've not been totally successful at removing Resistance's constant presence (and apparently never will be), Doing The Work informs me that by putting pen to paper, whether it be good or bad work, I am keeping Resistance at bay. While material success may not come quickly or at all, the act of doing the work moves me toward other valuable successes that I couldn't achieve by allowing Resistance to keep me down at heel.  A gifted writer, Mr. Pressfield brings his insight and experience to the reader/artist and delivers a swift kick to move them along their creative path.  A great book.  I highly recommend it.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I grew up reading Conan Doyles sometimes brief to the point adventures of his detective with relish.  I have collected nearly all of the stories.  Downey and Law are a good pairing and play well off of each other.  One more brilliantly eccentric who guides his more grounded partner in and out of danger.
B003Y5H54W|5.0|It was a great movie with a nice twist on the story.  As someone who loves fairy tales even as an adult this was a good find.  It was thrilling and suspenseful and worth the money.  The movie is a bit of a mystery where the audience spends the whole time trying to figure out who the wolf is and the answer surprised me.  There was some action and romance, and it was an all around good movie.
0307341577|2.0|I should begin by saying that this is not my genre of choice...but I just finished \\"Gone Girl\\" and found it so entertaining in a summer read sort of way, that I was really anxious to read one of her previous books.<br /><br />Very disappointing...Gillian Flynn is a good writer. She created an extremely compelling family at the center of her story. Her original characters are well drawn and multi layered. But then she slips in to attempting to shock and nauseate her reader on every page. Why do authors do this? I quickly lost interest after becoming very interested in the Day family's plight and back story. My mistake, I was looking for literary fiction and this is a crime novel, of which you might find on a dusty shelf at Walgreens.<br /><br />If you enjoyed \\"Gone Girl\\", like I did, just stop there and do not make the mistake of thinking that it was perhaps more than a fluke success.
B0088WFZQG|3.0|The concept for the film was based in realism, yet the director seemed it needed more than a dash of Hollywood schtick in order to sell the story successfully; I disagree. The film was technically well made and it was very interesting to see a new perspective on how the SEAL teams communicate and depend on one another, but I think the effect would have been much more powerful had the tone of the film stayed within a documentary or ultra-realistic style. When the characters stopped and tried to act like \\"actors\\" and not just like themselves, it really shocked me out of the environment I am sure the director intended for the audience. There are moments, especially during the action portions of the film, where I can really sense what the director wanted and it works really well, but then we cut to an unneeded dramatic scene in order to up the tension and life doesn't happen that way. The real SEAL team members don't get to peak into the motivations of their targets the way the audience gets to, I felt I was cheating in places. I wanted to see ONLY what the SEAL team members would have, somewhat like Paranormal activity was filmed. Perhaps it was my own fault for expecting too much or expecting what I would have done with the film instead, but that's that.<br /><br />While I disagree with most of the dramatic choices the director made in an effort to sell the film to audiences, I appreciate the chance that was taken on this film, though overall poorly executed in my opinion. All in all, a fine action film with wooden \\"dramatic\\" performances interspersed throughout the picture in order to add depth to something most of the ticket paying audience was already bought into.<br /><br />You want to see ultra-realism and war's effect on relationships in combat, go watch Restrepo.

0698116496|5.0|My 15 month old daughter is very active, so it is kind of hard to keep her sitting while you read her anything longer than a sentence.  She enjoys books where she can quickly grasp a story, physically turn the page, and something with lots of animals (but not too many on each page, it shouldn't be cluttered).  She loves this book!  Each page has 1 or no sentence; lots of action on every page (she especially loves the one where the lights are off); its funny, even for her!; and easy to understand. Very cute animals, not too much going on on every page, but very colorful.  We just love it!  This is by far our favorite book in the house.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I like it because I can play a lot of people all the time just how I like it too!
B0000DJZA0|3.0|OK, I like ColdPlay. I thought this \\"Live\\" CD and DVD combination would be worth listening to, and it is. One of the things I like about CP is the high quality of their recordings. This one just doesn't measure up to that, and the songs are performed very much like the studio versions. Not much variety here.
B00005B4GT|5.0|I purchased this album on vinyl about a month ago because A)I liked Kid A and B)I didn't have any 10-inch albums in collection. The sound quality is absolutley outstanding. Considering the content, it's the best follow-up album since Wish<br />You Were Here. Highly recommended
0345803485|1.0|This has to be one of the trashiest books I have ever read.  It is definitely categorized as \\"PORN\\" and should be listed as such.  I can't believe this series of books is advertised so highly.  I am an avid reader, but I definitely will research more when I am ready to buy a new book.

B007RXRSEY|4.0|Their are several excellent songs on this album! Myles Kennedy is coming into his own as a vocalist and Slash is still an awesome guitar player. He is experimental enough that you don't feel he is afraid of playing something new or different and yet at the same time he keeps the riffs flowing throughout the album! For me Your a Lie and Bad Rain are highlights but there are several others that rock and very few that do not! A very succesful effort that brings Slash out of the immense shadow of GnR!!
B008K8U13K|5.0|Havent bought this for the kindle fire yet but i have it for PC &amp; it is fun as hell! Wish they had sonic generation for the kindle fire! Sega has made me a happy customer, so far they haven't let me down.
B0071T5PN0|2.0|Edwards playing is excellent but it seems he is disconnected from the band. It is as if he layed down tracks seperate from the rest of the band! Alex's playing seems restrained and controled but he does have some moments. Dave simply is not singing RnR he is tring to be too cool and fit in. As though he is still unsure of his place and walking on eggshells! I expected a much better output from VH considering the amount of time they were rumored to be working on the album!

B0071R43MG|5.0|In terms of video quality, this is by far the best of all the concert videos that I've seen of Joe Satriani.  In terms of the choice of songs that he played, I prefer the San Francisco video slightly better.  If you are a diehard Satriani fan, this video is a must have.  I believe it to be the first Bluray in his entire collection of live videos.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|challenging game that keeps you involved.  the levels become progressively difficult and its hard to put the game down. enjoy the graphics and trying to beat the game. really do love it.

B005HSL626|4.0|this game is great. better than the paid version and actually less permissions! great graphics on my kindle fire. there is plenty of acheivements to unlock and cool blades. the problem with it is that it has openfeint. it doesn't try to connect you to it when you open the app, but the Icon is there.if the developers got rid of openfeint then I would give this game a definite 5 star.
0345525558|4.0|This book was suggested reading for our Book Club.  Found the book to be great and would recommend the book to others.  A good quick read as you can't put it down.
159102594X|4.0|Not as good as \\"Best Served Cold,\\" but still a good read (if possible, I would have rated it 3.5 stars).  It's obvious that Abercrombie really refined his writing as time went on since this is his first published novel and \\"Cold\\" was his fourth.  As with \\"Cold,\\" this is a very dark, violent tale, but one that is engrossing and fascinating.  However, it would have benefited by being pared down since there was too much that was unimportant and that made the story drag.  Also, Abercrombie sure loves the word \\"flounder\\"!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I really enjoy reading with this app each morning.  Most of the time it tracks my place well.  Occasionally it seems to back me up to the previous day.  Enjoy different plans to read through. Catch up if you get behind.
0345803485|5.0|These books are great, I am not a reader, never have been but when I heard all the hype of these books I had to see for myself. I order the who trilogy. Once again I am NOT a reader. I had all 3 books read in less than 3 weeks. A total amazing thing for me to accomplish. Towards the end of the 3rd book I began to realize I was sad that I knew once I read the last page.. that was it. I went a week with nothing, I felt a bit lost and wanted more. So I was suggested to read Bared to Me. Now I cant wait to for its sequel to be published. I finished it in 3 days. I now am finding myself reading the Anne Rice Sleeping Beauty books, and am waiting for more of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.. Bravo E.L.James for getting me into a book and keeping me interested!!!
B000CNFC76|5.0|This movie is a wonderful Disney production that everyone can watch together. Shia LaBeouf is 20 year old Francis Ouimet of Brookline, MA who is from a poor family and faces prejudice from snobby elitists when he pursues golf. He qualifies for the U.S. Open and takes on the professional players including repeat winner of the British Open, Harry Vardon. The movie focuses on golf, but it is a human interest story as well. Harry Vardon is the son of a poor family from Jersey, England and has experienced his share of elitism too. You will be cheering for both of them by the final day of the golf match. The movie is based on a true story.
030758836X|5.0|Amy Dunne is missing. Her devoted husband is called back to their home, to find the front door open, the remnants of a struggle in their living room and Amy gone. Gone, gone, gone. As concern grows to panic and transforms into suspicion, Nick has to unravel Amy's clues she's left behind. Because as days go by, Nick becomes the prime suspect in the disappearance.    I loved this book. Not since the last Tana French book have I been so taken with a mystery book. Flynn is in superb form. Her writing is easy, effortless, flowing and laying down crumbs of information here and there, leading the reader off on many paths, none of which may be the right path. Nick is self centered, shallow and selfish. But is he really capable of hurting his wife? We learn more about Amy through Amy's diary, her light, smart voice telling us her side of the story. Her side of a very different marriage, a very different Nick.    Through the entire story, I couldn't hold down either of them. I like Nick, I like Amy. I hate Nick, I hate Amy. Their characters are these layered, angry, raging humans, mourning the loss of what they had and who they were. One sentence from Flynn and my view on both of these characters could change dramatically. The darkness, the confusion, the mind games. Who knows you better than your spouse? And what if they could use that against you?    Clever, fast and truly haunting, Gone Girl is a thrilling ride. My first Gillian Flynn book and it certainly won't be my last. I know I'll still be thinking about this story days from now, and perhaps giving my husband a undeserved suspicious glance.    Find more of my reviews on [...]
073935650X|4.0|I normally roll my eyes at teen fiction as the characters are often self-centered and unrealistic.  I found 13 Reasons why, to be a real page turner.  It was not so much as poor Hannah, driven to suicide.  It was the already suicidal girl looking for reasons to quit life and blame it all on circumstances.  She prepares 13 cassette tapes to be distributed to all of the people who she feels did her wrong.  Back your bags for this guilt trip that she shares with most of the people who actually liked her.<br /><br />The story starts with Clay, who had a crush on Hannah, receiving a box of seven cassette tapes and some maps.  He reads the instructions of their use along with directions of who to send the tapes to next.  The story is intriguing from the beginning and I honestly thought that it would be about some heavy duty crime of the past.  Instead, Hannah narrates a series of stories about her life at home and school, where a series of disappointments led her to quit life.  It is a bit irritating the way that she keeps expecting someone to rescue her.  However, the suspense still builds when it seems that one kind act or stroke of justice might just change her mind.<br /><br />I like the way dialogue switches from Clay talking to himself and people around him to Hannah's voice on the tapes.  The way that the story flips back and forth is really effective. It kind of gives the reader their own flashbacks to adolescence.  Brilliant job in the narrations.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|the sounds are very natural and soothing. it's also nice to make a blend of sounds. you create what you want to hear. would have paid for it.but thankful it was free. highly recommend this app.
B004LWZVZM|5.0|Great court-room movies are always about more than just the case.  They are usually an intertwining of multiple stories, all of which affect the case itself.  This can be said of this movie.  The title of the movie refers to Mary Surrat, who was tried and convicted of being part of the conspiracy to kill Abraham Lincoln.  Her case and her defense by Union war hero Frederick Aiken is only one key part of the movie.  Another key part is the internal tension within Mr. Aiken in trying to determine her innocence or guilt, and his conflicts with Mary and her daughter in trying to get them to tell him the truth.  This drama itself rivals that of the courtroom.  Smaller story-lines include the conflicts between Mr. Aiken and his peers, which include his girlfriend, his friends at a local gentleman's club, and the machinations of Secretary of War Edwin Stanton.  The movie is anchored by great acting from numerous roles.  Lifelong comic actor Kevin Kline turns in a good performance as Edwin Stanton.  James McAvoy does a wonderful job playing lawyer Frederick Aiken, a character whose internal turmoil is only surpassed by the conflicts he has with those around him.  Probably the best acting is done by the two actresses; Robin Wright playing the \\"Conspirator\\", and Evan Rachel Wood playing her daughter.  The former sacrifices herself to protect her son, who she knows was intimately involved in a plot to kidnap President Lincoln.  The latter is convinced to turn against her brother to try and save her mother; to no avail.  All told, a great drama set in the aftermath of two of the most important events in US history; the Civil War and the assassination of Abraham Lincoln.
1932100660|1.0|The science used in this book is laughable. Anyone who has studied the sciences can tell you how bad the interpretations of the data are. Giving rats massive doses of isolated nutrients is in no way the same thing as eating real food. Would you extract a single nutrient out of food and inject it into your body everyday for months on end. NO. That is crazy. Dairy might not be the perfect food for everyone but not for the reasons this book has stated. If you look at the real science and anthropology you can see that the healthiest cultures in the world all ate meat, fish, fruit, plants, tubers, coconut, and animal fats. Of course these were the highest quality foods grown organically, and animals ate their natural diet also which made them healthier for us.<br /><br />If you ate beef you would be killing one animal a year with your consumption. If you eat grains and other plant foods you could be indirectly killing many animals who are killed by farmers to keep animals from eating their plants, or those animals can be killed by tractors harvesting enormous fields. Grains are also VERY unsustainable. Grains pull nutrients from the soil but give nothing back. Look at the middle east and the deserts they have from being the first to grow grains in that area.<br /><br />Grass fed cows actually fix carbon by eating the grass. The grass takes carbon dioxide out of the air while growing and turns it into organic matter which is good for the soil.<br /><br />Don't believe everything you hear. Do your own research. What I can tell you is this book is NOT applicable science and is a HUGE WASTE of money.<br /><br />I feel the same way about the \\"forks over knives\\" book as well. It is NOT truthful information.<br /><br />If I had to recommend some books that are ACTUALLY based on science these are what I would recommend:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Starts-With-Food-Unexpected-ebook/dp/B008C20TDG/ref=zg_bs_282861_8<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/Practical-Paleo-Customized-Whole-Foods-Lifestyle/dp/1936608758/ref=zg_bs_282861_6hole-Foods-Lifestyle/dp/1936608758/ref=zg_bs_282861_6
0439023513|1.0|Mockingjay - Hunger Games - Catching Fire - are a reflection of the superficial, trite media garbage that we ingest on a daily basis through TV, Internet, video games, etc.  Children killing children!  And, then we wonder and shake our heads over such senseless killings like Columbine or the Aurora Colorado Theater shooting.  Isn't it time America, that we stand up against such evil, turn off our TV's, stop buying into Hollywood gossip and trash and return to family values where the most important lessons are learned from loving parents, time spent laughing around the dinner table and family prayer?
B007RXRSEY|5.0|First, I am NOT a G'NR fan.  Sure, \\"Paradise City\\" and \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" are good songs but I just don't like their other stuff.  I think Axl is a d-bag and I can't stand his dying-cat howls.  I got this cuz it was super-cheap and I'm a fan of Alter Bridge, the band Myles Kennedy fronts.  I generally don't give a hoot about singers, but there's something about Myles that I really dig.<br /><br />I had no high expectations for this album, but was blown away at how much I enjoy it!  Catchy, groovy, with some great variations in the music.  Myles even almost raps on one track and it's GREAT!  I've been jamming to this album and Tremonti's new solo project non-stop for the last week.  I suggest you get them both!!
0425263908|4.0|I find it ironic that so many reviews here complain that this book is a rip-off of Fifty Shades when in fact much of the plot structure of Fifty Shades was lifted from the Twilight series. I know this because I have read the original Twilight fanfic that Fifty Shades was based on. Bared To You does have some similarities to Fifty Shades at first, but the books grow further and further apart as the story progresses. When you think about it, what they have in common are just the sort of things that you would expect to find in this genre - it comes with the territory.<br />I found Bared To You more realistic - the relationship is more realistic in that in doesn't involve an unusual contract, also their attraction to each other can be explained by their similar pasts - what explains the attraction in Fifty Shades?<br />The sex scenes also seem more real to me - I remember reading a Fifty Shades review where the author wondered if that book was written by a teenager. No such issues here. Day uses proper (sexy) terms to discribe things, none of this 'He touched me...there'. Also, unlike Ana, Eva is older and sexually experienced, which makes her a more interesting (and believable) partner.<br />Overall, this gives you a similar rush to Fifty Shades, but is better written - better plot, better characters, better style.<br />The one major disappointment here is the ending - like someone mentioned, it just leaves you hanging. I guess we'll have to wait for the next book.

B008IZ5X5Q|3.0|I was hoping for more interesting storyline with the Brother Sam(MOS) character. I like that Dexter's kill plans don't always work out as perfectly as he plans them.  This makes the episodes more suspensful.  I don't think the \\"Dexter as a father\\" storyline is working.  Dexter is never around for Harrison, even when he has time off. Always gone without any real explanation to anyone is too suspicious.  Frankly, Harrison should be completely attached to the babysister and calling her mommy by now. She has no time for anything else in her life, when does she go to class for whatever she's studing. Dexter is usually better about covering his tracks as well.  Miami homicide can catch everyone else's slip ups but not Dexter's?  He seemed to be running around like a loose cannon, never getting caught by a video camera, hanging out with DDK, checking into hotels, renting cars, using his own cell phone even to call police to his own crime scene, looking up stuff about suspects and victums on his computer AT WORK! These are all things that get the smartest crimminals caught.  I was really sick when they started with the storyline about Deb having suppressed feelings for her brother.  Please! Please! don't go there. I agree, the show loses a lot of credibility with that one.
0345522303|5.0|I love these books and love the fact that it is an ongoing story. These books have it all, adventure, mystery, suspense, thrills and characters you really come to care about. Can't wait to read more escapades. Thank you Lynn.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|I can't possibly add anything here that hasn't already been said about this incredible epic series except it is a little difficult to get into at first, but you will be generously rewarded if you stick with it (which only takes about 2 episodes).  HBO stayed very true to the books and so far have not turned it into the explosive vomit that True Blood has evolved into which started out as one of the greatest series ever. The sheer egos of some writers (and those who allowed True Blood to be destroyed)is beyond my comprehension.  They had a near perfect product and had ruined it by taking the series in directions that are ridiculous and cartoonish (and not in a good way).<br /><br />The magnificance of Game of Thrones makes me once again have faith that HBO can do it right!
B004J4RQIM|4.0|The DVD quality is comparable to the previous concert except that the audio was a little better in the previous concert. Yes, Jackie Evancho is an amazing young artist but not yet on par with Andrea Bocelli. Charice appeared in both concerts and gave a more matured performance but without the emotion she displayed in the previous concert. While this concert had its moments, with Natalie Cole and Donna Summer, the previous concert was more entertaining with Michael Buble and Blake Shelton. The bottom line is that I would prefer to watch the previous concert more than this one.

B000UZESIU|2.0|This review, as well as many more, can also be found on my blog, [...].<br /><br />Synopsis: The battle for the throne continues in this second book of the Song of Ice and Fire series. The seven kingdoms of the land have been thrown into civil war with five people vying for the throne. The crown may rest on young King Joffrey's head but Robb Stark, Renly Baratheon and Stannis Baratheon all have their own claims to that throne. Dany, the daughter of the Dragon King, is also on her way back to overthrow the usurpers for her father's rightful throne.<br /><br />My Thoughts: First off, I apologize for the lackluster synopsis for this book. It was hard to describe what exactly happened and I'll get to why a little later on.<br /><br />When I read the first book in this mega hit series, A Game of Thrones, about a month ago I was amazed at how immersed I was into this very large book. The characters were vivid, the storylines complex. Yes, it was more detailed than I was used to but the storyline and wonderful characters kept me going.<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot say the same for this book. Not even close. The characters, especially my dear evil Tyrion, weren't nearly as interesting and the overall feel of the book was repetitive and heavy. Really heavy because this book got very bogged down in details. Personally I can do without too much explanation of who is related to whom, what tapestries were hanging in whose hall and seeing an inexhaustible parade of minor lords and dukes entering into the fray. Being inundated with excessive description and truly boring conversations between some characters had me wondering \\"Do I really need to know this?\\" It wasn't just the conversations either. Sometimes at the end of a chapter I was left wondering what Martin was trying to convey to me with that chapter since there didn't seem to be much point to it except to describe the garb a group of lords were wearing.<br /><br />Unfortunately this book also felt like a repetition of A Game of Thrones (hence the lackluster synopsis above). We're still fighting over the same throne, Arya is still on her own, Dany is still on her way back etc etc. Nothing really changed all that much which didn't bode well for me wanting to stick it out to see what happened.<br /><br />It was after chapters and chapters of those seemingly mundane moments that, even though I was interested to see what would happen next in the overall story, I gave up. Honestly, I'm not one to give up on a book easily. I was on page 475 for goodness sake but seeing that it took me 2 weeks to get to that point and I had another 225 pages to go I just couldn't do it. I threw in the proverbial towel and here's why ...<br /><br />I think that this time around his alternating points of view in each chapter got to me. I'm not talking about two or three main characters telling the story. I'm talking about NINE. Nine different characters had their own stories to tell but the sheer number of storylines made it confusing. There were certain storylines (like Arya's) that really intrigued me but then I'd get to the end of her chapter and have to read a snorefest involving Catelyn and wait another five chapters to see what happened to Arya. The changes in points of view really hindered the momentum of this already slow book.<br /><br />At the end of the first book I was thinking that it was pretty cool to have the storyline continue into the next book. Now, after reading (and giving up on) this second book I've changed my mind. I've decided that this book's storyline is like the Energizer Bunny in that it keeps going and going and going. I've decided that I like a book that has some closure. The big quest that links the books can continue (like Frodo and his ring, Harry trying to defeat Voldemort) but I like an ending to each book in a series. This one long drawn out drama is too much for me.<br /><br />I have decided to not read the rest of this series and I am going to do something I just don't do. I'm going to watch the Game of Thrones HBO miniseries (which I have on hold at the library) in order to see what happens. I'm hoping that I'll get the gist of the books but not spend weeks reading books that just don't hold my interest. I feel like I'm cheating but it's that miniseries that got me interested in reading this book series in the first place.<br /><br />My Rating: 0 (I didn't finish it)e on hold at the library) in order to see what happens.

B007KQ6XYY|4.0|I bought this version since the HD version is only for the Kindle Fire. This version seems like it was made with only phones in mind. Other than that, great game!
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put this book down!!! It has also re-ignited my love life with my husband and given an insight to a world I couldn't imagine before!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The book was a bit slow to start, but once we got past the interview it was full throttle.  Definately a page turner and an excellent book for the summer time.  The intrigue of Christian and fortitute of Anastasia was very alluring for me.  I could not put the book down (or should I say Kindle).  My friends and I are all reading it and we love to get together at the water cooler to discuss our notes on the what we have read thus far.  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a hot summer read.
0345803485|5.0|I personally loved this book!!! this novel is sexy , seductive and intriguing, not your regular love study .... it shows how even the darker people have a soft side and are capable of love , even in a different way. a must read for those that like novels!
1400052181|5.0|Do not let the science of this book turn you off or away.  The author relates those facts to you in layman terms and still keeps you turning pages.  The fact that we learn so much of Henrietta's life and family is just a bonus.  Everyone should be required to read this book.  Everyone should be grateful to Henrietta and her family.

0345529057|5.0|This is my first time reading this book series and I have to say that it is fantastic!  I got pulled right in.  That being said, the box that my set came in was a little bent and ripped when I tried to take out the first book.  However, the incredible quality of the writing made me forget the little detail of a broken box.  The books themselves were fine so I didn't care.  I would recommend these books to anyone!
B005FVFWOI|4.0|If ever there was a classic/progressive rock album that needed a serious remastering job it would certainly be \\"Aqualung\\" and finally the powers that be have released a remix that is light years ahead of the previous releases that I have heard.  I had the old cd and then the 1997 alleged \\"remasters\\" which although was a lot better than the old cd was still seriously lacking and now we get a mix where we can better hear all the instruments and vocals involved.  This now sounds like a whole new album and like all great classics should this still sounds good and fresh to me today as it did when I first heard it decades ago.  The mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version featuring the 1997 remaster which I got was really a very well designed and assembled mlps and so I intend to put disc one of this 40th Anniversary Special Edition together with it while discarding the unimpressive digipak version of this while keeping the 32-page colour booklet containing the mixing notes and an essay on the recordings by Dom Lawson.  I haven't decided whether or not to also discard the unimpressive second cd which should please die-hard fans but which only one track, \\"From Later\\", impressed me.  I'm really pleased to be able to get an excellent-sounding version of certainly one of the greatest classic rock albums of all time after waiting for so long and I'm confident you will too.<br /><br />Highly recommended for disc one and the colour booklet but a lot less so for the digipak and the second disc.
B000PMG16U|5.0|The movies are not as great as four, five and six; but they still do a good job and they add to your understanding. Worth $20, not full retail.
0345803485|1.0|I had no idea what this book was about and purchased it on impulse without reading any reviews simply because it was on the bestseller list and was in a hurry to purchase a book to read.  One customer review stood out before I bought this book, \\"did a teenager write this??\\" I couldn't agree more! I am truly baffled as to how this book reached the bestseller list!! And am more annoyed with myself for buying it!
B008IZ5X5Q|4.0|This is one of my All Time Favorite Shows! But THIS season! OMG! Usually, the writing on this show can't be beat. It seemed to start out OK enough, but then \\"Dexter\\" went from serial killer to Sunday school teacher, right before my very eyes! And Dex tells us he doesn't believe in God, right off the bat! Nevertheless, we have to sit thru countless episodes of countless characters who NEVER let up preaching God's word to Dexter! The plot meanders all the way to \\"Nebraska.\\" A completely USELESS episode that made me think the writers came up with it LONG after they'd finished writing the others & possibly just needed an EXTRA episode (a #12 perhaps?) It was useless & meaningless! AND...finally, just when you think the story gets back on track again.... It doesn't. It turns out it was all in your OR his OR THEIR imagination! But the writing just attempts to blur the facts. Edward James Olmos is a perfect foil, or would have been...if he hadn't been a figment of the writer's imagination! \\"Travis\\" is a douche-bag of a villain for Dexter to do battle with! BTW: Deb having \\"incestuous\\" feelings for Dex left me feeling like the writers were scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas! Even the Final Scene... Well, luke warm. I've come to expect sooooo much MORE from \\"DEXTER!\\" I hope NEXT season will be a helluva lot better than this one was!

0151013837|4.0|I liked--but did not love--the book. I do feel like the entire story was a maddeningly elaborate set up for the final chapter, kind of like that joke, \\"The Aristocrats.\\" But the pay off was good. The audio book was only okay, though. I really hated the narrator and his unwarranted belief in his own ability to pull of realistic accents.<br /><br />I can't help but feel I would have liked it more if I had read it when it first came out instead of waiting until after all the hype.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B007WFR1MQ|5.0|I've owned this Album for a while now and have been listening to it regularly. It's been on heavy rotation because it's just such a solid offering. Really it is what a fear factory album should be and thats saying a lot coming from a band who are in my opinoin some of the heaviest hitters in this era of Metal.<br /><br />Others have summarized the songs well enough so I will not get into every track in detail but I will say that I have been a fan of FF for many years and hope that I have the ability to keep getting fine album after fine album.
0385342055|3.0|So I started reading this series ages ago, when I was in my mid-twenties with the first one, Confessions of a Shopaholic. It was cute. It was funny. It was highly readable.<br /><br />Then after a few more books I realized that the series wasn't going anywhere, or at least the character wasn't. With each new book her life had changed dramatically (she'd gotten a new job, moved to a new country, planned her wedding, met her long lost sister, gotten pregnant or quit her job to be a stay at home mom) but through all of it the character remained the same. Exactly the same. Exactly as cute, as mature, as flawed, as befuddled as she was in the first book. Except that for a single woman in her early twenties to be flighty  irresponsible, naive, and more than a little scheming is a very different thing than for the same woman in her early thirties, married and with a child, to be the same way without ever having shown any signs of growth. Even her marriage is written exactly the same way as her early courtship--they are nervous around each other, keep secrets, play coy games and don't seem to know or trust each other very much.<br /><br />Why do I keep reading them?? Sigh, because she writes them. I think I feel it would be a shame to have read \\"all but one\\" (probably why I've read so many John Irving novels too).<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm 52 years old and this book was just stupid! It had me at times, but all and all, just plain dumb. At one point, I was going to put it down because it just got plain disgusting. Not going to read the other two books, not even curious. Don't waste your time and money. IMHO.
B003Z0D4SM|1.0|I tried. I really tried. I started it multiple times and finally decided to just plough through. But 250 pages in (250!) it seemed to be a badly written, badly translated book about paperwork. It has everything. Accounting! Geneology! Maps! Yes, it's a pretty dreary book. And then all of a sudden, torture porn! What the what?<br /><br />The sexual violence is so fetishized that it's hard to imagine the author even masturbated to anything else. In short, I hate this book. I skipped ahead but I can't finish. And I certainly won't be reading the others. Ever.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B008AZWMMG|5.0|unlike the poppy \\"love game\\"remix(which i only got because manson was in the mix) this pumped out pure adrenaline and unlike mansons \\"born villain\\"(big let down) ITM's new album seems more promising for the hardcore metal fans.<br /> but if you want less screaming check out Godhead mansons successor. if you want more of this check out crossbreed KE101 (i believe another manson successor... i think)<br /><br />I fully support: Independent,loaner,and rising bands. they mostly go unnoticed yet they have some of the best junk out there.
0316056863|5.0|It may not be a book filled with great stories that I remember years or even days from now, but it was a delightful little fluff memoir that I couldn't put down. It made me feel like I really KNOW Tina Fey, but then, nearly everything she does makes me feel that way. Such an unapologetic nerd--what's not to love? I especially liked her childhood (and adulthood) photos interspersed throughout the narrative. If I had one complaint it would be that I wish there were more photos. I wanted to see every awkward haircut she described, every outfit she was convinced was \\"so rad\\" at the time despite all evidence to the contrary, and maybe--just maybe--a prom picture.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it way to hard to complete some of the games. Also the scores you need to get to are way to high.
0061928356|5.0|I am stunned and delighted by this first time novelist's ability to deftly play with the contrasts of subtlety and drama, expectation and reality, hope and despair. As readers we are at once anxious, hopeful, saddened and joyful for these characters and their parallel journeys. This skillful handling of contrasts is perfectly appropriate for a novel that deals with gender and class struggles in modern India, interracial marriage, immigration and international adoption--all subjects which are themselves full of contrast. Yet at its heart, Secret Daughter is a novel about family--about the special love between a mother and daughter; however simple or complicated that may be--and that is what makes it almost universally relatable and emotionally gripping.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The story captured my interest right from the start.  I loved the twist and turns in the story.  The ending made me wonder, what next?  Made a great book club book.
0312576463|1.0|This book has gotten so much attention. The author was on the cover of TIME Magazine with a caption that read, \\"Great American Novelist.\\" The library had me waiting for a copy for months. Amy Poelher's character on Parks and Recreation tried to get her best friend to read it \\"because I'm almost done and I want to talk to you about Patty.\\" What am I missing? I was all set to love this book. The whole world loves this book. The whole world can't be wrong, surely. I know, I know, there's a voice inside me saying, \\"If the whole world jumped off a bridge would you?\\" Of course I would! It's called bungee jumping and it's hugely popular. Not unlike this book. The difference is I did not like this book. At all. (Okay, that makes it sound like I do like bungee jumping, but in truth I've never done it. Maybe I'd find that underwhelming as well.) The characters were all so despicable, unlikeable human beings and not even that believable as multi-dimensional people. The author starts off describing Patty as so polite that she would never criticize anybody else's behaviour except to call it \\"weird\\" but then later describes her as so caustic and biting that no one can stand to be around her because she makes fun of everyone and everything. This drastic shift in her personality is not sufficiently demonstrated or explained. Actually, that's a problem throughout the novel. Nothing is demonstrated or showen, it's just said. \\"Patty was like this...\\" or \\"People described Walter as...\\" or \\"Joey was the sort of person who believed...\\" The author seems completely incapable of trusting his readers (or himself) to figure anything out about his characters simply by watching them interact, seeing them do things, hearing them speak. Instead everything is heavy-handedly explained in a way that makes the readers feel that, though the author may know these characters, we do not. Besides, the characters are boring, banal people with no real problems who complain constantly. Their only emotion is self-pity and their only tone is shrill. I kept waiting for there to be a big reveal, a mystery, a secret that the author knew but let the reader find out slowly. Something, anything, to explain the characters' pointless melodrama. But there was nothing mysterious about this book, no delights or horrors to uncover. The whole thing read like a 600-page outline for the novel the author intended to write.<br /><br />For more reviews, please visit my blog, CozyLittleBookJournal.self-pity and their only tone is shrill.

B007FZ7R7W|1.0|I would rather listen to the noises of a Taco Bell bathroom after a burrito sale than Chris Brown's new album. It's clear his stance on women as an inferior being is further supported on this album. He is the biggest clown shoe in the music industry. His music is disposable, in three months this CD will just be dribble, and nobody will care. If I could give this album negative stars I would.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|EPIC fantasy, well-paced and very well written.  Interesting, multifaceted characters.  I couldn't put it down.<br />I would compare it to Patrick Rothfuss' The Name of the Wind, but Raven's Shadow was easily the better read.
B002ZG980U|5.0|Christopher Nolan's winding, twisting dream epic is just as revelatory today as it was in the theater a few years ago. Nolan clearly took his time with this script, a full eight years in the making, and it bears gorgeous fruit in the form of a rich, bright analysis of lucid dreams, shared consciousness and the very roots of influence in an individual psyche. Those are some pretty heavy concepts to just toss around in a Hollywood blockbuster, but through careful elaboration and a few very stylish test cases, it manages to efficiently explain the ground rules and get on to telling the story without bucking the casuals or alienating the intellectuals. With all sorts of hidden truths, cleverly-masked winks and subtle hints at all sorts of deeper meanings, there's also much more here than can be absorbed in a single viewing. Although the run time falls well north of two hours, the groundwork is so enveloping - and the plot so fast-paced - that the minutes just rip by without any regard for the clock on your wall. It's a fantastic effort, and a great indication that large-scale, big-budget American filmmaking is still capable of bringing the goods from time to time.

B003JYOEYM|3.0|This is the sequel to \\"Diary of the Dead.\\" You don't need to see that film to understand this film and perhaps both films should be avoided. The movie has the typical shots to the head to kill zombies as well as exploding heads and a few unique ways to kill zombies which have become known as \\"deadheads,\\" something they could only get away in post Garcia days.<br /><br />People finally get the right idea and go off to an island to avoid the endless streams of zombies. However, this island, Plum island, has its issues. The island, located off Delaware is inhabited by two feuding families with Irish accents (go figure). The unlikeable leader of one family wants to shoot zombies in the head, while the other wants to pen them up and wait for Jesus to show the way. For some reason I found myself cheering for the zombies.<br /><br />The writers took a bad plot and did everything they could to make it worse short of writing a role for William Shatner. It has George Romero's name on it, you know you are going to watch it anyway. Besides, you've seen worse zombie movies. But hey, I warned you not to expect too much.<br /><br />There is a token lesbian with her hand in her pants, masturbating scene for some reason. Thanks George.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|As a non-fiction writer ([[ASIN:B008ND0MA4 Your Mark On The World]]) I approached this book without any expectations and was quite pleasantly surprised.  The book is full of vivid characters that captivated my full attention, a fast moving plot that made the book hard to put down, and thought provoking questions that left me pondering the book long after I finished it.<br /><br />The book is an imaginative story of a post-apocalyptic world with too few resources and governments run for the benefit of a small population of elites.<br /><br />Despite the fact that I generally read non-fiction, I found this book to be compelling and thought provoking.<br /><br />I would recommend the book to anyone interested in fantasy, science fiction, politics, or young adult fiction.  The book is painfully graphic in its description of violence, so I'd respect parent's who want to guide their children who may be interested in the book.  That said, I didn't find it objectionable.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a great book.

B00846REIS|4.0|bared to you<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. YES!!! right away I saw \\"similarities\\" to the 50 Shade Series but it was Hmmm How can I say this: Well (IMO) it was the same BUT different. I really enjoyed the 50 shades series and I enjoyed this Bared to You equally as much. What I liked BEST about this is that it was straight to the point with LESS soap opera antics.. BUT It did start to work a nerve with the \\"Oh Eva\\" and \\"Oh Gideon\\" much like the numerous Oh' Anastasia\\" and Oh Christians (in the 50 shades series) you could hear the background music start to play just before they KISSED like on All my children or some mess.. (LOL) Anyway the $ex was different between the two series as Anastasia was an (experienced) virgin (LMAO)( and Eva had been around the block a time or two so the way she related and handled the $ex was more believable to me. OOOPS I didn't mean to go into an all out comparison of the two books but hey it is what it is. This book was definitely a bit more steamer in the bedroom and out of it. Chiiiii You have to have a man while reading this book here (unfortunately for me I don't have one and haven't in years) so sad :( but anyway.... that's neither here nor there. ^:^<br /><br />Funny I don't really recall why Gideon had the nightmares that he had? Why was he choking his chicken in his sleep, why was he about to \\"rape\\" Eva in his sleep. Did I read that and just don't remember what had happened to him. I understand that he hated the home he was raised in (but why)... I understood the sibling rivalry his brother had against him, wanting what Gideon had? His brother thought Gideon was shown more attention growing up? Well OK.. Hey I read a lot from one book to the next so at times they start running together for me and I don't recall everything probably as I should so help me out here.<br />Overall this book grabbed and held my attention from the beginning to the end. I have recommended it as a read to family and friends that read.<br /><br />What I wish for a book though is that it be MORE TRUE TO LIFE. I enjoy reading always have since I was a little girl reading, Are you there God, it's me Margaret. Anyway lately in the books I've read everyone is Perfect. the sex scenes are hot and steamy but the Orgasms come to easily, In real like it's not always so easy, a man don't always hit the spot and make the woman have the Biggest O of her life or the multiple orgasms either. In Real life the Big O is much harder to conceive (per truth) LOL ... Who comes on demand? hahaha Chii Boo,, emmpf I wish it was so simple<br /><br />What I did like about Gideon is that he was straight forward and upfront about what he wanted from jump \\"I want to \\"8uck\\" you\\"! (well dayummmm) OK so that would have been a STRAIGHT turn off to me if a man EVER came to me that way, But I would respect him for his honesty and depending on the man, maybe Just Maybe he would have had a chance at getting it. ;)<br />I hated all the running away from Gideon that Eva did (too soap Operish) where they do that at besides (oh in the pages of books and in movies or on tv) Oh Gideon,, (takes off running)I cant do this, I love you but....

B003TJR2HS|4.0|Works Great!<br /><br />Some other companies discontinued their converters. Thank goodness for this one. Works with my old Best Buy Honda Accord Factory Radio converter kit. I think I own the USA-Spec PA15-HON3 or equivalent from Best Buy back in 2007/8 (can't remember). The ONLY problem is that sometimes my iPod (Touch) and iPhone4 stops playing music. This is solely because of my car kit and not the Cable Jive. I've had this same issue on other brands of converters for years. My Honda kit with the Converter will charge the devices, then 10 - 15 minutes the car kit & converter gets a little warm and the iPhone or Touch stops playing. I feel (but I don't know) it's because of some power issue with my car kit and some \\"circuit breaker\\" is kicking in. Who knows but I'm HAPPY the CableJive is around to keep my Apple devices charged...... until the iPhone 5 when Apple changes the dock connection AGAIN!!!!! (@#$@!#$ Apple)
B0086700CM|1.0|I never ordered this product and can't imagine why I would.  this makes it very difficult to write a review.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|Ok so I succumbed to the hype! I bought and read all 3 parts of this poorly written, cliched, and franky crap story!<br /><br />If the reference to Ana's inner goddess and conscious weren't enough to make me gag, the constant mentioning of Grey's gray gaze(say that 10 times), and Ana's biting of the lip and rolling of her eyes made me want to tear my own eyes out so I wouldn't have to continue reading!  But I did, because I promised my friend that I would read all 3 books before making a final judgement!  Which I could have made after the first page!<br /><br />Not even the supposedly raunchy sex scenes could save these books, because frankly I had read it all by halfway through the first one, and the rest of the scenes were just the same stuff slightly reworded!<br /><br />Reading a piece of crap like this trilogy really makes me sad for all the wonderful authors out there, that know how to string 3 sentences together and have a decent enough vocabulary to not have to repeat themselves over and over.  I am positive that there would be a lot of unpublished erotic novels out there that would shit all over this one!<br /><br />All I can hope now is that after 20million or so sales, E.L. James has made enough money to never have to unleash another novel, or god forbid, series of novels into the public!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|the game is simplistic yet challenging. I enjoy it very much. the larger grids are my favorite, and the time trails are great.

B008BRC6NS|3.0|When it has came down to Jennifer Lopez lately, she has been more known for her marriages and her personal life, than really her music. She has lately had a lackluster collection of music that hasn't really caught up to her glory days from the late 90's to the early 2000's. Her success has been with her recent stint as a judge from American Idol. Yet, with her leaving the show and focusing in on her touring again with Enrique Iglesias, she has had a lot to prove to her fans knowing if she can sing, which she hadn't shown. After a set of poor records from 2007's Brave to her recent 2011 record Love? which had been originally set for Epic, but she was dropped midway through the plans for the record after a string of poorly released singles Louboutons and Fresh Out The Oven. Now, with a hits album now it, is it worth the while? Well, for new Jennifer Lopez fans, but for others there is much more to be desired.<br /><br />Dance Again: The Hits is a lackluster reflection of Jennifer Lopez and her solo success from her days with Latin music going mainstream in the late 90's all the way to her recent album 2011's Love? There is a reflection here, but still with a lot more to have been desired for a more definitive reflection of her biggest songs. The album though has been digitally remastered and include more of her biggest hits like her starter single If You Had My Love, as well as Waiting For Tonight all the way to her more recent hits like On The Floor and I'm Into You. The collection mainly reflects on only one angle from Jennifer Lopez and that is her dance music, with a lackluster showcase from diversity in her voice, little to no ballads from her collection of music. The album does overlook some of Jennifer's bigger hits like No Me Ames, Play, and I'm Glad and the original version of I'm real from J. Lo. Mainly, she could've left those songs out on purpose, considering her past relationships with her ex's in the projects (Marc Anthony whom sung with her on No Me Ames, and her second husband Chris Judd whom appeared in the I'm Real video.) But overall, there was more to have been clearly shown from her musically. The new tracks aren't really good either from Dance Again, which she feels drowned out, and doesn't show a better range to the lackluster drive on Goin' In from the recent move Step Up: Revolution.<br /><br />Overall, with Dance Again: The Hits, it is a lackluster hits collection from Jennifer Lopez that mainly shows just dance and not a wider range of diversity from her songs. This may be a good sampler for anyone whom hasn't yet heard Jennifer Lopez's music, but not actually a good hits album when it came down to it. Jennifer Lopez hasn't worn many good hats on her musical sleeve, and could've given more to her die hard fans whom have stuck with her thick and thin. Overall, Dance Again isn't actually a must have for your music library. I would wait for something better to come along to say you'll dance to.<br /><br />Album Cover: B-<br /><br />Songs: C<br /><br />Price: C+<br /><br />Remastering: C<br /><br />Overall: Cs, and her second husband Chris Judd whom appeared in the I'm Real video.)

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I didn't go to this movie with high expectations, but enjoyed it thoroughly - I was actually really surprised at how much I loved this movie.  The story line captured my attention and I had never read any of the John Carter series of books (though, I did Google John Carter when I first started seeing previews for the movie and so had a general idea of the plot).  Honestly, I felt it was the best sci-fi movie I had seen in quite some time and kept giving me flashes of Dune and Children of Dune. For the length of the movie, I was completely immersed in that world and, though it had a completely satisfactory ending, it had me wanting more.<br /><br />I purchased the 3D combo set and I'm quite happy with it.  I had missed out on seeing this in 3D at the theater (which I still regret), but I am quite happy with the quality of the 3D Blu-Ray.  Watching it at home I was just as happy with the movie/story itself as I had been the first time - and have watched it multiple times. I am still left with the same feeling - being completely immersed and more curious about the political climate of Mars and what else there is to discover there.

B007P3TMW2|2.0|So much expectation for this potentially heart-felt theme, but even bigger let down when this young boy carries the adult theme that is not very engaging. Then there's the narration. Too much talking by this boy becomes overwrought. As usual, Viola Davis is superb.

B004OR199G|4.0|I was completely new to the idea of an alkaline diet, whole foods diet, etc. This was a great starting point, and I've incorporated many of her suggestions into my 70% vegetarian diet over the past year. I am healthier than I've ever been because of it. My only gripe, and the reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that I do not like her party-girl talk. I realize she is just trying to be cute, but 1. it gets old REALLY fast, and 2. I have friends who won't even finish the book when I loan it to them because they are turned off by it. It just detracts from her message. I hope her writing voice matures soon, because her advice and the information she shares is truly life changing.
B005DOL0R0|4.0|The slleve was what I had hoped for switching from a Kindel I and its sleeve to the new Fire.  But... a feature was missed.<br /><br />The Kindle Fire has a touch screen that gets finger marks frequently.  The sleev would have been ideal IF it had some sort of micro filber inside so it gets wiped when put in the sleev.  Currently, the finger marks simply accumulate.<br /><br />ALtearntely the sleeve is an ample carrying case for the Fire.
B00866H7SS|5.0|To be honest with you when I finished the three Fifty Books I needed something to read. I loved and enjoyed those books. I starting looking around the internet and found Bared to You. Read a sneak  of the book and went crazy that I found something I wanted to read. I love Gideon and Eva and the story they tell. I finished the book in two days and was so sad when it ended. I then realized the second book was coming out October 2nd and I already purchased for my Kindle. I was at a Baby Shower and everyone was saying they needed something juicy to read and within seconds they ordered the book. I also suggested when they finish to pre order the next book. It is the buzz on Facebook as well. Now I need something good to read!! Any suggestions??? Merle

0151013837|5.0|The top reviewers are very helpful and they've said it all and I know my review won't be as helpful. But I have to say Life of Pi has been one of the most intriguing books I've read. Its thoughtful and with all honesty, for quite a while, I thought the story was based on a true story. Silly me. I definitely recommend this book, its a great read indeed!
1594744769|4.0|You know those restless moments you have with reading where you're dying to read something new and original?  I realize that every storyline is based off a very small family tree of stories, but Ransom Riggs' novel Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is a strange little ride through a variety of stories that make it feel very, very new.<br /><br />Admittedly, I'm an impatient reader with certain genres, so I feared that I would be that way with this novel.  That wasn't the case.  The first 75 pages or so set the novel up in a pretty catchy sort of a way that had me flipping pages to find out what happened to Jacob's grandfather, and what were the eerie pictures and creatures all about?  I really liked the mix of a fantasy-like tale mixed with the realism of young Jacob's life.  It didn't feel as though you were reading a fantastical story until he was actually on the island.  Then, things got interesting.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story and think that the eerie pictures and juxtaposition of real and fantasy worlds to be intriguing.  This was one story that I didn't feel like I was simply being told, but that I was actually IN the story as well.  My heart would accelerate in certain creepy scenes, and I even jumped a time or two.  Chalk that up to me being a big chicken, but I really got into this read.<br /><br />For anyone who is looking for something new, that doesn't feel like it's been hashed over a million times, then you should give this novel a try.  It was refreshing, spooky, and beguiling--an odd combination, right?  That is just how this novel came together!  For sure, this is a book that I'll be sharing.
0131103628|5.0|When I received the book I was a little disappointed at its' diminutive size, but quickly found that it is incredibly detailed without being overly so.  Each section is clear about the topic it is trying to cover, and the lessons are reinforced by completing all the exercises.<br /><br />This is NOT a book to teach you about the standard library.  This is a book about how to program using C as your language of preference.
B008N1V11U|5.0|This game is one of the best games on any tablet.This clearly has ps2 graphics but netherless an awesome game.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|This series is OVER RATED! The author can't complete a thought let alone a character or constant story line! The books jump around like someone wrote 50 short stories and then decided to publish them together. I skim read all the books. If he spent half as many words finishing each character as he did describing useless trivial details this could have been one of the best novels around. Unfortunately the author didn't do that and there are HUGE gaps in time and the story.<br /><br />I do have to admit I like the story line. It just needs to be finished!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Sometimes when a film advertises itself as having a \\"dream cast,\\" that is all the film is - a number of high-profile actors and actresses appearing in the same film. Glengarry Glen Ross has a dream cast (Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Kevin Spacey, Ed Harris, Alan Arkin, and Alec Baldwin, plus an effective small role played by Jonathan Pryce) providing what a viewer can only hope for - true ensemble acting. These actors lose themselves completely and embody the desperate characters whom David Mamet has created in what may be his best play (certainly the best film adaptation of any of his plays). Yes, the language is raw and crude, and for those offended by such language, well, there are plenty of fine G-rated films out there for you. (I find it interesting and amusing that there are so many complaints about the language: the film is rated R, which means there are sex, and/or violence, and/or adult language, so what did you all expect?) But this is Mamet territory, so the language should not come as a surprise to anyone, and I feel sorry for those who cannot get past this. Every performance is nothing short of superb. This is arguably Jack Lemmon's finest performance. Baldwin's character was not in the original play, but one cannot imagine him not being there, as he provides a context for the rest of the film. A film for those who find great acting as exciting (if not more exciting) and entertaining as car chases, exploding national monuments, etc.

B006R8GK2Q|3.0|When the definitions of what you are told to find are accurate, the game is kind of fun. When it tells you to find a flute and it means an oboe, it's pretty frustrating. It's definition of translucent is a bit off too. Sometimes it means entirely invisible. For five bucks, pass this one up. If it drops to $.99, give it a try.

B002VHI8FE|4.0|Even after reading some reviews and anticipating a good read, I was really surprised by this book. It turned out to be really good. While Abercrombie's writing style and ideas are not remarkably original (like for example Steven Erikson and his \\"Malazan Book of the Fallen\\" series) they are really good and interesting, even compelling. From the begging I was swept in the current of the story and I didn't really meet any big sub-surface rocks. Which, translated in common, means that I enjoyed the book thoroughly and there wasn't anything in it to annoy me or break my immersion.<br /><br />Abercrombie creates an interesting world and he paints it well enough for the reader to understand and feel it. This happens slowly, in smooth intervals, one spoon at a time, and gives us time to enter this new universe without any stress or pass-through shakes. If you expect extreme dept however, you will be slightly disappointed - it's just a regular fantasy world without anything remarkable in it. This of course is not something necessarily bad, especially if you want a light read without the need to keep too much information in background.<br /><br />With the characters however the author's talent shines really strong. They are original, likable, some are even strange, and the reader can actually feel with them. Abercrombie describes each personality extremely well with all the little hooks and details to make each one unique and easily distinguishable.<br /><br />This is the first book from Joe Abercrombie I read, but it definitely won't be the last. I can highly recommend it!
1442337966|2.0|Hi,<br /><br />I've both read & watched Secret. That was like a new learning experience something which we knew subconsciously but concept was nicely put across in Secret.<br /><br />Frankly speaking, what I felt is Power is just an addendum of Secret. It describes that root cause of everything is \\"Love\\"! Well, I feel the concept of Law of Attraction is bit stretched in Power.<br /><br />I've a simple argument that for everything and every matter, we don't necessarily need to have a feeling of Love  to think positive, nor do I mean we need to have hatred too. What I'm saying is we can also think positive, and practice law of atractions by developing a power of focus, and gratitude.<br /><br />But POWER is simply associating everything to LOVE which looks bit exaggerated at one point beyond.<br /><br />Instead, I would say that we need learn how to practice law of attraction for that I would highly recommend to the folks, who already watched/read Secret, the book called \\"Key to Living the Law of Attractions\\" by maestro Jack Canfield.<br /><br />Step 1) Secret<br />Step 2) Key to Living the law of attractions.<br /><br />That's it!<br /><br />I'm 100% sure it'll amplify the impact of your learning of Secret.

B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I was amazed by the acting, the screenwriting, and the authenticity of emotion between the actors in an absurdist cartoon-like movie.  While nothing in the movie is even a bit tethered to reality, the chemistry and interactions among the actors works quite well within the parameters set by the movie. Often when an actor plays is a dumb character, the temptation is to play it with exaggerated mannerisms. Channing Tatum is magnificent in pulling off the character with restraint and dead pan humor that rings true. Jonah Hill also is adept in his part and is laugh out loud funny in his  audition for the school play of Peter Pan.  This movie deserves multiple viewings and to be passed down from generation to generation.

145162445X|5.0|This book is a must for everyone interested in the world around us. Till about 1925 the universe was thought to be our Galaxy (Milky Way) only. Less than 100 years later there is milk all over the place! Some hundred million galaxies, with billions of stars (suns) each, have sent their light into the universe. Some of this light reached our little planet after travelling for thousands, and in some cases for billions of years to reach us.<br /><br />A \\"Universe from Nothing\\" takes the reader right to the point, where astrophysics and astronomy now stand, including the background of the discovery of the accelerating galaxies, which led to the 2012 Nobel price for Saul Perlmutter, Brian P. Schmidt und Adam Riess.<br /><br />A discussion seems due why Lawrence M. Krauss, the author of \\"Universe from Nothing\\" was not among the laureates!

1585104205|5.0|Salvete, Amazon review readers. I have been interested in learning Latin since I started playing Civilization V a few months ago (since you can play as Rome and they are one of my favorite civilizations to play as). So after a bit of research, I decided to grab Lingua Latina and the Wheelock book. I have finished the first two chapters of Lingua Latina and I can safely say I have learned more Latin in my first week than I did in my two years of High School Spanish.<br /><br />Lingua Latina teaches you through immersion. There is no English in this book (besides for the copyright notices at the very front, that most ignore). If you have seen or used Rosetta Stone then you know the immersion method already. Pictures throughout the chapters help you learn vocabulary and you learn grammar through the story than Hans Ørberg crafts throughout the book. It's very entertaining. I have already laughed a couple of times (though that may have been because I was giddy about actually understanding another language).<br /><br />If you are debating between the Wheelock and Lingua Latina like I was, let me help you. Skip the Wheelock book. I wasted around $15 on that book. It teaches you through the traditional method of memorization. Like any high school or college student will tell you, they don't learn a language that way. Why some people insist on teaching or learning that way I will never understand.<br /><br />I also recommend you read an article called \\"Latin by the Dowling Method\\" (just Google it). It explains in greater detail on why Lingua Latina works and Wheelock doesn't. I'm sure that the basic points of that article can be applied to any foreign language but it is tailored to latin.<br /><br />Valete, readers.

It seems to me it is an attempt by the author to try to make some more money. Where I could not put the first 2 books down, I have struggled to finish the last 2, with the only reason being that I invested too much time already to not finish the series.

0547569653|4.0|As a distance runner and inspiring nutritionist this book looked like the perfect fit. I picked it up in an airport and read it on the plane  the  back from a race.<br /><br />It is a quick read and interesting enough to be a page tuner. For those already following Scott's career it might not be a lot of new information, but his personal insight and emotional input really elevtes this book to something much more interesting than the standard running book.<br /><br />For people looking for Shakespeare, this is not it. However scott's passion for the race and his dedication to diet and lifestyle more than make up for any stale copy.  The included recipes are good to get a taste (literal) of the vegan diet and to show off how easy it can be to prepare race worthy food.<br /><br />Chances are if you are interested in this book you have read books on ultras before or maybe book on running in general, this one will be a great addition to your library. If you are reading it not knowing anything about the sport or Scott than I think you will be very surprised on just how fun a first hand account \\"running\\" book can be.

A writer, someone who could also claim the spotlight.  But then the economy collapsed.  He and Amy both lost their New York jobs and that life.  It's back to Missouri to Nick's hometown for the two of them, and the slow dismantling of the perfect life begins.<br /><br />Suddenly a dramatic shift:  it's their fifth anniversary and Amy is gone.  The search, the spotlight on Nick as a killer, and the now flat and devastated turf of their lives is shown to the clamoring public.<br /><br />Told through alternating points of view, we see Nick's story and what he shows us in bits and pieces; then we see Amy's tale told through diary entries.<br /><br />But in several surprising twists and turns, we begin to form a new picture of each of them.  [[ASIN:B006LSZECO Gone Girl: A Novel]] reminds me a bit of the kaleidoscope toy I enjoyed in childhood:  you turn it one way, and the pieces assemble.  Then, with another shift, you have something entirely different.<br /><br />Gillian Flynn kept me captivated all through this story, and I kept guessing about how things would unfold, but she surprised me still again.  Could I even imagine how it would all turn out?  No...but then again, grab your kaleidoscope and watch it all reassemble in still another way.  Five stars!

B0086700CM|5.0|I think its a very fun game and it doesnt have any promblems. I think its great.I play it all time when I'm bord.
B0000E64TR|5.0|Although I have an above average $$$$$ home theater system (Paradigm/Yamaha/Denon/Tascam) I never used my Sony Blu-Ray player's SACD ability, so I took a chance and ordered this from Amazon. Last night we had a couple of friends over, fired up the ginormous Lava Lamp (read that review as well), and hoped for the best.<br /><br />OMG is an understatement! This was the best listening experience I've had in years-It brought tears to my eyes! (yes I was 12 when it first came out--I'm what the kids now like to call...old) The renewed clarity and punch of the drums alone was worth the price of admission. (no more muddy slapback snares and toms-the delays are CLEAN) Did I mention the acoustic guitars and Elton's planted vocals??? The remaster/remix engineer Greg Penny obviously loved what he was doing. Although there are a few \\"pan it here, then there...then ...there\\" moments for effect, overall they don't take away from a monumental experience.<br /><br />There's always going to be debate as to \\"altering\\" the original, especially when that original is such a touchstone of rock and roll; Burned into your soul on your AM radio, or Ranger under-dash 8-track player with Jensen 6x9' 3-ways on the back deck, or your Koss 4AA headphones and Advent 3's with a Marantz 2225 receiver... which one of those was \\"real\\" and not altered from the original mix? None of them.<br /><br />No instruments were re-recorded, added, or swapped out here-this amazing new version just painfully reaffirms that technology has far out paced true talent... and I'm personally for anything that brings such great music back into the modern conversation and my modern system...the only downside is I just spent $400 on more classic LP's on SACD, and I've decided to get rid of my one year old Yamaha A/V receiver I only bought to get HDMI and go with new 9.2 pre-amp/power amp separates for my A/V... but I'm grinning at the chance to hear what I've been missing...
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love these books....you have to read them with an open mind and see the true love story. I'm on book 2 now and look forward to book 3.

1400069289|4.0|I rarely write a book review for others so when i do it has to be really exceptional to me and something that i believe a lot of others would benefit from knowing.  IT IS EXCITING AND ENCOURAGING THAT YOU CAN CHANGE things you were about to give up on and didn't think you ever could (AND PERHAPS MUCH MORE EASILY) than you thought you could before you read this book. All ideas presented are backed up with  detailed,real and interesting examples. I do consider it a must read for  those who are  concerned about  human behaviors and not satisfied with current explanations in psychology, history, religious or spiritual studies or science thus far.<br />Your own unique approach to change has more potential to work for YOU...WHICH IS WHAT THE BOOK HELPS YOU SEE. While so many rely on some other person like a coach or counselor , to help them see themselves and create real and lasting change,  this book can help you create, precisely suited to your individual needs and values, WHETHER FOR YOU ONLY OR FOR SOME SITUATION OR GROUP YOU ARE WORKING FOR OR WITH. Even if change is not your goal or interest...this adds great insight into the understanding of self and others and helps one to respect and to respond more CONFIDENTLY, CLEARLY, KNOWLEDGEABLY,  to others and to be inspiring and motivating rather than manipulative or manipulated...without being a passive victim or a controlling tyrant. I would recommend as a supplement to this book the following: SUBLIMINAL  HOW YOUR UNCONSCIOUS RULES BEHAVIOR by Leonard Mlodinowo create change in themself or a situation...in many cases far better than other books that give you the exact step by step methods that they profess to work for everyone.  Your own unique approach has more potential to work for YOU...WHICH IS WHAT THE BOOK HELPS YOU SEE. And while it also offers examples and insights on how to create change for whole groups of people such as in a workplace, it is all based on seeing clearly what is happening and why and the kinds of changes you want to see and what you have to work with....so you still apply an approach, developed uniquely and specifically to THAT SITUATION AND THOSE PEOPLE INVOLVED...which is quite a bit more successful and the book so far reveals, to me , how to DO JUST THAT. While the title of the book does not claim to offer that anyway, comprehending its more in depth information and insights will and the information is presented in ways that are simple and easy to comprehend for any adult, regardless of education or experience, on your own or even more perhaps for some if share and compare what learned and how they would apply it.  While so many rely on some other person to help them see themselves and create real and lasting change,like a coach or counselor ,  this book can help you create, precisely suited to your individual needs and values,a plan to change, WHETHER FOR YOU ONLY OR FOR SOME SITUATION OR GROUP YOU ARE WORKING FOR OR WITH. Even if change is not your goal or interest...this adds great insight into the understanding of self and others and helps one to respect and to respond more CONFIDENTLY, CLEARLY, KNOWLEDGEABLY,  to others being inspiring and motivating rather than manipulative or manipulated...without being a passive victim or a controlling tyrant. I am not giving any examples of how this is done as i think it is so much better to go into reading this and be surprised at what you read and learn from it.  It is an extremely impactful book and even more so if you don't know much prior to reading it about the specific ideas and examples you will read about. I repeat: IT IS EXCITING AND ENCOURAGING THAT YOU know now, how you CAN CHANGE (AND PERHAPS MUCH MORE EASILY) AND UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T BEFORE  READING THIS.

1878424319|5.0|I don't read a lot for pleasure or personal reasons (I read too much for work), and I certainly don't care to take the time and write reviews.  That being said, some of verbiage is a little new age and hokey for me, but the underlying messages and lessons are very powerful.  I have already seen some positive changes and growth in my life. It is a very quick read, and I would recommend this to someone who truly wants to grow as a person and be the best they can be.
B005VTGB0S|5.0|This is a fantastic case, especially for the price I paid - apparently it was a returned item so was significantly marked down.  Quality construction and materials, the only flaw is that the elastic corner loops sometimes block the headphone jack and power button, but can be moved out of the way.  I would definitely purchase this case again.  I heart Amazon Basics!
B007SGM084|5.0|To really know this story, you need to read all three books, unless you are so undone by the D/s scene that you can not continue...by all means, don't read something you don't like. However, this book shows the very real lifestyle of Dominants and their submissive in a D/s relationship.  There are defined guidelines to follow. Protocol and training.  There are rules for safety, and limits are discussed and followed.  The mantra for the BDSM / D/s lifestyle is SAFE, SANE, CONSENSUAL.  For this reason, I loved the first book.  It stresses the importance of this mantra.<br /><br />E.L.James does an excellent job in character development with all the characters in the book.  The good, the bad, and the friends!  The families aren't perfect!  I loved the realness of the characters.  They have believable conversations and reactions and passion for their relationships.  All of the characters are seeking to live life, be connected.  I love being able to read Ana's inner struggles, and having the voice of her inner selves is amazing.  Watching the characters affect change in one another, to grow and evolve into a better form of themselves is THE best part of the books.<br /><br />To see the hurt caused by drugs, alcohol, abusive relationships and even civil divorce and realize the effect that these conditions have had on the development of the psyche and the choices that these individuals make due to these factors is eye-opening...real.<br /><br />While I do love our simple life, it is fun to wallow in the luxury of the rich and famous.  I did like that aspect of the book!  I looked up the cars they owned on the internet, just to KNOW what was being used.  NOT that I want one!  I've even tried and now enjoy a breakfast of Greek yogurt and granola with blueberries and Tea (tho mine is much stronger!) What I really thought was well-done, was showing that just because a family has wealth, they didn't have a perfect life.  But it was great that with their wealth, they were philanthropic with their monies and passions too.  I know that doesn't always go hand-in-hand.  It was a human touch to the luxury life.<br /><br />The most important part of the books is the healing of the characters as they grow together.  They embrace their pasts, look at them honestly, and accept that they can have unconditional love from the ones they love.  They can love those who made wrong choices that affected their lives, but still hate the choices that were made. They also have given themselves permission to walk away from those whom they may have forgiven, but realize that person is not a good influence in their life. It is a strong voice for all of us to have inside our heads.  To grow to this level of maturity in our thoughts.<br /><br />I have re-read the books 4 times.  I've recommended it every time it has come up in topic of a conversation...even jokingly.

0393088774|5.0|Paul Krugman is a best-selling author, columnist, and blogger for the New York Times, and a professor of economics and international affairs at Princeton University. He also received the 2008 Nobel Prize in Economics.<br /><br />Rather than asking how the crisis happened, he asks the practical question, what do we do now? He argues that the economics (but not the politics) of recovery is easy. He urges, \\"spend more, and both real GDP and employment will rise.\\"<br /><br />But instead the Coalition wants to cut the deficit. It refuses to spend more, so destroying the economy and jobs. It calls this `austerity policy', when it is actually poverty policy.<br /><br />The International Monetary Fund studied 173 recent cases of `austerity' policy and found that \\"austerity policies were followed by economic contraction and higher unemployment.\\" So poverty policy causes poverty and destroys jobs - well, whatever next?<br /><br />The euro embodies this poverty policy. Within the euro, countries must prioritise cutting their deficits; they are ordered not to spend their way out of the crisis. Worse, the euro caused the crisis in the EU. The EU claimed that the euro would prevent `asymmetric shocks', but as Krugman points out, \\"What actually happened, however, was the mother of all asymmetric shocks. And it was the creation of the euro itself that caused it.\\"<br /><br />Krugman explains that the euro ended the premiums that investors had demanded to compensate for the risks of devaluation and default, so Spanish, Italian and Greek debts were seen as almost as safe as German debt. This cut southern Europe's borrowing costs, causing huge housing booms which became huge housing bubbles. Local banks did not have enough funds to back all this lending, so they borrowed from other banks, German, French and British, spreading the debts and the risks.<br /><br />The hard part of ending the slump is political. Prioritising deficit reduction serves the interests of creditors, those who lend money, that is, those who have capital. Capitalists gain from the slump, so they don't want to end it.nd money, that is, those who have capital. Capitalists gain from the slump, so they don't want to end it.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless ~ 5 Stars<br />Fearless: The Heroic Story of One Navy SEAL's Sacrifice in the Hunt for Osama Bin Laden and the Unwavering Devotion of the Woman Who Loved Him by Eric Blehm<br />My rating: 5 of 5 stars<br /><br />This book will blow your socks off! I was sent this book to read and my 17yr old son who is considering a career in the military, snagged it and started reading it while I was finishing another book. He said it was pretty good but started kind of slow and read like a documentuary, but he wasn't very far into the book yet.<br />Now for my take...I agree a bit with the documentary and kind of slow beginning. I was surprised that it went so far back into history. But once the story got moving, while there was a lot off technical info and a ton of acronyms, the story of Adams life, determination, never quit and keep on keepin' on attitude in every aspect of his life is inspiring and uplifting! NOTE: I will state that while this is an inspiring book about a Hero who trusted God, this is a graffiti story and the author did not hold back in telling it word for word the way the SEAL's told it to him. So there is plenty of curse words and drinking, etc. As such I would not recommend this book for young children. As for older teens like my 17yr old who are considering a career in the military...a must read in my mind!
1603427244|3.0|I was excited when I saw this book coming out and pre-ordered it.  I am sort of glad to have it in my library, but only as a quick-glance reference list.  I do not think it is at all good for *learning* specific cast-ons/bind-offs, though it touts itself as a step-by-step guide.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Spiral bound<br />- Each CO/BO has a list of \\"Characteristics\\" (i.e., invisible beginning, can be a little loose and sloppy), and a list of \\"Good For\\"s (i.e., toe up socks, bags, top-down hats and mittens)<br />- Each CO/BO has a few close-up \\"finished\\" photos that show you what it's supposed to look like.<br />- The CO/BOs are categorized for quick reference; for example, the CO categories and number of COs referenced:<br />--- All Purpose (8)<br />--- Ribbing (moderate stretch) (4)<br />--- Ribbing (a lot of stretch) (8)<br />--- End-of-Row (5)<br />--- Super Stretchy (10)<br />--- Decorative (9)<br />--- Temporary & Hems (5)<br />--- Toe-Up Socks (3)<br />--- Circular (2)<br />--- (Note, the BOs are far fewer, 22 total)<br />- The book is designed pretty well & has an index<br /><br />Cons:<br />As I said, this book is not, IMO, good for learning any of the CO/BOs referenced in it.  Perhaps I am spoiled by YouTube and TECHKnitter's blog (and many other *free* online resources that have set the standard, in my mind, for exceptional explanations of knitting methods), but for every CO/BO I have referenced in this book, I had to look it up on YouTube to understand how its done.  Here's why:<br /><br />- The instructions are very sparsely worded and quite a few times haven't made sense to me<br />- The photos are RIDICULOUSLY small and waaay too zoomed-out to see what the needles/yarn-strands are doing.  This actually pisses me off because there is TONS of space around the photos for more photos or larger photos.  Also, these photos clumsily attempt to \\"line up\\" with the steps they are associated with; however, there are no notations in the photos to reference back to the step in which they belong. It's also not readily apparent which part of the corresponding step the photo belongs to as some of the steps have many comma-delimited parts.<br /><br />In summary, I see this publication as a glorified reference book, and not a terribly bad one, but it, for me, is not at all a how-to.  On the cover it states the book has 54 \\"step-by-step\\" methods, but the step-by-steps feel lacking and lazy, especially compared to the decent work done on organizing its content.  Interestingly, the book references specific YouTube videos in its Resources appendix.  It would have been nice to have those inline with their corresponding CO/BO, however.  If half-stars were permitted, I would give it 2.5 stars.he step in which they belong.

If you're looking for hardcore BDSM then read those but, if you're interested in a love story with some spanking thrown in, this is your book.<br /><br />I read the other 2 books just to finish out the story line.  I did, admittedly, enjoy the hilarious changes of the signature in Ana's and Christian's emails to each other. Some of them cracked me up way more than anything else...trust me, I was throatily laughing at 2am after reading this book and the signatures on their emails.

B001RCD2DW|5.0|I bought this headphones for $240 on Amazone almost 7-8 months ago because I wanted to prepare for my USMLE Step-1 exam. I was watching educational videos for almost 8-10 hours daily for 3 months. Not a single day I felt fatigue with this headphone. In between study I was taking a music/movie break and they sounds awesome by every mean. The only problem is that my wife always complained how loud they were...its an open back headphone. Anyway, now I am preparing for Step-2 exam and bought AKG K272 HD which is closed back just to calm her a little bit. Another comparable headphones I have tried at Bestbuy are Audio-Technica ATH AD900X and ATH ESW9 and they both are very good. I also tried AKG 550 demo at Bestbuy and they sounds horrible. Its unbelievable that they are the best looking headphone but sounds worst....probably because they are MADE IN CHINA, where as AKG 702 and 272HD are MADE IN AUSTRIA. Audio-Technica's are made in Japan.

0307279189|5.0|Written very well and although skeptical about a lot of the claims made throughout, I was intrigued enough to try Chia Seeds and minimalist shoes like Vibrams Five Fingers and Sauconys.

I love how you can see the begining and get an idea of where it's going but then you get a very nice journey getting there. The biggest problem I have, is that there isn't more! I look forward to the continuation and hope I don't have to wait too terribly long for it.

Yes, we are all getting older, but the music is still great, and that is what we went for and why we buy a set like this.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love this game!  It is a great way to pass the time because of the increasing challenges with each puzzle.  It elevates from easy to medium to hard but don't be fooled by a checkmark indicating that you've completed the level. Your aim is to get a perfect score by completing each puzzle in the designated # of moves at the top of each one.  A perfect score yields a star.  You can always go back to replay any level until you have achieved a perfect score on all puzzles within a grid.  If you play chess or other games of strategy, then you will definitely enjoy this game as well.

0812993292|5.0|Harold Fry is an ordinary man, living a normal life that some might call humdrum or forlorn. The arrival of a brief message from a woman he hasn't seen in 20 years changes his life, and quite possibly the lives of others whom he has yet to meet.<br /><br />Harold is a pensioner, recently retired from a lifelong job with a brewery. He lives with his wife of 40 years, Maureen, in a modest home in Kingsbridge on the southern coast of England. Reading the note over his morning tea and toast, he feels compelled to answer. He sets off to mail his inadequate words of encouragement to Queenie Hennessy, an accountant at the brewery who is in a hospice in Berwick Upon Tweed on the Scottish border. As he mentally tries to compose a more satisfactory response, he passes by mailing station after mailing station, and finally decides that he must go see her in person. Convinced that she will hang on until he gets there, he jots a quick postscript that he is on his way, drops the note in the post, and sets out on foot on the 600-mile trek. It is a fine English spring morning, and wearing only his shirt, necktie and slacks, his feet clad in yacht shoes (in America we would call them topsiders), he sets off on his life-changing odyssey.<br /><br />We accompany Harold on his pilgrimage as he suffers blisters and cramps, tries to overcome inclement weather, loses his way, and meets a multitude of kind strangers with stories of their own. We are both amused and dismayed with every agonizing step in the first days, wondering where he will sleep and what he will eat. Harold is not at all worried, but the impracticality of his whimsical decision weighs heavily on his wife, who doesn't know he has disappeared until nightfall when he briefly checks in by phone.<br /><br />Their life story unfolds as they both react to his challenging decision. He encounters many ordinary people along the road in small towns and large, who often fall in beside him. He listens to their stories without judging.He discovers that \\"...It is the smallness of people that filled him with wonder and tenderness, and the loneliness of that too. The world was made up of people putting one foot in front of the other; and a life might appear ordinary simply because the person living it had been doing so for a long time. Harold could no longer pass a stranger without acknowledging the truth that everyone was the same, and also unique; and that was the dilemma of being human. He walked so surely that it was as if all his life he had been waiting to get up from his chair.\\"<br /><br />Harold's journey into his self resonates in our current society. His solitude brings him insight and wisdom, allowing him to believe in his own strengths. His estranged wife, abandoned so unexpectedly, makes a parallel journey of her own as she resolves issues that have plagued them both for half their married life.<br /><br />This small first novel, just over 300 pages, has become an international bestseller and has been longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. Rachel Joyce is an award-winning playwright for BBC Radio 4, and her flawless narrative and dialogue crackle with authenticity and vitality.<br /><br />Reviewed by Roz Shea
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|A group of ex-cons stranded in some wintery forest after a plane crash, become the chosen prey of a savage clan of wolves. Sounds like a no-brainer with plenty of rewarding suspense and bloody, gory action, right? Well the no-brainer part is accurate. This movie falls way way short of what I suspect all of us who sat through this film were expecting. We all saw the preview they kept showing where Neeson's character, in a strategic and yet desperate attempt to gird himself for war with vicious canines, creates his own special version of a \\"knuckle sandwich,\\" and we practically turned blue while holding our breath in anticipation of the spectacular and visceral showdown that we knew was to take place. It would be more brutal than Ali vs. Frazier; it would be wilder than King Kong vs. Godzilla. After all, with today's special effects being what they are, what else were we to expect, right?<br /><br />Well I will not reveal the ending, but I feel it is only fair to let people know that THERE IS NO CLIMACTIC BATTLE.  Not only does this film shamelessly skimp on the goods, but the few attack sequences we do see come off as very jerky with annoying quick edits, the kind that make it impossible to clearly decipher exactly what's going on. Most of the all-male cast are not that interesting. There are a couple of semi-interesting moments of conflict among the men--most notably Liam Neeson and a loudmouth who keeps needling him--but for the most part, I never found myself caring very much about whether these guys lived or died. In fact, I waited for most of them to die as meaningful build-up to the big battle... that we sadly never see.<br /><br />This film was a big disappointment, especially coming on the heels of Liam Neeson's UNKNOWN. This was an engaging setup that never comes close to expl;oring its full potential. The editor (or editors) in charge of putting together the promo previews for this film need to have their foreheads perforated by staple guns. Sure, they putsomething together that no doubt drew crowds into the theaters, but I'd bet all five of my left toes that everyone walked out of that screening feeling cheated, demoralized, deflated.  Don't waste your time on this film. Watch the 1970s animals-on-the-warpath film DAY OF THE ANIMALS instead.

0316066524|5.0|Everything about Infinite Jest is intimidating. Its size, its depth, the end notes (which, unlike regular end notes, are not just optional citations but critical movers of the plot) - everything about this book says, \\"You can't read me.\\" And a significant part of David Foster Wallace's genius is that this intimidation was chosen for effect - it  was essentially done on purpose, and it's what makes this book not just a story, but an experience. And not infrequently a life-changing experience.<br /><br />One of the first things you notice about Infinite Jest - one of the first unmistakable facts about this book that you will encounter - is that it is not a linear narrative. There is some academic speculation about exactly how non-linear the book really is (is it circular? fragmented? a mobius strip?) but suffice it to say it will skip around a great deal at first before giving you enough freebie background information to give the reader a firm footing and propel the story forward.<br /><br />While this may sound very tedious, by the time you get your bearings - say, around pages 90-130 - you will begin to appreciate that Wallace has put you through that fragmented beginning for a reason. This is not drug-induced moon-howling stream of consciousness. This is not structured chaos. It is not beautiful by accident, or despite itself. It is beautiful on purpose.<br /><br />It is somewhat pointless and beside the point to summarize the plot of Infinite Jest, but one piece is critical to understanding what I think Wallace was going for with this, his masterpiece of fiction. The plot centers around a movie - called \\"the samizdat,\\" or Infinite Jest - which, if viewed, turns the viewer into a crazed addict who wants nothing more but to watch it again, and again, and again and again, until they die of starvation/dehydration/exhaustion. Conceptually, Wallace seems to have put a great deal of thought into whether something like that would be physically possible - some kind of filming technique, lens, subject or equipment that could have such an immediate, irreversible and profound effect on anyone who saw it.<br /><br />I don't know this for a fact, but I suspect Wallace also wondered what could be possible to achieve with a novel - what techniques, subjects lenses or equipment could he employ to have an equally, if not identically, profound influence on those who experienced it. I think the heft of the book is a deliberate choice. You are supposed to be a little aware that this thing you're holding weighs three pounds or whatever. I think the disintegrated nature of the plot structure is a deliberate choice, because his nonfiction is straightforward and entertaining. I think the footnotes are meant to piss you off, and you are supposed to be occasionally frustrated with the book. But he does this because it gets you emotionally invested in the book as a mental exercise but also as a physical artifact. It's his way of breaking through that barrier of time and space and making you physically feel something.<br /><br />Another arresting feature of Infinite Jest is the sheer density of ideas that he packs into it. A single page will hatch three or four ideas that you've never thought of before - enough ideas to satisfy an entire chapter of a John Updike novel. And none of them are frivolous, or overwrought, or showing off. They're just new, interesting ideas that would take a normal person about a week to have thought of on their own. It's almost like alien intelligence - it's hard to believe sometimes that this book was composed on yellow legal pads in a one-room studio apartment in Syracuse, NY. But it was.<br /><br />The book is not without flaws, and not everyone will appreciate it. One of the most obvious shortcomings is that Wallace doesn't really write any empathetic female characters. In fact, for all the ideas and thoughts and insight and hyper-intelligence, the characters in Infinite Jest seem to be emotionally transactional with oneanother in a way that seems unrealistic - like it takes place not on earth but on the planet Vulcan.<br /><br />The book also tends to deliver what emotional payload it does have through exploration of the depths of addiction, madness and despair. Not that it's a book of total sadness - and unlike some addiction-themed works of fiction James Frey, it isn't meant to shock or to sell books, I don't think. Instead, this is a profound intellectual explosion that obviously came from the hands of a 30-year old man, and to some extent that's who is going to be able to identify with this book the most.<br /><br />I read Infinite Jest over the course of about three months, which from what I can tell is just little slower than average among those who actually complete the book. That was about a year ago. Many people have said Infinite Jest was a life-changing experience for them - so many that for me to say it now would be a clich&eacute;. So I won't. But I will say that in the year since I completed the book, I have felt on the one hand like I have joined some kind of weird international brotherhood of book-nerd dudes who read and loved Infinite Jest, and on the other very isolated by my inability to fully digest what it had to say.<br /><br />By all means, read (or at least attempt to read) this book. It might not change your life.another in a way that seems unrealistic - like it takes place not on earth but on the planet Vulcan.<br /><br />The book also tends to deliver what emotional payload it does have through exploration of the depths of addiction, madness and despair.

B007UQ5Z1G|4.0|I like this album, I really do. I am one of 'those' LP fans who wish for the Hybrid Theory days and I know that's not going to happen. I came to terms with it. It's a 12 step process. ANYHOW.<br /><br />That being said, I think this album, TO ME, was like having a craving for ice cream but getting frozen yogurt instead. Still pretty good but not quite what you have in mind.<br /><br />I like the album but it sounds a little funky and I can't quite put my finger on why. I've listened to it about 5 or 6 times through now and I really. really. REALLY. want to love it but I can't. If you are a fan of the old LP you may have mixed emotions about it, like me. If you really liked the last album you will probably enjoy it a little more.<br /><br />But, I will say, a SOLID album and worth a buy if you are a LP fan.<br /><br />In the end (no pun intended), whenever I want to hear old LP I listen to old LP and I am still just as happy as the day I first popped in Hybrid Theory. So I guess I don't really need a new-old album anyways!

0307959856|2.0|I'll start off by saying that I was given this book as a gift and would not have picked it out for myself usually. So my review may be a bit biased by a lack of interest to start with. However, I do love Pride and Prejudice and was interested to pick up the book once it was given to me.<br /><br />To start off with the good, this book is a quick read and I did not have the overwhelming need to stop reading it at anytime. I found it to be plain and uninteresting, but not so dreadful that I couldn't finish.<br /><br />That being said, I did not like the writing, plot, or characters. Dialogue was unbelievable and boring. Characters would spend paragraphs describing events and other characters. These long passages in no way added to the action or in fact to the characterization of the speaking individuals. Darcy spoke the same way as Elizabeth, who sounded the same as the maids. The dialogue merely seemed like an escape from having to do any real writing.<br /><br />The plot was outright dull. Nothing really happened and the main conflicts were resolved outside of the focus of the story. The main characters, in fact, took no direct action to resolve any of the conflicts.<br /><br />While I was hoping to read a story about Elizabeth and Darcy, Elizabeth had only a few lines of dialogue and no real part in the book. She was hardly there for most of the chapters and was given a passive role. Darcy's character was completely different than in the Pride and Prejudice books, though he was at least present for the majority of the plot.<br /><br />Other than references to Pride and Prejudice, thrown in with a tactless hand and little relevance to anything happening, this book could have been written about anyone in any time period. All of the character could have been renamed and the book would not have been recognizable as a Pride and Prejudice fiction. It seems that the only reason to add reference to Austen's work in the novel was to sell copies of the mediocre book to unsuspecting fans of Pride and Prejudice.<br /><br />Don't waste your time or money on this book.

B004ZN9YNC|3.0|\\"The Final Cut\\" is the most depressing album Pink Floyd ever recorded -- and with a repertoire that includes \\"The Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"The Wall,\\" that's saying something.<br /><br />It's also not necessarily a bad thing. True art does not necessarily depend on happy conclusions or chuckles or a generally sunny outlook on life -- in fact, many artists' works matter because they address the human condition's darker side, from depression to anger to suffering.<br /><br />In the case of \\"The Final Cut,\\" though, the proceedings can get downright grim. Essentially, it's an anti-war album, which is just fine. It was inspired in part by the Falklands War of the early 1980s, which many in the UK and elsewhere saw as downright gratuitous on Britain's part, as GB sought to retake the rather bleak, sparsely populated Falkland Islands back from the invading Argentinians (writer Jorge Luis Borges characterized the conflict as \\"a fight between two bald men over a comb\\"). The Argentinians may have been the aggressors, but to Waters and other opponents of Margaret Thatcher's conservative government, Great Britain's response was over the top.<br /><br />The other inspiration for the album was the death of Waters' father, Eric Fletcher Waters, in World War II. Unfortunately, Waters had made use of this subject in \\"The Wall,\\" and to many Floyd fans, this loss on the bassist's part -- genuine as it was -- was wearing a little thin as grist for the PF creative mill.<br /><br />My judgment of the album: Lyrically, it has moments of absolute brilliance. An example from the title song:<br /><br />\\"Through the fish-eyed lens of tear stained eyes<br />I can barely define the shape of this moment in time<br />And far from flying high in clear blue skies<br />I'm spiraling down to the hole in the ground where I hide.\\"<br /><br />And from \\"The Gunner's Dream\\":<br /><br />\\"Floating down through the clouds<br />Memories come rushing up to meet me now.<br />In the space between the heavens<br />and in the corner of some foreign field<br />I had a dream.\\"<br /><br />Waters' gifts as a lyricist are undeniable. Rarely can rock lyrics be quoted out of context of the music without seeming a bit silly, but on \\"The Final Cut,\\" Waters had reached a point at which his lyrical skills were approaching those of Bob Dylan.<br /><br />Musically, \\"The Final Cut\\" is far less satisfying. Essentially, it sounds like a warmed-over \\"The Wall,\\" with many of the musical themes echoing that album. And the sound effects! On many Floyd records, including the classic \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" and \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" the FX played a crucial part, helping to underscore the songs' lyrical themes. Unfortunately, \\"The Final Cut\\" is just awash in them, to the point that the band was teetering on the edge of self-parody.<br /><br />Finally, Waters was the lead vocalist on all tracks except \\"Not Now John,\\" and Waters' style over the years leading up to this album had grown increasingly strident. Guitarist David Gilmour always had shouldered a large part of the vocal parts, but this time, he's barely present.<br /><br />Fortunately, his guitar parts still shine as one of the band's defining elements. Drummer Nick Mason, though, gets booted from the drum chair on at least one song, \\"Two Suns in the Sunset\\" (played by session drummer Andy Newmark), and rumor over the years has had it that he doesn't play on several other tracks, either.<br /><br />\\"The Final Cut\\" will never be one of my favorite Floyd albums. Gilmour, who has criticized it over the years, is right -- the music simply isn't up to the high standards the Floyd had set for itself. But the album's lyrics and strong concept do give it considerable merit.r />and in the corner of some foreign field<br />I had a dream.\\"<br /><br />Waters' gifts as a lyricist are undeniable.

B006RUJST6|5.0|All I can say is wow! I was doubtful when I seen the price tag on this book, but nonetheless I bought it for something to read whilst being bored visiting my parents. Unfortunately, my parents didn't get much face time. Once I opened the book I was completely enthralled. It took me 6 hours to finish this book and I immediately went back and purchased the next one. Everything else was put on hold so I could read these books.<br />I fell in love instantly. I can only compare it to Stephenie Meyer's twilight series. They are the only other books I can honestly say I could and have read more than once and will always have space on my shelf.
B000002C1W|3.0|\\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" is not even CLOSE to being my favorite Pink Floyd album, but it was a very important one for the band.<br /><br />Bassist Roger Waters had left in acrimony after 1983's \\"The Final Cut.\\" Waters had fired keyboardist Rick Wright at the end of \\"The Wall\\" sessions, though Wright played during the short concert tour that followed. That reduced the band to guitarist David Gilmour and drummer Nick Mason. They insisted they were going to continue as Pink Floyd, but Waters considered the band creatively spent, and didn't want them to use the Pink Floyd name. He went so far as to sue them over it, and the legal actions and counter-actions reached epic proportions, with both sides also airing out their differences in the American and UK music press.<br /><br />In the midst of all this, Gilmour and Mason brought Wright back into the PF fold, further annoying Waters (who had claimed Wright hadn't been contributing enough to the band, creatively speaking). At any rate, when the dust all settled, it wasn't really any of Waters' business anymore -- he had left the band. Gilmour and Mason, the courts decided, were free to carry on as Pink Floyd. Wright was initially brought back as a salaried employee instead of a full-fledged member.<br /><br />And despite all the distractions, the band eventually got around to recording \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" My judgment of the album: Musically, it's very good -- it is much more \\"Floydian\\" in its sound, with all the snappy guitars and lush keyboard sounds -- than \\"The Final Cut\\" had been. Lyrically, though, it doesn't stand up to Pink Floyd's best work. Roger Waters had taken over all the lyric writing for \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and also had penned all lyrics for \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" \\"Animals,\\" \\"The Wall\\" and \\"The Final Cut.\\"<br /><br />For \\"AMLOR,\\" Gilmour took on some of the lyric chores himself and also brought in songwriting partners such as Anthony Moore. The results were mixed -- songs such as \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away,\\" both featuring lyrical contributions from Moore, were quite emotionally effective and resonant. Other songs -- \\"The Dogs of War,\\" \\"Sorrow\\" -- didn't add up to much.<br /><br />The album's musical lushness was a return to form, but it was unfortunate that Mason and Wright's involvement was minimal. Wright was brought back only after the album was well along in the recording process, and plays on just six of the ten tracks. Mason appears on seven of them, but plays drums on just three -- his other contributions are limited to drum machine, percussion and a spoken vocal. Mason was going through difficult marital problems at the time, and, according to Gilmour, both Mason and Wright had developed confidence problems thanks in part to Waters' withering criticisms over the years. On several tracks here, then, they're not present at all or are underrepresented, their places being taken by the likes of session musicians Bill Payne and Jon Carin (keyboards) and Carmine Appice and Jim Keltner (drums).<br /><br />The situation led to accusations that this was nothing but a Gilmour solo album released under the Pink Floyd name in order to rake in the bucks from fans.

B000T05R8Q|4.0|\\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" was Pink Floyd's debut album, and the man behind the guitar and main vocal mic at the time was a pleasant, charming fellow named Roger \\"Syd\\" Barrett. He wrote most of the material, and his songs, unlike later PF songs that made good use of the melancholy and the menacing, were rooted in whimsy and English folklore.<br /><br />This is, of course, an essential album for the Floyd completist, and also will be of interest to those with a strong interest in the band, especially in how it sounded before Barrett blew his mind in a haze of drugs, most notably LSD. Barrett already seemed prone to depressive episodes -- and when a person like that starts gobbling acid, the results tend not to be good.<br /><br />Barrett performs on a few songs on the follow-up to this album, \\"A Saucerful of Secrets,\\" but by that time, guitarist/vocalist David Gilmour was also on board. For a brief time, the Floyd was a five-piece band, but the idea of having Barrett mostly stay home and write songs -- a la Brian Wilson's situation with the Beach Boys at one time -- didn't work out. Bassist Roger Waters, drummer Nick Mason and keyboardist Rick Wright were all, to varying degrees, frustrated with Barrett's erratic behavior.<br /><br />But those troubles all came to the fore AFTER \\"Piper\\" was written and recorded. Barrett did make a couple of solo albums after his PF days, but they are rambling, disjointed affairs, very much an acquired taste, if the taste for them can be acquired at all. \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is his masterpiece.<br /><br />Barrett's \\"Astronomy Domine\\" kicks off the album, and it's a small masterpiece of its own -- a fairly concise slice of \\"space rock\\" complete with trippy interplanetary lyrics and some very fine vocals by Barrett and Wright.

Toc H.\\" and \\"Interstellar Overdrive.\\" I've never been able to make much sense of the former, but the latter is a long, driving instrumental that goes on for too long but definitely has its moments.

Until recently, the stereo mix was always my preference, but spending time with this deluxe edition finally made me change my mind -- the single-channel mix is just so up and in your face that it has an energy level untouched by any other version.

B008BYXQJY|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS GREAT!!!  I loved it all from start to finish!  If you like PAYPHONE, then you most certainly should enjoy the rest of the album.  Stand out tracks for me are<br /><br />ONE MORE NIGHT<br />DAYLIGHT<br />THE MAN WHO NEVER LIED<br />LOVE SOMEBODY<br />SAD<br /><br />This is my first Maroon 5 album I've bought, and definitely been jamming out nonstop to it.
B000002A3T|4.0|\\"The Division Bell\\" is Pink Floyd's final studio album, or at least it is as of this writing in 2012 -- and with the death of keyboardist Rick Wright in 2008, it's likely there never will be a follow-up.<br /><br />As such, it stands as a very fine conclusion to the band's long, (inter)stellar ;) career. There are some tremendous songs here -- \\"Poles Apart,\\" \\"Take It Back,\\" \\"Keep Talking,\\" \\"Lost for Words\\" and \\"High Hopes\\" are practically addictive -- and the band sounds far more like a band than on the preceding album, \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\"<br /><br />On that album, guitarist David Gilmour was prominently featured, but Wright and drummer Nick Mason, for various reasons, were not; session drummers and keyboardists played many of the parts. Bassist Roger Waters had left the band after \\"The Final Cut\\"; the bass parts on \\"Momentary\\" were covered by Tony Levin.<br /><br />Mason and Wright perform on all the tracks on \\"The Division Bell,\\" though, and the album was born partly out of jam sessions they enjoyed with Gilmour on his houseboat/recording studio, the Astoria. And while Levin is a great bassist, the Floyd by this time had found a better fit -- a young, incredibly talented player named Guy Pratt. Like Levin, he's a fluid, accomplished player, but his tone is a little more aggressive -- perfect for the Pink Floyd sound.<br /><br />I would not rank this album as high as \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" or \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" the two greatest albums in the Pink Floyd canon. Perhaps even \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Animals\\" rate somewhat higher for me. But \\"The Division Bell\\" stands up, over time, far better than, say, \\"Atom Heart Mother,\\" \\"Ummagumma,\\" \\"More\\" or \\"A Saucerful of Secrets.\\"<br /><br />Part of the reason \\"The Division Bell\\" succeeds is the songwriting -- a great improvement in that department over \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason.\\" Gilmour writes or co-writes on 10 of the 11 songs here, while Wright has five songwriting credits.<br /><br />Perhaps the only major misstep here was to have Wright take the lead vocals on \\"Wearing the Inside Out.\\" It's his only lead vocal on the album, and unfortunately, his voice by this time just wasn't up to the task.<br /><br />The final track here, \\"High Hopes,\\" is as haunting and darkly beautiful as just about anything the Floyd ever recorded. Clocking in at just over eight and a half minutes, it features a church bell ringing on the fade-in over a sparse piano part played by second keyboardist Jon Carin; the rest of the band then comes in, including Gilmour on vocals and Wright on synthesizers. The lyrics -- which are about the inevitable disappointments, regrets and \\"slow decay\\" that aging brings -- yet express the lingering magic that living can bring, even if memories have become rather more powerful and meaningful than they should be:<br /><br />\\"The grass was greener<br />The light was brighter<br />The taste was sweeter<br />The nights of wonder<br />With friends surrounded<br />The dawn mist glowing<br />The water flowing<br />The endless river<br /><br />Forever and ever...\\"<br /><br />Everyone who's lived a reasonable amount of time has felt such loss, the terrible realization that the past can, at times, feel more vivid than the present. But we also know it's an illusion. According to one old saying, youth is wasted on the young; our energies and bodies burn bright, but it is wisdom we lack. Wisdom, though, comes at a price -- the boundaries of one's life drawing in, the realization that we have made mistakes and cannot correct them; even if we are happy in later life, we might wonder at times what we would be had we chosen, at certain key points, different paths.<br /><br />Gilmour, with lyrical help from Polly Samson, whom he would marry the year \\"The Division Bell\\" was released, perfectly captures these feelings. As the last song on the last studio album by Pink Floyd, it needed to be rich in scope and right in its execution ... and indeed the whole band plays beautifully on it. What a way to end such a magnificent career.at a way to end such a magnificent career.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|I can't get enough of Emeli, this album has classic written all over it!  Emeli is an amazing lyricist, her songs have meaning.  Her voice is very versatile, at times reminding me of Beyonce, then Leona Lewis, but mostly just Emeli Sande.  Every song is great and it takes you on an emotional ride.  Piano ballads, heartfelt lyrics really help make this my favorite album this year, hands down!  This is dare I say, better than Adele's album.  :X
B008M34INW|3.0|Get The Gringo is a Mexican noir that tries to skate along in a Tarrantino fashion with whimsical violence and quirky one-liners, but clashes with elements of serious drama that hinder the pacing of an otherwise enjoyable film.
0345803485|1.0|I started out seriously against this book a long time ago simply because it was based on the concept of a fanfiction that was free then ported it into a paid media.  But, I feel bad continually debasing a book based on my own outside impressions without actually reading said book so I went out and I bought it, and I now realize how accurate they really were. The book is very poorly written from the standpoint of it's handle on the English language and grammar in general, it was just abhorred. I honestly believe that no publishing company ever actually edited this book and if they did I seriously hope that the editors that worked on this book you were fired long ago.<br /><br />I believe many of the reviews thus far off cover the fact that how many words were repeated way too many times.  It baffles me that this could be such a popular book that was actually advertised on nationally syndicated television programs, it is just a travesty. This is not mommy porn, this is not good writing, this isn't even good smut, this is one author's big break that I seriously hope will not be considerably ruin the reputation of the BDSM community or any alternative communities simply because it was the only book that got recognition early on because of its large twilight fan base.<br /><br />In case it isn't clear enough I do not recommend this book to anyone for any reason other than those academics trying to decide where we have failed as a culture.

0345803485|1.0|I actually haven't read the book (I know, I know), BUT I have read enough reviews and articles that feature some of the finer , um, plot points and excerpts from the story to know that it is not worth reading.  If you are looking for erotica, there are better choices out there.  If you are looking for a well-written story, please look somewhere else.<br /><br />On a separate note, I stumbled across a parody called Fifty Shades of Brown by Melanie Jones and have read that.  It is absolutely hilarious, and I'd suggest just reading that over Fifty Shades of Grey.
B005FISC52|5.0|This was such a great series. A lot happened is this season, and I was extremely sad to see it end. I don't like the fact that they ended it with no real opportunity to extend the show in the future, but there are ways to do so. I really hope they do. I loved this!
B005D9MUWY|2.0|I watched the reviews of this program and I thought it was going to be the next best thing after sliced bread. I jumped right in and got the paid version and I was really happy with it until they did the last English update. Then everything went wrong. It replaced the word \\"computer\\" with the word \\"uterus\\" causing a bit of confusion for me. It takes about 5 attempts to a simple \\"'s\\" on the end of a word and wants to capitalize words for no reason.<br />You have to be really careful with this app as it can cause you great embarrassment if you are not careful when typing your messages (oddly this is one of the options when you set it up) It seems to assume I want to start every sentence with \\"I\\" or \\"And\\" for some strange reason. I have spoken to another user who is also using the Samsung Galaxy Note and he to is having similar problems.<br />I really hope these problems will be corrected with the next language update.

B004LWZWC4|5.0|I know that the movie did not receive good reviews, but for some reason I just really like it.  It is one of my favorites and I can watch it over and over.  Maybe it's just the clean-cut enjoyment of the plot, nothing violent and no gratuitous sex scenes.  It spoke of examining what our priorities are in life and how each one has to decide what that means to them.  Yes, it was simplistic treatment of a life-long pursuit, but watch the movie without any preconceived ideas and I think that you will enjoy it.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book as I have all of Ken Follett's books. I Love they way he weaves interesting fictional characters and stories through historical events. Unfortunately, I did not know much about WWI and this was a fun way to get a history lesson.

1400049628|3.0|When I read the other reviews for the Zombie Survival Guide, I grew increasingly excited about my purchase.  Knowing that Max Brooks is the son of one of my favorite comedic icons served only to enhance that excitement.  As I pored over the first few pages of the book though I found myself a bit perplexed.  The humor that I was anticipating rarely surfaced and seemed at odds with an assertion that everything the author was saying was in fact true.  The problem deepened as I continued reading and I found myself having a hard time reconciling my feelings about the book; it seemed to be caught in the grip of an existential crisis that reminded me a lot of a book that I had read about Seinfeld and Philosophy.  Both seemed to have comedic aspirations and yet neither fully embraced the angle of \\"this is meant to be a lighthearted, funny book.\\"  In fact, each time humor surfaced, it was almost immediately repressed with a reminder that, \\"this is all based on fact.\\"<br /><br />If Mr. Brooks intended to portray his work as one of complete non-fiction, he could have done so without incorporating so many obviously ridiculous or inaccurate references.  Many of the \\"true story\\" moments are insipid because there's no real heart or commitment to them; it's as if he's making a reference to a time when the sky was purple instead of blue--making an incredible, extraordinary claim but doing nothing to back it up.  Part of the problem stems from the repeated assertion that Solanum (the cause of becoming undead, according to Mr. Brooks) is in fact an actual virus.  I was often left scratching my head asking, \\"Is he serious?\\" with many of the instances in which the author tried to beat the reader over the head with his staunch faux-belief in the fictitious root of zombies.<br /><br />Ultimately, my issue with the book is simply not knowing what to make of it.  On the one hand, it is a useful survival guide of sorts but it would be better reading if it was more clearly tongue-in-cheek (orotherwise).  Instead, it vacillates somewhere along the middle-ground, never taking residence on one side of the fence for too long.  At times funny (but not funny enough), at times serious (oftentimes too serious), the text never coagulated into something cohesive for me.  Couple this with the thinly veiled political jabs that are thrown either at the American government or people (a quote from p. 161 serves as but one example: \\"Always keep in mind how spoiled Americans are in comparison to the rest of the planet.\\") and you have a book that just doesn't know what to do with itself.  If it's meant to be funny and lighthearted, then let it be those things; if it's meant to be a serious take on an otherwise impossible scenario (or an outlet for the author's socio-political views), then let it be that instead.  Unfortunately, I just never clicked with the book and am left wanting more.
B000002B35|5.0|Cynics -- and Roger Waters fanatics, if that's not redundant -- didn't have to work hard to find reasons to hate \\"Pulse\\" when it was released in 1995. It was a live album recorded during a very lucrative tour following on the heels of a multiplatinum studio album -- exactly what the Floyd had done in 1987 and 1988 with \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" which was followed by the tour-documenting \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder.\\"<br /><br />But Floyd fans, many of them, were delighted. For one thing, \\"Pulse\\" was a better album than \\"Delicate Sound.\\" For another, it was more honest -- \\"Delicate Sound actually had included a number of studio-overdub fixes, while \\"Pulse\\" had very few.<br /><br />\\"Pulse\\" also included a live version of \\"Dark Side of the Moon,\\" and a good one at that -- faithful to the original yet allowing the live band to stretch out a little on songs such as \\"Money.\\" The version of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" was far superior to the one on \\"Delicate Sound\\"; both versions are far shorter than the original but \\"Delicate had cut the epic song to the bone.<br /><br />The Floyd also had the luxury of cherry-picking the best songs from \\"The Division Bell\\" and \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\"; the lineup of newer songs included \\"Learning to Fly,\\" \\"Keep Talking\\" and \\"High Hopes.\\"<br /><br />This version of \\"Pulse\\" is the non-blinking one. I had the good fortune to buy one of the early copies with the red, flashing LED light embedded in the spine of the CD box. I've had to replace the batteries several times over the years, but as of this writing in 2012, the light is still doing its thing, blinking away on my CD shelf. What can I say? It kind of ties the room together -- when it's dark. ;)

B0000026NC|4.0|If I want to listen to a Pink Floyd live performance, I usually go to \\"Pulse\\" or the four live tracks the band included on \\"Ummagumma.\\" However, once in awhile I'll pull \\"Delicate Sound of Thunder\\" from the shelf, and I'm always glad I did.<br /><br />Recorded and released in support of the Floyd's \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason,\\" this album features some of the better tunes from that just-OK album; guitarist David Gilmour picks out \\"Learning to Fly,\\" \\"On the Turning Away\\" and a few other good songs from that record -- and, in several cases, successfully transforms them into stadium anthems without trashing their melodicism.<br /><br />Well-chosen, too, are the classic tracks. Especially nice: A new version of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond,\\" with a revamped vocal arrangement that compensates quite well for the lead vocals of bassist Roger Waters, who'd left the group after 1983's \\"The Final Cut.\\" And Gilmour's extended guitar soloing on \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Run Like Hell\\" is very energetic.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|The production design was great. The acting was good. That being said, even thoug it follows the ERB novels somewhat, it isn't as good a story. Only in Hollywood would writers think they could improve on a sci-fi legend. The actors were really good. I really like Taylor Kitsch. I think he is a very accomplished actor. He does an excellent job here. He is subtle where he needs to be subtle and over the top where it is needed. He is an incredibly handsome guy. He is NOT John Carter. ERB was very specific about what he looked like. This isn't it. Ms. Collins comes much closer in terms of physical description than does Mr. Kitsch. All that being said, it is a good movie for what it is. It moves at a pretty fast pace. My recommendation is to read the actual books, not comics. You will not dislike the movie. In fact, it will help you to understand the overall concept. I read ERB voraciously when I was a kid. After seeing this, I reread the first 5 books in the John Carter series. You cannot improve on good literature. Buy the movie. You'll love it. Buy the books. You'll love them more.

B0089LT8Y6|5.0|It's been four years since Testament's comeback album [[ASIN:B0012E6R3W The Formation of Damnation]]. If you enjoyed that one for whatever reasons, be prepared to be blown away by Dark Roots of Earth.<br /><br />The new album finds the band crafting a sonic thrash metal masterpiece, putting more emphasis on extended melodic guitar solos, intricate arrangements, powerful rhythm work, and excellent vocals. The songs are complex yet very easy to enjoy at the same time because the band has amassed so many immortal melodies this time around. The songs are also more homogenous but varied, involving plenty of complex passages laced with melodic twin guitar harmonies, fiery lead riffs, and stomping rhythmic anchors. Chuck Billy utilizes his full spectrum of vocal talents here. He goes for the clean singing as well as his instantly recognizable throaty delivery that borders on roaring and screaming.<br /><br />The rhythmic tandem on the album is amazing. Gene Hoglan returns to the band after 1997's [[ASIN:B000Z1LOBI Demonic]] and puts in an awesome performance. His drum tone is full and organic. His style is quite different from Paul Bostaph's; he engages in more intricate fills and even adds some twisted blast beats to the mix on songs like \\"Native Blood\\" and \\"True American Hate,\\" two of the album's most aggressive numbers. Hoglan grooves and thrashes with ease, and the addition of blast beats certainly lends the pieces an extra dimension. Greg Christian's bass tone is perhaps just about the best tone he has ever had (thanks to Andy Sneap's meticulous production). The song \\"A Day in the Death\\" might be the album's highpoint from a compositional standpoint. It is written around a gritty bass figure that opens the piece and drives it to its ultimate climax, in part due to the vaguely Egyptian-themed solo by Skolnick and thought-provoking lyrics.<br /><br />Guitarists Eric Peterson and Alex Skolnick are possibly the genre's most powerful duo. Peterson is responsible for churning out his trademark riffs; they are sharp and snappy, and have a lasting impact. There probably is not another rhythm guitarist that shapes the sound of the songs so profoundly. That noted, Peterson also proves he is equally adept at soloing and lays down several lead solos to contrast and complement his partner.<br /><br />Alex Skolnick is one of a kind. Even during the blisteringly fast tempos alternating between Hoglan's dazzling fills and attacks and Peterson's bruising riffing, Skolnick retains his unique style. His arpeggios remain surprisingly musical and articulate, and his soloing sends shivers down the spine. At times, his crystal clean tone and legato riffs carry a Van Halen flavour to them; they are so precise and well integrated into the songs. It is this feat that sets the man apart from just about any guitarist in thrash metal. He is the best.<br /><br />At times, parts of the album sound like a cross between the previous album and [[ASIN:B000002ITM The Ritual]] due to Skonick's unique harmonic minor solos. The inclusion of a seven-plus-minute quasi-ballad, \\"Cold Embrace,\\" may be a turn-off for some fans in that they may feel it is too long and breaks up the flow of the otherwise relentlessly heavy disc. However, the way the song builds from the blues-tinged acoustic guitars to a soaring number is staggering. It is one of the album's standout pieces to these ears.<br /><br />Andy Sneap's production is sharp and threatening. His mix is so punchy it moves air, and it does not hide a single note, which results in Skolnick's solos coming through more effectively and sounding more organic.<br /><br />The deluxe edition of the CD contains a number of cover tunes. Scorpions' \\"Animal Magnetism\\" is turned into a sinister piece with the whole focus being on creating an evil atmosphere. Iron Maiden's \\"Powerslave\\" features a killer solo and amazing drumming, but I'm not really too keen on the vocals here. Queen's \\"Dragon Attack\\" finds the band really jamming itout; it has a cool live vibe to it. I don't see the point of the bonus version of \\"Throne of Thrones,\\" as it seems to be the same song with a 30-second solo attached to the end. The album version is more compact and would work better in a live setting.<br /><br />This is probably the best thrash metal disc I've heard this year.out; it has a cool live vibe to it.

B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This has to be the most universal \\"romance\\" of all time.  Unless you married your childhood sweetheart, some line will hit you on a deep level.  It's about romantic connections, separations, decisions, circumstances, regrets, and hopes.  Everybody is afraid of losing out on their soul mate.  Everybody is afraid of being trapped in a cold marriage.  Why do we pretend we're not?  The last 15 minutes is what I would call a \\"quiet nuclear bomb\\" that should touch even the most cynical person.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read enough of the sample sections of the first book to have become bored and frustrated with the repetitive and amateurish writing of this book. It began as fan fiction and should have just stayed that way. I am appalled that such poor writing was rewarded with, not only publishing, but by becoming a best-seller.<br /><br />In reading some of the other reviews, I couldn't take them too seriously when they liked the writing because the writers of those reviews were terrible writers.<br /><br />I just do not see the appeal, let alone \\"romance\\", of a really stupid girl getting into an abusive relationship and thinking she deserves it. What a terrible message to send to women everywhere.<br /><br />But really, all it took was the reading samples. The writing is absolutely dreadful. I also wish there were a way to give a negative number of stars. People should save their money and time.

B008BDZP3K|5.0|I came round late to Frank and it was this album that opened my perception to his work so suddenly; like an endearing slap in the face.<br />Many regard this as his best work, but I'm not sure that this is an easy conclusion when faced with more than sixty different Frank Zappa albums of extraordinary variety and style and varying degrees of musical and lyrical depth.<br />Also, his lyrics sometimes famously repel people whilst charming and amusing others; one person's upset/another person's insight.<br />Frank regarded his whole musical output, including live performances and even interviews, as a sort of continuum of themes connecting everything and creating one body of work.<br />That said, this is possibly the studio album that I find most musically profound...possibly.<br /><br />'Peaches En Regalia', the highly regarded first track, is beautiful, musically startling and maybe even a little funny.<br /><br />'Willie the Pimp' puts an unlikely balance into the album (it should stick out like a sore thumb, but somehow does not) with Captain Beefheart's (Don Van Vliet) Howlin' Wolf-esque vocals setting the tone amongst a relatively stripped-back instrumentation of drums and percussion, gritty guitar, bass, a wonderfully ragged violin riff from the great Don \\"Sugarcane\\" Harris, and piano, before Mr. Zappa enters with astonishing lead guitar; it always seems fresh- Frank Zappa must be one of the most underrated popular guitarists as well as composers.<br /><br />'Son of Mr. Green Genes' allows us to briefly catch our breath, before lurching back into Frank's tremendous axe-manship and kaleidoscopic instrumentation from the absurdly talented Ian Underwood- Underwood is all over this album like a benevolent musical rash.<br /><br />'Little umbrellas' is a relatively short, eastern-like dirge that swings along sparingly before the ultra-saxophonic release of 'The Gumbo Variations' that has Ian making sounds with his saxophone that some less-fun folk may, back in the day, have wanted to censor; really spectacular stuff and some powerful violin and guitar solos, too.<br /><br />That reminds me: this was released in 1969! I mean, most of the music I listen to is from the towering musical decades of the sixties and seventies, but the production, clarity and innovation of 'Hot Rats' is still a little extraordinary.<br /><br />'It Must Be a Camel'. Whether or not you agree with the title's hypothesis this is a fine closing track to this remarkable instrumental (except Beefheart's brief vocals) album. It is relaxed, but with strange layers of timing and sound that seem to let us know that, while this is goodbye for now, Frank will be back...<br /><br />Note: The 2012 reissue of Hot Rats is the remastered version originally done for the vinyl release of 2008 by Bernie Grundman, which is from the original analog master and is more true to the original vinyl mix of 1969 as opposed to the controversial 1987 mix of the Ryko CD reissue- although many feel each version has its own unique positives & negatives or special individual attributes when the mixes are compared.<br /><br />The original mix has more definition on the bass and drums (they are more acoustically present due to the absence of the digital reverb that was added to the Ryko remix), but contains a shorter version of 'The Gumbo Variations' and Frank's guitar solo on 'Willie the Pimp' is faded in and out somewhat, whereas the Ryko remix has it all in and very up front.<br />So, opinions are divided, often depending on what one is used to. But one thing, in my opinion, is for certain, and that is that both versions contain an extraordinary album of music.y, have wanted to censor; really spectacular stuff and some powerful violin and guitar solos, too.<br /><br />That reminds me: this was released in 1969!

B00000J7JO|5.0|I got this as a gift for my sister, and she loved it! It came plastic wrapped and the box wasn't dented in the shipping process.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Kids.are having a ball and so am I.  fun trying to get more games.  keeps asking me to download games from tootle aps which I like but the kindle isn't compatable at this time
B000067CPX|5.0|Great album (which I already knew) that arrived in great condition! As described, great seller, no problems, easy transaction. I bought this as a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it!!!!
B00792EGES|5.0|The bluray is a most have for any Alterbridge fan. Excellent setting, and their is a difference in about 7 songs that are not in their previous Bluray/DVD concert.<br /><br />So get it!!
B002MGIIZE|5.0|Perfect condition, already knew it was a movie I loved. The director's cut, as always, is so much better than any other version. Perfectly intake, box not crushed in shipping process.
B007I1Q4W2|5.0|I liked this film a lot. Yes, it was slow, and no, it didn't have shot after shot of bloody battles, decapitations, splattering jugulars, or severed spurting limbs. But the movie actually tried to take the genre seriously, exploring the main character's real pain from losing his family, and his doubts about his own goodness, or the worthiness of humanity, after having witnessed (and participated in) true horror on earth. The acting is very good overall (excepting the man playing General Williams, ugh) and the cinematography and forest setting is exquisite. Really worth a look. Just don't expect a mindless horror movie.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Great movie (which I already knew) that arrived in great condition! As described, great seller, no problems, easy transaction. I bough this as a christmas gift for someone and they loved it!!!!!
B0068MNO4S|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I was surprised that the premise involved such historic people of Great Britain, than Shakespeare himself.  Never imaged this was the real story. The ending is good. Very interesting, and you will enjoy it, even if you are not a fan of William Shakespeare or Great Britain.  Rys Ifans is very good as well. He is such a versatile actor.
034580404X|1.0|I have not idea why this trilogy was made out to be so great. I literally quit about 150 pages into the first book. The way the book is written you'd think it was a middle school student who wrote it. About every other sentence is five words or fewer. It was really hard to read. If you are into trilogies and want to be immersed in what you are reading, I suggest Hunger Games.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|One of the BEST flicks I have seen in a long time! With all the build up over the years form the individual characters movies I had high hopes for this movie and it TOTALLY lived up to them!<br />I can't wait for the sequel!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|is a very good game,  interesting and it had a very intelligent design. I am addicted to it.<br />you can interact with all the characters of the movie, there are stories and you can pass hours playing it.<br />my kids Aldo love it,  so children and adults can have fun.
B0080R7O7W|5.0|Michael Jackson at his best as always. I Just Cant Stop Loving you of course is a pop classic with some of the best vocals ever put to record, and also if anyone has the chance to get a copy of the CD single that features an amazing demo Dont Be Messin Round. The amazing quality of the \\"Demo\\" Dont Be Messin Round which blew me away. Michael Jacksons home made, unfinished demos make todays artists over produced, low quality music sound amatuerish and 2nd class compared to even an unheard of MJ demo that he considered not good enough even to finish for himself let alone the BAD album. Masterclass at its best. Long live the King Of Pop. Miss u always MJ.
0446530573|5.0|My boyfriend is Italian and made me buy this book to learn how cook real Italian dishes, everything I made from the book turned out amazing .... One of the best cook books I own.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game has plenty of entertainment for all ages, and plenty to keep the kids busy and fun for the aunts who get so competitive with each other lol ;) have fun trying to beat all the games...some are challenging while others are just simply awesome games for all.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It has good weather updates, good satellite,  and runs just fine. It is especially awesome since its free! There are no problems with it crashing or anything else.
B003L77GRO|5.0|The DVD was awesome.  We watched it in two days and are now waiting for August 14th for season 6.
B000VLOKQI|4.0|This is how a musical documentary should be : to the point ,excellent and recent interviews ,and some live-clips that give you a good idea just how good this band was.Also very good is how the bandmembers came together in the fifties/early fifties.Recommended.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Use frequently. I can know what's taking up a lot of battery use. Plus u can set color. Good looking out
B003UESJH4|5.0|Didn't think I would like this so much. Superb acting by great actors. Wonderful story. Definitely one to watch again.
B008KW43TE|5.0|I grew up in the 90's when En Vogue, Genuwine, Blackstreet, K-CI & JoJo, etc. were around. This new album by Frank Ocean of the popular group OFWGKTA (Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All)is by far my favorite summer album and has been on repeat in my car ever since I purchsed it. Ocean's mix of rap and singing seems effortless and the lyrics to most of his songs are relatable. The very popular single 'Thinkin bout you' which has been covered by numerous people on YouTube, is my favorite tragic love song filled with nostalgia, taking me back to my middle school days. I highly recommend this album if you love R&B, Rap, or if you just love good music...
B0054JZC6E|4.0|kind of fun. the games r kinds of boring tho. yelps bulimia jubilee jog Hmong hug Gui small utmost Uta j
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the second book more than the first one..more of a story rather than racy S&M. You find out more a about Christian's past and good lead up.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|How can a series so inexpensive and unknown be so great? Hugh Howey is a great author; these books are expertly written. The story is captivating, every detail of this foreign world and way of life is brilliant. A must-read.
0441020712|4.0|I just finished this book and thought I'd give a short review while things were still fresh in my mind.<br /><br />*** very light spoilers ***<br /><br />First off, I thought the plot was compelling enough to drive me to finish this book. However, things start off pretty slow, so be patient. But, I think the end was worth the effort to push ahead. The bit with the elephants was a bit much as others have stated. Also, I'm not sure about the African continent being a big player in the  world. But, anything is possible. In the end, the author must create a reason to keep me reading and I think this was accomplished.<br /><br />Second, I think the characters could have been developed a little more. I didn't feel a strong connection to them and wouldn't have been too upset if something bad happened to them.<br /><br />Third, was the complexity of the story. There are quite a few characters and places to keep track of. Fortunately, the author does a good job of gently reminding the reader of previously introduced characters. But, the reader definitely has to pay attention.<br /><br />Fourth, the science is excellent. No faster than light travel. No instant communication over vast distances. Real spaceships accelerating at realistic speeds. The technology in the future seem plausible and reasonable. I did like how the different destinations had different rules/governments.<br /><br />Fifth, the ending leaves some unfinished business. I suppose a followup book will be forthcoming to continue the story. So, don't expect everything to be tied up in a nice bow. There are still some unanswered questions.<br /><br />Lastly, I think the book could have been a little shorter. The 500 pages could have been done in 350-400 pages, I think, without any significant loss to the plot.<br /><br />Overall, I think \\"Blue Remembered Earth\\" is worth the effort to read. Just pay attention to the characters, places, and events and you will be rewarded.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is so fun!!!  It starts out easy but that gives you a confidence that is entertainingly knocked down once you get into the higher levels!  So awesome that it's free!
B007TR1R22|1.0|Can we spell formula love triangle?<br />The plot reduced to it's basics is about an insecure young woman who marries an older wealthy/status endowed insecure man who marries her because she's an attractive, somewhat intelligent, trophy wife. She in turn also attracts the attention of an insecure younger man who loves her for - guess why? - her attractive physical appearance and of course therefore sex, otherwise she's a tossable. With so much insecurity floating about, and each of the three just playing the field for what they can get out of it, we have the usual overly melodramatic scenes. Yes, she decides to end it all -  and fails.<br /><br />Dramatic queen awards:<br />The acting was good as far as \\"let's see who can be the most dramatic queen\\", but beyond that nothing of note.<br />The music in itself was classically sound but as the major vehicle to enhance mood it also deserves the \\"most dramatic queen\\" award for over-the-top. However, the award goes to the prolonged periods of silence for effect while the audience gets to stare at the appropriate facial expression for interminably long periods of time.<br />Proof: One six minute stretch had about 16 exchanges between the wife and younger lover which is average of 23 seconds between one person speaking and the other speaking. The vast majority were between 3 and 6 words in length. I thought it was Japanese Kabuki except there they at least move around vs. in this case lots of standing and looking at each other.<br /><br />The movie would have been very successful as a Victorian Period stage performance.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This program is wonderful.  I love the many different things I can do. I was it for my math classes, as well as my everyday tasks. It is very useful. I love this program.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|All my younger female friends said....\\"you have to read these books,  they are best books I have read in years, I read all 3 over a weekend\\". I want my money back!  What a load of crap.  Think of reading letters to the editors in any adult magazine with much worse grammar and never-ending.  How many times can you say the same thing over and over again.  There is no plot, just some sex with some naughty sex, until book 3. Here is my synopsis; virgin, hardly even kissed, College Graduate (YEAH RIGHT) meets one of the richest men in the world.  He is a freak.  Wants to get his freak on with her.  She says no! He falls in love with her because she says no.  (We are now at the end of book 2)  and sex sex sex with some freak sex on occasion, all in between.  I suppose the joke is on me.  My money is now in the writers bank account.  The best part of this horribly written trilogy? The end of it.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's hard to stop playing this game. One is never bored; I actually feel my heartbeat racing, as I push toward another personal record. This is by far the best game I've tried on the Kindle Fire.
0812993292|5.0|&#34;The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry: A Novel&#34; is a very different type of book for me to read. The idea of a modern Canterbury Tales caught my interest in inducing me to try to book. I am so very glad I did read it. It was a very touching, sweet, and sad book. I find myself thinking through events in the book as if the events were real and happened to someone I care about - which is a real compliment to the author. She has brought these random and multiple odd individuals to life by breathing into them the traits of every day folk we all know and, even possibly, are ourselves.<br /><br />It is the story of Harold Fry, who is on a pilgrimage to save his old friend Queenie.  Queenie has written Harold that she is not long for the world and Harold feels that as long as he is walking to meet her, she will continue to live - and that she may live thereafter.  Harold comes across very simplistic at first, then as the story progresses, the reader begins to understand the depths that he has.  He thinks through the past and we get his story through these moments.  We find out about his wife, Maureen, and how far apart the two of them have drifted.<br /><br />More than once, I laughed out loud. I also cried, especially for Harold and Maureen. I highly recommend the book to anyone looking for a thought provoking story.
B0086700CM|5.0|good game to play when bored. trying to use enough words to post this review. will start and find it hard to put dkwn
0763644765|4.0|If you are familiar with any of Leslie Patricelli's books, this is just as great.  She has a way of making things so funny and at the same time, understandable. This book got 4 stars because for some, it may be a bit over the top.  There is one line in the book, \\"Tinkle, tinkle, toot\\" which I think is hilarious, but some parents may not like it.  Overall, one of my favorites, can't wait to start using it to help potty train my daughter!!!
0345803493|5.0|If you made it through the first one, obviously you HAVE to read this. I borrowed the first one from a coworker, and could not wait for her to finish this one so I ordered my own!Great story, and more background info is revealed. Agree with other reviewers, this series has repetitive wording at times (how many times can you gape at someone??)and some grammar errors. Still great...
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  It kept my wrapped attention to the end, and I felt it ended well, as I like resolution and happy endings.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is tons of fun.  It is a must buy.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I had no idea about the subject matter of this book, going into it.  What an EYE-OPENER!!<br />I have to say, it certainly keeps the juices flowing!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This really is the worst book ever, I don't understand all the hype, and I am so glad I only borrowed it. Please, don't waste your time or money with this book. I made myself finish it, but it was torture. Oh, and if someone is going to so blatantly plagiarise another author's books, shouldn't they have the decency to acknowledge that author? \\"Thank you Stephanie Myers, for giving me the Twilight characters, I changed their names but they're all in here.\\" Something like that.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I thought ther book was engaging, but it wasn't as good as books #1 and 3 in the Mockingjay Trilogy.
B007QJBHRS|5.0|I am writing this review, because I wanted others to benefit from my experience. I was real pleasure to watch this movie, I am sure there might be many other movies more fantastic than this one, But this is also a very good movie. I watched this in 3 intervals because of kids, and everytime I felt very happy.<br /><br />I kind of love classic movies and their Wit. I like the roommate character. She always makes me laugh.
0984334904|5.0|It's been a month since I bought these so I'd figure I'd edit my review to say that these cards help me greatly in remembering the kanji. I've successfully remembered all the kanji from this volume and can recall them pretty easily. I can honestly say these flashcards were a major part in that. Definitely buying the next two volumes.<br /><br />Features of the cards:<br />- Size of the cards is just right, slightly bigger then an average credit card.<br />- Easy on the eyes, not busy looking at all.<br />- Features both on and kun readings, and the most common meaning in English on the back.<br />- Gives similar Kanji on the front with their definitions.<br />- Gives similar words on the back, great for vocabulary building.<br />- Gives stroke order, very important.<br />- Gives common ways the Kanji is used.<br />- Study cards. They can be somewhat slippery but they're easy to use.<br /><br />Other then the cards themselves, there are unexpected extras.<br />- This is kinda expected but it gives a slip with details of the cards and how to read them, it's simple, trust me.<br />- Paper with index of all the Kanji included including stroke order index and yomi index.<br />- Additional cards, one of them has both hiragana and katakana which is great for reference if you're still rusty.<br /><br />Other then that, it's packaged excellently and rubberbands are provided. :)<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this for anyone that's serious about learning Japanese. Even if you're somewhat familiar with Kanji, this set is good for the extras especially if you want to expand your vocabulary.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|It is an AMAZING controller, especially since it has the best triggers AND control pad, but I don't like how it was too light. I like some weight<br />on my controller.<br /><br />However, it is perfect for those who with sweaty hands, since the grip is rugged enough to have a firm hold, and still be comfortable.<br />Not only that, it is INCREDIBLY responsive, and the clicking is a nice sound to hear, especially in a fighting game. It's perfect for those \\"I KNOW I<br />PRESSED THAT BUTTON!!!!\\" moments.<br /><br />I did get my package lost in the mail, but ended up contacting the company who gave me a refund. Ended up buying the controller again, and this time got it!<br />Awesome guys, and great product!
B005I4JG80|3.0|Just like Mrs. Druckerman, on a resent trip I was amazed of how well behave were the french kids I saw. We were at a restaurant, and I saw 3 couples coming in with their kids. The adults sat a table while the kids sat at another next to them(four kids between 6 and 9 years old) they had separate dinners; the parents ate and drank wine, while the children  ate and talk amount themselves without noise. Obviously I wanted to know how they teach those kids to be so well behave. Thats why when I saw this book I did not hesitate to buy it. However, I was kind of disapointed by the book. Eventhough this book was fun to read, it didn't tell me anything new.<br /><br />Those \\"simple\\" teachings are the same my parents rise me with. I agree with her that consistency and routine are the basics of parenthood. As parents we get tired of saying no all the time, so maybe the author is right and we should say yes to little things and save our energy for the big stuff.<br /><br />To be honest, I am not sure I like the book or not. To me at least, it didn't say anything new or transcendental.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Hugely enjoyable and interesting read. Informative and challenging your own approach. Recipes included adds valuable practical advice and dietary guidelines. Great read!
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|For what you pay for one of these, it is not worth the money.  Yeah it works.  But it is really cheaply made.  After so many uses the bolts start to loosen, so then you have slipping while cutting.  Your best bet is to go to youtube and search for the homemade ones.  Easy to build.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is the best writing currently appearing on television.  Nothing else comes close.<br /><br />The wit, creativity, characters and the gorgeous character development is the finest TV entertainment available on the planet right now.  Even the peripheral characters and guest stars are perfectly woven into the story.<br /><br />As proof, I've never purchased TV entertainment for home viewing.  Ever.  Until the BBT.  I recently purchased the DVDs for Seasons I-IV, and I'm buying V today. I could watch each episode a hundred times.<br /><br />Its so funny, unpredictable, and well done that I get totally involved with each episode.  Recently I've been watching the show while working out (still on season I).  I forget I'm actually on the rower!<br /><br />The writers deserve Emmy Awards for best writing in the history of television entertainment.
B00009ZYC1|5.0|The writeup said it was new and when it arrived, it was indeed still unopened.  It played fine and has a very extensive \\"extras\\" section on the actors who provided the voices.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read Books One and Two and Book Three was the perfect finish to the trilogy. I was pleased with the way the trilogy ended. I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the first and second books.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great game.  Fun and entertaining lots to keep you busy.  Smooth game play. I would recommend it for all ages of players.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved book one. Book two didn't disappoint me. It continued the story of Christian and Ana. As I finished this one I looked forward to Book Three.
0143106465|5.0|Beautiful Deluxe Edition! Especially loved the front inside and back inside covers as well as the textured page edges! Perfect for gift giving!
034580404X|5.0|Very interesting book, easy to read and really liked the ending of it. I wonder if she will write something similar.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|This is a very fun game that makes you think since you have to get the right angle and power to do certain shots and most holes can be completed in different ways to make it more challenging and usually more rewarding if done properly. You won't find great graphics, but the game still plays well and can be addicting.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I loved Rupert Penry in this version of Persuasion! I have the 1995 version with Ciarian Hinds as well but I really loved this version! Rupert brought an extra amount of angst and smoldering looks to Captain Wentworth and who doesn't love that! I thought Ann was plaid well also, except for the all the running close to the end but I loved the sweet ending with Wentworth, I wont spoil anymore than that! You will just have to see for yourself! HA! I thought Ann was seen as more emotional in this adaption than is some adaptions where she is seen as more of callus and a robot.  She has some really emotional scenes in this movie where you really get to see her internal struggle! This was a great movie to add to my collection of everything period and Austen!
B00701L5XS|5.0|You can impress your friends with your outdoor skills. Men like to out do oneanother knowing your knots let you silently impress the other guy.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I watched this entire series on the BBC Channel while I was in bed sick one day and fell in love!! I read the book and this movie really captured the struggle and angst between Thornton and Margaret as they struggle with their class differences between the north and south during the industrial revolution in London! I cant tell you how much Richard Armitage was made for the role of Thornton its like Gaskell reached into the future and based John Thornton on Richard! This movie was awesome and the chemistry between Richard and Daniela Denby was awesome!!! Its a win win for me because you get Richard Armitage and Downton Abbey's Brendan Coyle in the same movie!! Its a great movie and a great addition to my collection of everything period and Austen!
B000FBJFSC|4.0|i have not read his one either. but if you live in georgia and are entering tenth grade, this is one of the books for summer reading
B00364K6YW|5.0|Best adaption of Pride and Prejudice ever!!!!! I already have the original that came out in 1995 but with the modern age of technology I bought the restored version because honestly who wouldn't want to see Colin Firth digitally restored!! Ha! Andrew Davies does period and Austen like no one else so when he directed Firth as Darcy he hit pay dirt because in my opinion no one else has been able to capture broodingly handsome Darcy like Colin did! Sorry to Mathew McFadden he tried but dont get me wrong I do love Mathew as well, I own Little Doritt and I think he did an awesome job in it but Fitzwilliam Darcy he is not! Its a great addition to my collection of everything period and Austen and came in wonderful condition!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Ads became increasingly intrusive. The game is nicely done but the ads take over before every game and it's no longer about the game.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was well written although it was explicit in nature.  I really wasn't much of an erotica reader but, this book really spiced up my sex life. Happily ever after is where every woman wants to be in life.
B0084RSYEK|2.0|The movie was just ok. It had too much profanity and adult innuendo to be considered a family movie. Which confuses me, since the message at the end was positive. There were only a few funny parts. It was definitely more drama than comedy.
0345803485|1.0|Wow! What can I say?<br /><br />It's awful.  However, I've spent a good hour laughing with the authors of negative reviews.  How could I have done that without subjecting myself to this crap while trapped on a delayed air craft?<br /><br />Unfortunately, the writer benefits from the hype good or bad...how I wish she didn't.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a awesome game. Actually worth the 99 cents. Its not a rip off, has so many levels, but be warned: this game is addicting.
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|The album is a decent outing for Linkin Park.  Casual and Hardcore fans will find plenty to like but little to love about the album.  Its emotional highs and lows never seem to go beyond distressed.  Although the album touts a few songs that will undoubtedly be part of any fan's playlist, it's the filler that ultimately keeps this from being a 4-5 star product.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Christopher Nolan is a fantastic filmmaker, he makes the types of films I want to see. Solid focus on characters and their motivations, compelling stories, and amazing action. Personally, I believe his greatest feature is the fact that he is such an old fashioned filmmaker who likes to get as much of the film as possible in-camera (i.e. no CGI or voice dubbing). This is extremely impressive for a writer/director who raises the stakes in each of his films when it comes to action, the fact that he did the opening scene of this film for real astounds me.<br /><br />Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy is my favorite series of films ever. I've never been one to see a film more than once in the theater, but with each of these films I saw them at least 3 times, seeing the last two on opening night in IMAX. Batman has always been my favorite of the comic book heroes, but (except for the 1990s animated series) has never given a faithful or worthy adaptation. This is something Nolan & crew has really strives upon. They truly understand the character of Bruce Wayne and his motivations for becoming the symbol of Batman. With each and every viewing, these films get better and better. Before this last installment, I saw each one as it's own seperate film/story; now, I see it as one story cut into three different parts. The Dark Knight Rises ties all of the films in such a comprehensible and satisfying way.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is a perfect Batman film. Fantastic cast, thrilling story, fantastic action scenes, and one of the greatest villains ever put on film (thanks to an Oscar winning performance by Heath Ledger). There was a crazy amount of hype for Rises after TDK completely changed the game. I was nervous going into the theater because I did not want to be disappointed. I am glad to say that I wasn't, Nolan had done it again. Personally, I believe that TDKR is the most intense and emotionally satisfying film in the trilogy. When I left the theater, I was physically and emotionally drained. It is such a perfect ending to this story, I could not have asked for anything more. Having seen it three times now, I have to say that I like it as much, or even more, than TDK. The stories are both great, the casting is all phenomenal, the music is epic, and the villains are awesome. While Tom Hardy as Bane isn't as \\"fun\\" to watch as Ledger's Joker, he is very intimidating and even quite terrifying at times (I absolutely love the voice Hardy created for the character, I find it eerie and intimidating, most notably his last scene with Daggett). He gives Batman the first real physical challenge in the trilogy. The one thing I believe that TDKR truly improves upon is it's action set pieces. While there are only about four or five action sequences, they are truly epic, exciting, and like nothing I've seen before. The opening scene to this film is a testament to that fact.<br /><br />While the villain won't quite stand the test of time, and the story really relies on the two installments before it, this is a monumental film and an epic end to a perfect trilogy. These are the superhero films who typically don't like superhero films. They are more grounded in reality (the only real point of disbelief is the fact that some guy is dressed up like a Bat) and focus more on character & story than on action. The Marvel films are fun, like Iron Man & Captain America, but they are forgettable. The films in The Dark Knight Trilogy will stay with you after you watch them.
B005HSL626|3.0|its not bad but not good. you have to reeeaaaaally like it to give it more than 2 and a half stars.
B004LL1HM4|5.0|I had only heard \\"Helplessness Blues\\" and knew I had to know who Fleet Foxes were and what else they sang.  The song is brilliant and moves me to sing my heart out, as are the other songs on the album. I love their voices, their harmony and haunting sound.  All of the songs are beautiful on this CD ... even my 7 year old daughter is hooked!  I find myself waiting for any chance to listen to this lovely music and find it hard to fall asleep with the music floating in my mind.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I could not have been happier. The disks and cover were perfect. It looked like I just bought it from the store.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|Just rubbish, don't waste your money buying this trilogy. I've made a point of finishing it, and I swear, I've never had a harder time in my life!<br />I did like the beginning, I downloaded the free sample and liked what I read, but that was it, unfortunately. I am finding it boring and stupid, with a main character who really gets on my nerves, she is so silly and boring.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This has been probably the best training and nutrition book I have ever read,<br />It teaches you a way of life around steriods, to get in<br />true physical shape, spelled out in laymen's terms.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|I was very pleased with my purchase and the quality as well. I missed a lot of the episodes on TV and am happy to be able to see them now
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Nolan proved himself more than capable with his first stab at DCs' iconic hero, and has again made the case that he should be the only director allowed near the Batman universe. Why? His minimal use of CG, the excellent script and stuntwork alone make his Dark Knight definitive, but it is his work with the actors and their dialogue that make this a special film. While there are things to quibble about possibly storywise and action wise, you simply can't fault the performances he gets out of this outstanding cast. The photography coupled with a complex and involving screenplay that wrings every bit of character development possible out of everyone involved leaves the viewer slightly out of breath and awed by the end of this truly spectacular summer movie event. The best of next generation technology, mixed with some classic trojan horse surprises and non digital filmmaking send this picture soaring heads and tails above your average superhero fare. No digital blur here, and no flies either just spectacular performances (Oldman, Ledger, Eckhart) and a truly fufilling cinematic Batman experience.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I am obsessed with Mad Men! I loved how convenient Amazon was to download and the newest and latest season was right there just waiting for me. Season 5 was worth every penny!!
0060578793|4.0|I used one of the snares in the book, and quickly snagged a racoon for dinner. though some of the things in the book are difficult, or at least much more simple than the book describes them as (the only reason I'd give it a four.) but overall, the book is the best.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|e l james is a wonderful author. i am hoping she is still going to write a 4th one to where the last 50 shades left off. I fell in love with this book and read all three in 2 weeks. i am just sad the book came to an end.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Steifvater creates characters that live and breath on the page, including detailed personalities, likes, dislikes and distinctive dialogue. The main characters, though flawed and sometimes obnoxious like real people, face moral dilemmas and seek to act ethically, if not always with foresight. I found myself forming a book crush on Sam, as I read into the wee hours of the morning. There is some language, but overall this is a fantastic read. Steifvater is a master storyteller, and takes paranormal teen lit to a new literary height. My one complaint is the frustrating ending; its an emotional drain on the reader.
B007SGM084|3.0|I am a mother of three girls under 8 with a full time job on the side, with a husband who works away (14 on and 14 off). As much as I wanted to be able to read lots of different things, like lots of other people, I thought I didn't have the time or energy after my day was done. After passing on the Twilight series, the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, and all of the other trendy things that came and went, I gave in to the hype of the Fifty Shades craze and decided to go for it to see what it was all about.<br /><br />I was pretty disappointed, as several other people, with the wording and repetitiveness of the whole thing. The sex scenes were interesting and exciting at first but that quickly faded and I found myself wanting to skip them by the time the second book came because they started to bore me to tears...although, they did give me a few ideas to pass on to my husband, who was very grateful.<br /><br />That being said, there were also parts that I loved! The story in general I found beautiful. I see some people saying that it is degrading to women, but what I got out of it was that patience and love can conquer all.<br /><br />The best thing about the series, for ME, was that it made me realize that I DO in fact have the time and energy to make time for myself, to enrich my mind by reading and learning whatever I desire! After finishing the series, I decided that I would immediately start researching classic novels and start making a list of authors and books that I thought would be interesting to me. I was so excited to see that most of the great classics are free for kindle that I started downloading tons of them, and immediately started reading Tess of the d'Ubervilles (out of sheer curiosity from the Fifty Shades trilogy), then finally made time to finish the huge book that I had been working on for over a year at a snail's pace, and now, after seeing the trailer for Les Miserables, have begun to dig into that enormous work (which is absolutely glorious so far) so that when the movie comes out in December I can, for the first time ever, see a movie and be able to judge it against the book! And the fact that it is arguably one of the greatest novels ever written instead of a hyped up trendy thing makes it even better! All this because of a silly love story that I would have known nothing about had it not been for my girl friends on Facebook. I'm sure the same can be said of any book that I would have decided to start with, but it just happened to be this one for me.<br /><br />Now back to the books themselves. I thought the first one was wonderful, the second was absolutely fantastic, and the third was just \\"ok\\" until getting toward the end. If a fourth were to be written I would definitely read it. They are definitely not for everyone. I would say they would be best suited for beginners (adults of course) who's standards are not too high from reading the works of great authors and who would not be turned off by the explicit sexual details.
B004TTZHBK|2.0|First, I disagree with those who say not to downrate an app &quot;just&quot; because it doesn't work. What better reason is there? This app was a slick idea that sadly for me did not deliver. It consistently crashed, videos wouldn't load, photos on recipes would pop up and not go away so I could actually view the recipe...need I go on? My tablet has no trouble playing other vids. Reinstall didn't help. I was really looking forward to having these videos in the kitchen with me, so I eagerly paid too much for nada. oh well.
B004EPYZTE|3.0|If you're a fan of the Schwarzenegger movie, then this might be a real let-down. Kind of like comparing the Buscema Conan with the Barry Smith version. Arnold's was Buscema's, this one reminds you of Barry's. I like Arnold's better, but this one has it's moments and is quite \\"epic\\" at times, if you like this type of movie, you proably won't be disapointed. If you, like me got this to watch in 3D, don't waste the money, stick with 2D, while there is some idea of depth, that's it, no gimmicks, nothing jumps out at you, nothing to let know you're watching a 3D movie. In fact I'd go so far to say that my tv, which can change 2D to 3D, did a better job converting the 2D disk then you get with the 3D disk. So save your money, stick with the 2D.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|I ordered this along with the el cheapo stylus pens (see my other review) and in my opinion I do not notice much of a difference in the ability to write or draw on the ipad. I use it mainly to take notes on the ipad. The fineness ability of both are about the same. The difference comes with this pen being a bit heavy, thick and gives you more of a heavy fake crayon effect. To me, I can write with a fat pen or a thin pen, it does not matter. The quality of the cosmonault feels good though compared to the cheapo styli. I do think this one will last longer, although I will update the reviews when my pens break. Do you really need an expensive stylus? Or can you just get by with the fraction of the cost? I think I am leaning towards the cheaper ones. This pen also does not have a clip or anything to put it in, other than the cardboard box it came with. It may roll off the table as well. So if you do misplace it or lose it, it is more costly than the cheapo ones to replace and you may feel more hurt losing it. Something you may want to consider! Just one star off for the price (could do better).
B007JVJ3C4|1.0|This movie was just painful to watch. Cage was way over the top, at times I thought I was watching a silent movie (and I wished I was) because the acting was just so hammy. I got this movie because I love 3d movies, for which I'll give it one star, the effects were cool but really wasted in the 3d department. If  you like movies based on comics, get a copy of Thor or Batman, even Corman's version of The Fantastic Four is better then this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very fun game but also challenging, so many games that are all different from themselfs i would sooooooooo get this game if i were you
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a lot like the original game. keeps u going. energy refilled pretty soon. easy to follow the prompts. I recommend this game.
B00755646W|1.0|Truth or dare! For me a sentimental movie of my youth and childhood. Iam living in the Netherlands and this regioncode does not working in my country. We have in Holland regioncode 2 and this movie is regioncode 1 USA. I contacted with amazon but a reaction have not received yet. It was very disapointing. I have a blue ray disc and it does not play yet.<br /><br />Maarten Schriks the netherlands
B004QOB8SY|5.0|I was very leery of this series because of the fact it takes place in the modern era. I love the Victorian era with the carriages, etc. I quickly got over that once I saw how great these 2 fellows portrayed their characters, I absolutely loved both series. I'm hoping there will be more to come.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't think I can add much that the other 1,442 reviewers haven't said, but I just wanted to state for the record that this is a great book. Mr. Howey said in his questions section in the back that he is a \\"Big fat nobody,\\" but with this many readers and a movie deal I don't think he can say that any longer.

0385344228|5.0|This book is excellent. I love the way it was written and all of the twists and turns it takes. Even though it makes you a little melancholy, it's still hard to put down. I'm glad I read it and highly recommend it. A+.
B005Y4241K|5.0|This is  a great package, the concert footage is great and Adelle is truly a superstar. The package includes a cd of the concert which , I think is a bonus and at the price a great set.
0345536886|3.0|I've always gotten sucked into Grisham books. Once I pick them up, I can't put them down. I didn't quite feel that way about this particular one, but that's not to say it wasn't a good read. I enjoyed the characters and the story line, but it seemed to be missing that special Grisham thrill you usually get. Still recommend it, just make sure you buy it at a discount.
B000003BE4|5.0|This was one of the few earlier Rolling Stones Cd's I did not have . Basicaly 6 of the tracks were never released in US on other Rolling Stones albums , like they did in the UK. So in my bid to have all the early Rolling Stones songs, I bought this . This CD has helped me find six tracks i never had. It is probably one of the best RS Albums ever.
030758836X|5.0|This is, by far, the best mystery I've ever read.  Rich in psychological realism, and cleverly plotted, I couldn't put it down.  Ms. Flynn is a masterful storyteller, and the dual points of view are utilized to great effect.  Some readers may argue that Amy and Nick are unsympathetic, but good God, are they fascinating.  It's no wonder this book is a bestseller--it is THE BEST release of the summer.
B004FOA84A|4.0|People complain too much. The game is under a dollar, and for that price you get outstanding value. The art and story and gameplay are basic and competent. It's short and not extremely challenging because it is a MOBILE app that costs A DOLLAR. Is it worth a dollar? Yes, more than that. Should you buy it? If you are a hardcore gamer, no. If you are a kid or want a simple fun game,  YES.
0061765236|2.0|As a survivor of suicide--my older brother died the same way Em did--I was expecting a rich, in-depth exploration of the reasons why someone would feel so desperate, she would take her own life.  Unfortunately, this was terribly lacking.  Em's reasons for committing suicide struck me as archaic and inadequate--even simplistic.  The fierce love Chris's mother has for her son is deeply felt, but, after Em's death, her parents fade into the background.  Even more troubling is the presentation of Chris's younger sister, who seems to be placed in the novel simply to serve as a counterpoint to Em.  Overall, this was a disappointing albeit compelling read--by far, my least favorite Picoult novel.

B0052RDHTM|5.0|Started reading this book in book form and it was so heavy it made my hands and arms hurt. Bought a kindle because of this book and finished it on Kindle. I had read a series of books about WWII before but didn't know very much about WWI. The characters were facinating and the background taught me alot about the war, and women's sufferage, and immigration problems.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my four year old daughter and I both find this is a fun game.  the upper levels are quite a challenge
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I normally don't download these ___ in 1 games, because they're normally full of cheesy and often easy games. So far this one has been challenging and fun. Plus there are lots of ways to get points, which unlock other games.
B0006PV5VC|5.0|I have no hesitation in agreeing to the other reviews on this album. This is definitive audiophile grade recording with which you could evaluate any piece of equipment, I have on numerous occasions. The music has the uncanny ability to draw the listener into it completely, one will find oneself sitting on the edge of the seat with the jaw on the floor when its over.<br /><br />Every audiophile, music lover or a student of music, irrespective of genre preference should own this masterpiece.
B004QL7K8E|1.0|This wasn't a movie, this was 88 minutes of wasted time. I cant believe the amount of positive reviews this got, unbelievable. John Hughes & this thing should never be in the same sentence. Comparing John's work to Nima Nourizadeh is disrespectful and disgraceful to J.Hughes fans throughout. Warner Bros. should be embarrassed for releasing this stuff under their name. Blind buyers beware, rent first! It wouldn't surprise me to see this in the $1 bin very soon, and even then, it's overpriced.
B0065GC0BA|4.0|This is a very moving and powerful story.  Jojo has put pen to paper with compassion of a most controversial story.This is a quick read as you will not want to put it down.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|i bought two for the same money as one of the others, it works well and feels safe to use.<br />i improved the factory edge on my blade by at least 50%, this product does not fall short of it's claims.
B000002MP2|4.0|Green Day really did a great and excellent job on this one of a kind masterpiece. Although emerging as a bunch of Indie- Artists Green Day rises above it all with this album a punk classic this album right here should be in anyone's collection if you are a collector or music freak.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is verrrrrrrrrryyyyyyyy verrry  very very very very very very very very addictive but the best game i have ever played
0515142247|3.0|\\"Die Trying\\" is Lee Child's second novel in the Jack Reacher series, after \\"Killing Floor\\". Whilst I enjoyed the first book, I found \\"Die Trying\\" much less enjoyable.<br /><br />This time Jack Reacher finds himself involuntarily involved in a battle between the FBI and a Montana-based militia. He helps a woman struggling with her crutches outside a laundry shop and the next thing he knows he's being kidnapped together with the woman, ending up in a white truck that drives for days into the militia's hideout in the mountains. The woman, Holly Johnson, is an FBI agent who also happens to be the daughter of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the god-daughter of the President of the United States. She is kidnapped because of her PR value to the militia. Jack is kidnapped because he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><br />The FBI and Holly's father mount a semi-private rescue operation, as the White House prefers not to get involved. Needless to say, Jack is trying his best from the inside to get himself and Holly out. His shooting marksmanship enables him to create enough havoc inside the compound until him and Holly are rescued. He also manages to foil the bigger plan of the militia's leader involving a bomb and many innocent civilians.<br /><br />This is a classic Child novel, fast and with no unnecessary complications. An enjoyable read for a day at the beach or a long flight.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|just way over the top they out done there self I love it just love it its outstanding I'm I love with this app its my second favriot other than vevo
B007MDB71O|5.0|I first saw this movie, partially because of the horribly done preview, with great skepticism. As I watched the movie though, I was caught in the heroic and epic nature of the story. Stanton does a marvelous job adapting this time to the big screen. After I watched the film, I took my two daughters to go see it in 3D, which they loved! The story has all the elements of a great movie, drama, action, strong character development, thematic development, and scintillating romance. I went back to read the books, and have been thoroughly enjoying my read of this somewhat forgotten classic! I hope they decide to make the rest of them into movies!
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|be great if the update came out... other than that its a really fun game. i suggest you buy the real one. there's no in between commerical advertisement.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book was awesome :D I would stay up late trying to get to a good stopping point and what not but I'd end up waking up on my kindle the next morning :c. Seems like there's going to be a sequel which sucks but the story itself outweighs the whole sequel thing. The pictures connected sooo well with the story i actually thought they were purposely taken and edited to fit the story, but i was wrong and i found that so interesting. I really recommend it and to think I only bought it because i saw it on my school's website.
B007NZDES0|5.0|BUY THIS DVD! Best music DVD ever. The music, the performance, the staging are all top notch. You will play this one over and over and ..... Sade never sounded/looked better.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I definitely liked the first book the best and got a bit sick of the all of the sexual scenes, but it still turned out to be a good read.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Finally decided to buy the whole series and so happy I did, glad to finally have them all to watch in order and it was just as the seller said it'd be. It's just as funny this time around and I'm very satisfied with it.
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I really liked the story, but not the writing style. The idea of two lost loves reuniting is romantic and never fails to deliver. In that regard, this story is wonderful. However, I found the constantly changing point of views a bit distracting, but that's must my personal opinion. Overall, the story is incredibly romantic.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|This is such a funny movie, I'd recommend it to anyone unless they are too sensitive. Jonah Hill is quickly becoming one of my favorites.
B004LROUW2|3.0|I am 80% done with this book, and I will finish it, but I must say that I feel like the book is about 1/3 too long. I think a lot of it could be cut out and still be a fine novel. Too much of it - like Ushikawa's investigation and pursuit of Aomame - seems convoluted and like a deliberate delay. I liked the first half of the novel much better, it was very suspenseful and there were so many times when I just could not put the book down, I HAD to read on to find out what would happen next. But around Chapter 7 of Book 2 (when Aomame goes to the hotel to assassinate the Leader), I started skipping things to get ahead. Two full chapters talking about Aomame's trip into the hotel and her preparation for seeing the Leader was just too much. Likewise I felt that Tengo's trip to see his sick father in a coma just took too much time to explain. I can't wait to finish this book. I've liked Murakami's other works and I'm sure I will go on to read more of his stuff.

B007HC3LHS|4.0|What an excellent first outing. This book kept me interested from the first chapter.<br />I look forward to the author's next outing.
B00846TRHY|5.0|It has its slow moments.  If you are a religious type, you'll like the message maybe not the methods but definitely the message.  Overall, it kept me intrigued and even did a follow up on the character's real life.  It's the type of movie I can watch over and over again.
030758836X|1.0|Thank goodness I didn't waste money on this book.  Thank you, public library! I HATED the ending, but I also hated how the book was set up, to begin with.  As somebody previously mentioned, it began sounding like a teen girl's diary, when it was actually a woman in her 30's, telling her story.  It went back and forth.  First Amy was talking, then the next chapter, Nick was talking.  To me, the book just didn't flow, I didn't care for any of the characters, the plot was ridiculous, and as stated before, I hated the ending.  It should have been called \\"Pure Drivel,\\" but Steve Martin already has a published book bearing that name.
B0089LT8Y6|4.0|29 years later and Testament continues to show why they belong with Slayer, Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax as gods of thrash. This album is a near perfect mix of old Testament and new Testament. It has thrashy songs (Man kills Mankind, Native Blood for example), heavy Sabbathian songs (dark roots of earth), and 1 ballad (cold embrace). All band members sound great and Hoglan is a fantastic addition who delivers for the entire 50 minutes. I dont mind the blast beats which people have complained about it, they sound gnarly.  Testament sticks to the same old formula of kick ass metal and does not bring anything really 'new' to the table but thats okay because its killer thrash and that's all that matters.
B005VPLZ76|4.0|picked this up at my local record store for $30. this is one of my favorite albums and i was so stoked about getting it on vinyl. when i first opened it up i was dissapointed it wasnt a gatefold but i really didnt care. the red vinyl is really cool but i was dissapointed it was only 140 grams and not 180. when i started listening to this it had skips. DONT WORRY IF IT HAS SKIPS!!! it is one of those records that gets better with plays so the skips will go away. as for the sound quality it is great. it has that muffled sound that the album always has had which i was expecting. it could be better but im still happy. 4/5 stars.
B008578PMU|1.0|Spielberg lends his name to this movie as producer, but if he did any actual producing he would have thrown it into the bin and started over. Great cast. Bad directing and a bad story line. All acting fell flat which is amazing considering the people involved. Rent Tuskegee Airman. It was done roughly 20 years ago, but is 10 times better than this horrible mockery of very brave men from WWII.
B006VA57CY|5.0|This show has everything you could want in a period drama/ soap.(yeah I said it soap!) My boss at work watches PBS so he had told me about it and now all of us are addicted. Do not be discouraged by the term soap. The UK does it up right; Great actors,  beautiful sets, excellent writing,  and period accuracy.  I have learned many things about the time period I did not know about until watching these shows. So it gives you a history lesson along with dramatic licenses not seen since the originals of prime time soaps Dallas,  Dynasty, Falcon crest and that genre. In my opinion buy the first two seasons today get caught up and watch the third season on PBS coming in the winter. Word is Shirley Mcclain is in the new season. We can not wait.  OH YEAH! YOU GOT TO LOVE THE BRITISH?
1594744769|4.0|The book \\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" by Ransom Riggs mixes fiction writing and quality photography into one slightly spooky fantasy. This is Mr. Riggs' first novel and it was published by Quirk Books in 2011.<br /><br />Ransom Riggs writes of a teenaged boy named Jacob whose Grandfather told him amazing stories about a magical children's home and horrific monsters, that seemed almost too good to be true. When Jacob has his suspicions, his Grandfather gets mad and refuses to speak about the children. Later in life, the Grandfather claims that the monsters are coming to get him, and dies shortly after. This sets Jacob on a fantastical journey that sends him to a remote Welsh island, where he discovers the place his late Grandfather spoke so fondly of, in ruins.<br /><br />The author uses facts from World War II to strengthen his story. This makes the plot have more depth, and makes it more believable. The grandfather was Polish, and had to be evacuated when the war started. Later, in his teenage years, he went to fight. Jacob's parents and psychologist try to make him believe that the magical stories were nothing more than exaggerated versions of the truth: the monsters were Nazi soldiers, not the tentacled inhuman things that were described by his grandfather. Later on, the monsters are found to be called Hollowgasts, a word that is reminiscent of Holocaust. This could have been done more subtley by Ransom Riggs.<br /><br />Many books that feature a teenager as the narrator don't make the conversations or emotions realistic. This is something the author does very well. The text is written in a clear, relatable way that would appeal to the standard teenager as well as to adults.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a gripping, well-written novel that will come as a joy to all avid readers. The photography and story work together to produce a wondrous story that everyone should read.
B007FZ7R7W|1.0|Before I start my review let me clear one thing, My rating has nothing to do with Chris Brown's personal life. Yes, I'm aware of the fact that he's a misogynist with anger management problems. I'm a woman and totally anti violence in all its shapes and formes but celebrities personal lives and their mistakes no matter how grave does not affect mine in anyway so why should I care? I'm here for the music that's all.<br /><br />Chris Brown as an artist *if you could call him that* has a good singing voice. Not the most remarkable vocals you'll ever hear *God Forbid* but given the right amount of effort, amusing or somehow meaningful lyrics and catchy beats the overall production of his works are not that bad. Some of his past achievements or contributions to the music industry if one will consider anything by Chris Brown to be regarded as an Achievement *this is a tone in cheek way of saying earlier works not something I'd take seriously* were quite entertaining, Which I think is his strongest suit he stands out as an entertainer more than anything else. A Quality that is clearly lacking in this album as well as any sings of depth or sincerity. There was a release of some singles back in January & February to promote for Fortune which were somehow catchy but the overall product falls flat. My complains are just like every 1,2 star reviews there is an abuse of auto tone which doesn't help any, the lyrics are simplistic and come across as offensive and well tiring *how many times can a person hear about sex without being overwhelmed eventually?* and the spark is just not there. There is no message to be sent in this album or at least not any I can consider. It's filled with sexual innuendos, partying, alcohol and drugs. Much like every other song played on the radio and in clubs. Which doesn't make the tracks on here stand out or commit to memory. Sooner or later the listener is going to realize that it's not just one awful song after the other it's one awful song over and over again. You can't distinguish between the tracks themselves they all sound the same and have the same feel, message and theme to them. The Music Videos and Album cover as well as the logo, mostly give this Science fiction appearance to them which gives you the impression that Chris Brown is now a robot in the year 3000 on a save the world mission or something but this chosen persona does nothing to redeem the album once you start realizing that wether he's a robot thousands of years from now or an average backstreet guy he's still gonna sing about sex and all those things.<br /><br />Lust *the main subject this album evolves around* is a one dimensional emotion and it fades as quickly as it appears. Same thing goes for this albums. While F.A.M.E was entertaining and optimistic mostly, and Graffiti was sweet in nature. Fortune doesn't provide anything memorable or new to the table. Easily the most forgettable album of 2012 & by Chris Brown to date.<br /><br />Is it Recommend?  Yes, if you were super drunk, in a club and just want something to jam into then this album will be somehow bearable although god knows there are way better options out there.nd over again.

B005LFQRTC|5.0|Given the poor quality of many actual series on TV, I enjoy revisiting the old Six Million Dollar Man series. I find them excellent, entertaining and worth watching. All episodes are clean, with good plots. A real pleasure.
B00008S7KC|1.0|IF this product would play in a blu ray/dvd player in the u.s. , this would be a great deal, or maybe if I purchase a u.s. version then I could watch it anywhere...this is the second item like this and I don't think there will be a third...
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I don't use many photo editor apps but I immediately fell in love with this and don't plan on switching any time soon.
B005XBKXV2|5.0|I was very excited to purchase digital movies. I have a ROKU and love being able to have instant access to my movies for my New grandson. 7months old. and we are going to build a new collection for him.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a great game.if u are a person who loves adventure or loves making their dream town I highly reccomend this.
B004FRX0MY|3.0|well, I loved this app and raved about it to all that would listen. the free GBs were plenty for the majority of cds I listen to. well, fast forward to todays update. no longer is there a free amount of space. now I have to erase a good number of songs to be under the 250 tune limit. this sucks. I'm leaning toward giving Google music a try.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app!<br />this app allows easy access . the numbers are large in print and functions are basic for easy handling.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Based on the story alone I would have given the book 5 stars. I became emotional attached to the characters. What annoyed the hell out of me was having the author tos all the sex in just to make the reader spend more money.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I am very surprised this is as good as it is.  for a free game I am definitely enjoying it.
B0086700CM|5.0|Its so fun and hard at the same time yet its kinda easy at the same time too either way I love this game &lt;3 :) &bull;_&bull;
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun with hardly any adds I am so addicted and cant stop playing every day
B005PYZG6E|3.0|I have purchased this item and find it not useful at all. I mean it does have a nice solid build but as far as functionality, it does great with my 50mm prime on a Canon t2i but any lens above that this thing is all over the place.<br />I attribute that to the fact that this steady cam is just to damn light. It is definitely not 2lbs as they state and even after many attempts to get a proper balance the moment you begin walking it just goes all over the place... I was thinking about taking it apart and adding a longer bar at the bottom with heavier weight to see if that does the job..<br />But like I said with my 50mm prime lens this is nice therefore I see the potential but in it but it is a shame that I have to reverse engineer it and rebuild it to get it to do the job it doesn't do coming out the box...<br />This has a good build for the most part and hopefully with the adjustments I intend on adding to it hopefully it won't be a total waste of my money...
B0086700CM|5.0|AWESOME game. very addicting(: easy to understand very very fun game.<br />fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun lol great game.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is the best Bible app available for kindle fire. Easy to find verses, many different translations available. My favorite feature is the verse-a-day things with different themes and lengths from a week all the way to a year ranging in topics like hope, love, and encouragement. Definitely recommend this. Has yet to force close on me.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nice game to sit back after a hard day of work or play to relax and let your mind just connect the dots.
1595825045|5.0|Loved it, it follows the creation of the series from first idea then first drawing all the wa through the series finale. Its great to see the technical side of the show and see how some things came together.<br /><br />But these guys are drivng me nuts about Zuko's mom.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Really enjoyed the back and forth struggle between the lead characters and the struggle of the characters to change their future no matter their past transgressions.
B00001QGIQ|3.0|I got this movie for my kiddos to watch.  I was a little surprised by 2 of the scenes in the movie that I don't remember from when I was a child.  One in which there is smoking of cigars and the use of a sensitive word.  Yet overall is a classic that I remember from my childhood.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What cannot be said about \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\"? Eagerly anticipated by many, I myself have been counting down the weeks to its opening release. I've seen some not so good reviews written about the third Dark knight film and well...I don't see it, much less agree with the over analyzation of the story and characters. Folks, you have to remember. This is a film series based on a comic book universe and characters within that universe. Picking it apart and over analyzing the script, story and characters is well...really kind of pointless in my opinion. It's made for entertainment and well...the third film not only delivers that promise, but it also adds closure to \\"Bruce Wayne\\", and the first two stories as well.<br /><br />Without giving much away about the film for those of you who haven't seen it, Bruce Wayne has turned himself into a recluse. Battered and crippled, he hung up his cape and went into hiding for eight years. On the horizon a new evil and threat to Gotham emerge. Bane, a hulk of a man with not only the physical strength, ferocity, cruelty and willingness to use it, he also bears an incredible mind and intelligence that others before him lacked. While The Joker just wanted to screw with Wayne's mind attempting to bring about anarchy and chaos to Gotham, Bane's intentions on the other hand are far more sinister. To not only finish what his predecessor Raz Algoul and the League of Shadows plan in the beginning, but to burn Gotham to the ground, turn its people on each other and immerse society into chaos. More importantly, to not only destroy the city, but to destroy Wayne's soul, but to break him. Wayne answers to this threat, but is it too much for him to handle or too late?<br /><br />Seeing is believing my friends and I urge you to not take the negative reviews to heart or word for word. They are opinions spouted out by a few who are hard to please. This isn't Saving Private Ryan, Shindler's List or \\"The King's Voice, it's a film based on a comic book and comic book characters. The Dark Knight Rises is well worth the wait in line, the evening ticket price and you will be greatly disappointed if you miss seeing it in the theater. More so, you will be utterly amazed of Tom Hardy's physical transformation. Bale has been known to go through incredible physical extremes for film roles and Tom Hardy has proven himself equally time and time again. He is utterly unrecognizable and is something to see. Don't miss it; it is a great film experience
6304416415|4.0|I got this movie for my kiddos to watch, being a favorite movie of me when I was younger. they were delighted to watch and watched over and over
B005LAIGWS|5.0|Well gotta say don't see this movie in 3d it sucks. But this movie has promise its a little slow on the get up but give it time. Its not a family movie at any right. But it has a good ending.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game for children. I would have rated six  stars if I could . I love this game so so much.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|don't see the games increasing in inherent value as you earn more points<br />needs a better method to preview games
B000JK8OYU|5.0|I've had this CD for several years now and still do not tire of listening to it.  The way the tracks were edited and remixed are phenomenal.  Sounds fantastic and has you listening to the Beatles in a new way.
B007N5YIUS|2.0|Ok, so jazzed to see the update for Space but when updating had to uninstall old version which erupted out everything I had done before! Then, I played the first level of the new world and you can't go any further without &quot;paying&quot; !? So disappointed in Rovio. Seems like since they became successful they got greedy
B007SNFTAI|4.0|A parsimonious narrative that reveals only gradually key elements of the plot. The reader must be patient and advance at the pace set by the author. But perseverance is rewarded: a magnificent story about the effects of others' decisions on our lives, the possibility of being oneself, of being forced to be \\"another\\", the ability to deceive, and mostly, how the difference between possible worlds can ultimately reside in small details on which one has little control.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the game is fun to play but I dislike the pop-up ads a lot because their annoying wish there was no pop-up ads
0552164135|5.0|This really is the best book I've read for a good while - utterly absorbing and a classic \\"page turner\\".  I was fascinated by the way memory loss was used. I had to really concentrate at some points in order to follow things but did so willingly.  I was particularly impressed by the ending; I hadn't worked it out and kicked myself for not doing so. Definitely recommended as one book you should read if you like something with psychological undertones.
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I saw this movie with my friend,and we had a blast. It was a hilarious good time. After seeing the movie, it made me start watching the original series. I love how this was mostly a comedy, and a tribute to the series, rather then a serious dramatic soap opera. Johnny Depp was great as Barnabas Collins, the vampire of Collinwood Manor. I love how it had a classic 'fish-out-of-water' story. It was like taking Bela Lugosi's Dracula and putting him in the 70's hippie age. This is definitely a Tim Burton film because everyone wears pale Marilyn Manson-type makeup, and it has Helena Bonham Carter, along with Danny Elfman music. Chloe Moretz gives a great performance as Carolyn Stoddard. She's the rebellious teenager we've seen in all of Burton's other films like Ryder in Beetlejuice.<br /><br />In the 1700's, Barnabas makes the mistake of breaking the heart of a witch named Angelique. She curses him by turning him into a vampire and locks him in a coffin for 200 years. In 1972, the Collins family are trying to find a governess for young David who claims to see the ghost of his mom. Along comes Maggie, who changes her name to Victoria Winters. When Barnabas is found and awakened, he returns home to bring the manor to its former glory and re'vamp' the family business. When Angelique returns and threatens his family, Barnabas must take action and seek revenge on the witch who cursed him. If you want a smart Gothic fun hilarious vampire movie that pays tribute to the 70's era and the original series, I would definitely recommend DARK SHADOWS!!!

B000VDUWMC|5.0|Jared Diamond won a pulitzer prize when he wrote this book.  It digs into why some nations industrialized while others did not.  Ultimately, this book is a long and ingenius answer to a single question: \\"Why is it that you white people developed so much cargo and brougt it to New Guinea, but we black people had little cargo of our own?\\"  When the writer was confronted with this question by Yali, a New Guinea politician, it inspired all of the study discussed in this book.  Diamond analyzes the social and environmental differences that resulted in such vast differences in development.  Jared  Diamond is an expert in the field of Anthropology and one of the most well informed voices in the community, in regards to this subject.  This book will contribute to your understanding of different societies past and present.  It shows why not all people civilized, and why simple indigenous lifestyles are not lesser to our own, but simply different.
B008578PRK|5.0|I loved this movie.  There were several times during the movie that scared me so much I jumped out of my chair. My husband and I watched it together and we were both wondering how it was going to end. I believe it ended the only way it could possibly end. Great entertainment!

0545123275|2.0|Oh. My. God. It. Was. BAD. Capital B-A-D.<br /><br />The plot is plain stupid. Simple as that.<br /><br />The writing... actually I liked the writing. Actually, I really like the writing! It was gorgeous. Her description of emotions and surroundings where brilliant. I would have finished the book...but...<br /><br />The characters where the worst. Both Grace and Sam were so pathetic, it was sad. With Grace; I thought that she was obsessed with the wolves. Overly obsessed. As in runs-into-a-woods-where-men-are-shooting-to-save-the-wolves obsessed. (True, they shouldn't be shooting wolves in the first place since wolf numbers are declining.) Sam was even worse; he's supposed to be a werewolf! He writes poetry and songs. He also whines SO MUCH. Whine this, whine that, whine whine whine whine!!!!!!!! I kept on banging my head off the wall, whishing the whining would end.<br /><br />Grace is obsessed with Sam. Sam is obsessed with Grace. Sam saw Grace naked. Grace saw Sam naked. They sleep together, but don't have sex. Well, until the end (I stopped reading it around there). I think I've rounded up the romance. OH! They kiss in the first 90 pages. Fast? Yes. Completely.<br /><br />In eight words; Shiver. Was. A. waste. Of. My. Precious. Time.

B007SAKSF2|4.0|It's been 21 years since Blur's first studio release: the 1991 Leisure.  To honor this occasion, a 21-disc set (appropriately called \\"21\\") collects pretty much everything the band ever commit to tape.  Everything is here.  With the band currently having scrapped any plans to create a new album, this could very well be the definitive Blur collection.<br /><br />So what does this collection contain?  Here's the inventory:<br />7 studio albums (all expanded to 2 discs apiece)<br />4 discs of rarities (a good bit previously unreleased elsewhere)<br />3 DVDs (two live shows and one with videos)<br />A hardback book full of liner notes that follow the bands' career<br />A 7\\" single of \\"Superman\\" (from the band's days as Seymour)<br /><br />The two-disc studio albums include all of the band's major releases: Leisure, Modern Life is Rubbish, Parklife, The Great Escape, Blur, 13, and Think Tank.  The band's first five albums have also been remastered.  Each album is accompanied with a bonus disc that contains B-sides, live cuts, a few remixes, etc... Some of the content from these extra discs have been available for quite some time.  The band has led a fascinating artistic direction, from Leisure's mild psychedelia, to Parklife's britpop glam, to the selftitled Blur's crunching distortion, to Think Tank's refined pop sensibilities.  It may be important to note that all of these albums have been concurrently released independently with this collection -- if you're only interested in hearing material from the band's early era, you can buy those discs separately.<br /><br />The hardbound book includes many insights from the band itself.  This book includes interviews with the band members, but it is primarily composed of pictures.  The collection of photography here tells the visual story of Blur's rise to success in Britain and America.  Likewise, the DVD's serve a similar function.  Two of the DVDs are live shows: one from the band's 1994, and the other being from 1999 (titled \\"THE SINGLES NIGHT\\").  It's remarkable to see these two live shows in juxtaposition of one another -- they almost behave like different bands.  The third disc contains some of the band's music videos (mainly their later videos), their first appearance on television, and a few other live cuts.<br /><br />Longtime Blur fans will be interested in the 4-discs worth of rarities.  These tracks range from Seymour-era demos, some live tracks, some remixes, fan-club singles, songs left on albums' cutting room floors, and of particular interest, the aborted sessions with XTC's Andy Partridge.  These tracks range from silly, unfinished demos to songs that outshine many of the band's singles.  The majority of the material from the band's later years are early demos of songs that did in fact make it to the album; they have all been mastered, so they are certainly listenable and of interest to Blur fans.  It's largely a grab bag though, these tracks vary wildly in length, mastering, and quality.<br /><br />To top all of this off, the purchase of this staggering collection comes with a download code; this code allows purchasers a chase to download the entirety of this material in digital format.  Don't worry -- you don't have to rip all 21 of these discs to your PC.  :)<br /><br />It's really hard to recommend this enormous collection to many people.  Most hardcore fans will probably only be interested in the four discs of rarities, the vinyl single of \\"Superman\\", and the hardback book; for this content, 21 isn't worth the pricepoint.  However, if you are a Blur fan who doesn't happen to own any of their albums, the price of admission is well worth what is essentially everything in the band's catalog.  For fans unfamiliar with the band, I would recommend starting elsewhere -- [[ASIN:B000TETE04 Blur: The Best Of]] and [[ASIN:B000SXJMUI Parklife]] are both fine places to begin listening and stop missing out.d \\"THE SINGLES NIGHT\\").

B001NB4Z6K|5.0|Just a disclosure: I'm more of a fan of U2's work before Zooropa than after.  With that said, this greatest hits collection collects material from my favorite U2 albums (The Unforgettable Fire, The Joshua Tree, etc...) except Achtung Baby.  Collecting songs from 1980 to 1990, the greatest hits package contains many of the band's best songs, and it's a great place to start listening to this prolific band.<br /><br />Unfortunately, there's not much here for longtime fans.  And by  \\"not much,\\" I mean nothing that hasn't appeared on their albums already.  This compilation doesn't include any live tracks, demos, or B-sides.  All of these songs can be found on their studio albums.<br /><br />But, for those listeners who have yet to own a U2 album, this is a great place to start listening.  Many of the biggest hits (\\"[[ASIN:B001NB1TX2 Where The Streets Have No Name]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B001NB5BE0 With Or Without You]],\\" \\"[[ASIN:B001NAZRWM Sunday Bloody Sunday]],\\" and so on) are collected here.  If you are just interested in collecting the classic U2 songs that they play on the radio, this is a no-brainer purchase.
0345803493|5.0|So i wanted to know what all the hype was about this book. I borrowed the 1st one \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" from a friend. I was hooked! Just finished the 2nd one and i can not wait to read the Last one. I must admit and warn those who haven't read it yet that the writing is not so good. What i mean by that is because it is very repetitive in both books. I knew this before i started reading them i just didn't care because i needed to know the hype. If it wasn't for the character Christian Grey, I think i would have put the book down long time ago. E L James makes this mans character sound so dreamy & irresistible and i'm sad to say but not ashamed, i'm on the \\"In Love With Christian Grey\\" Band Wagon! The story is great! The writing not so much...BUT i can not wait to see the MOVIE!!!!!
B005869U6G|3.0|When I asked a friend what he thought about IF NOT NOW, WHEN?, he replied \\"I've always wondered when Incubus would release a bad record, and it looks like this album's title gives me the answer.\\"<br /><br />Incubus has made a healthy career of trapping forward thinking alternative rock music into digestible melodies. Before this album, the band's 2006 release LIGHT GRENADES ranked among the band's best. Incubus showed no signs of slowing down. Five years after the release of LIGHT GRENADES, the band followed up with IF NOT KNOW, WHEN? While Incubus's albums have all largely deviated from one another, this album represents a stark change in the band's sound. The creative hallmarks that framed past albums have been replaced with a more \\"adult alternative\\" sound. It's certainly a more mature move, but it's one that doesn't always pay off.<br /><br />To initially promote the album, Incubus released \\"Adolescents\\" as their first lead single. The song is decidedly one of the heaviest on the album. The biggest risk that Incubus has taken with this record is that they've not taken any risks. Many of these tracks are straight-forward, down-tempo ballads. The majority of these songs, especially in the first half of the album's run time, sound like sedated versions of A CROW LEFT OF THE MURDER outtakes; there are several points in the album where the music feels as if it is moving in slow motion. Some of these more mellow songs are quite good, the first two tracks \\"If Not Now, When?\\" and \\"Promises, Promises\\" begin the album with considerable promise. Unfortunately, the formula introduced here isn't improved on through the album's run time. Gone is Mike Einziger's manic guitarwork, gone is Ben Kenney's noodling rival bass, gone is Brandon Boyd's lyrical wordplay. In the five years since LIGHT GRENADES, Incubus has put on their serious faces.<br /><br />There are a few interesting points on IF NOT NOW, WHEN? though. \\"Switchblade\\" sticks out like a painfully sore thumb -- the vocal melody doesn't suit the song, and the song doesn't suit the album. \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" edges towards progressive-rock territory, and it ends in a fantastic and energetic climax. Unfortunately, the ending of \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" feels like one of the only moments that Incubus is feeling anything at all. The most frustrating thing about this release is that Incubus's new sound has potential -- it has so much potential. They aren't able to capitalize on it here though.<br /><br />Ever since Incubus's initial FUNGUS AMONGUS LP, I haven't been let down by an Incubus album -- until now. I will repeat: it's not because I don't like the direction the band has taken; the songs here just don't seem to have received the same attention-to-detail that past releases have. Instead, the band sounds to be honing in on one precise, mellow sound, as opposed to their usual willingness to experiment and play in the studio. Essential tracks to sample/download: \\"If Not Now, When?\\" \\"In the Company of Wolves,\\" and \\"Adolescents.\\" IF NOT NOW, WHEN? certainly isn't a bad album, but it's a bad album for Incubus.l melody doesn't suit the song, and the song doesn't suit the album. \\"In the Company of Wolves\\" edges towards progressive-rock territory, and it ends in a fantastic and energetic climax.

0345803485|3.0|I notice that quite allot of people are slamming this book. While I agree that it is more vanilla than I'd like, and also a bit unrealistic, I enjoyed the book. Maybe I liked it BECAUSE It came across as a teen girls perfect man fantasy. Sometimes it's fun to go to that place. But yes, she practically squirts at his every move, and there is really not a single unlikable trait about the character of Mr. Grey.
B006ZCWTXS|4.0|I'm a rock guy but like this album a lot. If you like Adele, and I do, this is the next step. (I think that Adele is done now that she is preggers with a dopey guy.)Check out this new, young talent.
B0071R43MG|1.0|I just received this Blu-ray from Amazon here in Brasil.<br />I am praying for years for \\"Satriani in San Francisco\\" comes out in Blu-ray. Will we have it someday?<br />For while, there is this BD, another GREAT show of Satriani and his band.<br />There is one BIG problem, the aspect ratio informed by Amazon is 1.77:1 for the Blu-ray  and for the DVD is 1.33:1 (4 x 3).<br />The blu-ray ray of  Satriani that I received  looks like just a little larger than the traditional  1.33:1.<br />I have anothe Blu-rays of shows with 1.78:1 aspect ratio and they look like a  \\"REAL RETANGLE\\" (16 x 9).<br />Why the Satriani Blu-ray  is more for a \\"4 x 3\\" ???<br />Obs: I use an excellent Infocus IN81  and  project in 120\\".<br />Someone can EXPLAIN ME ???
B000HIVQD0|4.0|A very good album got an upgrade. The second disc of bonus material is spotty. Why not some more live stuff? They were around for only two albums but the original group was talented and  memorable.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its not really needs but I love it:) I recommend it too everyone!! and I'm not just saying that! I love sex though
0547258305|5.0|People say, \\"Don't judge a book by it's cover,\\" but this book is as incredible as the cover!  I enjoyed every page and the story was wonderfully crafted.  I finished this book in a day and a half, and still think about the characters, and am a little obsessed!  This book reminded me how fun reading was, and I have started to read just about everything hoping that it will be just as action packed and lovely as Graceling.<br /><br />I love Katsa, I especially love Po, and I hope that Kristin Cashore continues their story elsewhere in another book.  It doesn't sit well with me that I might not ever read about them again.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|I always know how much battery life I have now and its easy to understand. it is very useful to have
B007MNV5WU|1.0|just got the update and it wiped all my games and unlocked planets, plus another 99 cents to play boo to them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great except for ads and they only pop op between games. this game is a classic tome waster and perfect for my kindle.
B000Y1CWDS|5.0|They sure picked the right actors for this movie = we loved this - love the comic book heroes - ( Superman) Batman Begins is the best)  Fantastic 4 = etc...
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|I don't know why I waited to see this movie. It was a great \\"comic book\\" movie.<br /><br />The script isn't perfect. Pacing becomes problematic.<br /><br />But the performances sold me on this film. First, they got a stable of fantastic character actors: Tommy Lee Jones, Stanley Tucci, Toby Jones, Hugo Weaving, Richard Armitage, Neal McDonough ... And these actors obviously had fun with the roles. Some of the acting is a little hammy, but it works. Chris Evans makes a wonderful Captain America giving his character an innocence and essential decency that never becomes preachy or camp. Hayley Atwell is good as the love interest and Dominic Cooper also stood out as Iron Man's dad (he did a lot with a little, IMO).<br /><br />This also had one of the better soundtracks of any of the superhero movies. While not reaching the heights of Back to the Future, Silvestri turns in a rousing score on this one. Although, I suspect it is Alan Menken's contribution, \\"Star Spangled Man,\\" that will stick with most people.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|My wife and I greatly enjoyed this show, such great stories, such great actors!  There is such a depth of story, tha the world comes alive, now I can't wait to read the books!
0345803485|5.0|I believe this series is a fun love story. Sex scenes are hot but its the love they have for each other that I like the most. Christian is everyone's dream man!
0307341577|5.0|\\"Dark Places\\" is an outstanding psychological thriller by Gillian Flynn. The story is set in the rural heartland. The main character, Libby Day, is forced to revisit the night, when she was 6, which her family was brutally murdered. The story telling is crisp. The characters are vividly drawn. The plot twists you into knots. This is a great piece of writing.
B007ZRZF8I|5.0|this game is absolutely the bomb it is great on my kindle fire and i love it! i started playing on my friends ipod and i found it here in the appstore and had to get it.
B00881VLCE|3.0|i like it but the puzzle pieces are next to the ads so sometimes it goes to the ads instead. having the option to change what background color the puzzle is done should be an option.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|Liam Neeson is a bad ass. But even he can only make a shoddy poem go so far. Wolves and Alaska also make this exciting.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Great game fun and fully interactive!  I love how cute the graphics are its also comical.  I would love to try the other games like doodlefarm etc.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|I have to say, 110% better than A Thousand suns; this album is a cumulation of all of Linkin Park's talent and ability. The musical styles of this album resemble the bests of all of their previous works. As a fan of Meteora, Hybrid Theory, Reanimation, and Minutes to Midnight, I can safely say that there is at least 2 songs on Living Things for any kind of LP fan; the rap, the screamo, the alt. rock, and even some slower songs. Check it out, for there is little to disappoint in this one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app its great the games r fun and addictive some r hard but never gotten to play most of these games before
B007MNV5WU|1.0|One of the biggest issues I have with the Andriod Platform is we can never get the same versions as with the iOS platform. Where is the Danger Zone Levels on my Kindle Fire? My iPhone has it. Chalk this up to another reason why I will be getting the new 7inch iPad when it's comes out this fall. I love Amazon, but the Kindle Fire and it's App Store is terrible. It really gets on my nerves when apps are updated on my iPhone and weeks later, if ever, on my Kindle Fire. Why is that? Amazon, you're killin my love for the Kindle Fire. Per Amazon's web page for Angry Birds Space HD (Kindle Fire)the new version is 1.2.2....Why won't it update. What do I have to do to get the lastest version!!! Again, nothing is ever easy or the same for any device on the Andriod Platform....Sorry Amazon, I will be turning in my Kindle Fire this fall for a 7inch iPad!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fully engaging characters who are stuck in a post-apocalyptic tin can.  Enjoyed the story from beginning to the end.  Will definitely be reading the rest of the series.  Good show!
0345472322|5.0|This book has been very instrumental in my own personal and professional growth.  It helps to be able to identify differing Mindsets so you can relate to others and be able to reflect on yourself as you sense changes in your mindset given circumstances.  I wrote a little about it on my site, feel free to check it out.    [...]
B006LSZECO|5.0|An excellent book!  Keeps you guessing from the start to the finish!  Although you can guess twist no. one at the beginning, you're never quite sure if you're right.  And turns out further twists keep your first guess not quite right!  Couldn't put it down!
B0086700CM|4.0|this is a cool game but on my kindle it freezes its still scoop game and on my iphone it works good
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it's okay. It's not exactly what I expected. It's okay if you like classic games. Still an okay game overall.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This product is perfect for my Kindle Fire.  It's sturdy yet lightweight.  Great protection for the device's screen.  Texture assures the Fire stays where I want it to.  Flips up for easy reading.  Very happy with this purchase.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If your thinking about getting a set of firefly and have access to blu ray this set is the spot on choice. If you've seen it on dvd or have it on dvd already the picture of this set is truly great compared to the dvd. I watched the series on dvd when I borrowed it from a friend and just got my blu ray set in the mail just now and I can already tell huge differences from just watching the pilot. The 1080P picture of the blu ray is no comparison. For a little technical details it is unique they kept the original \\"grain\\" that the show had and was intended when it was filmed but remastered in 1080p. Some reviewers have complained the show doesn't look as good as other blu rays because of it and other reasons but I personally think it is unique to the show. You will see when you watch the set it is a perfect balance of keeping the original authentic feel of the show and making it look great on blu ray. No this set does not look as good as a new release top of the line movie but even still it is very surprising how well the transfer worked. If you are a hardcore fan of firefly trust me and get this or if you have it on dvd and have the money get this set. It is the best the show can possibly look right now and makes it that much more enjoyable. The only downfall is it is pretty expensive compared to the dvd (almost double or more somewhere in high 30's to 50 or 60 dollars depending) but is it worth it by far. Shell out the extra penny and have a set that will last for years whereas your cheating yourself with the dvd as this show is probably going to look as good as it ever will at least for the foreseeable future.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|up until 8&times;8 does it get challenging, and usually you can assume the right patterns by looking for colors near each other. however, the higher levels won't use the whole board and you are forced to fill the whole grid in. it luckily doesn't predict lines zigzagging in a 2&times;6 section.
B007US9NA8|4.0|I have struggled with traing tips and varying my routines. I have found everything I need in this book. I'll be using these methods and ideas for a long time to come.
0345803485|2.0|50 Shades of<br />-Annoying lip biting, painfully syrup-ie emails, and \\"Really Miss Steele, Mr Grey?\\". Reflection of our society? Wow I thought we got past the Barbarella stage a long time ago. Go figure.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|Anyone who has ever chucked at the fate of the poor sap in the red shirt will be very satisfied o have experienced this story.<br /><br />I was very happy to see all the old cliches poked at in this book, but one of my favorites was notably absent: why didn't the Captain always get the girl?
B007SGM084|3.0|So there is all this hype about these books, but the reality is they are extremely repetitive.  Not a bad read altogether, but not a great read either.<br /><br />The story between Christian and Ana is cute, and semi-interesting; however, the character development isn't great. I was annoyed with the character Ana, as well, she is overly emotional, and cries, a lot!  Out of all of them the 3rd book, for me, was the most interesting.  The Epilogue was interesting and I wish the author would have wrote more.<br /><br />Christian's First Christmas, should have been in the 2nd book, and instead of writing the extra 50 Shades at the end of the 3rd book I wish that would have been in the 1st book. I would almost tell anyone to read the First Christmas, before even venturing into the books, and then when you read about Ana's and Christian's 1st meeting go to the end of the 3rd book and read it from Christian's perspective, but save the Epilogue til the end.<br /><br />I hope that E.L. James writes a 4th book, and develops Christian's and Ana's relationship more, and actually develops the relationship beyond sex.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is the best. its fun to play when you're bored.to those who are giving bad reviews: ur just so weird. this game is fun...u guys are just boring and like to hate on games for no reason. if u are complaining that it crashes, its probably ur kindle. I'm happy its finally on the kindle fire. u guys should be too
B007SGM084|5.0|So it wasn't the best literature in the world... it was still a very fun book to read. I recommend it completely.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|good it was a fun intertaining game I loved it. I loved to play I got so addicted to it i had the toke of my life playing it.
0345803507|1.0|It was so horrid, I couldn't finish it.  Quite frankly, I'm shocked I got through the first two books.  I'm so glad i didn't have to pay for them.  I would be demanding my money back.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|like<br /><br />I enjoy playing this game. Its great for kids and a game to show them responsibility. My child told me this is a lot of work. Lol
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|Testament is just one of many of the old guard thrash bands to come roaring back with a vengeance within the last decade. While some of the bands have released pretty decent albums, only a few have released some that can stand strongly with their classic canon. Ironbound and The Electric Age from Overkill, Violent Revolution-Phantom Antichrist from Kreator and of course Testament's Formation of Damnation and this lastest, Dark Roots of the Earth. This album is an incredible, perfectly mixing the band's classic sound with modern metal edge. Production is great, but like alot of modern albums, sometimes gets monotonous after a while. Fortunately, the music and songs keep this album more than interesting. Musician ship is excellent, with thrashs most notably duo of Skolnik/Peterson laying down some great riffs and solos, with great vocals and growls from Chuck, great bass work from Greg, and of course returning to the kit since 1997's Demonic, The Atomic Clock Gene Hoglan.<br /><br /> Rise Up starts the album off with as a great opener. Native Blood is a great catchy song that proudly shows Chuck Billy's heritage is a great anthem, and features some excellent off-the-chart drumming from Gene. The title track incoporates a brooding sense of doom that fits perfectly with the lyrics. True American Hate is a great thrash song and a great choice for the first single. A Day in the Death starts out with some sick bass from Greg and features some great lyrics. Then there's Cold Embrace, the album's slower, ballad-esque song. This song is has classic Testament written all over it, easily relatable to The Ballad, The Legacy, Return To Serenity, etc. Man Kills Mankind keeps the album's momentum going & features some great riffs and lyrics. Throne of Thorns is definitely one of the standout cuts(although every song could be a contender), a great epic and some amazing lead work. Last Stand for Independence is a great closer song with very speedy, catchy riffs to end this excellent album. The deluxe edition features four bonus tracks, an excellent take on Queen's Dragon Attack in which the band totally make it their own, the Scorpion's Animal Magnetism which is down right haunting, Iron Maiden's Powerslave which the band fully respects and adds a modern flare to, and finally and extended, uncut version of Throne of Thorns that doesn't fade at the end. Overall, the album is a triumph for the band and the genre, showing the age has no boundaries for quality music.album.

B008KRJWEK|5.0|this app is awesome I think this app should be 1dollor that's how good it is. get the app people
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I finished reading 'Wool' (Omnibus Ed.) in the wee hours this morning. This is an incredible read! I was hooked from the very beginning and raced through all five books. If you love sci-fi then you need to read this. It's awesome! Can't wait to read more about the Silos. Hugh Howey is now one of my favorite authors.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I've never been so tiered and I've never taken so many naps if your tiered get this app and you will be sleep in no time
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This app is amazing! I made a really great combination of sounds and they all play really cleanly. This app was worth the money...<br />Oh wait! It was free!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|My daughter was playing and the next thing I know I have 30 dollars charged to my kindle account for some kind of packs!!! you can't get the charges off it is just a loss of money. I watch her with games so not sure how this happened but I uninstalled one purchase alone was 16.99! another was 7.99! be very careful this game is tricky!!!
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a good game until you get to a puzzle that you think you have solved but it doesn't give you credit and there are no hints.
B00009YXHN|4.0|4 Stars = Classic<br /><br />I feel \\"Bride of the Re-Animator\\" gets a bum rap. Sure, it's not as good as it's predecessor, \\"The Re-Animator, but it's a classic!<br /><br />Jeffery Combs as \\"Herbert West,\\" is black comedic genius! Black hearted & ambitiously delusional as ever! It is Combs who drives this film over the top, but he does have help along the way. Most of the great characters are back from the first film, even David Gale as \\"Dr. Carl Hill,\\" is back as a flying bat winged head, a real scene stealer, & a sure knee slapper! Bruce Abbot as \\"Dan Cain\\" plays the straight man again, getting sucked in to Herbet West's maniacal schemes. You'd thought he'd of learned by now, LOL!<br /><br />The special effects are great, as this film is another gorenaza! Especially funny is an eye ball with four fingers attached to it, crawling all over the place, well, until it meets it's demise. The ending is a slam bang freak show of the first order, as Herbert's creations rebell against him, as he screams, \\"rejects\\" at them! Funny stuff!<br /><br />If you have not seen this film, then by all means do so. If you have, but seen the \\"Re-Animator\\" first & thought this film was a waste, then watch this again with no expectations. You just might find this a great re-anitmation of the first film!
B004JHYRP4|3.0|I've long enjoyed and admired Asimov's fiction. I read this book many years ago but had forgotten the story. I decided I'd give it another read on a whim.<br /><br />Initially, I found it a bit tiresome, slightly confusing, and a bit naive, but I eventually learned to like the characters and found a way to care about their problems. The second part of the book was simply stunning. The way a whole new world in a different dimension is conceived is breathtaking. This is what delineates a great writer from us mortals. To weave a plausible culture into a world so far removed from our own is the work of genius. The third part was the least satisfying of the sections. At times the tedium was overwhelming. The dialogue was excruciating, the pace as torpid as settling dust on the moon. And the many acts of coincidence and just-what-was-neededness to wrap up the storyline tested my desire to suspend all disbelief.<br /><br />Statistically then, the whole shebang rates dead average, but the magnificent centre section pulls the rating past two and a half, to three.
B002BE7JEI|5.0|5 Stars = Masterpiece<br /><br />If there was ever a movie whose title is the definitive definition of the word, it is this film, & I mean that in a good way!!!<br /><br />Thrilling, chilling, dreadful, suspense, are just a few words to describe this nightmare scenario! But, this could've never been pulled off without out the masterful acting that lies with in the two leads of this film! Astonishing! Might want to include the directing in there too, astonishing! Oh, & the script, astonishing!<br /><br />From the mind & fears of author Stephen King!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Is not for everyone! This app is very satisfactory it gets the job done!!! I like how it changes color and shows you details about your battery!
B002Q7JYPC|2.0|Love the Eagles but this CD was quite a let down, had three good songs and a lot of filler and instrumental stuff.  Maybe they should do the hits and focus more on quality and wait for a really deserving showcase of their talent.  Missing Felder in the mix.  Time to realize it's more than a two man show.
B008MEM24S|5.0|very challenging.  my kids love it...better than where's my water.  hope to see more games like this.  maybe even a cars one
0345536886|2.0|This book is quite boring compared to his old books.  I agree with others in that it starts off really slow and kind of ends on a whimper.  The book is poorly researched and I didn't learn anything new from it, like it did with his older material.  On the plus side, it's a really easy read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good easy to use. fun easy yo understand. my friends enjoy it. fast moves quick.  fun fun fun. I like it
