B009XIXVU6|3.0|Many stories but I was put off as we had to endure the life story of yet another character again and again.  They were all connected in a way but  I wanted them to intersect more than start new into another persons life.  I got through it but wouldn't enthusiastically recommend as a great summer read.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|the game is good but there is one thing that is slowing the game play sometimes it glitches and says there is an enemy on a spot when there is no enemy there that is all
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really like this app. It was worked really well and is easy to use. It is a very fun and challenging game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME THEY ARE SO CUTE.... MY KIDS LOVE IT ALSO I TELL EVERYONE ABOUT IT SO THEY CAN DOWNLOAD IT AS WELL...........
B00821OX98|5.0|I love smart, well acted sci-fi, and Falling Skies is it!  I had not watched any of the episodes until Season 3 was about to start.  I'm addicted and can't wait to see what happens next!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Grandson saw this Despicable Me: Minion Rush offer today and absolutely loves it.  Who doesn't love the Minions and the Despicable Me movies!  Thanks Amazon!
B003DFJW9E|4.0|I love the movie and the soundtrack is one that I listen to. If you liked the movie, I would recommend it.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Love this book!!!  So excited to see it come to the movies!  An amazing tribute to the 80's and the beginning of the electronic age!  Time to watch all of wade's movies!
B000V8A31C|5.0|I love this album and I listen to this every day. This is a great soundtrack to listen to over and over again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|one thing I don't like about it is that hero Bryan is always atacking me but it is still fun
B0058W74UY|1.0|I tried to use this on my Kindle and it did not work. It is free, but it is not worth it.
0060594896|4.0|Great information which is well laid out. Sometimes we forget things that are important and this book brings those things into focus.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|We both love Star Wars. I got this for his birthday. It is a great price for the set and the extra materials is great.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I enjoy the show.  It has just enough quirks into to keep it interesting. I am waiting for the next season
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|It is basically a remake of subway surfers . Its a cool remake especially which corillates with despicable me . Basically above fair
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a very fun game. Hard not to spend real cash though. I have deleted it and replayed it a few times now.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I have a kindle fire and this app worked for about a month. Then it froze up and said its not working. Then I tried to get on other apps and they wouldn't work either. So I deleted everything I downloaded form that and the app. Then everything started to worked again. So take my advice and don't get this app!!!!!!!!!!!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Proved to be better than I expected. Loved all the smashing and nothing left standing..<br />As always, a digital copy is very useful when travelling
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!!! I luv it. It is great. Go subway surfers. Plus its free ... awesome.<br />GO GET IT!<br /><br />:)
B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|I am a Michael Douglas fan. Bought this movie so that I could watch it with Money never sleeps. Would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good drama and good acting.
B009E3EY38|5.0|The album is simple amazing! Forget the bad reviews saying that they don´t show the same \\"vitality\\" of their 20´s (?! really, they are on their 60´s! what else do you want?)<br /><br />They still as good as always.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|versatile and accessible from multi devices - best of all is the Amzaon MP3 stre that feeds it, best music at best prices.
B00594XOZU|1.0|Doesn't work on kindle fires. I tried to use this app on my kindle but it didn't work, disappointment at its best
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A great story. Whole new perspective on the German air force and its aces .  It was also fascinating to learn of the very different political views within the Third Reich, and how much of the Luftwaffe was not in the Nazi party.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Although, I am only up to level 8, I found the rooms to be somewhat challenging, but not too much.  This is a good exercise in logic, math, pattern recognition, and combinations of all.  I think this would be good to help teach younger bright children in what and how to observe things, stepping up to thought challenges and problem solving.  I would recommend that an adult sit with the and help only when necessary.  I'm 63, so this is a good brain exercise for me when I get home from work.
1416550534|3.0|I like the subject matter very much...the English setting before and after World War I at an English manor.  The characters are well developed...especially Grace, the maid at the manor and then the lady's maid for Hannah at their townhouse in London.  It just kind of drags at times.  The print is awfully small and difficult for these old eyes to read.  But overall, I enjoyed the book.
B007KK5P5I|5.0|Product was new as advertised and great quality.  For those that may have never listened to this album and are in to this genre of music, this album is a must.
B001O304US|5.0|We received the CD in good repair.  The CD holder was broken internally and prevented the CD from connecting properly within the jewel case.  The CD holder was broken, so the CD's were next to impossible.  Broken pieced throughout the box.<br /><br />The contents of the CD were tops as I remember them.  I believe the cost for some activities associated with them are not a viable alternative to buying the CD and making your own CD/MP3's on your own.<br /><br />In closing.... Buy the CD from a reputable company and make your own MP3's for your iPod, or in my case, for my Walkman MP3 player.  Just use Windows Media Player.  Practice what to do and you'll be up to my seep in no time...  Best of wishes!!<br /><br />If you run into troubles in this process, just let me know and I'll take my time to help you accomplish what you need to know.<br />Enjoy!!  Once the bugs are worked out, it's a really super device.<br /><br />Again, please post comments here for me to address as you delve further into this problem area.  In time, with patience, you will become an expert and I, a protegee.
B0013ND30M|5.0|Great classic story.  Shipped and sent on time and in great condition.<br />I am sure I will be buying more Walt Disney DVD's in the future.
0316067598|5.0|This book gives the reader just a glimpse into the life of the seals. It lets us average people see some of the sacrifice made to protect our freedom.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Great game that has great graphics and a wonderful story line ! My mama played the game with pool guy and I was upstairs studying and I could hear he was better than me on jumping and going down !
B005K17RU0|5.0|I lost the Weather Channel and downloaded AccuWeather.  It works great a d was to get accurate info.  It did all that Weather Channel offered plus more.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I just re-read this book and it's still a good read! BTW, I'm 50 years old. Finished the quintet too.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|of this game, as stated you get to explore each room and you must figure out each clue and the best part is without narration, or hints the trial and error is the addiction of puzzle solvers. Thank you for the game look forward to more levels, it reminded me of Saw sans blood and self mutilation(yes I enjoyed Saw) continue to challenge yourself and us.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|My three kids (4-8 years old) all thought this was a very funny movie. They were laughing through most of the show!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I used the word heart as the title in my review because this story had touched many facets of my heart! The story was wonderfully written and I often felt as though I was watching a movie unfold in front of my eyes. This story showed just how the heart can accept and begin to love someone as if they were born into your own family. It displayed the heart of a family and the loyalty that comes with that love. Yet, this book was also heart-wrenching. The portrayal of an unfaithful marriage and the effects it could have on the soul was heartbreaking to read but was beautifully described. I loved this book with my whole heart. It's a must read for anyone that has a heart.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great story line with many characters and a fast pace.  A great look at life in England's upper class both upstairs and down.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It is a Dictionary and I am a kid and  this book suck  what ever you do do not get this book.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|This EP is great. All the songs are quality. Good beats, melodies, lyrics. So fresh. And you actually feel more hip as a person when listening to Lorde.
B0090SI4OC|3.0|I watched the movie last night and again tonight. I'm a syfy maniac; this was no syfy movie. It could not pass as a love story either. I'm not sure what the heck it was. I do know that the background music drove me crazy! Mortuary parlor music played all through the movie. After listening to it for 2 hours, I felt like I had a chemical lobotomy! The movie would have been much better with NO MUSIC.<br />Again, Saoirse was cast in a poorly written movie. I love that young lady. I hope someone wises-up and finds her some good scripts.<br />I'm worried about her net worth too. She only has $ix million in the bank. She is a talented actor and should by this time have 20 mil.<br />And for goodness sakes, please do not put her in any more sexual or romantic scenes. I love her, but she is no Marilyn Monroe. She could not do a romantic scene to save her soul. She's not that kind of actor. She obviously gets no please from kissing men. She is very mechanical doing it. I'm not sure she is turned on by males. The best kiss she ever gave was in the movie Hanna when she kissed her female friend. Well, I give her a 4 for carrying this movie. I give the movie a 2. I give the music a minus 50.<br />Heck, buy the movie if you like Saoirse Ronan. I have all of her movies. I'll keep collecting them.
072325804X|4.0|I was looking for a good book to my daughter of 8 years old and this book is beautiful and she like it. Good price and good ilustration beside the stories of Beatrix Potter are timeless, so it's something great for a personal library for any kid.
0345472322|5.0|I have recommended this book so many times that it has become a joke in our family! I heard about it from two different sources while looking for ways to address some self-esteem and work ethic issues with my teenage son. I can honestly say that this book created a turning point in our efforts to have him take responsibility for his lack of performance, and understand that he has an attitude choice when confronting a difficult task. Carol Dweck has developed a brilliant concept that she explains very clearly, and provides lots of real-life examples that not only prove her point, but add a lot of interest. We approached Mindset as a book discussion; we read it one chapter at a time, and followed up with a discussion - sometimes just my son and I, and sometimes with our whole family. This book is an absolutely must read for EVERYONE.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just wish they wouldn't make you have to buy Jews for quests. every other part of the game is great.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This game locked up my Kindle Fire (1st gen.)  every time I tried to play it. I had to uninstall it. That's too bad because it looked like a fun game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a fun game this is. Definitely one of the best free games out there in any genre. Extremely fun and imaginitive.
B00AAX68HG|1.0|This App made my Kindle Fire freeze. We couldn't even play it. Dleted it right away. Don't waste your time.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|I read this years ago when it first came out and am passing it along to my grandaughter. She loves story's like this.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I like the fact that you can relate to life stories in these times. The creators have shown the ability to present good episodes in and out of court.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I think everyone in the movie was absolutely marvelous- great acting- wonderful screenplay. I'm a great fan of the movie and think Tiffany deserved her academy award. Don't remember if Bradley Cooper was nominated-impossible to beat Daniel Day Lewis anyway- but he deserved to be nominated. a Really original romantic comedy- very modern. The two stars almost Danced their rolestogethher. Everone who has seen it - including my husband who dislikes most movies- loved it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I thought this book was great from beginning to end. My mom is a nurse, so this was an especially easy book for me to understand. August truly has a great personality and this book just proves that having a disability does not make you unfriendly, or gross. It also proves that if you be yourself, and are kind to others, it all comes back to you in the end.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Kevin Bacon is great- Natalie Zea is great. I think the feloow who played the srial killer-guru was totally miscast and irt through off the balance in the story. He was neither hypnotic nor rea;;y threatening. Glad he's gone. Last episode was huge.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I watched the HBO show before reading the books, which made it much easier to understand. Great plot, lots of twists, good writing. I love it and would recommend it to anyone who is not put off my adult content.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I don't play to much my kindle fire to much but is the best app I ever play ever before
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! I love playing it with my wife good way of spending time together and finding a way to escape.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|ok so i was playing for about a day and it worked fine and it was really fun.but the next day i tried 2 open it and it won't open i deleted then got it back, i shut my kindle down and turned  back on and still get the same thing!!!
0143143492|4.0|a little to deep for me you have to really be in your journey to grasp it this is a book for people that already have  a feel on new age.
1594746168|5.0|this was a very interesting book.i really liked the way that the Author combined the printed word in the beginning with some very detailed art in the end.a very different kind of a book and very enjoyable.if you like stories that are odd and a bit mysterious then give this book a look.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This is the crowning book in this series.  It is one of the very best written, very intense and enlightening.  I really enjoy Nalini's writing and have been a big fan of the Guild Hunter series as well.
B00AB7IA1S|2.0|I gave it a 2 star rating and not a 4 star because there's a bug on level 3.7. The hot air balloon keeps crashing on the first mechanical Wind Tunnel, even though it's supposed to turn the balloons like the regular Wind Tunnels. If that bug is fixed and I can finish game I will bump it up to a 4 star.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|This incredibly insightful read combines findings from empirical research and compelling personal narratives to diagnose fundamental reasons *why* we are a Nation at Risk. How we respond to these finding about the development and importance of character strengths in our young may well determine our collective future.
0143034901|4.0|This was the first book by this author I read.  Discovered it was currently being read by several of my friends--even one in Barcelona and one in Germany.  A must read
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book is written in a clear voice and nicely drawn out characters. Interesting dialog. . It is a great read.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Felt this was much better than &#34;The Kite Runner&#34;.  I really enjoyed and felt with the characters.  Hated for it to end
B007HACDLK|5.0|This novel does not disappoint. Mitch Rapp at his best. Easily on par with the other books in the series.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved this book. I plan to read it aloud to my middle school students. Powerful messages for anyone young or old.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|I enjoyed Michael Buble, as I always do. The songlist was pleasant and easy to listen to while relaxing or busy with chores..
B005LAII8A|5.0|This movie has your attention from the minute it starts and never lets go.  Lots of action, great acting and highly recommended watch.
B0012GMVXU|5.0|Leonard Cohen has a gift in writing lyrics. They hold you stellbound. Certainly not the repetetive phrases you hear with most artists.
B00000251N|5.0|Love the mixture and reminds me of the movie every time I listen to it.  Classic singers do a wonderful job
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I have loved mahjong solitaire since I found the game on my first computer - and this one is the best I have found for my kindle. I found no problems with the game - there is a choice of tile pictures so I can choose the one that works best with my poor eyesight, I would prefer a solid background but the pics provided are pretty and I found one that wasn't too distracting. there are many tile layouts to choose from to keep from getting bored and a leaderboard to keep me trying to beat those impossibly good scores!! (never going to happen with my eyesight but my competitive nature will keep me trying!) this one is worth buying if you like mahjong solitaire, even better as the faotd!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very challenging. You have to use your brain with this game. You can also use it with FacEbook. But it always says \\"can't connect to FacEbook,try again\\". I don't know if that's happening becAuse I am trying to connect to FacEbook on a kindle fire HD. Maybe you can can only connect to FacEbook on a original kindle fire or cell phone. Other than that a very great game. =)
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|This was one of my favorite games........I don't know if this is a newer version......but instead of keeping it simple the controls are all four located on the opposite side of the screen....it's a solution ....to something that was never a problem........I still think it's good......just change the controls and make it more simple........people like simple........I think everyone should download and try for yourself.....because the game is great.....and its free......be the judge and let them know what you think...I think the button Icon size is the Only fault....so for that reason......I give this five star game.....three stars(get it fixed)
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really liked this game, it was not too hard and not too easy. now waiting on more levels to complete.
034580709X|3.0|I've read all of the Harry Hole novels as they've been translated into English. One of my all-time favorites is also the first one to be released in English, i.e. [[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]]. I've also enjoyed [[ASIN:0062068423 The Redbreast: A Harry Hole Novel]], [[ASIN:0061133981 The Devil's Star: A Harry Hole Novel]], [[ASIN:0307743187 The Leopard: An Inspector Harry Hole Novel (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]], and several others. I was predictably excited when I heard The Bat, the first book in the series, was to be released, but after reading it, I must say I feel rather disappointed. Perhaps because this was the first in the series, but it certainly is not as tightly-plotted as some of the other books in the series, and Harry Hole's character is not as well-delineated.<br /><br />The story centers on the murder investigation of a Norwegian celebrity of sorts in Australia. Harry Hole is sent to assist with the investigations Down Under and is teamed up with his Aboriginal Australian counterpart, Andrew Kensington. The first half of the story seemed to focus a little too much on providing background info on  culture and other details that I felt detracted from the actual crime that needed to be solved. The sense of suspense was not as evident as in some of the other books in the series, and it did not seem as much of a thriller but more of a slightly banal procedural. The pacing also seemed a little slow for my liking in comparison to others in the series such as The Snowman, which literally kept me on tenterhooks throughout!<br /><br />I did appreciate some of the insights into Harry's family background and also his penchant for drinking though I think Nesbo does a much more credible job in developing Harry's character in the later novels, once again, understandably so. Oh, readers also learn how to pronounce Harry's last name. I also did not like that the story's primary setting was in Australia. I think I prefer the descriptions of the Norwegian settings much more, and Nesbo does do a credible job with the Norway settings.<br /><br />I would recommend this book only to die-hard fans of the series. Frankly, I did not feel like I would have missed much in not reading this. If you are new to the Harry Hole series, I would strongly suggest reading [[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] first.of the Norwegian settings much more, and Nesbo does do a credible job with the Norway settings.<br /><br />I would recommend this book only to die-hard fans of the series. Frankly, I did not feel like I would have missed much in not reading this. If you are new to the Harry Hole series, I would strongly suggest reading [[ASIN:0307742997 The Snowman (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)]] first.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was AWESOME anyone should read it!!!! Every one will love the book and it helps you mature in life
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I wanted to buy this game after i played it at my friends, fast shipping, easy to understand! I absolutely love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is very addicting has good graphics and alot of upgrades for your vehicles<br />And this game is a highlight when im bored
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Outstanding novel, kept me engaged throughout and a real page turner.  It's a story that I will never forget.  Good humor, serious issue and I laughed and cried up to the end.  One of the best books I've ever read!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|My daughter loves the game, I think is fun,(when l can play).<br />I enjoy K-Fire HD. The games that are payable of coins,ok. But pay of money is ridiculous!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|You can ride your horse in competitions and dress them in cool paddock clothes. You can buy as many horses as you want and can earn gems and coins by doing fun tasks.I LOVE this game.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|The boy turned 10 today and this arrived mid day! A great present for my lego ~ Minecraft fanatic.<br />He has been building like crazy. Nice to see him do something 3 dimensional related to Minecraft and take a break from Minecraft on line!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|You can jump on trains and dodge obstacles. The game starts to get really fast so you have to use your reflexes. This game is awesome!
0634014331|5.0|This book has some great information on how Hammond organs work, various settings to use for different styles of music, etc.  It also has complete musical examples for different genres/styles of music.  Kind of a history/instruction book combination.  There are not many books out there on Hammond Organ or organ methods strictly for the Hammond (or other similar drawbar) organ.
B0050BPJ50|5.0|Very good album, I discover some songs that I never heard before. A good way to discover more about inna's debut.
B002YCVX5S|5.0|Without a doubt Inglorious Basterds has raised the bar for Tarantino in regards to his ability to craft and maintain an engrossing flick.  From the intriguing beginning to the explosive and justifiable finale, I was hooked and enthralled.  Without revealing any storyline tidbits, I'll simply give a few more reasons why you should invest in this motion picture. Brad Pitt's character was by far my favorite (mainly due to his southern GI JOE style) character. Christoph Waltz's potrayal as the &#34;Jew Hunter&#34; Nazi also had me on the edge of my chair. Well now you've been made aware of 2 reasons why this is a movie worthy of purchase and collecting.  I can now say that Quentin Tarantino is perhaps one of the most gifted and brightest film makers in the history of American Cinema if not the most underrated.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use facebook often so this was a must have app for me. It helped that it was free. I have no problems with it so far and would tell others if I did to help them out. Would recommend it.
B00BS3EMNY|5.0|Fantastic voice. Buy this along with her first album and you can probably get rid of all your other cd's
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Good graphics except for the monkies when<br />you trip--they are too big and you really can't<br />see the upcoming trail with any clarity
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|Amazing movie.  Remarkable performances by young actors . Great casting. Breathtaking ending. This movie Is ranked among my all time favorites!
B0076NKLRQ|5.0|It was a great movie. My gf enjoyed watching it together. Loved the ending. I would  definitely watch it again!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minions! so adorable. this game is very addictive.  don't start playing if you gave to be somewhere in the next few days.
0060555661|5.0|If you are looking for Benjamin Graham, it is because you already know something about him and want to hear what he has to say.  With this book, you won't be dissappointed.  The comments by Zweig are a little long but I'm not as critical as others have been.  Zweig does try (and succeeds often) in relating Graham's comments to more recent events.  We don't have Graham any longer to do it for himself so Zweig is as good as any.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|the best running game I've played ever and I hope they have up dates to make it better also I hope it doesn't freeze
B0051UH6W4|4.0|What a great read! Book club read and I was a bit skeptic at the beginning. I grew to love the playful use of words. The back and forth in the story line! I loved the tears that could not come but the deep sense of sadness I had!<br /><br />I cannot wait for the discussion with my girls at Unbound book club!
B004742Y68|5.0|If you're looking for the definitive 80's horror move, this is the movie for you.  Well directed, this movie is nostalgia filled, and will leave you wanting to see the rest of the trilogy.
B000ID1J0E|5.0|I'm just seeing this move for the first time. And I am hooked!! Johnny Depp is a fool! OMG! cracked up the entire movie! Excellent!!!
B00B7FXZQS|5.0|I would recommend this movie to anyone who has seen the previous 3 paranormal activities.  The movie fits well with the ongoing storyline of the others, and is in my opinion the best of them yet.
B009R659L8|4.0|Another Good One from Mary Higgins Clark. Bought as a gift. I was told its not her best, but still an enjoyable read
B001TKMAGW|5.0|This is Ozzy young and amazingly focused on delivering a new and heavy sound!  This cannot be beaten on any level.  Outtakes rule.
B008OOYALE|1.0|This game requires long periods where you can do nothing. Ten hours for eggs to hatch, 12 hours to build a farm. There is just no interaction. Earning coins is slow, and mostly only available through your habitats. To clear land for your habitats requires hundreds of thousands of coins, but habitats only produce hundreds per hour. Again long, long periods of inactivity waiting for enough coins to expand. The graphics are nice, but I prefer to actually be involved in a game, not just waiting for stuff to happen.
B001D2AYCI|5.0|This was my 1st Sabbath CD from the mid 80's.  The sound quality back then was not great.  This definitely is a cleaned up version...plus the outtakes!
B005TBN3EU|2.0|I downloaded a bunch of movies for a long flight and started with the Hangover 2. There were two funny scenes in the entire movie. Surprisingly the movie Parental Guidance (PG-13) made me laugh until tears rolled down my cheeks. I love the actors and the characters in the Hangover but the movie just wasn't funny.
0757302661|5.0|This book helps you curb your fears of child birth, it is a great insight into the mind and helps expecting mom's to understand what to do to be calm and peaceful during the storm.
B00COQKE2M|5.0|Just simply loved it, its all over the place and couldn't be happier with this new cd! Highly recommend! Screaming, singing, punky, funny and even small rap.  Awesome!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I cannot believe how much I love this book and the entire trilogy.  Great writing and all the time I was reading this, I kept thinking that this could be a true story somewhere out there.  Could not put it down.  A true chick book and the ending was perfect.
B008JFUTT0|1.0|Not happy bought 2 x DVDs and both won't play as it says ' wrong region ' really disappointed as I was excited to watch it and one was a gift.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I was looking for a movie that I could just sit and enjoy on a hot summer afternoon.  This is a nice feel good movie that should hold the interest of kids and adults.  The story line is typical of a kids movie but there are some funny lines and the CGI is well done.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am currently obsessed by books about &#34;what's next&#34; after humans destroy civilization.  Go figure.  But this book was better written, more compelling and thought provoking than I expected, especially for such a low price.  The characters are well drawn and the mental images suitably claustrophobic.  I did not want it to end.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|For a Nation that prides itself in breaking away from the mother country, we all remain enchanted by the old country.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version and Hi-Def viewing is a must to fully appreciate this period piece but give credit to the storyline as well.<br /><br />Yes, America has gone crazy for Downton Abbey.....it is a must see.
B001453LSI|5.0|This album is wonderful.  It's relaxing, it's deep, it's a hit.<br /><br />I can listen to every song all day long.
0307730697|4.0|Great book! It really adds a personal story that differentiates it from your normal navy<br /><br />Seal book. I found it to be motivating and inspirational
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I have mixed feelings about this book.  It was enjoyable, but it was also a let down.  Perhaps my expectations for romance were higher, but it was decent.<br /><br />I honestly read it, because I wanted to see the movie.  I thought I'd read the book ahead of time.  It was enjoyable, but I won't continue the series.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I liked it very much even though there was a lot of cliche and predictable scenarios it was refreshing to watch a European film with a bit of different flavor.
B0073PPKNM|5.0|This is a beautiful album.  It's melodic and full of her amazing voice.<br /><br />I highly recommend this album.  Two thumbs up.
B00DEG4Z1W|5.0|My little girl loves this game!!! She cannot put it down!! She loves the different styles that she can create!!!
B008XNZMOU|4.0|This is my third favorite country music CD. I love Taylor Swift I have three CD by her and I loved this CD called \\"Red\\". My favorite songs on this CD are \\"22\\" and \\"I Knew You Were Trouble\\" and \\"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\\" and \\"Red\\". All of these songs are my favorite on this CD. Another great and excellent album from an awesome singer yet again. She is always a class act and a great country singer. I love all of her music all together.
0399157565|1.0|I have only read a few of the kay scarpetta novels, this will be the last at best is a 100 page novella crammed into a thick paperback.  Did you know that benson had a firm jaw.  Did you want to know what kind of shoes the crime technican was wearing, oh but they were only the finest european.  Did you know marino tried to rape her once, or benson dissappeared and tortured her heart.  Did you want to know what kind of furniture the crime victim had...... guess...... yes i know you can  \\"fine french antiques\\". Did you want to hear long digressions about all the \\"fine\\" the \\"best\\" and as many french terms as cornwell can squeeze in.  keep in mind that scarpetta only has the best, is the best cook, is the best at everything.  Its interminable and tedious skip this horrible book.

0307887960|5.0|Some people, like me, are predisposed genetically to be overweight.  Not only that, but once I've lost weight on a diet plan, my body &#34;learns&#34; how to not &#34;fall&#34; for that again.  So, for example, when I was in my early 20's, I lost weight on Weight Watchers, but when I tried to lose it again, my body would not shed the weight... After being very hungry all week, I'd lose 1/4 lb per week, if I was lucky.  One cannot take that torture for long.<br /><br />South Beach, and Adkins also worked for me, but  I didn't have the time to cook for South Beach, and I needed portion control that was absent in Adkins.  In addition, I've had my gall bladder removed, so my doctor recommended a low-fat diet.  Thus, the low-fat, low carb diet recommended by Dukan agreed very well with me.  I lost weight quickly, and the low carb element kept my hunger at bay while consuming very few calories.<br /><br />I liked being able to eat low-fat yogurt and milk products on this diet.  It was unique in that aspect, and am now convinced that the sugar found in dairy helps you to burn fat.<br /><br />In addition, the weight, for the most part, stayed off.  When I returned to the plan to lose more, it worked again.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I have been looking for a calander app for my Kindle Fire for awhile now.<br />I tried two others that were free and would not sync with google calander<br />This is the first app I've ever paid for but its also the most useful.<br />I love all the font adjustments because I was able to adjust for my<br />weaker eyes. The calander flows well from month to day or week and<br />back. Now my phone and KF have the same appointments, and I can share<br />the month etc. by emailing a PDF. Worth the small amount I paid.
B002C6A6N6|4.0|We have not seen all the series but as a whole the colors and sound are great. Have had one episode that disc is damaged. We have not notified Amazon of that. We are waiting to check all disc out.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|The word amazing does not describe this free app. Best kindle game so far. 5 stars is not enough to actually rate this game. Wow!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Grabbed my interest immediately.  The book brought sadness and humor.  I was horrified to learn that the story was based on some actual events, which are heartbreaking.  Lovely ending.  Well done,  Ms. McKenna.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Excellent game. Graphics are spectacular for a game program. The game moves along. Didn't have any problems with downloading or operating game on my Fire and Samsung tablet &amp; phone.
B0055Q5F36|5.0|We were aware of the quality of the case before making this purchase, having talked it over with a couple of friends who recommended the product. I was purchasing a new phone for my wife and smart phones being an expensive accessory, i wanted it to have the protection offered by using the &#34;Otterbox&#34;. A decent price and good deal all around.
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Good album and it was at a REALLY good price!  I paid only $7.00 for the entire album when iTunes still has it for $12.00!  Great deal for a good album!  Really easy to transfer to my iTunes to put it on my iPhone and iPod!!!  Very happy!!!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Quentin Tarantino masterfully displays one of the most relevant issues in American history. He delicately places his style of dark humor while at the same time shows the pain and ignorance that was a major part of slavery and human relations. Often times, the inhumane treatment towards the slaves is extremely difficult to watch but unfortunately accurate. You don't have to be a fan of westerns to receive the full impact that this movie portrays.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved it!! Very challenging to figure out how the pieces fit together. Wish there were more levels!! Can't wait for the next update.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Excellent James Bond movie! I have not viewed the Blu Ray version nor done the Digital Copy deal yet.  I recommend this movie for avid movie lovers everywhere.
B00005R24K|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, funny to think the special effects were so &#34;state of the art&#34; at the time this movie was made. Brought back fun teenage memories of being scared out of my wits and unable to fall asleep after watching it.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I'm in love with this series tough season though.. I love  these people. the are like family to me.I look forward to next season
B00AB7IA1S|3.0|Decent brain game... but developer needs to fix Rotating Fan glitch on level 3.7 (and on, I assume) so that further levels may be enjoyed.
B006LSZECO|3.0|It was an odd book with lots of twists which really held your attention. I got tired of reading the f word multiple times on each page.
B00947N6UG|5.0|Both our 5 and 7 year old really love this movie. I will add that some of the parts are scary to them (with Boogie Man is the villain), and my daughter does get mildly scared. But they have watched it for their TV time every day since receiving it (I think were up to 10 days in a row)
0345525558|4.0|I liked the story and the use of the flowers and there meanings as a part of the story. We are reading it for our book club.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|This is a great filler game for when you have 15 minutes until someone arrives. Just enough strategy to keep from being boring.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It has just the right difficulty level to keep you interested. The levels get gradually harder but get your inquisitive mind thinking.
B000KITQK2|4.0|This unit is very, very good and reasonable price.  Can turn on or off as needed.  Excellent sound shaping before input to amp and boosts volume ot reduces volume as needed.
0452295548|5.0|My doctor kindly suggested I read this book. Before I read it I thought my diagnosis was the end of the world- figuratively speaking. Afterwards, I found hope. Someone got it! I then bought more copies of the book for my husband and family. Now I can explain what is happening and I can focus on the joy of the new things I am learning and the fun person I am becoming. I highly recommend this for anyone with brain damage, who knows someone with brain damage, or works with anyone with brain damage. Words are not enough but \\"Thank you Jill. Thank you.\\"
B000002AGN|5.0|I first heard Dave Brubeck's &#34;Time Out&#34; when I was growing up. My Dad was a huge jazz fan , and we always had jazz playing on the turntable in our home. What can you say , but , this is what be-bop is! This record is alive with invention , playing with time scales , playing with form , it's a joy to listen to. Fun and bouncy , jazzy with a hint of the classics thrown in , it's alive with the spirit of jazz . I'm not sure what that actually means , but Dave Brubeck on piano , with Paul Desmond on sax , who was ,  incidentally  , the composer of &#34;Take Five&#34; , one of the greatest jazz tunes in history , they make for sheer jazz bliss , an absolute joy to listen to , and one of the classic &#34;Dessert Isle &#34; albums of all time. Cheers!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|There is no way to understand this game, put a puzzle together i did that and nothing happened. Not recommended.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I recently say the award winning film &#34;Searching for Sugarman &#34; after seeing that it had won the Oscar for best documentary. I was going to see it at the theater , but it left a few weeks after it got there , so I didn't have the chance. I saw it in a Redbox DVD rental station at the local Walgreens , so  thought I would give it a chance.  It's a very entertaining film , telling the story of fleeting fame for a guy named Rodriguez , who was from Detroit and sounds like a cross between James Taylor , Bob Dylan , with maybe a little Van Morrison thrown in . The music has a very 70's feel to it , it's somewhat overproduced , with horns and strings in the background, and kind of a lush sound going on. The film was how Rodriguez never really made it in America , for whatever reason , but , somehow was kind of a cult hero across the world in South Africa , due to his somewhat revolutionary lyrics, and the banning by the government of his music during the apartheid regime. I like Rodriguez , I walked away from the film not knowing much about Rodriguez , but wanting to hear more from him , and wishing him success in his now awakened career.
B000JMKQX0|2.0|It's like reading a documentary.<br />Hope the movie isn't done in this format. Not on my best books for the summer reading.

0307279189|5.0|A fascinating account and will interest anyone who enjoys a well written story and account whether you are a runner or not (I'm not). Is about so many things that I can't put into words. I just highly recommend this read!!

0345529057|5.0|I received the package earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. I absolutely love the books! I cannot put them down! I first watched the show on HBO and books will always be better than TV so I had to get the books. In love with my summertime reading choice!
B005PK56TA|5.0|When this show originally aired, I missed the first episode or two. I started watching it, but realized that this type of show you had to watch from the beginning. I am VERY glad that I decided to give it a second chance. You can probably count on one hand the number of times in your life when a tv series actually SHOCKS you. This is definitely one of them. What a brilliant idea it was to have each season a completely different story line. It actually turned it into more of a mini-series. The ending blew me away, I NEVER saw it coming. There were so many different shockers it happened all most EVERY EPISODE. I have never seen anything like this. So, if you are smart you are smart you will not let this one pass you by. You won't regret it.
0753541637|4.0|Exciting, high powered book from a super executive and company manager. My copy of this LEAN IN book was delivered promptly and in excellent condition. Although mostly anecdotal, this book has immediate impact advice on how to overcome shyness, \\"lean in\\", get engaged, enjoy other people more, and enjoy a seat at the discussion table.  Useful for family, home, community, church, or work place settings.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I've used and enjoyed this app on my Kindle Fire HD for many months. But, the new version is HORRIBLE. I've removed it and will search for another weather app.<br /><br />This new version has a busy look, loads VERY slowly, sends me off to Google for some reason when I click to minimize the report, and has a TERRIBLE color scheme along with awful and glaring advertisements. It seems designed to make users NOT want to use it. Success--I will not use it.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read some reviews before I read it and by the sounds of it I was going to be disappointed.....but I wasn't. The love these two people share make you wish you could be this open with your partner. I was not disappointed at all and I am excited for more to come. I'm glad their story hasn't ended

B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Even though there have been a few hicups along the way with the app, it's  been fun and I recommend it.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Book five expands the saga even further. Now the action is spreading beyond Westeros to the free cities and beyond. New players will join the game but none are safe!
B003DNH6DK|4.0|Nice family film, Sandra Bullock really plays her part well and its just anotehr really great story only this one is for real.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I can't believe that this is the third book and it's still not over!!! I was really looking forward to finishing the series but I'm kind of happy I have more to read. I love this more than 50 shades

B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book gives a very detailed account of Abraham Lincoln and how he became President and how he handled the American Civil War.  It also covers his assassination and the aftermath.  The reader also gets a sense of the culture at that time.  It is a wonderful book for those interested in American history.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|for all the people who have a kindle fire, this game will not work, maybe the first few times, but then, everytime you open it, it will close out of the game by itself

B00BI73CVI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was not disappointed.  It was a good departure from the wild action filled stuff I usually watch and I did really enjoy it.
0553801473|5.0|The dragons are back, and so are many characters that were slightly absent from Book Four.  A terrific read, could not put this book down and I hated finishing it, knowing that I'm in Westeros limbo until Book Six is published.  If you've read Books One through Four, I don't have to tell you anything.  My inner princess tells me that Book Six will be out this fall, so there is still time to start reading this fantastical tale now.
B000FVE3AC|4.0|I got this to replace a non-automatic diver as I expand my collection. It's definitely diver-sized (read: oversized), so if you want something not so hulkish, look elsewhere. I recently picked up a Citizen BN0000-04H, which is much smaller if that's your thing. As far as this Invicta, it's now my favorite to take in the water (I'm still keeping my overall fav diver, the Orange Monster, on land). The rest of my divers have rubber straps, which I love, but the bracelet works well on this watch, adding to the heft. It took a week in the ocean unscathed and I'm hoping it lasts for a long time to come. The Rolex-like cyclops eye over the date is a nice addition and the lume works well.
B00AEFXL5W|5.0|This classic film never fails to satisfy, and the Blu-ray edition makes it even more enjoyable.  Watched it three times the day it arrived.  :)

B00DHNBY02|5.0|Only missing more of the book and more ghosts I liked how there was some creepy cult thing at first kinda set the center stage for an all around horrific movie

B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|While some have been better than others there surely is no bad Keith Jarrett trio recording out there.  But this one is a pristine beauty, perfect for summer listening.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|This is certainly the most useful book I have ever read in my life. As someone in their early 50s, somewhat overweight and with a high risk of CHD and possibly Type2-diabetes looming, this book has given me a whole new lease of life. For the first time I have understood the exact role of the bodies metabolism in the so-called lifestyle diseases of current times, and how they can be effectively eliminated by the avoidance of sugar and refined carbohydrates. I believe I now have a good chance of avoiding CHD and diabetes,and of achieving a sensible body mass. Years of experimenting with other silly diets and exercise regimes have been a complete waste of time. This is possibly the first book that explains diet theory to the general public, in a causal and scientific way, based on the role of insulin and hormones etc. I have bought several copies for friends already....its a MUST!
B00C5XBAOA|5.0|Loved the toys. We got the whole set from here a lot cheaper than in the local stores. Will make a great Christmas present.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|Systematically builds and proves the case that great talent and so called unique skills are made not inborn. Then goes on to show how its done.  One of the most eye opening treatises I have ever read. Have been recommending it to all my friends.
0345529057|5.0|Enjoying them very much. I read a couple of reviews and I wonder if those people have anything going on in their life.  These are books, don't over-think it. They are great!
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I had just got this game several times. Every time I install it there is a game that's on level 8 or something. I don't know ( idk)  if its just for the kindle fire though. I am definitely sorry if someone opens their game and find it has changed in a way. it may be my fault. ...
B006YTTVHO|2.0|This book contains common sense tips that I expect most people already know. I was so bored by it that I just skimmed it and then deleted it from my Kindle.

B00CM9JKQM|4.0|I own this album. I don't have Frequency Unknown. Mainly because most of it bored me. That's not to say Frequency Unknown is a terrible album- it's not really as terrible as I've heard it is, but it's not really up to the standards of Queensryche's back catalog, either. That being said- I feel like this one can live next to those records. Let's face it- after Promise Land- the quintet from Seattle's releases have been a mixed bag. And having Tate not being on this one and having Todd La Torre as the vocalist has breathed some much deserved life back into the band. I never thought I'd say that about Queensryche. I mean if you play a game of name association next to the band- Chris De Garmo and Geoff Tate instantly come to mind. Even though Degarmo hasn't played on an album in years. And this version of Queensryche no longer has Tate. The first song I've heard on this record was \\"redemption\\" which is a good introduction- sounding like classic Queensryche somewhere between Rage for Order to Promise Land.I'm really surprised by how well Todd's voice is not only eerily similar to Geoff's but how his own signature on the tracks doesn't tarnish the band's sound- it helps it. Scott Rockenfield in particular- sounds the most inspired on this record. Playing with vigor we haven't heard in years- (his name is on the credits on some recent albums- but doesn't actually appear on some- namely Operation Mindcrime 2.) Michael Wilton & Lungren's guitar harmonies harken back to the classic Degarmo/Wilton team of classic Ryche- and Eddie Jackson's tone sounds a little grittier at points- but still what you'd come to expect from him.The album has some great points- and some songs that are just \\"good\\"- why only 4 stars then? I don't know- as muchas I enjoy this- there's more just \\"good\\" songs than \\"great\\". I feel like this line up has found it's voice again- and the best is yet to come. Highlights: Where Dreams Go To Die, Spore, & A World Apart.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|As close as I will ever come to seeing the band play live.  I really liked the second DVD disc of the dress rehearsal, it was like a whole second show not to mention live performances not seen by anyone but the crew.  Essential for any fan of greatest band the world has ever known.
B008JFUR10|4.0|Pacific Rim brings back the monster movie genre with some touches from anime. Following the steps of the popularity of the Transformers films and others that mixed massive action with massive budgets on top of a nerdy nostalgic series. Yet unlike the Transformer films, Pacific Rim doesn't need to insult the audience with crude humor, or exploitative sexual scenes, it only brings great action scenes that are only tarnished by some excessively safe and predictable characters and writing.<br /><br />The obvious highlight of Pacific Rim are the action filled setpieces, and they do deliver. With most of the action coming in form of one on one combat through fisticuffs, grabs and throws, and even swords, the action is very impactful along with the good sound design. Those scenes themselves are shot relatively clearly, giving space for the scope of the massive combatants yet zooming on in for impacts. That scope of the film is where most of the excitement comes from, the massiveness of the aliens and the resulting robots means that cargo ships are now baseball bats, stadiums are now landing pads, and humans and any traditional vehicles are completely obsolete for combat. This results in a great sense of size when realizing how slow the aliens and robots are from being so massive (elbow rockets!). The only complaint I have of the action is, that despite the whole world seemingly teaming up to take down the aliens, there are only four or five robots that we get to see, which is a shame considering how each robot has different moves and stereotypical pilots. There seems to be a missed opportunity of having a final showdown with at least a dozen or so different countries having their own robots with their own flare to kick some butt.<br /><br />However, while the action in Pacific Rim is terrific, around a third of the movie in total does a surprisingly good job of dragging the action down with anything that is not giant robots fighting giant aliens. There are about a dozen characters that all fit into their own extremely generic positions in order for the film to go through the motions. The comic relief from Charlie Day hits some occasional marks, and Rinko Kikuchi did a decent job with the script given. Yet I couldn't find myself caring about these characters at all when it was obvious where they were going to end up. But even with all that being said, the lackluster performances and writing, are not bad enough to ruin the movie, in fact it makes the action all the better once it actually gets going again.<br /><br />All in all bringing back the monster film with Pacific Rim serves as a memorable experience, even after dredging through the boring parts. Go see it in a good theater with some friends, or at least get it on Bluray to push your home setup.
B000W93CHC|1.0|I gave it one star because it's hard work to write a book this long and you deserve some credit.  The book was drivel though and just stupid. Don't waste your time.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a fun game. The graphics are great. I wish there were activities in western and racing rather than just English.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I approached with trepidation this book series but found myself loving it.  The writer can weave a good yarn and I can't wait now for the next book.  A little racy for this grandma but if you can look past a few of the scenes, it's a good read.
B000H0MKOC|5.0|great, awesome, unique and comical while still politically incorrect like it tells in the descriptions. Great movie worth the value of adding to your collection.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read Kite Runner and Thousand Splendid Suns and now his latest book ...and The Mountains Echoed.  It didn't disappoint.  He has a wonderful writing style that weaves you into the story.  Love this book.
B00AZ7V0W0|5.0|Perfect for any horror fan collector. Quality unmatched to standard versions previously released, like a new refreshing moment reliving the original classics of this horror franchise.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Ever wonder what would happen if you put every bad action sequel from the 80s into one film? It is kind of cute in the beginning, but by the end you start to think you may never enjoy a one liner again. Production quality is good. Great movie to half watch while you are cleaning the house, folding laundry, etc
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|not bad but lacks exciting scenes and almost requires. you to spend real money to keep from getting bored. of course you also have the choice to stop playing at any time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I am enjoying this game alot. Very challenging at times. I like the options to customize the backgrounds and the cars too. Very pleased.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Read this book a long time ago while I was in middle school...and I still enjoyed it today as a 26 year old man.
1609611543|5.0|Although we are not doing this 100%, all the time, we try to follow it as much as possible.  It makes us think before we eat.  And yes, sometimes you are going to eat those items you shouldn't have.  It has helped quite a bit with digestive issues, etc.
0547848412|5.0|I want to buy this book for several people I know, I absolutely highly recommend this book! Didn't watch the movie, and I probably wont because movies tend to stray away from the books they originate from.
B006O5XYWG|5.0|Great movie in and of itself, but if you've watched the original movies, the way they've tied this one into those is truly amazing and make the movie much more fun to watch.
0143119680|3.0|I've been in a book slump lately, and some ladies in a fan club of Diana Gabaldon's book, Outlander, suggested A Discovery of Witches.  In fact, this book was suggested a lot.  I was pretty excited about everyone's eagerness about it so I picked it up at Barnes and Noble and got started.<br /><br />This book is about a witch named Diana, set in modern-day time.  She doesn't want to be a witch; in fact she basically refuses to use her powers at all.  She's a historian, a doctor in that subject in fact, and her daily routine is doing research at the library.  One particular book there soon changes her life.  Diana then meets a vampire, Matthew, and they become involved.<br /><br />A forbidden relationship, magical powers, a vampire.  Sounds good right?  I don't know guys; this book just didn't do it for me.  At the beginning, I was enthusiastic, and actually got lost in the book, which made me more excited because I was like, finally, a good book!  But then I just got bored.  I know this is the first one in a series and I'm wondering if the series gets better?<br /><br />Something trivial that bothered me was the main characters' names.  I know Diana was used for a reason, but Matthew just seemed out of place for the vampire.  Also, there was only one suspenseful part in the book that left me wanting more, and in a book that's over 500 pages, I want to want to know what happens more often!<br /><br />It was good, just not awesome, and I'm looking for that next book that I can rave about.  So if this sounds up your alley, go ahead and I bet you'll like it. Even for its length of 500 pages, it's surprisingly a quick read.<br /><br />Also, it ends on sort of a cliffhanger into the next book, which is already out on shelves.  I'm on the fence, because the ending was really good.....what to do, what to do...<br /><br />My Rating:  3 out of 5 stars<br /><br />~Pam
B000I8G5GW|5.0|This is a classic. Good to see it in its original, uncut form. I would highly recommend it for fans of the movie and genre.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|This is definitely a good album. My problem with it is there never seems to be an appropriate time to listen to it.<br />It's really well made, and if you like Vampire Weekend, you will not be disappointed.
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|This is a great special effect movie. However I gave two stars because the story was ordinary, and even my child did predict the end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was one twisted perverted read that I couldn't put down. It was one page turner after another.  Highly recommended
B0094K1WZE|4.0|This is the best of the Mission Impossible movies.  I was surprised; absolutely no language! Good plot and decent acting!
0451418441|5.0|Wow, where to start?  After reading and loving The Pillars of the Earth I just didn't think World Without End could be as good.  But it was!  I will address my three complaints about the book first.<br /><br />I finished World Without End after reading for six to seven hours per day for three days (I was out sick, people!).  At 1014 pages, this is definitely not a fast read.  I can read about 100 pages per hour of YA and most adult books.  My pace for a Ken Follett historical novel is about 50-60 pages per hour.  This is due to the fact that his historical novels have large pages with small print and also because the writing is sometimes technical.  By technical, I mean that Follett includes detailed descriptions of architecture, machinery (example, he tells us how a fulling machine is built; FYI a fulling machine is used to turn sheep's wool into cloth), and warfare that seemed to slow me down a little.  I'm interested in love, not masonry!<br /><br />My second complaint is that Follett reminds the reader of events that take place earlier in the book.  I'm not stupid, Ken.  You don't need to tell me these things twice.  For example, one of the main character's parents died early on in the book.  Later in the book, we read, \\"He went alone because his parents were long dead.\\"  No kidding!  I remember when they died!  It reminds me of when you're reading a series and at the beginning of each book there is a short recap of what's happened in previous books.  Now, probably if I had not read World Without End in such a short time span, I might have appreciated these friendly reminders.<br /><br />My last complaint is that there is a lot of sex in this book; much more than The Pillars of the Earth.  And it's not all sweet and romantic.  There is rape, public lewdness and homosexuality among the nuns and monks.  The descriptions are not as explicit as most popular novels today, but in the historical context it was a little surprising.  I have to think that Follett believes the sex to be indicative of the time period he's writing in (the 1300's).<br /><br />Okay, that's the end of my complaints.  Here's what I liked about the book.  World Without End tells the story of two girls and two boys from the ages of 10-12 years old up to their 40's.  We have other central characters too, such as Godwyn the monk and Edmund Wooler, but the main focus of the book is the four children.  I love a book with parallel stories.  I just love following more than one character at once.  World Without End is written in the third person but isn't choppy like some third person books are.  I loved that we get to see the characters grow up and mature.  They all encounter hardships (war, death, disappointed hopes and dreams, the black plague) but never stop fighting and never give up hope. My favorite character was Gwenda.  I just love a good survivor, especially one who suffers from unrequited love.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading about the advances in medicine and what people believed to be cures (bloodletting, poultices made with dung, balancing the \\"humours\\" of the body).  Physicians believed that diseases could be transmitted by looking at a sick person because the eyes have \\"feelers\\" that touch things in order to see them.  Isn't that wild?  When the black plague befalls the country, one of the nuns wants to wear a mask over her nose and mouth to prevent transmission of the disease and this is treated like heresy!<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading about the politics of the church.  There was definitely more corruption in World Without End than there was in The Pillars of the Earth.  Of course, the fact that The Pillars of the Earth's main character was a humble and worthy prior may have something to do with that.<br /><br />I am in awe of Follett's plot.  He weaves the stories together in a way that they all make sense and seem cohesive.  I love his one-line paragraphs (example:  \\"As they walked out, the jailer sneezed.\\"  This refers to the start ofthe second wave of the black plague).  They are kind of snarky and usually contain big plot twists.<br /><br />The last thing I enjoyed reading about was the architecture.  Now, I know I said the descriptions were hard to read, which they were but they were also really informative and practical to the story.  I'm not a fan of architecture, but reading about how they had to build things back then was pretty fascinating to me.<br /><br />When I finished the book, I was left with a feeling of hope.  I think the ending is totally appropriate.  It's not so perfect that it's unrealistic.  I think that's the special thing about Follett's writing---he makes you feel what his characters are feeling.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />A woman's naked body was described just one too many times.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The excellent plot---there were more plot twists than a Candyland game.<br /><br />Appropriate for a younger audience:<br />Rape, murder, warfare, homosexuality, drunkenness---no.the second wave of the black plague).

B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Kinda of slow, but if you stay with it, it is a very good movie.  Acting is kinda of shallow, but adequate.
014241543X|5.0|A warning to fellow readers---if you have not read If I Stay, make sure you: one: are not home alone as I was,  two: have an adequate supply of tissues at the ready when you sit down with this book, and three:  have at least an hour and a half to read this book in one sitting because you're going to want to finish it once you start.<br /><br />I have heard so many great things about this book but I had no idea how powerful it would be.  It looks so unassuming, with the peaceful cover and small size (less than 200 pages) that I completely underestimated it.<br /><br />I sat down to read If I Stay after work one evening after my husband left for a business trip.  My cat immediately got in my lap---her favorite spot while I'm reading---and I did not move again until I finished the book an hour and a half later.  This would not usually be a problem except for the fact that I had one small napkin next to me (to hold my Hershey's Kisses when I first sat down) and was in desperate need of tissues throughout the whole book.  The story was just too gripping for me to stop long enough to get up and get tissues, so I confess that my tears fell unabated onto the blanket my cat was lying on.  She didn't like it, but I was too enmeshed in the story to get up.<br /><br />I don't want to go into specifics about the story, because I think you need to read it for yourself.  There's really not much I can say without giving anything away.  Forman's writing style is clean and spare, something I really like.  I think it's hard to get spare writing right, but she hits the nail on the head, writing emotional scenes so cleanly that you feel what the characters are feeling---not what the author wants you to feel.  The book alternates seamlessly between the present day and flashbacks, something I also think can get choppy if done incorrectly.  Instead, the flashbacks keep the book moving at a pace where you don't want to stop reading.<br /><br />I think the most powerful thing about If I Stay is the fact that the writing makes it easy for you to put yourself in Mia's place.  I know that's what had me feeling so emotional through the whole book.  I was upset when I finished and found out that the sequel is not due out for another six months!  Somehow I thought it was already out.  I would recommend this book to anyone----it's that good.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />My only gripe is that now I have to wait for the sequel.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The writing and the emotions Forman elicits in her readers.is the fact that the writing makes it easy for you to put yourself in Mia's place.

B000RUAR5G|5.0|good movie for kids! fun to watch. Very funny and entertaining. Watched years ago and watch it again now. Worth watching.
0451208706|5.0|What makes Ken Follett so great, in my opinion, is his ability to take a really dull subject and create a book around it that is exciting, thrilling and suspenseful.  Thinking back on all of the Ken Follett books I've read:  The Pillars of the Earth was about building a cathedral, World Without End was about building a bridge, A Dangerous Fortune was about banking, and The Man From St. Petersberg was about foreign policy in 1914 England.<br /><br />All of those topics sound so boring when I read that list, but Follett makes them into a book that I can't stop reading!  I was a little apprehensive that The Man From St. Petersberg wouldn't be as good as the previous Follett books I've read, but it was.  It was a shorter book so I was able to speed through it and after the first 75 pages, I just couldn't stop!<br /><br />The Man From St. Petersberg is about two star-crossed lovers and the paths their lives take after their heartbreaking forced separation.  The way Follett weaves his plots together, taking events that seem unrelated and then making them all tied together at the end, is so satisfying.  I also really enjoy the way he writes relationships and feelings.  His poetic justice is another selling point, as well as his pacing.  Can you tell that I love Ken Follett?<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />This one was a little harder to get into than his other books.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The relationships and character development.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very good to past the time. Really plain but challenging.  I consider myself a very absorbent person and very a very logical thinker. This game made me guess myself. Which makes me accept the challenge.
0142420891|4.0|I absolutely loved If I Stay.  It was one of my favorite reads of 2010, and I was on pins and needles waiting for Where She Went.  While I think Where She Went was a great conclusion to the story, it did not have the emotional impact that If I Stay had for me.  The book is told from Adam's point of view, and I'm not a fan of the male POV.  It just doesn't work for me...I have a hard time identifying with the main character when he is a teenage boy.<br /><br />Adam has \\"made it\\" in the music business.  He's famous and recognized wherever he goes.  With the fame comes problems though:  Adam is a bit of a mess, overwhelmed by fame, addicted to prescription anti-anxiety drugs, and smoking all the time.  He is kind of a wild child with his drinking, partying, and groupies.  If I wanted to read about an addict, I'd go pick up a Nic Sheff memoir.  So, when I discovered a few chapters into the book that the entire book would be told from Adam's point of view, I was pretty disappointed.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I did enjoy the conclusion to Mia and Adam's story.  My favorite parts of the book were when Mia meets up with Adam again, and when they reconnect and talk about the past.  I thought that the development of their relationship was realistic and appropriate.  Despite my lack of enthusiasm over the male POV, I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone.<br /><br />Just One Gripe:<br />See paragraph two above.<br /><br />The Best Thing About This Book:<br />The conclusion to Mia and Adam's stories.
B0000X2DMA|3.0|The case was entirely scratched up and ruined. As a collecter I like when things are in good shape , I wouldn't mind a couple of scratches but the entire case is destroyed.<br />I am rating this 3 stars for the case not the music , I love Epica and this is my favorite album

B0074YVW1G|2.0|This is a well written book. Earnest and well researched but pondeous and rather dull. I ploughed through 3 chapters and then gave up.  It wasn't what I thought it was and is not much help to the introvert with regard to ad vice and seemed distant and academic.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The app did offer me basic weather informatin and offered a news view on the current weather reports. It did give a forecast on the upcoming days, and all seemed to work ok for a time. I gave the app a trial. I recently had a problem with this app after not using it for a time, and the permissions under terms and conditions have either changed or appear to possibly charge me for them through a subscription. I am plain out of here! I will search for a new weather app soon as I can find one.
B00BEIYM7O|5.0|This excellent film is about the healing power of music being the key to unlocking expressions of feelings, even in advanced age. The superb British cast performs beautifully, with a masterful, curmudgeonly Terrance Stamp, Vanessa Redgrave, Christopher Eccleston and Gemma Arterton as the vulnerable young music teacher who gives joy and meaning to the lives of her aged choir. Even if the ending is somewhat predictable, it still packs a wallop, with not a dry eye in the theater. Great actors, understated plotting, sensitive direction by Paul Andrew Williams, intelligent dialogue. Highly recommended!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|If you read the other books read this book! If not read the other books first. This is because you'd get confused

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved this book great story line and romance. As a set of three I wish there was more books as good as this series.
6305535264|3.0|I love old movies, but this one though had good special effects, didn't really blow me away. To me it was mostly a boring movie, however I loved the actress, and her husband played well too. The robot was all right and the evil human character was just okay. I really couldn't watch the movie the second time, except for fast forwarding it to refresh it in my memory. It's not the movie I love, but it's  still a classic.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book kept me interested. As a series I wish there was more great books like this. I give the write 5stRs
B0090SI42Y|4.0|I found it to be an all-right movie, kind of interesting and with a good set of actors. I liked special effects and the plot was quite original. I'd give the movie 3,5-4 stars. I really don't understand why there are so many bad reviews. The movie was entertaining and I will see the second movie as soon as it comes out!
B00DM0UTPQ|3.0|*** Warning this review contains minor spoilers<br /><br />I have several problems with this movie. The first is I am used to being with Russians, and these people did not act like Russians. More importantly like officers in the Russian navy during the communist era. I doubt American officers would behave like these guys do much less Communist era officers.<br /><br />Nor did the submarine look like a USSR submarine of the period. I know I have been in one. Clearly it was not well researched the movie.<br /><br />As the plot developed, the almost guilt-ridden  captain story became more implausible. Okay the captain was responsible for a minor naval disaster which killed about eight people, but life goes on. I can remember reading of an Israeli tank commander who made a bad mistake, and a man in his group died by accident. He did not go overboard like this captain, and he was in a society which is super sensitive on this sort of stuff. Hardly, something the old USSR military or society was. I used to work in a plant that had an industrial death every few months, and I can assure you industrial and military accidents happen all the time; you get used to them.<br /><br />Having said that the story is reasonable for a movie, it is not all that original. Unfortunately, I just did not get that absorbed in the story.<br /><br />Having said that the acting is good, the filming is good.<br /><br />I probably would not see it again, but I would say it is okay for an afternoon.

B0050AV5MW|4.0|I'm enjoying the books a lot! I won't go into the story, just wanted to note that my kindle edition has a good index to differentiate and search each chapter and book. So I guess they have fixed that since the other reviews.
075669812X|5.0|My son loves this book. He is a lego fan and watches the TV series. He also has the Lego Star Wars one.
B003XF1OK4|5.0|I loved this novel, I would recommend the readers to first read Woolf's &#34;Mrs. Dalloway&#34; so you can grasp and appreciate some details of the novel.<br />Sometimes it is not easy to read, to keep track with the narrator's changes, but it is not hard at all.<br />The Kindle version is good, no problem there. And I always prefer that the covers don't say that the books were the inspiration for a movie.
B000JML7EC|5.0|great product. thanks so much.  wonderful seller, super fast ... terrific delightful amazing, awesome. thanks .. was great great thanks
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|As with all the previous books, this one kept me just as \\"entwined\\" and interested.  I am really looking forward to reading all upcoming books!
B006YMLE7G|5.0|Awesome visuals and audio that you'll watch over & over again. Not your typical formula from today's anime. It has a good story line from beginning to the very end and you will not be disappointed.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|In my opinion, this IS one of the best movies of all time.  I don't buy many movies, but I had to own this one.  I purchased it for my husband for Father's Day.  This movie has everything:  action, drama, comedy.  It will have you laughing, crying and sitting on the edge of your seat.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
B003VR5PPY|5.0|This is the first time I have ever played a game like this on and I am definitely hooked cant wait to play zero escape the sequel!!!
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|You don't have to be a Super fan to appreciate this soundtrack.  Sit back and relax because you are about to go on an emotional high ride.  You'll hear soft sultry sounds that smoothly glide into an intense sensory overload that your ears will love.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|I devoured the book as fast as I could and am reading it again at a slower pace this time. It's a great combination of inspiration for all the opportunities available to us now, combined with practical examples of others that have succeeded.<br /><br />James is a great writer that mixes humour and humility to offer life lessons that are entertaining and insanely valuable.<br /><br />I absolutely loved this book and can't recommend it more. Brilliant!
B001HMSFFC|5.0|This was gift for my mom and she really enjoyed this movie! I also bought her the second one which she loved as well!
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Connelly is a great writer! I could not put this book down, even using my iPhone at work to sneak in a chapter.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like this game a lot my hubby and I have a little competition going on with the game to see who can score more! lol
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|the best game on kindle fire fosure. yo yo yo out of this world hope they have some space mission and scenes with roddy.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|to download all the way onto my kindle it. It kept getting stuck at the last percent of the download.
B001EAWMGA|3.0|I am glad to know that I could be a Norwegian with alien blood.  I could use that if we are ever invaded.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This game really was a lot of fun! It's a great time killer but it's also fun to play. G
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyable read. As always a great read.  Good and believable characters.  Kept my interest throughout the entire book. Good and unexpected turns of the story.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|This game would not work for me on my Kindle Fire. It would download and the get stuck at the last %
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Beautifully written as were his previous books.  You could feel the dust in the air and smell the food cooking on his pages - very descriptive!!  A true story of how conditions were in Afghanistan in the past.  You will really care for all of his characters.
B003ZJ70W4|5.0|I love this movie! I actually bought this for my Mom and she loved it just as much as I did!
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|I am using my Kindle Fire HD  to capture ideas for illustrations when I'm out and about and then completing them back home on my desktop with a Waccom tablet and stylus and an OLD version of JASC Paintshop Pro. I am new to using a tablet, but I found Sketchbook very intuitive and easy to pick up. I like the various pen/brush strokes and layers. I haven't tried to do anything very complex with it yet, but I like the ease with which I can move in and out with the kindle to do close detail then go back to viewing the entire piece.
0316134082|5.0|My Hubby bought me this book for part of my Christmas gift and it is a stunning book! It really was a nice book and I can't wait to get the others like it!
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Excellent cover, but then one should always expect above average products when Marware is involved.<br /> I have usedeveral  Marware products and they are always top quality.  In addition, Marware  will always stand behind what they sell.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This was a fun and challenging game! It was a great way to pass the time and it was fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is very fun to play on my kindle fire!  I played it on my road trip an it's  fun with and without the Internet!!!!!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I liked this game a lot the graphics were good and it was a lot of fun to play and to kill time!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|if ur looking for something to pass time this isn't ur game but if u want a fun game its ur game! no joke its fun
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game for all ages. It has pretty nice graphics too. Highly recommend for a free way to pass time.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Fun story line; play it timed or &quot;zen&quot; (no time outs).  About 24+ hours of play. Full version definitely worth the 1.99 price.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Actually we are a HUGE fan of the play so the movie left something to be desired musically.  You can tell this movie version focused more on the acting than the musicality.  But that's ok - the story is wonderful.  And I like that this particular product has the Blue-Ray, the DVD AND the digital copy.  Not sure what to do with the Ultra Violet part of it - but oh well!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|What an interesting conclusion. Three murders done by the same person u will be shocked  who did it. Good book to read.
159463176X|3.0|I was rather disappointed as his first two books impressed me as being very authentic but this book and it's format seemed contrived
B00BQPEIT2|1.0|I spent the last of my coins for it when I could have used it for a different app. I have not yet received the item and I am competly unsatisfied.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|I love this movie. The characters are complex, the relationships seem real, the values worthy, and it's about baseball. How can you go wrong.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I was sitting in the hospital with a very good friend of mine after her surgery.  As my friend recovered I read this book.  Nurses would come in and see me laughing so hard my sides hurt and tears were running down my face.  I read little snippets from the book to my friend and to people as they came in to take care of her.  Bossypants (Kindle Edition) lifted everyone's spirits in the hospital.  I love this book so much I sent it to my sister and my best friends.  It's that good.<br />What a gift Tina Fey has!  What a gift she gave to me!
B000IJ79UW|3.0|Superman - The Movie was good for its time, but anyone who says it's better than Man of Steel probably hasn't watched it since 1978.  I bought it to refresh my memory after seeing Man of Steel.  These are two completely different interpretations of the Superman story.  Neither one is right or wrong.
B00DW2PDH8|4.0|Simon Okill has created a horrific tome dealing with vampires, mysticism, and sexual depravity.<br /><br />Delicate Rose- a vampire, perhaps, who seeks freedom and solace is trapped by Count Lucian, a man who may or may not be a vampire. He considers himself a suckling- a vampire who has not yet been given eternal life. Chaos ensues when Rose is entered into an insane asylum and Lucian cannot deal with the separation, or does he?<br /><br />The book jumps back and forth between different periods of time, which, for me, was confusing. Sometimes, I found myself having to go back and get my bearings straight. I tend to prefer my horror without a lot of sex, so with areas of this book verging on erotica, I wasn't as engaged with the story as I would have liked. Still, though, Okill does have a command of language that is beautiful to read.<br /><br />His web unravels slowly, taking you on a ride that makes you completely uncomfortable and unsure of yourself. Let's just say that the ending is one heck of a surprise and leaves the reader shocked.
B00CLZ48FA|4.0|enjoyed this movie a lot.<br />few tweaks could have made it better, tho.<br />for instance....<br />i love mila kunis but why did i feel like i was watching meg griffin play the wicked witch during parts of this movie?<br />still worth seeing more than once.
B00B2EWNWG|3.0|RZA (born Robert Fitzgerald Diggs,  aka Prince Rakeem, Bobby Digital, Bobby Steels , The Abbott, Ruler Zig-Zag-Zig Allah, The Rzarector) is a Hip hop MC and influential producer best known for his work with Wu-Tang Clan.  Here he expands his influence by conceiving, writing, composing the musical score, directing and starring in this very strange movierama ,THE MAN WITH THE IRON FISTS.<br /><br />Madame Blossom summarizes the plot by saying `Power belongs to no one, until it is seized through sex or violence.'  One critic was able to give the pan for the story as follows: `In Jungle Village, the leader of the Lion's clan Gold Lion is summoned by the Governor (Terence Yin) and assigned to protect his gold that will be transported through the village. However he is betrayed and murdered by the greedy Silver Lion (lawyer/actor Byron Mann) and Bronze Lion (Cung Le). Gold Lion's favorite son Zen Yi, a.k.a. The X-Blade (Korean American famous fashion model Rick Yune), seeks revenge and heads to Jungle Village, but he is defeated by Brass Body (Dave Bautista) and rescued by the local Blacksmith Thaddeus (RZA). Meanwhile the Gemini Female (Grace Huang) and the Gemini Male (Andrew Lin) protect the Governor's gold, but they are vanquished by the army of Silver and Bronze Lion. The Blacksmith is abducted by the Lions and has his arms severed by Brass Body. However he is saved by the British Jack Knife (Russell Crowe), who is the emissary of the Emperor, and he manufactures iron arms for Thaddeus. Meanwhile the Governor sends the Jackal army to fight against the Lions and they hide the gold in the brothel of Madam Blossom (Lucy Liu). However, Madam Blossom and his girls form an army of black widows and together with Jack, Zen Yi and The Blacksmith, they fight against the Lions.<br /><br />Great costumes, extraordinary hair styles for men, pretty sets, flying action and blood blood blood are the main attractions here.  The story is supposedly set in feudal China but much of the dialogue and situations are very much of this decade. Filmed in Hong Kong and the US the characters are basically an Asian mix of what appears to be a cluster of American actors. One is left wondering how such people as Russell Crowe, Pam Grier (she plays RZA's mother) and Lucy Liu (and what did the publicized Quentin Tarantino do in this picture?) connected to this extended Oriental rap session. But in the end, if silly dialogue and absurd fights and lack of plot make for a colorful evening's escapist entertainment, then here it is. A tagline for the film spotlights the theme: `They put the F.U. in Kung Fu.' Grady Harp, July 13dialogue and situations are very much of this decade.

B00004SA86|4.0|I don't claim to be a Mahler expert by any means. But I've purchased several of the major cycles as well as individual symphonies and, to me, this one seems like the most balanced (in terms of tempo, dynamics and feeling) complete set. Each symphony in this set seems to fall into place very naturally and the sound is certainly adequate. I've also purchased the more recent Bertini set, which seems overly ponderous, and the Solti Chicago Symphony set which, for some reason, leaves me uninspired. I really enjoy some of the Otto Klemperer recordings, but he never managed to record a full cycle. I have yet to listen to the full Bernstein cycle, so my opinion shouldn't be considered definitive by any means. But, given the price and the quality of this set, I don't think anyone looking for an introduction to Mahler would be disappointed.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this is a fun game.<br /><br />love this game. its fun to play. it does take time for energy to come back unless you purchase diamonds but thats okay by me.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|This current implementation of a previously fine app is so poorly done that one can only conclude that competing developers somehow infiltrated the weather channel development team and sabotaged the update.  Fortunately, the .apk file for the previous version (I believe 3.8.3 was the final) is available at many locations on the web.  Simply uninstall the current version, download the previous version, and install.<br /><br />I hope the weather channel will reconsider and, like the guys that came up with New Coke, return to their previous successful product.<br /><br />Update 8/1/13:  Apparently, The Weather Channel has managed to disable the map information in the Map View of version 3.8.3.  The weather data still shows, but it appears on a blank grid, at least on my KFHD 7.  Best alternative, IMHO, is the paid version of Accuweather.  I'm not much into ads.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game. Keeps you thinking. It helps to get the &quot;helps&quot; from youtube when you get really stuck. Only need it for level 7 &amp; 10. Great way to keep your brain going.
0679805273|5.0|One of my favorite books, what a great way to send your little off from high school or kindergarten graduation. Applies to all ages!
B009C7JS14|4.0|This is a really great weather app it really helps and it is also free and that really great I really don't know what to say about a weather app
B00B8WXG9G|4.0|My husband and have enjoyed the easy listening, soft music of many fine musicians.  It's both contemporary and older standard music.  Very enjoyable.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome I like it a lot this game is easy and fun I would recmend it. by
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This game reminded me of Myst from back in the day.  Very little guidance as to where to go but Lost Cities also provides hints to direct you.  I had great fun with this and it kept me off of the Xbox for the three days that I obsessed over it.  The graphics are top notch &amp; the sounds and soundtrack were very soothing. Many wow moments.  It is going to take quite a wonderful game to top this one as I just finished it!!
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Nice little escapist movie.  It was funny and things blow up!  Bruce Willis and John Malkovich were both great.  Now, I'm looking forward to Red 2.
B000I9YX06|4.0|Based on the story by premier science fiction writer Isaac Asimov, this movie is pretty faithfully executed using CAG. It is well done and very entertaining. I think Asimov would approve. It is a good buy.
B0095MVOMC|3.0|First, I have to say that I don't see any \\"hidden ads\\" (just the developer ads) and my kindle isn't saying there's anything malicious about this app. I would recommend reading April Hamilton's review as she sums up the reason for why people's antivirus programs are saying there's adware/malware attached to this game.<br /><br />Now, onto the game itself. Even though I wanted to give this game four stars, there's a few things (explained later) that stopped me. You have to find the numbers 1-25 in each puzzle (there's a total of 50 puzzles). There is a set time of 5 minutes for you to find all the numbers. To me, some puzzles are easier than others. If you're having a hard time, I found out you can zoom into the picture (by taking two fingers and moving them apart) and look through the picture for the harder to find numbers. A plus, there is a hint button but with each use, you get docked points (the first is 300, the second 600, etc). However, you have to wait until the lightbulb fills up before you can use another hint. Your total amount of points dictate how many stars you get for each level completion.<br /><br />The level sceneries are nice and the graphics are pretty nice as well. The music is OK, though I muted it after the first level. My major downfall with the game (and why it's not a four star rating) is all the dev game ads. I don't mind one ad/button for a dev advertising their other games in games. However, in this one, there's a total of four different places (a main page one, sidebar one that you can (thankfully) minimize, and two after each row of levels). That's a bit too much for a paid game.<br />Another thing that kinda made me want to give the game three stars was the fact that (at least for me) 50 levels is just too few for the price tag of $2. I go through these types of games pretty quickly. So, for $2, I'd expect a bit more gameplay than a day's worth of play (even getting all three stars on each one). I also kind of wish that the numbers would disappear after finding them, but it's not too much of a problem because if you click on a number you previously found, it doesn't dock time.<br /><br />Overall, like I said, a pretty decent hidden object game. Would I recommend it? If the majority of dev advertising was taken off. As is right now, not really unless you don't mind the ads and love hidden object games (well, hidden number in this case, really).ld disappear after finding them, but it's not too much of a problem because if you click on a number you previously found, it doesn't dock time.<br /><br />Overall, like I said, a pretty decent hidden object game.

B0002O7XW2|5.0|A nerd buys a  car with cursed with an evil soul.  A car that can change the nerd into a tough guy and get revenge on anyone mean to him or the car.  Only a few can see what it is and try to stop it.  A great scary movie.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|love it I was  hooked my kids too couldn't put it down was expecting there to be a few more chapters but guess I'll have to Waite
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I am not a fan of zombies. I don't watch Walking Dead, I don't think zombies are cool. In fact I really don't get the whole zombie thing. Vampires i get. Werewolves, eh, I guess I get it. Zombies, no.<br /><br />A friend told me about this book and I was intrigued by her description. I love post-apocalyptic and virus based books. She urged me to try this. I am not sorry I did. My husband who was looking for gross zombie action didn't much care for this book.<br />I love the way this was told through peoples memories taken in interviews. I love the picture it painted of the whole war. It didn't need to describe for you every single battle in gross gory detail. You got a complete picture of what led to the war and what it looked like once it was all over. You got the sense of how quickly it escalated and how little people knew of what was going on. My only complaint would be I wanted more of each persons stories. Some ended so abruptly. You knew all these people were the survivors. I wanted more about how they survived, how they were coping afterwards.<br /><br />That being said, I have no desire to see the movie after reading the description of the movie. A friend who read this book and saw the movie said the movie was lightly based off the book. My husband would probably enjoy the movie more than he did this book.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|This is a great buy.  The original theatrical movie, an extended version of the movie, many extras, and a movie of the MOLE People from the old Superman from TV...George Reeves!  Would recommend this to any Superman fan!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loooove minions and temple run and this is basically the two combined.  It is a great game for all ages.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This app is totally worth the money, addicting and fun to play, good strategy game. But I warn you, May cause rage quit...
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Why does everyone have to take a good thing and ruin it with an update.  The simplicity of the previous version was perfect.  The updated version is annoying in every way possible.  Annoying ads and pictures now populate the screen.  I will be looking for a new weather app and deleting this one!!!!!!!!!!
0425263924|5.0|Of course I was up all night reading this book! Can't get enough....however I wish I knew before I started reading this one that Sylvia Day was writing a fourth. Looking forward to the release date for it!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just simple Klondike, but a good game. Doesn't lag or close on me like some apps do. Overall, it does what it  is supposed to do.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Smallville manages to reimagine the world of Superman, before he was Superman.  My version of the Box set has plastic backing on the cardboard insets to protect the DVD's and seems to protect the DVD's adequately.  It is a bit tricky to get the DVD's out by the edges, but it can be managed. For those who love Superman, or those who just love good drama, it's worth it.  Even if Lana does linger on a bit long.  Rosebaum's performance of Lex Luthor, and Tom Welling's Clark Kent really are some of the high points.  John Schneider and John Glover bring us competing fathers of Johnathon Kent and Lionel Luthor.  The extras are fun, but of varying quality, the Green arrow and Chloe Chronicles are of lower production value, and it rather shows.<br /><br />All in all, worth the own.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is perfect for anyone who just wants PLAIN solitaire! It took me months to find an App without all the graphics and crap. A few simple settings to take advantage of computer over a deck. (Like winnable hands) well worth buying to get rid of adds but tolerable if your cheep.
B00992CF6W|4.0|All its really missing is redstone and caves real I mean real nether because I love redstone caves make it more fun and a real nether for fun as well
B0001CNRBG|1.0|This has to be the worst acting ever from Alan Alda.  He should be embarrassed enough to pull this thing from the market!

B0036S4C6G|1.0|Halfway through the book I decided I didn't like it. My sister convinced me that maybe it would all come together in the end....like Crash, and turn into a good story. Perhaps if I could read a whole chapter without falling asleep it may have been better. Anyway, I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book.
B00A8MGIZG|2.0|Part Blade Runner, a little Matrix, some Soylent Green, an evil corporation film, a couple of costume dramas and a bit of Quest for Fire.<br /><br />Toss with multiple story lines that are all mixed together.<br /><br />Make a couple of story lines totally incomprehensible.<br /><br />Give Tom Hanks as many roles, with different looks and accents as possible.<br /><br />Have the good sense to not try this Halle Berry.<br /><br />String this out over 3 hours.<br /><br />Change the sound level constantly.<br /><br />This is just about what Cloud Atlas works out to be.
B004KBSQBA|1.0|I HEARD ONE SONG ON THE RADIO AND IT WAS GOOD. I ASSUMED THE ENTIRE CD WOULD BE ENJOYABLE BUT IT WAS NOT.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This was a beautiful love story with such a sad ending. I could not put this book down and look forward to more books by Jodi Picoult.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is really addicting, fun, and enjoyable to play. It is made even better since you get it for free.<br /><br />The only two issues are a lack of levels for variety and if you were to purchase coins for costume upgrades then you could easily spend $30 and not see where it went. Most costumes are easily 3000 tokens and a bundle of only 7500 tokens is pretty pricey. Game would be better if everything was buyable with bananas which you collect for free.<br /><br />Other than that, the game is great and worth the space time it takes to play!
B00CLIJ9A6|3.0|I suppose it is a really good view of a free old-age home for performers. Being a senior citizen myself, it hit a little too close to home. The actors do a great job of playing sympathetic golden agers of all sorts.
B000P0J09M|5.0|I think their is a a special facination with the mob life that people can ony fantasize about because most of us could never live that that kind of life.
B004LROUNG|5.0|As with all John Grisham novels I've read, The Litigators was a fun & engaging read!!  Love his writing style!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I downloaded this app a couple months ago and I love it. It works fast, notifies me the moment a text is sent, is very convenient for pictures, and so on. It has frozen up a couple times, but it has been wonderful other than that. I would definitely recommend kik.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Addictive. Makes you use your brain but not so much that it hurts ha. Love love love this game! Great job!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Interesting little time filler is pretty challenging but enjoyable and a good way to pass the time.<br />Give it a try.
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|Quality of download was very poor, with missing pixels; Movie plot slow and disjointed with characters very undeveloped. Not very enjoyable.
B00BLLXGS0|5.0|As with all new releases the songs tend to grow on you. Each time I listen there are new treasures found within the lyrics and musical riffs. I only wish they would do an extensive American Tour!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Wow. I just saw the second movie and love the game! hey... I wonder... how did they think of that shape... a thumb?
B006M4F67A|5.0|Love it. Would recommend to anyone who enjoys mahjong should get this app. Entertaining and fun. Not bad for a free app compared to the many out there.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Wow, decided to fire this game up on my Nexus7 after a not playing it in over a year because my son has started playing it on my wife's iPad. What a joke it is compared to the iPad version. If you can even get it to play without freezing on the loading screen it will freeze shortly after you start playing.<br /><br />This app has not been updated in 2 years. No tablet support for android, the graphics are really, really bad. But wait there is a special tablet version fire the Kindle Fire. WTF Pop Cap!<br /><br />This does not leave me much hope for Plants vs. Zombies 2 or Pop Cap fire that matter.
B004SBQALA|5.0|Great plot, good acting and excellent special effects...if you are a SciFi fan then I think you might enjoy this movie.  It seems to me that this would be a great TV series because of the plot has so much potential for char. development and sub plots.  I would really enjoy seeing that if the right people were involved with the writing and directing.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not too easy, not too hard time killer. Only 10 levels, then you're done with the game. Also, once you figure out the concept in the first level, you can pretty much zip through the others. Still, I like that you have to use your brain a little.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|Great story as only can be depicted in a way that the actors/actresses can depict it.<br />Great addition to any visual library.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it is awesome its so funny it's like the best Gameloft I just love Gameloft  i just love it Gameloft is cool!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000DIXDR|5.0|Great depiction of a family summer camp of that time.<br />The actors/actresses did a great job with this story.<br />This is an era that will only be told in stories and movies for future generations to understand.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I thought this was a lot of fun. It really held my interest. On each puzzle I couldn't put it down until the level was finished
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|The game is not so and not so bad, just average, I have found a better mahjong game for my kindle and like it much more than this one.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I thought I'd never get used to not having an actual book in my hand, but I have to admit having this app is great.  I can read on my tablet, or phone whenever I want.  It's especially great at night when I can't sleep.  I normally use a flashlight to read by, which annoys my husband. He doesn't even notice the light from my tablet. Great app for the avid book reader!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it best game I played in a while. I would recommend it to my friends. I can not get enough of it
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I play this often on my computer, and it is nice to have it available and easily playable on my Kindle also.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was a fascinating look at the history of world war 2. Sometimes fact can be more exciting than fiction. I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I have not yet finished, but am thoroughly interested, and probably will continue to read the others, hoping that they will be as interesting and getting more interesting.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Love it.  I play this all th time on the laptop, and it is SO Much better on the kindle!!!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|this movie was better than I thought it would be.so much great action.the wife and I realy enjoyed it.just great
B008HK3XYK|5.0|This case is lightweight, flexible, and colorful. It's great for easy access but of course if ur looking for something more durable and strong for ur screen this unfortunately is not it.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|I love this movie but  upon watching it .I realized the sound track was off.this is a big disappointment to me.I guess later I will have to buy it again used and hope the sound track is in synk.other wise everything else was good on it.
B000005RS1|3.0|Real to Reel is the stronger of the two Fish-era live albums, with more verve than the antiseptic La Gazza Ladra.  You have good performances of various songs from the first two studio albums as well as two key non-album tracks (\\"Cinderella Search\\" and \\"Market Square Heroes\\").<br /><br />Brief Encounter is a mishmash of leftovers that you probably won't listen to much, if ever.  \\"Freaks\\" and \\"Lady Nina\\" are both available on the compilation B'sides Themselves if you really want to hear them (the former tune is decent but not great, the latter is hilariously bad).  Then you have a trio of live performances of tracks that appeared on the first three studio albums.  All three also get live performances on La Gazza Ladra, and I can't tell whether they're identical performances or ones that just sound the same, but they are totally superfluous if you have that double album.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I can't say enough about the band, and especially Lzzy Hale. She has what it takes and displays it appropriately and with style. She is what makes rock fun...disrespect, hard on her lovers, herself...songs I want to repeat over and over. Lzzy and the emerging ladies of hard rock are what might save it in the next decade. Their fresh voices, perspectives and joy of their craft is a great shot in the arm of what has become a sluggish boys want to whine trend in rock in general. Halestorm brings me back to the days of car windows rolled down, blasting music over inadequate speakers, summer cruising, summer fun and nights spent fumbling in backseats, or heading off to impromptu parties - &#34;party at the moon tower!&#34; -<br /><br />All hail Halestorm and Lzzy Hale !!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Have totally enjoyed MobilityWear' s game of Spider on my KFire HD 8-9, always smooth playing with no glitches. Only gripe is the pesky ads between hands that I cannot &quot;x&quot; away, have to go to home then bring the game back up. I spend lots of time playing and will continue even with the pesky ads.
B007N8RULO|4.0|This is my go to game when I want to wind down or occupy some time. I avoid most of the pop up ads by turning my Wi-Fi off. This also saves battery time. I am now spoiled by the touch action which sends cards. No more dragging! The only downside for me is when you touch the cards to send they often go to whichever pile the game decides instead of what I would consider the best choice. Thus the four stars. It's a minor adjustment for me but if you keep track of your statistics it will effect your scores. Great game.
B005LAIIN0|5.0|I liked this movie..Like many I am waiting for \\"The Walking Dead\\" to return to lelevision. This movie fills that void during the hiatus. It is filmed and edited masturfully. Not as bloody and gory as Walking Dead but the way it is filmed it holds the same excitement and grab ya scenes. Pitt plays his part well and I recognize the woman who plays his wife as star of the AMC show \\"The Killing\\". AMC seems to cast well so I guess movie makers are taking a tip. This movie made me jump in some scenes that alone gives it the 5 star rating it deserves.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Pure fun a must have most addictive game I own on my kindle download now what are you waiting for
B0091REZMW|4.0|I have no life now. I just play this game now and don't leave my house or even brush my teeth! Mystery manor for life ya'll!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, great challenge. I got stuck and and found some great help on you tube.many levels and gets harder as you I go.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun but kinda boring after while when u do the same stuff waiting to learn lightning bolts to train and compete
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Sadly I chose to pay for the Pro version after using this app for a while.  The app no longer works and there are no developer updates...I think that they took the money and ran...sad.  Don't waste your money.
1442364203|4.0|The problem with audio books is that I listen to them in the car on my commute.  This means that I sit in the driveway when I get home to find out what happens next.<br /><br />This story is so different from Kite Runner, and yet so amazing.  It is the story of two girls from different backgrounds and walks of life.  They end up married to the same man.  They become sisters surviving a hard life in war-torn Afghanistan.  It is the story of a younger girl teaching an older woman that she is valuable, lovable, worthy, and breaking down the barriers that the older woman has put up throughout her life.<br /><br />Some of the subject matter is hard to hear.  Many of us will never face some of the difficulties in the story.  The story will have you crying buckets, and is well worth purchasing and listening to over and over again.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't put it away!!<br />I played like 7 hours in a row.<br />My parents say that I will become one!
B000AYEL6U|3.0|I wouldnt recommend it. It's tediuos and long.<br /><br />It seemed rather dark and not enjoyable because it was so dark, to me any way. Others may enjoy igt.
0307913090|5.0|Awesome to listen to, can't wait for the rest of the books to finish listening to.  Well worth getting the rest
B002VWNID6|2.0|This is the second one I ordered and both of them went into the movie about 30 minutes and suddenly stopped. It had a box to click on Return to Movie. That did nothing. So basically I bought two movies that didn't work. One was at Walmart and the other through Amazon. This indicates to me that perhaps all the copies of this old movie are bad, or purposely set to stop way before it finished. Makes me wonder if the copies are even legal. Just my thoughts...
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you have any interest in why some people don't quite fit in to the party society we have created, this is the book for you.  As an introvert myself, I found this book both insightful and confirming.  Although any work of this type risks overly simplified pop psychology, Susan Cain writes with search thoughtful language, based on extensive research, that this danger is almost entirely avoided.  This is a work of great charm, when read, it is impossible to believe anything but that this is a deep personal statement executed with careful scholarship and passion.  There are, of course, many over simplifications, including talking as if there are only two polar opposite profiles.  Susan acknowledges the risk of this in an afterword, explaining that the need to communicate effectively requires this sacrifice.  I agree with her.<br /><br />A must read for introverts and extroverts alike, a wonderful and important work
1574214276|5.0|good adult beginner book......especially nice for anyone inhibited to draw.  lovely designs, easy to follow instructions and lots of ideas
B00CHI5B7A|2.0|Hated the movie.  Not sure that I liked their casting decisions either.  It seems that Sean Penn has played that very character in another movie???
B0053O89WY|5.0|I should say my wife love it!  I hardly ever watch it.  Since she is such a big fan along with so very many others, it must be addictive!
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Very nice mahjong game. Enjoyed it immensely. High replay value, and I like the shuffle tile option. I would definitely recommend this game to friends and family.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Great Songs by a great Artist.  I don't think even he believes what a success he has become.  I first new he was a star when I heard him sing You Lift Me Up.  He is just one of the born talents of our time!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Would have given 5 stars if it had been longer! A wonderful book. Will try more by this author, this was my first.
B00BAYLQI0|5.0|A very good flick.  My wife is a big fan of Naomi Watts.  That makes it worth the purchase for me and her.
B00DU74U74|5.0|Just finished watching The Host and really didn't know what to expect, having not read the book. Both my daughter and I found the movie very entertaining and enjoyable. My daughter had read the book, so she was vested in the characters right away. It took me just a tad longer. I thought the lead female character (also from Lovely Bones)did an excellent job and by the end I was very emotionally attached to her character. There are some good support characters and a great ending that just may have left room for The Host 2. I hope so!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I loved how balanced and easy to read the book was. Instead of just a 600-page praise about how wonderful he was, it also portrayed how horrible of a person he was as well. Those are the type of contrasts that make a well written biography stand out from others.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was unable to put it down. It left you with lots of questions making me want to read the next book.
B0082Z447U|5.0|This is the second book of Wilke Collins' that I have read, the first being The Moonstone. In both books, various characters tell the story in their own words via written narratives.  One of the characters compiled all the narratives in a somewhat chronological order so we can find out what happened - that makes up the book. The story is set in England around 1850, starting when a young artist is commissioned by an aristocrat to catalogue some art pieces on canvas.  The artist falls in love with the niece who is engaged to someone else, an evil someone else.  Trouble ensues.<br /><br />Wilke Collins was a buddy of Charles Dickens.  Wilke is easier to read.  Bob and I read both books mentioned and he is finishing a third.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love period programs with love stories. It is cross between soap opera and romantic movie. Can't wait to the next season.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Totally enjoyed all three of the books.  I was incredulous at the ending of the first book, and frankly had to buy the 2nd to see what the outcome was.  I loved the characters, thought they grew a little in each book, could totally relate to them and enjoyed all of the quirkie bits.<br /><br />What I started to find,and I heard this from some other women friends as well, was, although you knew it contained sex scenes, the scenes ran a bit long - to the point where I was thinking - ok, enough is enough.<br /><br />Other than that, I'm looking forward to seeing if she writes more on these characters at a different point in their lives.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This was a great add to the VD collection i do not have that many that i believe should be in a collection this is one of those that made it
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Easy &amp; fun to play! Very addicting game &amp; lovely graphics! This is a first time game for me but I now love it!
B001608QVS|5.0|This was a great add to the VD collection i do not have that many that i believe should be in a collection this is one of those that made it
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love mine craft so much. My best friend has it on her I pod. I totally recommend this game to people who like building their own cartoon world's. I give it five stars. :-D
B0091REZMW|4.0|it does well. the tutorial is short and sweet but gets the job done. everything is easy to understand. I'm only at the beginning though.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I found this game in by dads I pad and I loved it so I got it I showed my family and friends and they all enjoy it
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|Refreshing look at Katy Perry and her \\"story\\". It's nice that a strong work ethic is emphasized....that being in her position takes a lot of work!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like it very much can get kind of addictive at times but other then that it's a good game
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game bbecause it is fun and it is good for any age:) I love it I am on level 5 and I have over 200 coins well for all the people who play this game please enjoy just like me
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game was a lot of fun, it had clever puzzles that you have to figure out to get to the next room.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app gives you everything you need to know about the weather. Love it!!!!  Would recommend it to anyone else
B00BR0LQ5K|5.0|Walk off the Earth is on their way! Love their harmonies and the work they do. If you haven't checked out their music videos, you've got to. That's where the magic lies. They are on their way to greatness.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|This is a fun game but be prepared to have some problems finding some of the numbers in the time given. It is a super game for those that like hidden object games
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|Love the twists and turns of this book! The growing relationship between Sam and Grace is fabulous and I really liked the introduction of characters. Can't wait to read the final book
B00CWY76CC|1.0|This game was rated 4-1/2 stars by 5361 people so I'm supposing that I must be the one with the problem.  The instruction says, \\"The purpose of this game is to break out of the rooms. Solve the puzzles and find all the hidden objects that you have to use in the rooms in order to advance to the next floor\\".  Swell!  How do you do that? I see a room with stuff in it, what am I looking for?  What do I do when I find it? If I find everything and can solve the puzzle, how do I record my solve?  This is about the 10th game app I've purchased that doesn't give any rules or explanation of HOW TO PLAY the game. Is it just me?  If anybody can clue me in, PLEASE DO!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is an awesome game, it makes you think and really go outside the box. Great game for myself and children, exploring numbers, colors, shapes, and so on, great in education and memory.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a fun time killer mainly.  While relatively easy, it doesn't hold your hand either.  Would recommend for people who like puzzle type games.
B008A708E8|5.0|[[ASIN:B008A708E8 Voltaire: Oeuvres compl&egrave;tes - 109 titres et annexes (Annot&eacute;s) (French Edition)]] Great edition. What a pleasure to have the complete works of the great man at the touch of one's Kindle. A bit like living and spending real time with the master itself.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very nice game , not too hard to find the hidden objects, but always has something new for you to do. Finish puzzles in each room of the manor to collect money and rewards to enter locked rooms. Overall a very enjoyable game. Wish it was a little bit longer though.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is definitely one of the best games I have played in a long time. Worth the money..i can't wait for more Rooms. It's mysterious, clever and the graphics are great.I wish it was longer.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|similar to Temple Run in mechanics only. this game actually has a story to go along with it. nice armor and special weapons. would have given it 5 stars but there is an extra download and my Kindle froze the first time I played it and actually got some distance.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|As other's have stated eset fount a virus in \\"Android:SmsReg-EO (PUP)\\" This should not be a free app of the day spreading it to many people that do not have a AV on there android device.      EDIT: They confirmed this was a false positive with avast.
B000ZNQEMU|5.0|I had purchased another letting before which wasn't a letting at all as it was too big for a pocket. This is a real keyrong size but more importantly it's a real Lego piece, or as close to as possible. The helmet doesn't remove of course. All the movements you expect from Lego pieces are there. Legs arms and hands rotate. The quality seems to be legit with the graphics. As its a keyrong it's in a pocket all day with keys so I don't expect it will hold up forever without a scratch. But so far it's not shown any wear.
1594746036|5.0|I though this was for young people but I read the Harry Potter series also. This book is great, I enjoyed it and chose it for light reading. I started and could not put it down, very iinteresting....I do not want to spoil it for anyone wanting to read it but I am in hopes they will find it as great a read as I did. The book came in as new......no marks, no bent pages, no scaring on cover although listed as used. After a lot of drama, mysteries, murder, sci-fantasy, this was such a welcome read for me. Enjoy....to all those who choose to read this, I am sure you will.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I wasn't expecting much and was pleasantly surprised by the quality of this game!I would totally  recommend this game to a friend.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Well, my Grandson loved it.  But for me it is very over-priced.  The Lego box is no larger than a roll of toilet paper, but again, my Grandson was very happy which is all that mattered on his birthday.
0240810554|5.0|This is the one book my daughter wanted.  Buying through this vendor was quick and easy and I would recommend them to family and friends.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I only started watching this because it was on Prime.  Now I am hooked.  Besides the music, the kids in the club actually supporting one another the way they do is just refreshing.  One can only hope there are &#34;real&#34; teenagers out there like this group!
B009HUB40Y|4.0|I actually like this game.  It is addictive I just keep playing more and more to beat my previous score.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Way to go. Loved this game. Could not put it down. Graphics were great. Worked great on my kindle fire.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've been waiting on this for a long time. Duels is finally on Android! It works great, very crisp and clear graphics. I miss the online multiplayer, but it's just nice to be able to play MTG anywhere I go.
B003G4W49C|4.0|This book moved quickly and was thought-provoking. I will definitely read another book by this author in the near future.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|not as good as the orginal.  did not like the lack of respect for father figure like last one.  where is Holly? Explosions looked good.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|I only read this book for 5 minutes at a time, while I was blow-drying my hair. It is easy to dip into, enjoy and laugh out loud. I'll be sharing some of the funnier parts. Ms. Fey is a passionate feminist in the best sense of the word. I appreciated her candid appraisal of the unfair criticism of professional women and the obstacles to their success society unconsciously condones.
B002WY65VU|5.0|better than on TV.  saw stuff on dvd not on hbo or sho or whatever. Love this movie. Funny funny funny
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I've only bought a hand few of movies/shows and this was worth every penny. Quality was excellent & sound was great!
1781162646|5.0|bought this as a gift for my sister. always a good read. thank you for the book and the great service, sincerely, janet
B00597A6NU|4.0|It is a good movie without alot of cussing or extreme violence. We rally need more of these kind of movies in 2013!!***happymouse***
B00DU73T08|3.0|Was Not a Bad Movie kinda reminded me of stargate in a way of the aliens in the human host. and the fact she could still hear the voice inside.. never read the book but the movie is not bad... wont be more than my 4.99 hd rental... had a bit of issues at first but a call to amazon fixed it with no problem.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|I read the children's version of this book as a young boy. Now after reading the actual book I have a greater desire to read more classic books. Especially Mark Twain.
159463176X|5.0|Very good story of life in Kabul spanning multiple generations.I have read other books by this author and enjoy his style.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|QT's losing the magic touch.  I thought so with Inglourious Bastards and I think so again.  Fabulous dialogue, superb.  But honestly there were certain deaths in both movies that were gratutious and unnecessary and ruined the film.  Dr. Schultz didn't need to die, and neither did Bridget von Hammersmark...over the top  And Django especially REALLY dragged on and on.  Where is the editing?  Is Tarantino getting so big like Stephen King & JK Rowling that no one will edit his work?  Both these films lacked the satisfaction of Kill Bill and Pulp Fiction.
B00CL68NOG|5.0|I didn't really expect much from this film--it was just something to have on in the background one evening. But it surprised me: it was funny and silly and sweet. The chemistry between Seth Rogen and Barbra Streisand was there in spades.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|if you have a busy schedule this is a great app to keep you accountable and on track with reading the Bible.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Insufferable rich people and hardworking servants coexist in this gem of a series. Yet, no one character is completely one-dimensional, which makes the show so compelling. The Downton home is as much a star as the cast, and even my toughest friends have shed tears while watching. It's just delicious.
B001N9ESQ4|1.0|I wanted to like this movie as the original was so fascinating. But I've gotten older and wiser, and fantasy no longer captures my attention so easily. Both characters talk ideologically on most issues or else just talk too much, particularly Celine with her parochial diatribes. Much of the dialogue sounds like political theater slumming it in a standard genre. That's too weird for a couples movie, let alone a real couple learning how to commit to each other. It's sad, because the locations are scenic and the storyline has promise.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|There's a good reason why this show is so popular. The actors and the stories draw you in and don't let go. You'll never be bored, and you might be quite surprised by the twists and turns of the stories.
B00D5CENXA|5.0|I really enjoyed this story.  I love stories about the bond that humans and animals share and I love that a horse was a hero.  This story touches on an issue that is all too real for many women and I'm glad it had a happy ending.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|There's a good reason why this show is so popular. The actors and the stories draw you in and don't let go. You'll never be bored, and you might be quite surprised by the twists and turns of the stories.
B008JFUR10|1.0|I couldn't wait to review this film, at all the sites possible, to say  \\"\\"Horrible\\"\\".  Just noise and repetition. Nothing new.
B00AYB1RXE|5.0|Wonderful film about a remarkable musician. It's simply amazing that Sixto Rodriguez isn't a household name. I purchased his CDs as soon as I finished watching the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! It's fun for all ages and for all people! I haven't stoped playing it yet beacause it's so fun! You really should get the app there are a few ads though, but you'll be hooked on it you won't even care! ;) If you like this you should get flow!
0307477479|4.0|Read this w/my book group most of whom enjoyed it. I thought it was a great story with many points to pause & think about but I wouldn't read another one in this style.
B00DHSK3RM|2.0|I knew this was just a guide for the game, because i read what I am about to download onto my Kindle before I download it. People you seriously can't give a low rating because you didn't read the description. I am giving a low rating anyway because my coworker & I both tried to figure out how to look at guides for a specific level and could not figure out how to do so. It seemed like it skipped around and had random things listed. We received no help from it & I deleted it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I have often been a harsh critic of Mr. King 's works. This story however is a lovely gem. I hold a history degree and found King 's assessment engaging and entertaining. Thank you Mr. King for your diligence in researching and telling of this time twisting thriller.
0316017930|5.0|In “Outliers” Gladwell is concerned to show why it is that certain individuals become true outliers, in that they have tremendous success that cannot be explained by their cultural heritage alone. For example, why is it that so many of the lawyers who had the greatest success as corporate takeover lawyers in the 1980s and 1990s were descendants of Eastern European Jews who had immigrated to the United States around the turn of the twentieth century? As Gladwell points out, most of the most successful lawyers were born within a few years of each other, at a time when there was a birth dearth, which allowed them to take advantage of the best schools in New York at the time. Moreover, they came of age as lawyers at the time when hostile corporate takeovers were beginning to be the order of the day. Had they been born a few years earlier or a few years later, they would have missed out on all this and in all likelihood would have lived in anonymity.<br /><br />I'm convinced that Gladwell is on to something. However, I'm also concerned that he has sought to establish his hypotheses through a rather limited number of examples. When a person engages in this procedure it is always possible to pick and choose instances that support one's hypotheses and ignore those that do not. I would caution against simply accepting all of what Gladwell says. He may be right. But, since he is engaged in inductive reasoning, unless his sample is augmented by further evidence, we have a fairly weak correlation. None of this takes away from the value of the book. It is still a very interesting and worthwhile book to read.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Could not put my iPad down while reading this amazing story on my kindle app. I'm so sad it's over and that there isn't a sequel, Travis and Abby are beautiful.
B00CM9JKXU|5.0|Great return to form! Fits in with the Pre-Q2k era queensryche. It IS rather short by today's standards, but every song is solid. I could do without the  (instrumental???) Midnight Lullaby, and really hate the whining baby in it (and at the end of the following track), but the actual songs are all solid! LOVE IT!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|This a really sweet game I love the challenge I would recommend it for sure!!!!!!! And the graphics are really great
B008OOYALE|5.0|The good thing is is that it's free! So there is no money! The only thing that's wrong is that it's kind of hard to evolve. But who cares? This game is sweet
B007SGM084|5.0|NOW I know what all the buzz is about!  Can't wait to see the movie, though it can't be as good as the books!!<br />klynnrn
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Easily addicting. I just wish it wasn't quite so tempting to bankrupt myself... I've been looking for something similar to Farmville to play on my tablet, and so far this is the best I've found.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Definitely lots of fun.  You do have to think a little.  Every floor it gets a little more difficult. But still lots of fun.
B00526ZKYS|4.0|I can't wait to read the next one. The twist and turns really make this book and series worth reading
B005LAII80|4.0|I thought the slow motion  was awesome  and the actors where pretty good but not better the the Stallone version it had more of a store then this one but still great movie thats why i bought it
B00CW665VI|5.0|This book was so hard to put down, but I had to sleep. I love the characters and the writer put me in their lives. Like a great friend this book will leave you laughing and wanting more!
B0041KVW2K|5.0|This box set is absolutely fantastic. There aren't enough words to express how great this product is. I was so happy to open the set up and take a look at all the Beatles records as well as the glossy book. I honestly recommend this to anyone. And, as of right now, Amazon is looking at the issues that people have been having with these records. I bought one anyway and I have to say that the one I received was great. If you're a Beatles fan, I implore you to purchase this!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|All the fun of temple run but with those cute yellow minions.  Cant wait to play this game some more.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Great game I'm level 28 finally got the sniper but the game needs more maps and modes to play.<br /><br />Awesome game come play I'll bet I'll beat you lol
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's a 5 star rating because of the great storyline and how the book takes place. I am really please with the author on this book & all of the rest of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I loved the app until a recent upgrade changed it a lot. Now it's more confusing to navigate and they took away the detailed written forecast and the hourly forecast. Now I like the Accuweather app better and I'm removing the Weather Channel app.

B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Had me from the very beginning and downloaded the rest of the series before I finished the first book.  Highly recommend it and can't wait for the movie.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the previous version<br />So easy to choose weather where friends and family live as well as locations we travel to weekly for our business.  Have uninstalled this new unfriendly version.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|My avast mobile security found a virus as well.  I do not understand why their other apps sound fine in the reviews but this app has a bad virus.  Wonder why they did this?  They ruined their rep by adding crap to one of their apps.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really liked this book. I preferred Hunger Games and Catching Fire. MockingJay was good, but a couple things that I didn't expect happened and it wasn't the best surprise... But other than that, the trilogy was awesome, very interesting. I really recommend these books!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think everybody should give this game a try. just love it. so much you can do and build. also fun on multiplayer
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|The actors were good and Mila was breath-taking at first before fully turning evil.  The story line builds nicely to the original &#34;Wizard of OZ&#34;  Scenery was spectacular
B005H9B2CE|4.0|High production values make this enjoyable...it has a sense of humor too. Altogether fun and exiting to watch. Asgard is beautiful!.
0345803485|3.0|Too kinky for my taste and I didn't care for the main character, but things are explained about him in book 2 and the story got better.
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Yes...this is the first Amon Amarth album I have listened...and I am both regretful and ashamed... After listening to deceiver, I immedeately bought twilight of the thunder god, fate of norns, sultur and with odin on our side and AA is the only thing I can listen to in the last three weeks...<br /><br />All songs are very solid,  but if I must chose one it is &#34; as loke falls&#34;
B009MYARIK|3.0|I've read almost every single Sophie Kinsella book, apart from the last one (I've got your number), which bored me to tears, and I was very excited to get my hands on Wedding Night in the hope it might be an improvement. Unfortunately, it was rather a disappointment.<br />The plot was ok; nothing to rave about: When Lottie's relationship with Richard comes to an abrupt halt because he just won't propose, she meets up with an old flame, Ben, and accepts his crazy idea of getting married on the grounds of them having been 'in love' for fifteen years. Lottie's sister isn't keen on the idea so she tries her best to sabotage the honeymoon. I won't say more so as not to spoil the plot. Let's just say my emotions ranged from lukewarm to annoyed at some of the things she does to stop Lottie.<br />The sisters' alternate change in POV didn't bother me; what bothered me was that all characters sounded so similar. I'd read the same thoughts one character had in a different chapter from the other character's POV. At some point I really wished the author spent more time thinking about her characters' personalities and how to give them a distinct voice. Description was pretty much non-existent but the book was an easy read, hence the three star rating.<br />I really hope Sophie Kinsella will regain her voice at some point and write something like The Domestic Goddess again, which is the only reason why I keep continuing reading her books, even though the last few were disappointing.
0393325172|5.0|The entire series by Patrick OBrian is wonderful. I have read all 20 of them twice and have learned a great deal not only about the sea and life in the 17/1700's but human nature as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is so fun I love this app it is so fun the characters are exactly like the movie and the animation is fabulous !
159463176X|4.0|Khaled Hosseini has given me great insight into a world I have much to learn about. The characters of this story however did not quite become the soul mates as those in his previous novels.
B005I6EU48|5.0|It makes the Kindle look like a book as well as protecting it .Easy to use frequently. I have had many complements.
B007NVJ7NU|1.0|The movie was mostly soft porn.  It was disgusting.  It starts out somewhat entertaining, taking the perspective of the young punk drug dealer, and then it's just sex through the entire rest of the movie.
0307200477|5.0|My children were brought up on this book and I give it for gifts for family. Who live out of town.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have seen in a long while.  The writers are incredible to create such great stories and the actors are amazing to deliver those great stories.
B004VOBIE8|5.0|Great app and works perfectly I would recommend it to anybody<br /><br />P.s. if you saw one of George Lopez's stand up comedy you would know what ftp means
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I have loved this show from the first time I saw it. Has a vary good plot line that will draw you right in.
B003TJ4YU6|5.0|Excellent picture and sound...Thank goodness for the entire four shows...commercials and all! Hey...Show number one includes Davy Jones in an \\"Oliver\\" stage performance...two and a half years before \\"The Monkees\\". Incredible. To have The Beatles' entire Ed Sullivan Shows on DVD is like finding gold bars in the back yard. 1964...The fab four....and everything changed. Beatlemania! The best!
B0095MVOMC|3.0|I previously wrote a comment that this application contained a virus because Avast said it had one.  It looks like that was a false-positive.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|it works perfect with the Western digital 3TB firewire 800 external hard drive... no problems at all.<br />Is very expensive just for an adapter
0688051197|4.0|Completed my collection as this is an English version and American printings are non existent. There were three books done in Englasnd and not issued in the US, this is but one of them
B0000VAFO0|5.0|It keeps you wondering what's gone to happen A 1000 year war between Vampires and werewolves has been going on the end is believed to be soon ending.But unknown to the vampires the werewolves have A secret and A last card to play so watch for lots of action deception betrayal and doubles.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Fine condition great price.  Definitely a good purchase, now will look for extended edition dvds to add to the collection this is just the basic movie with a few extra scenes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. Wish there were more levels. I hope they add more soon.This game is super addicting. It really makes you think!
141690977X|5.0|This guide is refreshingly funny and informative. I only wish I had had a copy when I was seventeen! Powerful!
B0072V39DK|4.0|I never knew that this existed, until I looked up Jamie Foxx's Django: Unchained 2012.  Franco Nero, I never heard of him until I saw Enter the Ninja 1982 on cable last year. Now, he reminds me of Clint Eastwood in this movie, from the clothes and the way he carries himself. I'm guessing it's because of the time period this movie was released in. Anyway, I like the movie a lot based on action scenes, the dialogue is okay too!. If you love westerns like Clint Eastwood's, you'll love this movie. Also, there is a lot of reincarnations of this movie not just Jamie's and Franco Nero's sequels.
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome and I see a very bright future including endermen and something that makes a Chavez to the original computer minecraft.
B000QCSA54|4.0|If you are involved in Complexity, driven by the desire to to and be better and surrounded by orchards of opportunity in full bloom, read this...and follow Seth's advice.
B0079R8KXG|3.0|I really like this product, but the clips that hold the Kindle in place are not holding up very well.  My Kindle has fallen out numerous times.  I Have had this for six months.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|the kids love it and it is challenging enough for adults too. graphics are very cool. rewards are a bit unattainable for free but that is common
1452654425|3.0|I did not like it. The examples were not what I expected. I do not recommend it. It was boring information
0984380213|5.0|I have read it twice and keep a highlighter in it's pages along with post it notes. One of the better business books I have read in a while. Buy it, read it and implement, the ROI is there. You do not have to use Sales Force to benefit from the information within.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Love this game. Very challenging and fun. Only bad thing is I wish there wewe more levels for free ans sometimes you press right on the number but it doesn't register.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Free app for the day. I have not played it yet but it seems like I have to do a review first. I hope it is a fun game.
B005LAIH2M|3.0|I thought this movie was ok. Lots of action which was good part of the movie, the rest was ehhh. Watching it once was good enough for me.
B000I9YLUI|5.0|I have read the book many times, and I was quite pleased with the movie version . Tastefully done, I'm sure Jane Austin would have been pleased.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Made me think but needs more levels<br />Want to be able play .longer then a couple of hours and make me think harder
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I downloaded this game on my mom's phone before I could find it on my Kindle. When I played it on the phone, it was FINE! But when I tried it on this kindle, it keeps freezing, especially when it's took Forever downloading. Although when I was about to go on the green slide for the first time, I couldn't do anything about it, IT FROZE FOR HOURS! I couldn't even exit to the home page like with other games I know.
B00BEJOMIW|5.0|First of all, I am a fan of this movie and have been ever since it came out in theaters.  I thought it was a great movie then and after all these years, it still holds up.  Everything about this film is first class.  The acting, the costumes, the location, the sets, the cinematography, the directing, and the script.  I know it has been made and remade with each generation....and that is fine.  I think that is one way to pay tribute to a great piece of literature and make it relevant for each new audience.  So I think the best thing to do is enjoy each and every incarnation of this story.  Each one so far has had vaue in its own way.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This is a wonderful magical book. I could not stop reading it. It made me wish this kind of magic is really out there in the world. Who knows may it is.
B00003CXTG|5.0|A piece of history that is worthy of collection. I have not watched this movie as of yet, but had to have it for my collection of American history.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I thought this app was really good.  I can't wait to do more.  This is a must have app. Challenge yourself!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|I am fascinated by the strength that was required of the gladiator.  Russell Crowe was a good actor for this part. I loved the way that the story was told and the outcome of the film.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This game takes forever to download. You only get two people. If you want any more people than you have to buy it with real money. Whatever you do don't get this game
B004R36QUE|5.0|I thought that this movie was very informative and brought out the fact that obstacles enter even the more privileged society and that they can be overcome by determination.  A great bit of history entered this movie and I love history.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game it's so fun kinda hard for little kid but it is very fun if u love challenges and despicable me u will deffinatly fall in love with this game!!!!!
6305692572|5.0|Great Movie... Glad that I got it . I like to collect movies that are heart warming and this one rings true to that statement.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I would definatly reccomend this app to anyone who is looking for a loud funtioning affective alarm . Your kindle can be in sleep mode for you to use it. There is a choice off different alarm sounds or you can use your own music :))))
B000QRIGJY|5.0|Another classic Bosch story.  Loved it and I wish there were more Bosch books.  I've read almost all his adventures now.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|The music expresses so beautifully the emotions that a mother (and father) feel for their children.  Warning:  tissues will be required.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is fun and a mix of my three favourite things temple run subway surfers and of course the minions I would highly recommend this app
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Really awesome on the kindle fire. Touch screen controls feels like your actually playing with real cards. Good addition to the planeswalker series!

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|As a sci-fi fan I can wholly recommend this title to anyone who loves Ridley Scott's work. Attention to detail, arcing story to his previous movie Alien, this tale tells the origins of the Xenomorphs, the beginnings of an epic sci fi corporate empire Weyland Yutani, and even a unique origins of species adventure relating to the human species. I highly recommend this for those who are hardcore &#34;Science Fiction&#34; nerds and want a great story with a high budget instead of just another hollywood action movie.
B00756GKBA|5.0|i bought it used but it come in a wonderful condition almost like if it were new i love madonna and this is her best album jet
B0063M22QO|5.0|I haven't played concentration type games in a long time. Very much fun. Keeps your attention to details fine tuned. Hours  of fun. Must have in your game collection.
B001NLKZUA|3.0|I enjoyed it. I am confused with the whole her and clary bring in love. I am assuming it isn't true. I hope it isn't cause then the author took a very weird turn.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a brilliant game. A game which you have to be patient to reap the rewards of more food, land and new dragons. Absolutely fantastic.
B0052FG750|5.0|I've been listening to more of the Doors music recently and was missing what wasn't on the greatest hits collection. So I sprung for all the studio recordings in this collection and haven't been disappointed.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|This got off to a bit of a slow start, but man, what a great ramp up and a great ending!
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|This is probably one of Clapton's best recordings, and one that I listen to often.  MTV was doing lots of these Unplugged shows at the time, and it was sort of in vogue to release an Unplugged recording, and Clapton certainly was alone in doing this.  The difference is that Clapton's Unplugged has stood the test of time, and is straight up an outstanding blues recording.  There's nothing pretentious here, just a group of phenomenal musicians, stripped down the the acoustic basics, playing some of the finest blues you'll ever hear.  This is the intimate Clapton, who fell in love with the blues, playing from the heart.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|This is one of those books where you feel like your experiencing each adventure, heartache and happiness as if you were there. No dribble. Just a great story.
B00AESN8XY|3.0|It was broken, but I got it to instal. Still can't get the in-game purchases to work, though. Why is this so hard? Ahh, whatever.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|CD case arrived cracked.  Not what I expected, but the music and the quality of the CD was fantastic.  If you saw this show, get this CD!
B008RTE066|3.0|...that this is in Italian?<br />Don't get me wrong - saw them on Ed Sullivan - grew up with them, seen Sir Paul 3 or 4 times...<br />But apparently I am missing something here about the language thing...
B000AYEL1A|4.0|One of my favorite Streisand films. Barbra and Kris have very good chemistry together. Barbra's singing is top notched. The only downside I can give would be in certain parts the film drags a little.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|Typical Jack Teacher novel. It employs his customary maximum efficiency with a minimum of  external resources and financial aid. The quintessential teacher at the top of his game
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Easy read, would recommend for parents and kids to even read together. I am sO pleased I picked this one up.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|This was a very short book and it wasn't very interesting. I downloaded it for free so I can't really complain, but I won't be recommending this book to anyone and I wouldn't pay for this book.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Sorry but I was really disappointed with this app and hated it right away. The graphics and controls aren't good and I just don't like it. I personally think that survivalcraft is better since it has better animal graphics and the controls are easy. I like realistic games with realistic looking animals. Sorry I just don't like it.... :(
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Two fine relatively inexperienced actors and director, produce a  \\"realistic\\" ghost story which will please many viewers and displease many as well. Completely unaware of anything about the movie save what is suggested by the title, I was caught up in the daily  life of the two characters, and only gradually began to understand the nature of the picture. Yes, it seemed to drag at times but that, in itself, is  part of the plot and the experience of watching the story unfold. I liked it. I understand why others will not like it. Until the very end, nothing really happens. Clearly that was the intent of the creators. The two actors make it work, seem entirely in synch with the intentions of the writers and director. Given the gamble that watching a film like this, which will elicit such different responses, viewers are advised not to make this the key feature of a group (two or more people) evening at the television.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun app for horse lover's. I just got it and I apsolutly love it. I play it all the time just wish you could unlock things sooner.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|I like this so quite a bit, but I just wish there were more guns that I could mess around with.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Very good, but falls short of the original.  Cat was already out of the bag, I think.  But those cute little Minions continue to entertain.
B004CQ5GMU|5.0|Have one that was 2GB for years now. Went through a wash/dry cycle in my pants pocket 3 times. Casing coming apart and being held together with glue. Picked this new Transcend drive  because I liked the last one. Much bigger memory too. Only thing is the old one came with a lanyard and the new one did not.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|downloaded this for my two nieces and they love it . I also gave it a try and can not lie its a fun game.  definately recommend it
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I was just looking for a decent movie to watch on a Saturday night.  I usually prefer smaller (not blockbuster) films.  I recently rented 21 grams and found that I was very impressed by Naomi Watts' acting.  So I searched other movies of hers and lo and behold, found \\"The Impossible\\".<br /><br />One could get picky and question why she and a Scottish actor were picked to act the real life roles of a husband and wife who weren't English speakers.  However, I felt their portrayals were stellar and the special effects of the Tsunami were incredibly realistic.  It was one of those \\"don't watch/can't take my eyes off of the screen\\" moments.  However, do not expect non-stop thrills.  It is a film which centers around the story of this family, which to me makes it special.<br /><br />The story is heart wrenching, yet uplifting at the same time.  Nothing is impossible, after all.<br /><br />Definitely worth a rental....your minutes of viewing will not be wasted.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This application was a great way to waste some time whilst sitting at the airport.It kept me entertained and also made the time fly by! Excellent all round with the different puzzles in each floors escape.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Its a very nice app and very easy to use.no need to bring another gadget if you want to use one.surely will recommend it to others.
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Very good DVD set. Loved seeing the back story. Was also awesome to watch the concert from 1977. Only thing that could have made it better would be a reduction in price.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is one of my favorite things to do to unwind. I like it because you don't have to worry about losing a piece! :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My daughter has lots of fun searching for clues and this game keeps her engaged to the very end of each level.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|Its an amazing album its their best! Haha so proud of them, they come so far! Hopefully many more to come! Woohoo
B00AFROVQC|1.0|In so many ways this was just plain awful.  First, I am trying to remember the name of the book from which some of this story came.  Second, the grammar oh my goodness where to start - no on second thought just leave it I don't want to waste my time.  Third, the time lines never made sense.  Fourth, never mind I simply can't be bothered.  Someone made the statement that this writer was in the same realm with J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, Rick Riordan, Christopher Paolini and J.R.R. Tolkien, well all I can say is NO WAY!
B004SUDQ4U|5.0|How do you make the best World War Two submarine movie even better? Release it again on Blu Ray. If you are a fan of this movie and have a Blu Ray player--- What are you waiting for?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I. Love a book that takes me away to places I have never been. That makes me want to go back to it. That can take away my daily concerns, to think of what is happening to the people in the book. One that makes me sad to see the last page.  This is another winner by this author.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - is realy great!! buy it you'll love it to!!! ,,The  audio is Great!!!!  ,

B0064X7FVE|1.0|New is not always better.  I will be looking for a different weather app now.  Disappointed in the weather channel on how bad this new version is.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful Darkness took off running where Beautiful Creatures left off and reached a higher level of creativity. I highly recommend reading the book but the first book, Beautiful Creatures, should be read first to better understand the full story.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Just did not really interest me at all. I got really bored with it after a few days so I just deleted it from my tablet.
B009ZOCLD6|5.0|I have numerous recordings of the Brahms violin concerto and I have played this piece quite a few times (as an orchestra member, not as a soloist). I always liked the Brahms violin concerto, but was never really drawn towards it as a romantic violin concerto as I was, for example, to the Sibelius.<br /><br />And then, as I was driving in my car and listening to a classical music radio station, a version of this concerto came on the radio and absolutely took my breath away. It was so good, I had to stop the car to hear who the soloist was. It was Lisa Batiashvili. I fretted a for about a week whether or not to buy the recording since I have other recordings of the Brahms, and then I bought it, and I am so happy to have done so.<br /><br />In short, this recording--although perhaps a little overproduced, and yes, the violin sounds like it has been very closely recorded--is a marvel of technical musicianship. The \\"studio magic\\" aside, one can really hear the thought that Batiashvili has poured into this piece. Above all, it is the phrasing that makes the piece incredible. Everything in her interpretation flows, rough edges are rounded out, and yet, remarkably, this actually increases and intensifies the energy of the piece. She does an amazing job sustaining notes, playing \\"through\\" the phrases, and making all of the parts fit into a glorious whole. You really do just want to keep listening. The stand out movement is the first movement, although she does an excellent job on 2 and 3 as well.<br /><br />As a musician, I feel like I learned something just listening how she put the piece together. I have been listening to this recording quite often since I have purchased it, and it truly is something very, very special.
B0091REZMW|1.0|you have to connect with friends on facebook to play this game. so i deleted it. I don't like that idea.
0865479186|5.0|A brilliant guide, for the lay man, to the world of science and medicine and the need to maintain a rational approach to new phenomena. It's also a critique of the mainstream media and the lack of specialist knowledge among feature writers and reporters, resulting in mis-reporting, deeply flawed analysis and the creation of campaign 'bandwagons' that charge off in the wrong diction. The global scare over the non-existent link between autism and the MMR vaccine is only the most egregious example.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Loved, loved this book. So insightful and touching. I read this at a difficult time in my life. The message is so true... Highly recommended reading in my opinion.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Such a beautiful book. I am sorry I waited so late in life to read it. It will make you stronger in mind and in spirit to read of what love, determination, and belief in youself can do. Read it and encourage your children to read it. It might change you as it changed Colin.
B00BZA3I0I|5.0|the continuing saga of the wolf pack...let see, how do I explain without giving away too much...well there's a wedding, a kidnapping, and a monkey...and oh yeah, that stripper...Well I'm glad I saw this before viewing Hangover 3, without part 2, I would not have laughed at certain parts of the movie.
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Great music. I enjoy the way this band experiments with sound. I listen to it for about two weeks straight.
1455869910|5.0|worth the time and money! This have to be my first time reading a teenage novel though being an adult. guess, i am gonna have to read more teenage novels. i've come to respect john green because he is a youtuber.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|\\"The sweetest music he had ever heard slowly evaporated from his memory like the dying sighs of a thousand angels.\\"<br /><br />Eternal - Delicate Rose - Petite Fleur, is a woman with a fractured mind from the horrid savagery she witnessed at the hands of her pursuer, Count Lucien.<br />This gothic, dark, poetic tale leads us through the twisted mind of this poor woman as she is entrapped in the bowels of an insane asylum reminiscent of Dante's Inferno.<br /><br />She and the Count share a commonality, they exist in a perpetual dance of love and hate, mutual obsession. Both are inhabited by the souls of ancients entwined in an age-old battle for her precious, eternal blood. Through snatches of broken memory we learn Eternal has been pursued by the Count in all his incarnations across ancient Europe, the two of them leap-frogging into one life after another, each vying for that magic moment when her blood will bring forth its gift of eternal life.<br /><br />\\"He heard that word again - \\"Eternal\\" - carried on a breeze of subconscious design.\\"<br /><br />This lost soul plays the role of Madonna, bearing aspects of pure innocence and the predatory succubus. Through the centuries she has seduced kings, queens, statesmen, and all manner of rulers. A muse inspiring artists to greatness, forging conquerors from average men, she is a living paradox, the woman every man wants but can never truly have.<br /><br />Simon Okill crafts a lyrical and disturbing story in the grand fashion of Edgar Allan Poe, told from the perspective of tortured souls with dual personalities. The characters are colorful, lively, despicable, yet still lovable in their human frailty.<br /><br />A genre-bender, the story is definitely not what you would ever expect. A clever world where nothing and no one is what they seem, a world mired in grey morality where villains and heroes trade places like schizophrenics.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This book is beautifully written.  The story line pulls you into the life of the Nolan family. A glimpse into the world of Brooklyn 100 years ago. There is a wonderful honesty surrounding the characters, revealing their flaws along with their strengths.  Francie would approve of the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game rocks and works really well.I love it as well as many of my fellow cool close friends and other fellow people.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Both interesting and educational. The character development  is great. Historically  accurate -British television at some of it's best!<br />Seasons one and two  are equally good.

B0097EWK3A|5.0|Pretty cool. Challenging but the hints help. Very addictive! There were a few glitches where you have to touch just so but not bad.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great concept in bringing all of these super heroes together.  Anyone who enjoys mindless super hero action movies will surely enjoy this one.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Love the narrative construct of bouncing between Amy and Nick but somehow the ending was unsatisfying and left me incomplete with the story.
1593072937|5.0|Amazing book, gives you a sneak peak into the world that is Frank Miller's Sin City with a compelling storyline and captivating characters.
B008P9M614|5.0|I ordered the House DVD box for my wife, who recently has become obsessed with the medical drama. The box set has all 8 seasons on standard-def DVD for, at the time I bought it, the incredible price of about $80. The box itself is very sturdy, not some paper-thin affair, and the cases each season comes in are the same as if you were to buy them individually. The only thing that stinks for me is that each season is on DVD and not blu-ray. While watching the show on my 51&#34; plasma, for instance, I see trails behind moving characters; but while it bugs someone with a complex like me, it certainly isn't a deal breaker. The show was filmed in wide-screen though, so you won't have to suffer through the gray or black side bars of a show filmed in 4:3. If each season were on blu-ray, while you'd have crisp HD, that price tag would probably not sink as low as $80, but the package itself would be thinner because each season wouldn't have to be stretched across 6 DVD discs. At any rate, this was a great purchase. The wife loves it, ergo, I love it.

B009ZQJ1G4|5.0|Excellent movie! I enjoyed it greatly! It shows the true power of the human spirit to overcome even the most difficult adversities! A true testament to man, humanity and the power of passion.

B008TRH5N6|4.0|I really enjoyed this book and I plan on re-reading it for a long time to come, but I do have to say, the writing was a bit hard to read. It's written as if I'm reading a manuscript from hundreds of years ago and from a distant land. I'm sure no matter how old Mr. Murphy is, it can't be as old as his style of writing! The way the writer worded things or phrased/formed his sentences, it was chaotic to me at times. Don't misunderstand, I very much liked the book and the vocabularies were not difficult in the least but reading this book required me to concentrate. His book makes classic books from Emily Bronte, Jane Austen, and even Shakespeare like easy reading. He has a very different way of speaking through his word. (At least that's my opinion!)
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was an amazing ending to a amazing series. It was<br />exciting, suspenseful and also sad. It was an amazing ending.
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|I love doodle jump is fun to play I'm like addicted to it it's fun to play in fact I'm playing right now
B00D37UQ1K|1.0|Not worth the 2 hours. Don't bother watching it. The story line and the acting was beyond stupid. It just seemed very silly, the Melanie girl and the love triangle she found herself in. Ugh
B007N85POS|5.0|Angry birds Rio is so cool I loved playing it but unfortunately I had to delete from my kindle fire hd
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Very entertaining, non-stop action, funny movie. The Hulk is my favorite. Even if you don't usually go for 'violent' movies I think you will enjoy this.
B005PK57IK|5.0|For the same reasons I loved seasons 1 and 2. Great writing, cast and story. I swear the writers just sit around a table with little representations of each character and mix them up, then write about their association. Then they re-shuffle and write some more. It's such a great interaction with all the recurring characters. LOVE it!
B005K17RU0|1.0|This app was great until the update which totally changed its look and the way it functions. l have  uninstalled it.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Growing up in the '80's, I remember the whole Iran-hostage period, but didn't recall all the details.  This is a very well acted and directed film with plenty of suspense and a great storyline.  Well worth the rental price.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Awesome totally thrilling fun from being  to end. Would definitely recommend to a friend. Love the graphics makes you feel like your in the game awesome.
B0058YPG2K|5.0|Many TV series get old after a few seasons...not this one.  Although it starts off a bit slow IMHO, the last 1/2 of the season is very well put together and entertaining.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This is a great watch. It is just the right size, really good looking, easy to see and read and it works flawlessly. I got tired of always changing batteries in my watches, so I looked for a mechanical watch I could forget about. I was also looking for something inexpensive, versatile and sturdy. This auto winder is perfect for my needs. Makes a great everyday watch that is both serviceable and dressy at the same time. I bought the black because it was the least expensive, but the other colors look awfully nice as well. I've had this about three weeks and everyone who has seen it has complimented me on it. Excellent watch.
006056251X|5.0|Lord St. Vincent was everything proper young ladies avoided. Handsome as sin, a minute with him would ruin any lady's good name. That is until Evie enters the picture. I loved the way this story developed and how St. Vincent went from rake to besotted husband. Evie is his total opposite but it was total fun watching St. Vincent fall!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|i loved it so much! it felt very real and unlike any other books that had same plot which boring. I felt their emotions and i praise the author for delivering such a heartfelt book.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I had this on my son's iPod and could not get enough. It is even better on the kindle fire because of the larger screen. Only complaint is that the iPod version gives you a free game every day and you were able to buy past daily games for gopher bucks. I wish it was available for my kindle also. Thanks for such a fun game and keep up the good work. Btw the litter videos between the different courses are funny. The gopher rocks.
B00DEG4Z1W|3.0|i hav never really tried it yet but everyone says its good so ill get it just to try it out first.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book kept me wanting more at every turn of the page, especially at the end. Be sure to bear with the few parts that seem to go slow, it's well worth it! I can't wait for January 2014!
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I thought it had chances where it could have been better , though. The acting was acceptable too . Plenty of action!
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|Man flick, lost coin toss. Like every other Bond movie, predictable and exaggerated. But then again, you should expect no less.
B00846REIS|5.0|Similar story line as 50 Shades of Gray only way hotter. Sylvia Day is a very talented author, not only does she \\"start the car, she takes that baby on a test drive\\" :-)
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Ok, I'm not a movie critic or profess to any knowledge of the technical expertise required to make this movie; but oh my, too deep and difficult to pay attention to.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love the game on my phone,  but it wont let me download it on my kindle and ive already paid for it,  so please fix this.
B008WHQZJI|5.0|I've been a PSB fan since I was very young. I still remember the day I saw Opportunities on Mtv (back when it was in heavy rotation!). Elysium is my personal favourite. I did not come easy to this conclusion I thought about it a good deal as I have been a fan a long time and have all the albums to choose from, all of them different. That is the beauty of Elysium, it is a reflective album that with every listen I'm transported by the music immediately. I can play it through without skipping because each song has some riff or gem of a lyric; there is always something about the song that makes me go \\"Oh yes, this one, this is my favourite!\\". This is a lush musical landscape to wander over. The lyrics are as sharp as ever the music as vivid.<br /><br />These guys aren't going to make Very or Actually over and over again. They constantly surprise. This album is a wonderful surprise indeed which I believe will be re-evaluated years from now, just as those who slagged on Behaviour, or Bilingual, changed their minds later on. I think down the road as many listeners who complain about this album mature they will see what many of us see in Elysium; a beautiful place to rest a moment before we get back out on the dance floor.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Fast service, great pricing and to top it off I liked this so well I will be back and will recommend to others. I have no reservation about this product or seller.
B005SAP45I|5.0|After reading some reviews I wasn't sure what to expect other than it was going to be different than the first Cars movie. I ended up enjoying the movie in its entirety and I liked the whole James Bond/spy thriller theme.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is an atmospheric thriller set in 19th century Vienna, as spiritualism was beginning to take hold. Young Eisenheim and Sophie are childhood sweethearts, but are separated as their parents part to lead their respective lives. Years later, Eisenheim becomes a respected stage illusionist (now played by Edward Norton) with Josef Fisher (Eddie Marsan) as his manager, while Sophie (now played by Jessica Biel) becomes a countess. As such, she is betrothed to Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), but, when she meets up with Eisenheim again, she yearns to be with him. But Leopold apparently kills her to prevent her joining Eisenheim. Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) threatens to arrest Eisenheim for fomenting dissent against the monarchy but when he confronts Leopold over Sophie's murder, the Crown Prince shoots himself. But the story is far from over and we do not know till the end how much is real and how much is illusion. The movie is well directed by Neil Burger.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|30 years after reading this in middle school, it had me glued to my seat still.  Buck is one of the greatest protagonists off all-time.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|so once again not going to review the season, thats not the reason for this. just what we get for buying this set. First off, i'm still extremely upset at how damn expensive it is to buy a season of the walking dead. the first season sold for i believe 30 dollars...can you believe that? for just 6 episodes and very little features in my opinion. now season two has been out for some time and it ranges between $30 to $40 heck even bestbuy has it at 49.99. for what? 13 episodes? that is just too much. anyway back to the product.<br /><br />Languages: English TrueHD 7.1 and French dolby surround 2.0. this series should have more than just two audio language options for the damn price they are charging. besides in the USA, spanish is the second biggest language, not french. so wth is french language the only other option for audio?<br /><br />subtitles: english for deaf and hearing impaired, spanish subs.<br /><br />bonus features: there are 11 bonus featurettes, most of which range from 3mins to around 10min i believe. most are short around 5minutes though. there are 6 webisodes which i actually liked. remember from season 1 ep 2 i believe when Rick gets out of the hospital and sees a bike he uses? and he sees that walker with no legs? well we find out who that walker was with these webisodes. sad story.<br />there are audio commentaries for episodes 1,7,8,11 and 13. the deleted scenes are for the most part lackluster, BUT the very first deleted scene for the season was an awesome scene that i think should of been added to the episode. its actually the longest deleted scene coming in at almost 14min long. remember in season one where those gangs captured glen? and they got glen back and found out the gangs were actually decent men taking care for the elderly? WELL, we go back to that site and find out whats been going on there since we last saw them in season one. i thought that was brilliant!<br /><br />anyway, thats all for season 2 extras. honestly i would go to ee - bai to get this set, because i got it used for $20 in excellent condition thats with shipping. no way am i paying 30 odd dollars for a 13 episode season.bai to get this set, because i got it used for $20 in excellent condition thats with shipping. no way am i paying 30 odd dollars for a 13 episode season.
B000067IZ3|5.0|Somehow I missed it when it came out, and was prompted to see it by a story in the New York Times relating to the character on which it is based. What comes through is that corruption doesn't mysteriously end on the Mexican side of the border. We tend to think of this whole business as a Mexican problem. Well, it may be their drugs, but it's our problem. Not pleasant viewing, but necessary.
B0050O7VAI|1.0|I know I'll love it if I can find a working DVD set, since I actually watch the show.  However, this set was a gift for a relative.  It took forever for it to arrive....well past the birthday for which it was attended.  I also gave them the second season, which arrived promptly. When it finally arrived, I passed along the belated gift, and it doesn't work!!! So now, I have to go to the trouble of returning it, locating a new one, and getting it to the recipient yet again.  In the meantime, they can't watch the second season....so my gift was a total bust.<br /><br />Very upsetting!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The book drug out, and didn't get good until the end. This was not as good as the first two books in the series.
0553801473|4.0|SPOILERS: After the previous books abysmal existence, I still had faith going into the fifth book of \\"A Song of Fire and Ice\\" series. Now that this mammoth book has been read, I still have faith in the series, but it is very microscopic at this point.<br /><br />The only good news really about this book is that my two favorite characters are back, Tyrion and Daenerys. It was their stories that really kept me going and even with them in it, all the other fillers put me to sleep on more than one occasion. I honestly don't care about Jon any more, but it seems Martin may have killed him off anyway (another thing I hate, all these cliffhangers, with no answer on whether people actually die or not). Davos's story didn't really have an ending; in fact I don't think he made an appearance after 400 pages. Same with Bran, don't really know where his story is going, I think he lacks any more appearances after 450pages. I believe Martin forgets to add more chapters about the said characters above when he writes his books. By the time the book gets published he says, \\"Oops, forgot to add more stuff on Bran...and Davos. Oh well.\\"<br /><br />At the end of this book, the same for the previous one, all the characters take one step forward, but by the end of it, they've taken three steps back. If the series still has two more books before the end, I honestly can't see how Martin is going to finish the tale, unless he just kills off everyone at the end in a spectacular blood bath. He is not going to give the fans what they want, I fear, and that is exactly how Charlaine Harris's career ended for me with her Sookie Stackhouse series. I even had the tiniest amount of sympathy for Cersei and Theon in the end. Shame! Shame on you Martin!<br /><br />The rating is four stars, but just barely, and perhaps only because the first three books were phenomenal. Let's hope with the release of the sixth book in Gods know when, the percentage of the series doesn't get reduced down to 50/50.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|I absolutely loved watching this movie!!  Great shout out to the characters of yesterday and today!!!  Super funny!!!  Would definitely recommend!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Can't stand the new look of this app. Before change style / screen was clean, clear and neat. Now it is painful to use and hard to find and read the info I am looking for as before it was all in one place and one screen. Why the change and was it tested for user likeness?
B003L77GG0|4.0|Let me start by saying BIG Superman Fan so smallville I didn't think i like it. But after the first couple of show i was hooked. After season season 6 it got even better when other hero's appeared so season 10 was great watched it during a superhero party my son put on...<br />I specially want to make a shout out to your Customer SERVICE TEAM YOU GUY ARE THE REAL SUPER HERO FOR MAKING THIS HAPPEN.<br />THANK AGAIN.
B007V5CF5K|3.0|I really like this game but I am really frustrated! I have played this game two times and both times I have gotten stuck trying to put the record together!! The piece is stuck under the tab of my kindle so every time I go to grab the piece, the home tab pops up and takes me back to the game main menu! I know I only paid 99&cent; but I'm still bummed that I can't complete the game.

B008220BLG|4.0|As a fan of zombie movies, I naturally have issues with this entry into that genre.  The whole premise defeats the purpose of zombies, making the creatures depicted in this movie only faux-zombies.  It was also rather cynical (or just plain lazy) to deflect the reason why (or how) half of the population became zombies in the first place.  As for the claim that this is a laugh-out-loud comedy, it's not.  Yes, it has a humorous perspective, but whether or not you appreciate its glibness depends entirely on your sense of humor.  Woody Allen did not direct this movie; neither did Mel Brooks.  There are no jokes, no snappy repartee.  For pity sake, John Malkovich does a supporting turn as a soulless military type with an itchy trigger finger!  The main character eats brains to get high on someone else's memories!  There are hordes of creepy skeletal figures called Bonies and they want to eat EVERYONE!<br /><br />This fractured fairy tale version of a zombie apocalypse takes some getting used to, especially as it spoils the genre with its happy-go-lucky point of view that's absolute blasphemy to zombie purists!  I'm utterly ashamed to admit that I liked it (won't go so far as to say I loved it but I am keeping it...........although nowhere near my REAL zombie movies).  There has to be some semblance of loyalty, in spirit if nothing else.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|It doesn't work with my kids nabi, even though it took all night to download the software to make it work.
B00CFA222M|4.0|A rather tasteful, bloodless version of the famous fairy tale.  It looks lovely and everything runs smoothly (more or less).  The fact that it's pat and perfunctory was its undoing.  I can see why it was a box office dud.  There's very little magic to be had.  The singing harp was present and accounted for but quickly passed over.  Most of the elements one would expect from this story were cast aside for a tiny bit of romance, brief adventure, and an almost epic battle.  It didn't help that the feature began with a whiplash effect between Jack's childhood and that of the princess.  Scenes sped back and forth at an alarming rate, at times the separate conversations folded into one another making it impossible to keep up.  I suppose the director thought this was an interesting gimmick to employ but the result was entirely too cute and confusing.  An odd choice considering the admonishment that was used on Jack ad nauseam: \\"don't get distracted!\\"  Very little imagination went into the making of this movie.  My biggest complaint remains, it was too darn tame (practically sanitized to death).  I expected more backbone, especially considering the subject matter.  As for the cast, Nicholas Hoult made a decent Jack, Eleanor Tomlinson was a lovely princess, and Ian McShane was perfectly cast as the king.  I smiled when I heard Bill Nighy's voice for half of the two-headed giant.  But I couldn't understand why Ewan McGregor deigned to play such a lackluster role that anyone could have done.  The same goes for Stanly Tucci as the villain Lord Roderick (a villainous creature from first to last and yet all of the characters voiced surprise to learn that he was a megalomaniac only out for personal gain!).<br /><br />At worst, this was just a pleasant diversion that should have been a lot better.  At any rate, I enjoyed it enough that I wouldn't mind watching it again someday.  It's a keeper.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|sooooooooooooooo funke and challenge .Wichita it involved the Queen but I LOVE THIS APP! !!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and it never. seems to end.

B003XT603Q|5.0|This was the first book I've read by Haruki Murakami and it was AMAZING! This author is definitely one to check out, as is this book. It's pretty sad but that's the aspect about it I loved the most. If you're thinking about reading this book you definitely should.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I love this game, this game is the best there are so many levels to go through a good none stop fun game.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I really liked this game. Its very addictive. The graphics are good and best of all it was free. I would recommend it.
B00BHNQ5XK|2.0|Wow this movie is stupid. And I am a huge horror buff who generally holds a good deal of suspension of disbelief for most movies and doesn't mind a good B flick now and again. The premise starts out fairly compelling, and I won't say that there aren't a few interesting visuals, etc. I like the repetition of imagery with the super 8 film, and as much as I feel this kind of thing is an over-used visual trope I didn't mind it. The problem with this movie is that the plot makes almost no sense, and it unravels completely by the ending which was just over-the-top predictable and stupid. I really wanted to like this, but I recommend not wasting your time! Particularly with horror their has got to be some kind of realistic thread that pulls it together since there is usually so much fantastical stuff happening with anything supernatural, but this one just fails to deliver any kind of satisfying reasoning behind the events that occur.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|Because the books r funny and this is the only books I would read-Diary of a Wimpy Kid<br />Love the books
B00CATSONE|4.0|Good motivational and inspiring book to read. Not too long, so it doesn't take long to read. And it not a hard read either.

B003V4AK8E|1.0|uh, it would not take a charge and the wireless was bunk. need i say more? as soon as I take it off the charger it shuts down, no matter how long its charging. when i wirelessly connected it (by charging it from an AC, nit the PS3) the wireless was super spotty and dropped out at the worst possible times while playing BF3 online of Little Big Planet solo. A shame because the frame was fantastic, but the controller is bunk.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Read the whole book in one day. Reminded me of The Tragedy Paper , which is probably why it was a kindle recommendation. They did touch on warning signs of suicide, but it think listing all of them might be helpful in making the target audience more aware of them. Brings me back to those awful times in school when I never thought it would get better, if only kids knew those days are so easily forgotten once you get on with your real life. Tragic.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really miss the old version.  The radar map was better and the day to day forecasts had more information and easier access.  It's ok.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have thought in general grisham work lately has not been as good as his early stuff but this<br /> one reminds me of those early very entertaining books.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun puzzle game!  I liked how you had to solve mini puzzles in order to find the key to open the door.  It wasn't so easy that you got bored but it also wasn't frustrating.  Highly recommend if you liked 100 Floors and/or Endless Escape.  Cant wait for more levels.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|Love this game. It's good for all ages and can get multiple people involved. Keeps the mind thinking and uses the creative and cognitive sides together.
B008CPZNL6|1.0|Use it on my HTC but cannot log in on my Fire HD. Amazon why did this happen? Thinking about selling for a pure Android tablet.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I am a big fan of both science fiction and fantasy movies that capture the popularity of a wide audience. Good examples are Star Wars in the SF category and Lord of the Rings in fantasy. These are movies in my opinion that draw in both adults as well as children a movie that the whole family can enjoy together. The Harry Potter 8 film collection is one of these types of movies good for the whole family. I recommend it for the whole family.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|One of the most ambitious productions I have ever seen! This amazing interleaved story of multiple timelines defies description. This became one of my favorite films of the year without any expectation before seeing it of what I might expect.
B0091XT22O|5.0|Every once in a while, I get this need to watch The Shining again. And not just watch it, but get obsessed by it, researching more about its cast and the making of. Up until now, I've just rented it again and again (and again). After each obsessive episode, I always think I've had my fill of The Shining and am over it for good. I've finally learned. Though I haven't felt the need to watch it again since my last viewing after my purchase, it will come tapping soon enough, at least by October if not before then.<br />PS - I think Shelly Duvall's performance as Wendy Torrance is the soul of this film. She appears to have worked the hardest of the cast and sacrificed the most. Imagine the mental stress of repeated takes of those emotionally draining scenes. She allowed Jack Nicholson's performance as Jack Torrance to bloom so magnificently. Love both actors. I just think Shelly deserves a bit more recognition than she's so far received.
B00B1E6FF8|5.0|Every now and again a film comes around that you know will be looked back in film history as representative of the day and age it was made. Not just the look and feel, rather the place in history we were at when the film was made. These films form a historical timeline and exceed the constraints of pop culture. For example, films like Dr Strangelove and Failsafe exemplified the paranoia of the atomic bomb and the Cold War. Zero Dark Thirty along with the Hurt Locker are a pair of films that are crafted with amazing skill to avoid a big political statement and focus on the events shaping our post 9/11 world. It doesn't matter how much you know about the history behind ZDT, the film will grip you and amaze you at the same time. This is not one to be missed!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a Star Wars fan.  He LOVED it.  We played episodes IV and V, running it in the background, during our 4th of July party, and our guests were stunned at the picture and sound quality, as were we.  Such a classic, and beautifully remastered.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Calling all geeks! Go read this book now! Seriously. Just do it. It is amazing! Epically awesome. Really. This needs to be a mini series, because a movie is not enough. I really do not know how to express how much I loved Ready Player One. It is the epitome of all things geektastic. I pretty much missed the 1980s--born in October of '89, boo!-but I still have quite the fondess for 80s music and movies. A lot of the references did go over my head, but it was still fun to see the ones I did recognize! Usually pop culture references are annoying and immediately date a book, but in Ready Player One it works.<br /><br />As awesome as this book is, I don't think that it'll work for all readers. The writing is very info-dumpy. I do mean very. Every little thing is explained in extreme detail, and I loved it! Many chapters of Ready Player One read like articles on the history of OASIS (the worldwide virtual reality world) and its creators. At some points I completely forgot that I was reading a fiction novel. I'd also forget that OASIS isn't even real, and when I'd get sucked back into the plot portion of the story, I'd get a little disappointed. Anyway, I did love all of the details and 80s references that are the backbone of this book. There was only one section where I felt it got slow and I wanted it to just move on, but that was it. Everything else was simply amazing.<br /><br />OASIS is awesome! It's like a utopia! It's a real life simulation but it also has a gaming side to it, where you can level up your avatar, do quests, learn magic, and pretty much anything you can imagine. The real world has gone to hell. I think Ready Player One could be classified as a kind of dystopian, but then again, I'm not sure. Poverty and homeless is at a record high due to the energy crisis. It's something that could very well happen to us. Thankfully, the OASIS exists so that people can escape their less than satisfactory lives from just about anywhere. Our hero, Wade, even attends school inside the simulation, which of course has its benefits and some drawbacks.<br /><br />The actual plot, the hunt for James Halliday's Easter Egg, was super exciting! I felt like I was witnessing the events unfold in real time or something, instead of just reading a book. I was completely invested and I was cheering Wade on. Of course, there's an evil corporation in the game and they'll stop at nothing to win the multibillion dollar prize and control of OASIS. I could not put my Kindle down during the third part of Ready Player One. I couldn't tell if there would be a happy ending or not, or who would win the contest. It truly was a nail biting finish!<br /><br />Ready Player One has made its way onto my all-time favorites list. It was so much fun! It's not only a gamer and 80s lovers paradise, there's also some romance and friendships included. I actually loved these parts, because even though this high stakes contest was essentially every gunter (egg hunter) for themselves, it was necessary at times for Wade and his friends to work together. Those last few lines were also super adorable and I had the hugest smile on my face upon finishing! I highly, whole heartedly, sincerely recommend this one!hool inside the simulation, which of course has its benefits and some drawbacks.<br /><br />The actual plot, the hunt for James Halliday's Easter Egg, was super exciting!

B00CF34B2I|5.0|It feels so much like the actual table top that I am having a blast. I haven't had a friend to play with in my area so it fulfilled my inner gamer.
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|Love this movie
B000ICXQOM|5.0|Great movie for the time and still great to watch today. Great pick for anyone who likes older &#34;horror&#34; ( it's more like a comedy now) movies.
B001U0HBQ0|2.0|first one skipped. contact seller and got another one. second one worked fine. because this is a bluray video, it should have never skip. either way, its ok now.
B001AZFO14|1.0|Always the same story... The good against all the bad men... And guess who win at the end ? And of course, as usual, violence, violence, violence... Do you call that art ?
B009ME47H2|1.0|Its basic. I need a free recorder that ican crop the sound with. Im willing to pat if thats wat it takes any one know where i can find one
0762445262|5.0|Perfect gift for the husband.  He loved it.  I read reviews where there were complaints about how far it illuminated, but it just a little light and all he did was take it into a dark room and shine it on the wall.  Perfect toy and looks great just on his shelf by his desk.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the books that drew me to SF growing up. The story is so well written. Love, love, loved!
B00BP4WAZS|2.0|We rented this in hopes it would be as entertaining as the previews, but it really had no storyline.  I was bored before we were even half way through.  It's a cute movie, but it didn't hold anyone's attention.
B0001I561E|5.0|it was great to finally find this movie and at such an affordable price, Will shop with you often. Thanks
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a joy for a young toddler to an old lady! It's a wonder of how they make such enjoyable games!!
B009V3KKXY|5.0|THE best ever .everyone should buy this book weather you like paracord or not.again I say best book ever. A great help
B00DI75SWM|5.0|I personally love to design my own things, so this app was perfect for me. It is totally worth your $0.99! You can even put in your own pics it is fun and simple! Must get! Enjoy!

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Game play is sensational.  Perseverance will get you there.  I loved it. Best game out there right now! If you are looking for a great point and click, you just found it.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|Very hard to find, as of late. Finally bought it, and I received it 1 day before the earliest promise date. I am VERY happy with this knife! Lived up to all my expectations.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|This was a very good book. It was packed with many different plots and side stories. My only complaint, if you can really call it a complaint, is that it was very long, and had a great amount of detail that did not contribute to the main story;a lot could have been left out, and it still would have been a very good book.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris does a great job detailing his range of experiences serving our country. His wife, Taya, also contributes greatly with her insights. You must read this! It saddens me beyond words that we've tragically lost one of our heros in Chris. To all those who sacrifice to make our country what it is!
B0056WODZ0|1.0|I couldn't finish this even though it pains me to leave a book unread.<br /><br />I liked the tension in the beginning, although the main character's logic for stealing from the dragon was a bit flimsy and not very convincing (\\"Do or don't, I'll die anyways.\\" To my understanding the dragon was supposed to be the greater evil? Why would she choose that option?). I agree with many of the others who called this 'generic', it is, but if you can work that angle, then it's not really a problem for me.<br /><br />I was disappointed because the characters seemed very superficial and a plot, which sounded interesting, remained pretty flat throughout my reading experience. I couldn't really relate to anyone in the narrative, and the main character was very inconsistent in her actions; although she's (supposedly?) afraid for her life, when she gets caught by the dragon, she lies there and tells cheesy, perverted jokes. Didn't really feel like the author was very committed to the idea that the character might be in life-threatening danger, which made it pretty anti-climactic for me. From there I felt like the narrative just deflated and I lost interest.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The Eye of God  is another good read from James Rollins. You always trying to figure out what's truth and what's fiction
B000003CMD|5.0|Brothers and Sisters, what can I say.  AWESOME.  Love the Allman Brothers!  Saw them recently, The line-up has changed some but the music is classic!  LOVE 'EM!
B002VWNID6|1.0|I had bought this movie at walmart and it was only half there. I returned it and got another and it was the same way. So I bought this one thinking what are the chancesof me getting a 3rd. It was also defective. This needs to be removed from AAmazon.
B000003CM9|5.0|Idlewild South, an ORIGINAL Allman Bros album.  AWESOME!  LOVE IT!  Have been listenining to it for over 40 years!  Can't believe how old I am, IKES!
B00196YNWU|5.0|A really good movie. I like it a lot better than the more recent one that has the lady from Misery in it.
B000003CMC|5.0|Allman Brothers ode to Duane.  Beautiful album.  Can't believe how long it has been since his demise.  Always miss him, RIP Duane.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My daughter must've watched this 100 times already. And it has a lot of funny parts for adults who remember the old games that were once in the arcades.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game! Even my cousins have it on their phones! It may be pricey but you people will love app!
B000056NX5|2.0|I know it is a rock opera and I have seen it performed live on stage.  I am very old schooled and this one was too modern it was like when I went to see Romeo and Juliet and they made that play modern with gangs and guns.  I think it ( Jesus Christ Superstar) misses the essence of what Weber was trying to convey.  I would not recommend it to others,
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I just love this game.<br /> It's very realistic. And it feels like this horse really depends on you. If u love horses and just animals in general th I s is recommended for you!!! I
B0041G683W|5.0|I never saw it live but when it comes to town again I would really like to see it up on the stage.  I gave it 5 stars because the live performance was so good that I would recommend it to others to get it even if they saw it on stage they should get it to own so you could have a private performance of you own to view.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a very nice app. It can be as challenging or as easy as you want it to be. There are lots of beautiful pics to choose from, and they are actually true jigsaws. Many I have seen are just move the squares around and aren't very challenging. This feels like a classic puzzle. Only negative is you can't use your own pics. Maybe they will add that later. Other than that, I love it.
1476734941|5.0|It actually woks and isn't difficult.  It is great to not have to agonize over every food choice five days out of seven.<br />As a cancer survivor I a<br />Like the theory that it may reduce cancer risks!<br />Have lost 17 lbs.

B00CWY76CC|5.0|Real fun game for me. Not too hard but challenging enough to keep you interested. I will tell my friends about this game...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much and it is soo addicting. My lil brow loves playing it so much too. He is not as annoying anymore. :D
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love minion rush it is a really fun game! I really recommend this game! If you get it you CAN'T stop its like a second temple run 2 it's a afg ( ADDICTIVE FUN GAME)! You need this game!
B002VWNIDG|5.0|it was everything I thought it would be, I've seen it before, so there were no surprises<br />this gets my rating of two thumbs up<br />A deffinite &#34;PG&#34; rating
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Perfect not quite mindless entertainment happily hailed away an evening without guilt, without having to log onto facebook! Will LOOK FOR UPDATES
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|This game has become my favorite pastime over the last 3 months. I enjoy the relaxing music and reading the educational tidbits. This is a quiet, patient game which is often needed after the craziness of a work day. It's easy, colorful, and fun. The main objective is to create a reef that attracts fish so there is much planting, growing, and collecting. The only reason I gave it a 4 instead of a 5 is that its extremely hard to get pearls; my suggestion would be when someone levels up they receive a pearl. Other than that, I would recommend the game to anyone looking for a quiet diversion from reality.
B009ZM74F8|4.0|I thought the movie was really good.<br />Christian Bale is always good. He's always tense!<br />Good acting! I liked it. It was free on Prime. Why Not!<br />It won't break the bank to download and watch if not on Amazon Prime.
B005CMSDLE|5.0|thank you, I really love this movie, the girl who plays Hanna is very powerful!! she must have put in an extreme amount of time in the gym!!!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|Me and my son LOVED this movie, he's been wanting to see it for a long time now, it's a true Action and Adventure movie, and that's the genre my family loves.
B0052RCX0G|4.0|Tells a lot about what's going on in different areas of the world at key moments in history, always from the point of view of these objects. Can be a bit dry at times, but very much worth the read. Be sure to read it on either paper or a good, color screen. The visuals of the objects are definitely an integral part of the story.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|I ran full scans with AVG and Vipre and did  find a bad app,  but not this one.<br /><br />I played a few rounds and found it enjoyable.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Other Reacher books are better, though this one is still worth reading if you are a fan. Three more words required to submit, so...
B008W14ZD2|2.0|I don't really like this one. It lacks what Owl City is known for: the fantasy feel. The thing I love about Owl City is Adam's ability to paint picture with lyrics, and how fantasy-like it was. You take that away, you do not have Owl City.<br /><br />Though I did enjoy a few of the songs, it just doesn't have the Owl City feel
B004HWYTP4|5.0|This is the type of summer blockbuster I can watch again & again & never get tired of watching.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, John Malkovich, Morgan Freeman, & Dame Helen Mirren give  tour de force performance as retired CIA and MI-6 agents reuniting to uncover why one of their own is in the CIA's crosshairs.<br /><br />There's action & adventure with side order of romance and dating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game.  Very fun and challenging. Puzzles are easy at times but some take more thought. And you cant beat the cost.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|Being someone who grew up happily watching movies where a guy in a Godzilla suit stomped on cars and bashed buildings, the preview I saw for \\"Pacific Rim\\" looked like just too much fun to pass up.  This is definitely one movie I am so very glad I went to see, and would love to see it again.<br />I am going to try very hard not to give anything away here and yet tell enough to let you know just how much fun this movie really is.<br />First of all, this is not a Godzilla remake or update.  Let's just say it appears the film-maker also grew up watching a lot of old monster movies and loved them.  Not to be disrespectful of Godzilla, you understand, but the Kaiju in this film make our Godzilla look about as scary as the Geico lizard.  They looked amazing, and were genuinely frightening even to a middle aged jaded person like myself.  More than once I found myself with my back flattened against the seat in an attempt to put just a bit more distance between myself and what was on the screen.<br />In addition, if you are also someone who has enjoyed Anime series like \\"The Big O\\" and \\"Evangelion\\", you will find a great deal to enjoy in this movie.  Personally, I was thrilled.<br />I was not familiar with any of the actors, they were all new to me. I thought they all did a fine job, though.  It is after all an action movie, not a straighforward drama.  Again, trying very hard not to tell too much, but the child who portrayed one of the main characters in the film, during scenes showing her childhood, did a particularly wonderful job.  She had tears welling in my eyes at one point.  There are touching moments in this film, as well as some unexpected humor.  The audience in the movie theater where I attended were laughing out loud at several points.<br />I really can't say enough about this film.  If you are looking for monsters, giant robots, action, emotion, and just a rockin' great time, this movie can't be beat.
1472200322|5.0|It was a pleasure to finally read Neil Gaiman's work. I have heard & heard about him from lots of different sources and none of them have ever had an average thing to say - everyone simply gushes about this author's works.<br /><br />As a boy, the narrator was quiet and introvert. He would remain at home and read a book rather than go out and play with other children of his age. It was when the narrator was seven years old, his family rented out his room, moving him to bunk with his sister, to a mysterious miner due to financial crunch. But things were never the same again. When the narrator returns to his hometown as a forty something years old, his long suppressed memory resurfaces things that were extraordinary and not all so pleasant things. And well, then there's the three Hempstock women who live in the farm at the end of their lane. Young Lettie has been eleven years old for quite some time now and is convinced that their pond is actually an ocean. As weird and mysterious they are, there's more to the Hempstock women than meets the eye and they may be the only people who can help the narrator uproot the evil that seemed to have taken root at their little town.<br /><br />This novel left me speechless for hours after I turned the last page. Author's language and narration style left me awestruck. There is no way anyone can describe it... one has to experience it for themselves to understand the wonder that this work is. What stands out the most is the author's way of describing things through the eyes and mind of a seven year old boy. You cannot expect a seven year old boy to understand and describe the intricacies of a dress or a building, but you can expect him to remember his beloved books, his toys and the face of the mysterious lodger who took up his old room. And the author has done just that, described things the way the boy would see and remember it and not gone into details and description that would be impossible for a boy.<br /><br />The characters are well developed and engaging. The plot in itself is another wonder on its own. It gives you goose bumps at times, makes you nostalgic, makes you think and in the end leaves you with a powerful ending.<br /><br />This is a book that one should buy, read more than once and cherish for a lifetime.are well developed and engaging.

B0095MVOMC|1.0|I installed this app and right after the instalation my avast virus detector scanned it and said that there was a virus/malware that was installed with the app. INSTALL AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!
B003V1WUKS|5.0|Great book. Different stories different characters all amazing. Left me wanting more.  Cant wait to read \\"california childhood\\" James Franco is a great writer
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app is very useful for relaxing my mind enough to wind down for bedtime. I had the free version and the additional sound and waves for this one are a nice to have. Free or premium, if you have trouble relaxing--try this app.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game was really fun until the last update a couple of days ago. Now when I get on it to play, all it keeps telling me is the connection to the server is unavailable.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Great premise and good development of the story. I will look for other stories by the author, Hugh Howdy.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Worth every cent, keeps you looking, great variety of puzzles within hard to put down. Love to find more like this one.
B006DX4PXQ|1.0|Just don't see it. It's super slow and boring, with a bunch of characters that it is impossible to sympathize with because of how one-dimensional they are. So any chance of it being \\"realistic\\" was ruined by that. Also, lots of the scenes are shot through these really weird yellowish color filters that make the scenes look extra dreary. Just..another overrated, overhyped movie which adds absolutely nothing to its genre.
B006S08RLU|4.0|Charming and humane yet too many directorial missteps and plot holes deprive it of excellence. The single biggest flaw is that by the end of the movie Amelie still doesn't represent anything. She means well but her stratagems sometimes backfire (as with the romance she instigates at the cafe) and at other times reduces herself to the level of her antagonist (the revenge she seeks on the owner of the vegetable stand). As the man with the glass bones recognizes her subterfuges are simply dodges around her own faint heart. Despite all the directorial prancing and narrative quirkiness she winds up in bed at the end with her new love like any ordinary couple. The ending doesn't bring a sense triumph and cheer but simply a sense of relief that the drama is finally over.<br /><br />Amelie is a good movie. It is well placed and despite the fact the lead character is something of an oddball the narrative never strains credulity. The lead character is likable enough that we want her to succeed and different enough to be entertaining. Those who enjoy \\"art for art's sake\\" will love this move but those wishing for some moral heft will be disappointed.
031620157X|5.0|When I first heard of this book I was only interested in it because Chris Colfer wrote it but once I heard the plot line and read the first chapter (since Amazon lets you read the first chapter) I was instantly hooked and surprised that it is such a wonderfully written book and great story. 10/10 would recommend
B00CXL6XP0|4.0|The classic sound of Queensryche is back!  And Todd is a great addition, infusing some great new energy into the band's sound I think.  This review would have been 5 stars if the album weren't so short.  I assume it was the desire to get something out as soon as possible, but don't do that again Queensryche!
B000SEKNUK|5.0|I purely love this book:  its practices, its stories, and the ways it all points toward our new emerging consciousness. Can you feel it?
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Season 1 was great, and it's downhill since then... In Season 3, the series lost its special touch and chapters are often predictable. Not planning to watch season 4.
B00BB22GQM|4.0|not as good as i wanted it- but for the freeway i like it-prefer the first one and keep it in my car as a fixture
B0008ENICU|5.0|The first time I saw this film, I knew I had to get it one day for my DVD library. It's a slice of history in so many ways: fashion, male/female relationships/ idle rich/naivety, foolishness, greed, and more. It's disturbing to the extent that women will do anything to get or keep a man. Nevertheless, there are characters to love and those to hate. That's always fun. I recommend this film to anybody who asks, \\"What's a good film to see?\\" I haven't found any friend who has seen the film, so I happily recommends it. It's such a classic; film buffs just have to own it. I've watched is many times. Always interesting and captivating. Crawford is at her cattiest, man-stealing, selfish, lying best!! Get it. Watch it. Share it. There's nothing quite like it. All woman cast. No men needed.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|My daughter, a teacher, recommended this movie but I wasn't so sure. Maybe the actor involved (no name) didn't inspire me, but  I went ahead and bought the dvd. Am I pleased ?  Absolutely !  I have watched it three times already and get a lot of pleasure from it.!!<br />That's as much I will tell you.<br />Lorrie<br />NZ
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book so very much. It is a true romance, young love, love of life, love of family. I wasn't emotionally prepared for this incredibly moving story but I never once regretted shedding a tear in public for Hazel, Augustus or Isaac. This book made me value the relationships I have and urged me to let those that I love know just how much. Very rare these days to read a book that has made such an impact on my life. I hope you enjoy.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Enjoyable game. All ages can enjoy. Easy to understand and nice that things build up without using money. Have fun!p
1612680011|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad<br /><br />For years my dad has talked about the principles discussed in Robert Kiyosaki's book, Rich Dad Poor Dad.  I've always been intrigued by financial conversations and have often thought about how to increase my financial competence.  Once I started reading Kiyosaki's book, I could not stop.  It was engaging and I found myself having aha moments ever few pages.<br /><br />In Rich Dad Poor Dad, Kiyosaki teaches about the concept of not working for money, but having your money work for you.  He compares the money principles taught to him by his two dads, his rich dad and his poor dad.  This helps to illustrate the importance of thought patterns when it comes to finances.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in finances, or just wants to become more competent and work towards ridding their minds of financial ignorance.  My eyes have been opened while reading Rich Dad Poor Dad.  Since I started Kiyosaki's book, my mind has been coming up with and processing ideas and ways to put myself in a successful financial position, where my money will work for me.<br /><br />This book is and easy to understand, easy to read book--and well worth your time.  I would recommend it to all.
B0047Y17P2|4.0|Tedious reading in the mid-to-end, & then BAM! Needed to reread the last few chapters. Kinda fun & pretty exciting.

B00CW665VI|5.0|I loved this book. Reading from a males perspective was fun and to be honest I appreciated the straight tAlk. It was honestly the best book I have read in a long time.five stars plus.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|I enjoy this game a great deal. Fun and entertaining for hours at a time. I would highly recommend this game to anyone.
B00D37UQ1K|3.0|I've never read the book. But, I can see why the movie didn't do very well. Honestly, the audience this was geared towards wants to see a love triangle. There was never any of that. The movie poster itself kind of misled me. To me the character progression and relationship progressions weren't smooth. Even what should be the height of the movie with the &#34;villain&#34; wasn't thrilling. The producers and writers should have just build a story around the plot and made some changes if this was to be a big movie.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I am a writer and an artist and I love all the music from this series to create by. I have ALL five CDs!!!
B004UID2LC|3.0|its sorta working for me now sooooo I like it. the only bad thing is I cant download the official video but that doesn't really bother me. I hope it starts working for you guys!!!!

B002ZBJ6SY|5.0|First off, if you are going to get Disclaimer, get this instead.  I was going to download Driven Under for $1.29 and realized that this was only $6.99.  It is worth it for the price.  Plenty of good songs here including gasoline and fine again.  I am not the biggest Seether fan in the world and some of the songs on here are straight junky.  Probably would have gave it a 3 or 4 stars but the fact that it contains the whole Disclaimer cd plus 8 more songs makes it a great download for the price.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I have all five CDs from this movie series. I love the soundtrack in my studio as I paint or write.
B00361DR4Q|5.0|Its simply grt i love both the stars and i am a grt fan of versi. This dvd is super

B000V658EQ|5.0|There is really nothing to say...hey! It’s Marvin Gaye. In my opinion Marvin was at the top off is game when he recorded this music every song...pure genius.  This is just the perfect music to relax and chill out with, whether you’re alone or with your significant other. I warmly recommend.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I'm a period piece, costume drama junkie.  Love well done British shows and this was beautifully filmed and well acted.  If you're into British period shows, you'll love this one and recognize many of the faces in this series from shows such as Downton Abbey, the works of Jane Austen and others.  It hit all the right marks for comedy, grit, romance and all the other bits that make for a remarkable series.  Couldn't wait to watch each episode and hated for each to end.  Understand that the series is to be axed after season 4.  What a shame.  Well worth your time and truly an enjoyable series.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Used it when lights went out.worked fantastic. Supplied slot more light than I Would have thought possible. Really like it.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|This actually works great !!  I did not expect to be so pleased and happy !! Highly recommended. A must !!
0307591549|5.0|I took the book with me on a weekend trip, showed it to a person I met at the B&B, they went that day to find a copy. Both my Son and Daughter have a copy and my Assistant Manager is reading this. Fun to read when it makes a whole lot of sense!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|First, just the name makes it reliable. But it is a must have for any tablet ! Very dependable !!
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I'm echoing the comments of others in that I hooked up the mic to my Iphone5, made sure the battery was good, even tried the battery in two positions inside the housing, but still got a recording so faint, at the full extension of the very long cord, that was of no use to me. I will have to return this; I don't suspect I'm using it improperly with a very excellent recording app I have on my Iphone. If I can figure out that I'm doing something wrong I will hurry back and correct this review but I've tested the product several times with the same results.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I was so happy with this book, was kinda let down by the author and his private views - when I looked him up, but other than that, everyone is allowed to have their own opinions.  This book was awesome, but I heard the sequel is hard to get into.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|If you can get this king game on kindle then why not the other king games. Just asking? I like playing king other games they have.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is awesome if you want a super fun game to play get this. it's a great game for all ages.
0743297334|5.0|You can't read this novel with its elegant characters living the high life without reflecting how much Ernest  Hemingway himself shared the same wild, glamorous but ultimately empty lifestyle.  It makes his sparse writing with its powerful evocation of the glamorous, ambitious group of 30 somethings enjoying the best parties and adrenalin rushes of interwar Europe all the more poignant.  The second half of the book is the most absorbing because it is here that Hemingway writes of the things he really loves - peasant life in Spain and bullfighting.  What would he have imagined happening to Brett, Jake and the unfortunate Robert Cohn in the political maelstrom that swept through Europe within a decade? How in their 40s would they have reacted to the rise of fascism and eventually world war?  The fickle Lady Ashley one has no hope of redemption for in a hypothetical sequel, but Jake would surely have \\"done the right thing\\" in defence of freedom and Cohn too, given a chance to act with honour and courage for a larger cause?
B0068THAGY|5.0|How do you manage to pack a lot of explosions and train crashes into a film about a bunch of middle-schoolers making a zombie flick? Put a dangerous cargo on the train and let the mysteries unfold! Super 8 is a sweetly written film about Joe, a kid who has just lost his mom in an industrial accident. His police officer dad can't relate to him, so he spends lots of time as makeup man on his friends' amateur monster film. Sometimes it's harder to tell which film is more interesting - the fully-formed film about small town loss, young loss, military lies and a terrifying presence, or the choppy, badly-acted (but darling!) film about a bunch of teens trying to become filmmakers.<br /><br />I'm not sure there's much being said about the intersection of the two stories, except in the way they allow the adults and kids to cross paths and resolve old animosities. Very sweet and very smart. You don't get a good look at the film's mysterious presence until well into the film - a salvation for anyone familiar with the genre. Young and old alike will appreciate the looks at very \\"old\\" technology - super 8 cameras, the first Walkman (a little head of its time, but playing a cassette tape!) and old-time film projectors with film on reels. Not to mention the Vietnam-era military uniforms and a 3-day (!) wait for film to be developed! But he period stuff is perfectly integrated into the plot. Very entertaining.
B00C7O8MJ8|2.0|No star trek theme is anywhere on the disc.  Great Disappointment.  Sorry I bought this disappointing product,  waste of money.
B00992CF6W|4.0|This app is great, especially with the update. the only problem is that I cant join games that's are hosted with any device other than an android.
B00CWVGBEO|1.0|I didn't actually finish the movie.  It was that bad.  Poor acting, dumb plot.  Arnold is getting old and it shows
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a fun game, I am happy I spent the 99&cent; for ad free. can't wait for more levels. only needed to &quot;cheat&quot; on one level!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I could not figure out how this game worked. I tried several times and could not get it to open up. The directions were not very clear
B006KX3GXO|5.0|This app helped me save pictures and has many other features I can use. :) This is such a great app!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Me and my 11 year old had a blast playing this together. Can be a little frustrating sometimes. You just have to keep trying though.
B00005ATQM|5.0|If you have a 5.1 surround sound and you are a Metallica, then I recommend you buying this DVD-Audio.<br /><br />I enjoy hearing guitar parts that I never heard on a regular CD.
B0019M068O|2.0|Got this one because I love ABBA gold.  This is nothing like that.  Chances are you will not recognize any of the tunes.  This must be all of the \\"B\\" sides.
B008XOXGL0|5.0|I love this album, the music is obviously great, but the sound has an extra something to it on vinyl. It's something that any vinyl lover will appreciate and enjoy, the subtle crackles in the background are something I enjoy, but it's also super clear music.
0670034711|4.0|Any young-thinking mature woman will enjoy this book. I saw the movie after I read it. Julia Roberts portrayed the woman in the book quite well.
B004G8QHKO|5.0|I liked a few songs when I ordered the album, but now I love them all. It's a great album and something truly unique and special. Different from other bands and that's a good thing!
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|We are big fans of country/western music.  Darius Rucker is a great &#34;new&#34; performer and his music is easy to listen to.  This CD is easy to listen to.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|This album is brilliant! Adele's album on vinyl has a great black and white insert in the record album case and that just adds to the overall brilliance of this album. The songs are all great and having this on vinyl is really something special!
B00005NGAK|3.0|There is something terribly wrong with the format of this DVD.  It is listed as \\"Widescreen\\" and yet when shown in that format, all of the performers are fat and pudgy and look like they have been spread horizonally across the screen.  I have watched the individual videos on my computer and they are perfect, no distortion at all and yet when I show the DVD on my TV, they are distorted.  It is not my TV either.  I have 3 widescreen HD TVs and I get the same results on all of them.  I can play other DVDs such as \\"Celtic Woman\\" or \\"Riverdance\\" and they are perfect and when I put on this one, they are all fat.  The only way I can get them to look normal is to change the format ratio on the TV to some other format other than widescreen and then they are the right proportion but the picture is not widescreen.  It really hurts to see all those beautiful dancers with calves on their legs looking like NFL football players.  Mercy, mercy!  Am I doing something wrong, if so will somebody out there help me?  I gave it three stars because of the format issue, the performance was 5 stars all the way.<br />Colonel Follis
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|This game is a very good game ,Although it was hard at first because you can buy swords(which you get from earning things in the game).And the swords do have evolutions which made it hard for me to understand how to use the swords and by the way this game is almost like pokemon
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Inspiring, funny, sad.  I believed that I was watching Abraham Lincoln; Daniel Day-Lewis becomes Lincoln.  It should be required viewing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|really enjoyed the game, it is a great time waster. tablet version is smooth and 10 x 10 levels and higher are quite challenging
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|free did not skimp on the value it gives very easy to use. thanks for this app it foes a great job
B0041KYLAU|1.0|The DVD was in Italian, and it also would not play on any DVD machine or computer in my house and in my daughter's house.<br />I am in the process of returning it.
B000P61BG6|5.0|For the first Jennifer Lopez Spanish CD, &#34;Como Ama Una Mujer&#34; is too good to be true! Romantic songs mixed with the pop essence, this version comes with a DVD featuring the making of &#34;Qué Hiciste&#34; and the music video itself. Great version and rare version! A must have in every Jennifer Lopez collection!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was a trilogy I couldn't put down. I didn't want to stop reading it. Of course, I had to, but every spare moment, and some not so spare moments, I was drawn to read more. Now I've finished it. So it's your turn to start reading.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|good, straightforward feed reader which works across a wide variety of devices, supported google reader when it was still around, and now that it is gone continues seamlessly to support the old feeds. clean interface that works as you would expect, very highly recommended, especially for people who use several different sorts of devices in a day.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Took me a while to get into it and read it but once I did I was hooked!  Lots of twists and turns!
0143113100|3.0|I bought the book as a gift to my neighbor; I did not read it myself. Do not insist on a number of words-I am very busy. Your format often keeps me from replying at all
B001AVCFJM|5.0|Got this movie and it was packaged nicely and the disc were great. The movie has been an enjoyment to watch.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Harry Potter has become a big deal in our household and we are enjoying watching the movies.  Can't wait tyo see the next one.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|loved it!!! Now cant wait to see the second movie to see if they do the books justice!!! its great
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Addictive, hate to put it down. Fun game.  Challenging enough but not too much to get frustrated.  Looking forward to more.
0060839872|5.0|I have been reading this book since 1989 and have read it so many times. It is a book about travels, exploring life and growing as a person! My wife is reading it now!
B00B6KJ0AE|5.0|This is the band Krokus' new 2013 LP and it kicks the same ass that they did back in the 80s . I love it. Great Band!
0425263924|5.0|Love it!!! This book was really good.  I was really upset once it was over and now have to impatiently wait for the next one.
B00C5W3SBE|4.0|This was very good.A wonderful story and lots of special effects.I watched this with the whole family just like I did with the original one.
B000LB7G00|5.0|I purchased the SpaceNavigator to use with my laptop running FlightSim 2004. It took a little experimentation but now it's set up I can fly perfectly with very little hand movement. It sits calmly on my laptop wrist support pad and is exactly what I wanted. I have also found it really cool for navigation in both Chrome and IE and it makes zooming and scrolling much simpler and more exact than a mouse or the touchpad. All in all I would recommend this device not just for working with 3D objects in packages such as Autodesk Inventor where it is very useful but also as a 90% replacement for a standard mouse. It is extremely well made and just for once rather than plastic its solid metallic base and fascinating blue led give you a sense of actually getting value for money.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|James writes in a down-to-earth, no nonsense fashion that is informative, inspiring, and real. This book takes you inside the head of someone who has toiled and spun like the rest of us yet found a way to become closer to his true self and achieve success when the path wasn't clear. Thank you for writing this! (I read the book but I'm not going to request my money back because I got much more than $5 worth of value from it already!)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so suspenseful and amazing and you could feel the character's love like omg this was such a perfect book
B00BSWMITK|5.0|This is the best Satch album in a long time. I love this album and play it as much as I can.  If you like the early Satch music you will love this CD.
B0095MVOMC|1.0|After reading all the reviews I wanted to test out my own anti-virus software (comes pre-installed on T-Mobile device) and see if it did catch anything. Well it didn't and it was scanned twice! I guess I need a new anti-virus app since Lookout said it was safe. Samsung Galaxy Relay 4G
0345472322|3.0|A self-help book, Mindset simplifies a fairly complicated thing; motivation and purpose.<br /><br />I'm not sure I agree that we are one mindset or the other (there are only two), but there<br />is a solid point to be made here, Pull up your boots straps sooner than later.
B004SEUJK0|5.0|Was very pleased with this shipment. Love the movie always have been a suck for  the Bridget Jones Movies.. The package was shipped fast and in great condition. Thanks so much!!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|No glitches! This app works well on phone and Kindle Fire! Love the ease of searching and the display of photos. Very streamlined!
B00005JNDZ|5.0|Was very pleased with this shipment. Love the movie always have been a sucker for the Bridget Jones Movies.. Edge of Reason was just has good as the first movie... The package was shipped fast and in great condition. Thanks so much!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|It's a super hero movie that keeps on going. Except, unlike Ironman, it is still entertaining to watch after the first episode.<br /><br />If you don't like this show, you have failed this city.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|My daughter and myself were going back and forth should we rent or not, about ordering this movie. Glad I did. It's quirky zany, story was a nice refreshing change. Different but to me in a very refreshing kind of way. Now my daughter wants to read the book. Maybe not the movie for some , but we enjoyed it.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found the story to be compelling and seemed to be very accurate. The behind the sceens account of the raid gave me a better appreciatin of how diffiult the opperation truly was.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I've read it four times, and every time I fall more in love with the characters and their love for each other.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|I was (overall) happy with TLOTR and suspected due to its popularity that they would give us a live version of the hobbit. As a Tolkien/Jackson fan I was ready to spend more money and enjoy &#34;The Hobbit&#34;. Then I began to hear rumors that it was going to be another trilogy and I thought there was 'no way' they could stretch this book into three movies. When I read about how they were going to do it (pulling other material from other sources to 'fill in the blanks'), I began to get nervous.<br />This book is not about Smaug, 'the hobbit', not about Gandalf, 'the hobbit', not about the Necromancer, 'the hobbit', not about Thorin, 'the hobbit', not about anything else but THE HOBBIT. The ring is such a very small part of this story that its amazing TLOTR was written at all! All of you who remember the book also remember that there is NO part of the book that doesn't involve Bilbo. We don't witness the death of Smaug, we're only TOLD about it when Bard tells Bilbo that the thrush delivered his message. We don't witness the battle of five armies because Bilbo in unconscious during the battle.<br />There is so much material about Middle Earth that WB could have probably given us another 6+ movies in a &#34;tales from middle earth&#34; type format. There was no need to try and smash all these other stories under this one title.<br />The movie slashes from one story to another and its confusing even to those of us familiar with the background events they have added to this adventure. The characters themselves are so different from the book that if different names had been used I doubt we would even recognize them.<br />The (mostly) amazing CGI work done in TLOTR makes this product seem childish by comparison. The wholly ridiculous ride on the stone giants knee (ah 3D doesn't make it any better), the dumb looking trolls and Goblin (orc) King. Along with the Disney type escape on the rail cart from the goblin (orc) tunnels. &#60;-another part NOT in the book because while they are escaping BILBO is dealing with Gollum. Another small add to that, NOW according to the Jackson/WB version of the tale, Bilbo really did steal the Ring!! In the book he &#34;finds it&#34;, in TLOTR he &#34;finds it&#34;, only to realize later that the ring was Gollums. In this version he WATCHes the Ring fall out of Gollums pocket and STEALS it.<br />Another major fault to this movie is how obvious it was rushed to the Big screen. Say what you want about the LOTR release, no one can say the battle scenes small and large were not spectacular. In this movie you wonder whether any battle choreography was done at all! From the battle with the trolls to the tunnel escape we have our adventurers swinging their axes and swords this way and that with no reason (until CGI &#34;THROWS&#34; an orc into the picture to receive the blow, or the Troll says ouch and then continues on as if nothing happens).<br />I have mentioned only a couple of items where our WB/Jackson team totally ignore the original tale. If I were to write about all of them this review would be just as long as this very bad rendition of Tolkien's &#34;CLASSIC&#34;!! CLASSIC!! Guys!! This is a CLASSIC! How DARE you think you can do a better job of presenting this story than Tolkien! I always understand and have no problem with 'editing' and changing the story a bit to bring a classic to the big screen. But way to many of your changes were unnecessary and RUIN the story. And I mean RUIN it.<br />I truly believe if Tolkien were alive today, he would have enjoyed TLOTR release. He would have understood the changes that were made as the tale was brought to the screen. And just as sure as I am that he would have liked TLOTR, I am just as sure that he would NOT have like what they have done to this book. In almost every case the was just no NEED to change the story as much as they have.<br />If you really love &#34;The Hobbit&#34;, I suggest you watch the animated 'made for TV' version from the 70's. Givethis one a miss! Its NOT &#34;the Hobbit&#34;.<br />Icing on the cake? Because of this fiasco, its highly unlikely we will EVER see another live version of this wonderful novel. 20+ years before its even considered probably. I won't get to see it (to old).<br />Thanks Pete
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Great book! Lots of action picked up right where book 1 left off. I am looking forward to book three.
B008DVJO8C|5.0|Maria Brink really has out done herself. This is the best album she has made. It is a must listen to!
B006X5L6VS|5.0|I love this app. We live in Hawaii and almost always have a clear night sky. This tells me exactly what we are seeing. I like this latest version where you can mute the music which can get annoying after a bit. Best used laying down otherwise it hurts my neck from locking so long.
B00017LSK8|5.0|It has a great -3 +3 leeway In the exposure, which is fantastic.<br />Gives amazingly sharp images(especially stopped down at F/44)<br /><br />The contrast and blacks are sublime, really enjoy this film!<br />Works a treat with flash also, best of all IT HAS ZERO GRAIN. Which is insane for ISO 3,000.<br /><br />Only con: if you're shooting dark skinned people it really doesn't work well. The tones are unflattering.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse. This app helps me sleep fairly effectively despite my haphazard schedule. It is easy to use/configure. I slept like a baby while people were doing construction with heavy machinery outside our home.
B002KLOPF8|5.0|Has a comical twist,you don't see much of in military action movies.Recommend everyone watching once for culture experience.go check it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|They say pictures speak a 1000 words but in this era videos tell it all.<br /><br /> This case is professionally sleek and it does what the video say it will do, sometimes I don't even know that I have it in my bag.<br /><br />Amazon continue w/videos over photos please, thank you.
0142421375|5.0|Good read, even for adults. J Grisham is a winner! The Kid Lawyer books have the same legal tone with underlying morals as any Grisham book. Same excitement and suspense as you expect. The hero just happens to be a 13 year old boy!
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|My youngest daughter needed an alarm, since she just moved to her own room.  We looked up alarm apps and downloaded this one.  It's fun to use, with plenty of &#34;voices&#34; and options.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|T has way too many words for me. But it's a great source of words. So I would recommend this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Take this fun game with you wherever your Kindle goes.  Handy app for the waiting time in a doctor's office or carpool line.  Ads can be skipped and are not too disruptive.
B008RA3X5E|4.0|I like this app a lot. It's a clock, which is what I needed when I downloaded this clock app. It's also an alarm which I needed when I saw it was an alarm. I defiantly recommend this alarm clock if you are looking for an alarm clock.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I had been reading PDFs on my Kindle, but missed being able to highlight.  This app lets me highlight any PDF I open from my email while on my Kindle, send to my Kindle, or download while on my Kindle.  There is a learning curve, but I am figuring it out with the help of the documentation that came with the app.
B001992NW4|5.0|I think that this movie looks absolutely phenomenal, as opposed to the original version. A must-own for any movie collector.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|What I love about this book is that it has nothing much to do with the undead and everything to do with regular everyday people living. Brooks has done a fantastic job of populating his book with people you'll recognize. Despite the fantasy premise this book is all about what happens to real people when they're put into mortal challenge.<br /><br />And yes, it was thousands of times better than the movie.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Simply the best! The sound is beautiful. The good ol' days of rock and role. This is a must have.
B00004XPPE|5.0|Fail Safe is an excellent study in the various philosphical and political attitudes of the Cold War era. I use this film when I teach Cold War literature to my junior English class.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|Its just a great story told with superb skill. I really want to give it 6 stars. Buy it and enjoy.
B00919CI5Q|5.0|Not really a review just wanted to let people know with the promotion you get Splinter Cell Blacklist and Splinter Cell Conviction for free when you order this card or any card that has the promo with it. (Ill change the stars when I get and use the GTX 660.)<br /><br />Installed it and plays games great with the FX-4100. Plays Battlefield 3 on ultra. Just Youtube some of my videos CybertronPC Escape and click the newer videos.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane took me from the warmth of my 65 + year comfortable life back to when I was young (6-8) and had adventures like our hero, or we're those just dreams?  I really can't remember.  A great book which I really enjoyed from beginning to end.
0783241577|5.0|Ghost used to be my favorite romantic movie, but I changed my mind when I saw Notting Hill for the first time. This is a great movie and I love it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This makes you think.  I love it.  MY husband and I play the game together on separate kindles.  We help each other sometimes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This was the best game eva. It is just like Subway Surfers but is Despicable Me Themes. So if you like Subway Suffers you will like this game.
0674059719|5.0|Philological care and fascinating look: this book is the best thing one can expect looking for a new edition of an old classic.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|It took me a long time to finally watch this movie, but once I did I absolutely fell in love with it. When my friend bought it I watched it all the time with her girls. When I saw it was on here in just dvd form I had to buy it. I'm so glad its apart of my collection of movies. Can't stand stores that only sell it with Blue Ray discs. Not everyone has a Blue Ray player or wants one. Definitely one of my favorite animated movies of this generation.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was excellent! So many twists and turns until the very end! Sure would like to read a sequel to this one.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Darn the book ended! I now must download the next one I'm anxious too see how it turns out! Happy reading!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This is a fantastic album, not to mention her other albums. Her music is AWESOME and she is so stylish and HIP
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love the music . My mom does ,too. It's great to play. Especially for kids. It's good just to listen to. They did a good job!
B006M4RN3U|5.0|GR8 Group! Love the music and the songs!  Breakout group of the last several years in our opinion! GREAT ALBUM!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just got this game and it is a lot of fun, it's a good game to play on long car trips.
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|Some of the language is a little too old school for me, but the message is clear - never assume, get all the facts, etc.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and I would recommend it to any one who likes adventures and books that keep you on the edge.
B00CA9Y6Q8|5.0|There aren't enough superlatives for me to go that route and just list one after the other. The music is arresting, to me, completely independent of anything I've heard before. She has a musical vision that is very refreshing and intelligent.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|you want this app you need this app you'd in love with this app so when your ready come and get it Na Na Na Na Na na
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|The Writers are Amazing and so are the actors..  Loved seeing the sudden plot twists & can't wair for Season 8 to premier ;)
B0087JTAKW|5.0|facing cancer, feeling that time is too short. realizing it should always be enough ..<br />one breath can be an eternity<br />I love this book I read it all in a blink of an eye
B008LZHA3G|4.0|Not up to Dylan's &#34;Modern Times&#34; in my opinion but the product and the service are not responsible for the artist's work- Do not require minimum words for an evaluation
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I must admit I get out quickly the grandkids can go on forever!  Good fun! Not violent and the kids love it!
B00BQI4AU6|4.0|I wasn't expecting Cinderella....This is a good solo album.  I've listened to it several times and it has grown on me quite a bit. One of the better solo efforts I've heard for quite some time.  If you like Cinderella, I would expect you would appreciate this CD....
B005HSL626|5.0|My grandson made me get this game they love it.  Keeps them entertained and they think about fruit not guns!  Just swords - LOL!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Think it's a good app, fun, no complications using it and use it even without Internet, highly recommended to buy this game
B007L3BMGA|4.0|I enjoyed reading it. Very easy reading and made me feel young again.<br />very entertaining too. can't put it down
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|One of my most favorite recent album releases and certainly the most authentic and inspired of them all.  I'm not a die-hard QOTSA fan but have been getting progressively more into them, especially over the last year after I got the discography.  I remember when everyone was going nuts about SFTD in the early 2000s and I couldn't understand it.  I think I remember actually returning the CD.  A few years later, the light went on and I repurchased it and started loving it.  Anyway, these guys are the real deal: just self-destructive enough to not really care what the expectations out there for them are, but confident and inspired enough to make a fantastic record together.  This is a fantastically inspired collection of songs and I hope to see them live when they get back from touring Europe.
B007KOYEOC|4.0|I really enjoyed it. Seems like not able to put it down, I liked reading it .Always wanting for more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|good game for free but it needs to have more rooms from the start instead of having to wait for them to release more levels
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I just keep reading it, like to know what's next. The story is very intriguing and entertaining,. I can't helped myself smiling and laughing while reading.
B00004XQ83|5.0|one of my favorites
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|This is not going to win a Grammy, but it is a fun, good-guys-beat-bad-guys movie that will keep you entertained. It was the perfect movie for a Friday night.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's very fun for all ages it's entertaining, addictive game, when your bored you can always count on this game.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It works quite well on my Galaxy S3; though during the start up the app seems to lag behind my input enough to feel chunky, although It may just be a problem with my due to my phone running many things at a time. Either way though I must say that I enjoy it more than the standard one which comes with the phone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games I ever played and its free get it Pol caiuse it is one of the best games.I played andi promise u wont be mad with results
B0031RAOVY|5.0|It was a great heart warming movie; I loved it.  I would recommend it to anyone adult and children alike.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|Alright, first of all, I've been hearing in the other reviews that this piano has only like 7 keys or there are not that much keys....that's a big fat Lie. In order to get to the other keys, you slide your fingers up above the piano, not on any keys, and you slide to the right an left to change octaves... anyways this app isn't that bad, it is very silent and pitch isn't as good, but it hey it's on a Android or kindle what do you expect it to be? A real piano that comes out of the screen, I'm not trying to be prudent many people just need some Common sense, other than pitch and faint sound, it is a wonderful app, it helped me learn fingering and I used this app every day! I bought myself a keyboard and I'm glad I got to learn off this app because now I can MoveOn with other fun fingers and music! So thank you for creating this app!
B005IS565S|5.0|I love five finger death punch, Every song is really good. If you are considering buying it, I want to let you know you definitely should buy it.
B004C00EM8|4.0|WARNING: Extremely violent from beginning to end. I do not think most people could watch this until the end.  It is extreme--maybe the most extreme movie I have watched, and there is not one time the viewer can relax and sit back to enjoy.  The film is very sick, but it does have an objective: who can endure pain more, men or woman? Can women survive torture beyond belief (beatings, skinning, and other horrors)? The elderly female character who is introduced at the end of the movie is the most horrifying character I have ever seen. She makes Adolf Hitler look like a pussycat.
B00AB7IA1S|4.0|game is fine until level 3.7 when there seems to be a bug that will not allow the ships to use the fans properly.  was quite fun until then. some of the levels got quite challenging. I especially liked that the hint feature actually only gave a hint. it did not do it for you as many of these games do. once the bug on level 3.7 is fixed I look forward to finishing the game.
B001QWEE4E|5.0|A love story. Who cares if the men are straight or gay? The love between the men is genuine. Can a man love another man and not be gay?  Absolutely. This is a beautifully filmed movie with outstanding performances.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|ok the app is fine but there were virus warnings. I got it any way and it got a virus!
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book is both lyrical and nicely constructed.  I've a certain interest in the trappings of magic, and Ms. Morgenstern weaves them better than most.
B009K916ZK|4.0|Received the item in time and it works great, I would recommend this product to other. It was a original product from apple a d it was half the price.
B002NN5F7A|2.0|The story has great potential regarding the conflicts involved in business.  However, is it really necessary to inject the four letter words into just about every sentence.  I can't recall one line of Jack Lemmon's where he did not use it.  I am not prudish and realize there are times when these words are necessary if not for the realism factor alone.<br />However, having been in business for many years and having contact with many business people, never have I heard these words used so gratuitously.  Used, yes.  To this extreme, never.<br />It just seemed they were thrown into the film just because they could be used but it sure got tiring after the first twenty minutes.
B003UPPO2G|5.0|I recommend, i Love it, i like it, came quickly and was what i want, was for a Gift and my daddy Love it
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Williams story and the trials his family went through are so awakening for me.  The determination is very inspiring!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Wonderful graphics. Easy to play. Something new each time you login. Includes some education about oceans and coral reefs. No worry about inappropriate content. Family friendly.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|The Kindle App allows the Android OS to make use of Amazon's extensive library and is very user friendly.  My complaints are that I cannot loan all of my titles as some have copyright restrictions & e-Books are still a bit too pricey given that you are simply buying the data and not a physical product.
B00A72M77U|5.0|This album has been always a reference recording, excellent music, this is the best record that blue nile has ever made
B008OOYALE|3.0|This game is really cool. You get to hatch your own dragons and make hybrids. Don't  spend too much money when you first start because you will regret it and even if you restart it it won't take you back to the beginning of the game. The graphics are really great.<br />I have to say, DS is slightly money oriented. Solution? Get neighbors! If you have a handful of active neighbors, then you can get gold and other kinds of useful stuff. Except, they can't give you silver. You have to collect it from the habitats that you made.<br />In the end, I've deleted this game, because itt was just frustrating. The silver problem just overwhelmed me,  plus they have timed goals, which I seriously hate! What's more is that these timed goals have to deal with breeding ultra rare dragons, and.... TeamLava's other games!<br />Did I mention that sometimes the dragons just look hideous when you level them up?
B006A9XRSM|5.0|A perfect duo!!!! Stan as oscar peterson are favorites choices to listen always, they play jazzz at their best !!!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Ok, so it probably will take a little while to unlock the hammerhead shark, but otherwise, I am addicted to this game!
1439102813|5.0|I enjoyed reading the book\\" Still Alice\\". The author presented a realistc view of living with A!lzheimer's disease from the perspective of the client. It is a good book to read to gain information without the use of medical jargon.
B007N8RULO|4.0|The black deck game is easy to win, the black and red deck game is hard. It helps to pass the time if there isn't anything on the TV to watch. I keep coming back for more.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|In their day, Godzilla, Mothra, and all the rest were great fun. Then the day of the rubber-suit monster passed, and we've been largely bereft of that time-honored tradition since then.<br /><br />Their day has returned! As usual, you have to swallow a few improbable premises to get the movie going - such as, when attacked by giant monsters, the solution is a fist-fight. You know, a giant fist-fight. But, as suspension of disbelief goes, other movies have asked me to suspend a lot more. Once the premises are in place, this plays by its own rules, right to the incredible finale.<br /><br />This has all you'd expect in the way of computer effects, giant robots'n'beasts, and horrendous damage to cities (not just Tokyo this time). It has the heroics you'd hope for - brave fighters giving their all. It even has a chaste bit of romance (or at least, potential romance). But it's directed by Guillermo del Toro, the creative force behind [[ASIN:B003Y1D7UC Pan's Labyrinth]]. It has real characters with real histories and feelings, and works them realistically against each other. Except maybe for the two super-scientist types, who seem to be the movie's nod to comic relief. In the end, though, even they get to be heroes in their brave but utterly nerdy way.<br /><br />del Toro has not just brought the giant-monster movie up to date, he's brought the whole genre up a notch in the rankings of real drama. This is not just an excuse to sit in the theater's air conditioning - it's truly a summer movie to enjoy.<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the release to theaters
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Although the movie is not as in depth as the book, it does have all the elements to make a good movie. Having read all the books in the series, I am waiting for the next movie to come out to see how it stands up to the book also. An interesting movie to watch, I would recommend it.
B00129H7VS|5.0|well put together movies to show how a group of men became one of the best known fight outfits in world war 2
B009MF5BXK|5.0|The return of the muscles, guns, knives and violence! With three new old timers, Arnold and Chuck Norris and Jean Claude Van Dam. Also a new young face of Liam Hemsworth. This time we are going to Albania, chasing bad guys who want to unearth and sell plutonium to more bad guys. Hang of to your seats for the action is nonstop, the music is better and the ending is a surprise.<br />A good Saturday evening of entertainment!

B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The &#34;Men in Black&#34; series have been a favorite of ours but the last one is the best. A must see and must have for fans of MIB.
B00192KCQ0|4.0|good hard rock and roil the lyrics are very harsh and should be only listened to by adults,defiantely do not let you child listen to this cd
B002ZG999U|4.0|With this cast how can you not have a winner. It's muscles, guns, knives and a lot of gratuitous violence. This movie is not for the faint of heart, but if you can overlook the blood splatter how can you not watch Sylvester and friends come to the rescue of the oppressed. The story is a little weak, but the music is great as well as the edge of your seat action. Worth watching!
B000YXMMAE|4.0|good music,radiohead has a little different  music still very enjoyable to listen to.i have listened to this cd over repeatable
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great novel.  Baldacci draws you in immediately and it's impossible to put this book down.  Looking forward to reading more from him.,

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think this is an excellent show!! Cannot wait for it to come back on! The end of the show last year was a shocker. I wish he had not died.
B003Z0BWRM|1.0|While I can see a lot of work went into this and there is a fair bit of imagination in it, the writing is really mediocre and the characters are flat and predictable. Obviously I'm in the minority but I couldn't finish it.<br />I think I've been spoilt by my favourite supernatural book 'Sunshine' by Robin Mckinley - Cassandra Clare just doesn't come anywhere close.
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Great and inspirational movie about commitment and faith.  Good G movie for all the family to watch.  Highly recommend this movie.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|Hate it!  why fix it once it is perfect?  I can't find anything now. I liked the 10 day review.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Too much extraneous detail about doctoring. Not really a lot of detail on the exact subject matter. Would not recommend.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|This case is exactly what I wanted. It's simple and lightweight. It's easy to put into position and close it up.
044024630X|4.0|Typical Jack Reacher.  Don't know why I'm not bored with the series yet.  Oh well, this one is very much like the previous books in the series.  Very entertaining.  Can't give it 5 stars.  If it were totally new and blew me away sure.  Predictable to a degree but worth the time.
0345803485|1.0|I couldn't make it through the book. I could only stomach a few chapters, and I ended up giving it away to a stranger.  The characters were weak, and I was irritated at their idiocy.
0525953728|4.0|Good read if you want to understand the perspective of the guys on the ground. I don't read much, but this was an enjoyable book. I do recommend.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Simply awesome. If you like the show you'll love the movie. It ends the series perfectly couldn't ask for more.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is one of the best free apps I have ever played!  Complete fun and hours/days/weeks of entertainment. I totally recommend this app for children of ALL ages!
0679805273|4.0|I have always loved this book, and purchased this for the graduation of my Preschool class.  They also enjoyed it immensely!  The cover was a little too big, and I had to readjust it, but other than that it is a beautiful book.  Arrived as described time wise.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|great game for the whole family. challenging yet fun for all. this game is the best my little pony game out there.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I love this concert. Alfie Boe is great, Nick Jonas did a great job. This musical is the best around.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoy this app. A lot of different sounds and a lot of different combinations. I get lost in my own little world's listening to nature sounds, or sitting in a room with a grandfather clock, listening to the rain and thunder rumbling in the distance. Love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. its like a mix of temple run 1 &amp;2 and also subway surfer. the only thing. I don't like is when u say yourself it goes and shows a side view. I always die when it does that. its confusing a little bit too.

030789701X|3.0|Contents look fantastic but mine, which was a new copy bought from Amazon, came with some pages torn and missing portion. Very disappointed with the book's condition but great service recovery from Amazon after i notified them. Five stars for book contents and Amazon's service, 1 star for the book's condition, 3 stars overall.
B00004NHCC|4.0|First of all.<br />I love this period in Sarah Vaughan's career.  She was at her peak at this time(in my humble opinion), and as a jazz singer was hard to match.  I am also a big fan of Clifford Brown.<br />So, to paraphrase  \\"Mary Poppins\\".  This Album is ALMOST perfect in every way.<br />It would be perfect, were it not for a sugary sweet version of \\"April In Paris\\"  which has no place on an otherwise great CD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging and mind building.  It is very addicting and I find myself wanting more levels. Cannot wait for the next levels to come out.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|OMG! I love this series it is very realistic, of course with some exaggerations and fantasies but overall it is excellent, you will enjoy it a lot.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|I can't tell you how many times my son has watched this. And it comes with a mini figure to play with while watching the movie.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I wear ear buds with my phone but can't keep them in my ear when exercising and earphones made specifically for working out just rub my eat in all the wrong ways.  I guess I'm old school and frankly never expected these to stay put while running but they have been great.  They stay in my ears and sound decent enough for my purposes and no weird friction or pain in and around the ears.
B00338QENI|5.0|This was required reading for a nursing research class.  It was a great story, insightful and well written.  I never knew or understood the importance of Hennrietta Lacks' cell line in the development of vaccines, research testing and advancements in all aspects of medicine.  Truly an amazing story whose mission was to point out that patient protections, consent and privacy issues developed today are a result of our arrogance and careless disregard of the past.  The paperwork we all have to read and sign when seeking healthcare is there for a reason; starting with the story of Hennrietta Lacks.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter is an amazing show and this season pulled out all of the stops!! So far the best and wildest season we've seen yet!
0425263991|2.0|I am amazed at the number of reviewers giving this 5 stars.  This was not a particularly good or interesting book.  One of the things that makes any \\"romance\\" novel interesting is the dynamic between the two leads.  The best novels have both characters experience a growth arc where they have to change who they are or how they act or feel to accommodate the relationship.<br /><br />The problem here is we don't just have two alpha characters.  We have two gods.  There is not a soul on the planet (nor I suspect most modern weaponry) that can stop them if they decide one day to (a la Pinky and the Brain) \\"Take over the world\\".  I mean seriously, he can control forces the size of Midwestern states, and she could, if she wanted, make him do anything SHE wanted.  Yawn.  And his kryptonite?  It's her.  Meaning if she dies he implodes the world.<br /><br />The tone of this book was very different than all others in the series, and that's fine because it was the first all-psy story point of view, so yes it should feel different.  Unfortunately since he's not going to be bothered by emotional issues, or moral concerns, and politically he can do pretty much whatever he wants -- this only leaves global level crisis as what happens in the story as far as plot goes.  so we have one after another and by the third I honestly have to say it was a little boring.<br /><br />I found the shift in tactics by the pure-psy to be bizarre.  Up until this book their tactics aligned with those used by terrorists in our world, so it was recognizable (not going to go there and say it makes sense).  But this shift was strange and felt like it was the only way she could move it to a conclusion quickly -  hence it felt rushed and cumbersome.<br /><br />There we a lot of things that happened in the larger plot of the politics of psy and the net that all happened at a rapid pace.  One could argue that I guess things had reached a tipping point so therefore events would happen more quickly.  But it allfelt so \\"last 10 minutes of a Star Trek episode\\" if you know what I mean.<br /><br />My feeling is that characters like these are fascinating until you make them the focus of a story -  and then it becomes obvious that their extreme power makes them limited as a hero.  They are far more interesting as side characters that shift the lives of other \\"mere mortal\\" in interesting ways.  I'm not arguing that the events that took place in this book should not have happened.  They just would have been far more interesting to have happened as background story involving two more \\"regular psy\\".<br /><br />It gets 2 stars from me because there was no way to have any kind of character arc for our leads, and it was mostly action with too many major events being resolved in simplistic ways.  Hence it was like a summer action movie - and not a very good one.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|Who doesn't like Penguins especially super ones!this is a great game and you can easily become a super penguin addict!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I was so happy with book. It was very well written and pulls at your heart strings like nothing else!
0374214913|4.0|Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore is a great read for literary lovers or people who like to think outside of the box.  The thoughts explored in this novel are unique and interesting; they give you a different view on life.  I loved the characters, and the descriptions were great.  The only negative for me was the characters Kat and Clay; I wish you saw how their relationship turned out.  Overall this is a great story; 4/5 stars.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|loved this movie. I will be sure to watch this again soon. Viewed it with the girl friend and it was a big hit. John makes terrific movies. Love every one of his!
B0041G683W|5.0|This and the 10th anniversary are must-have for the timeless story.  I love the 2012 movie for better realism and how acting brings out the story.
B002N57KG2|1.0|This movie was made for the adults of the 70's. it's almost a toast  to the actors in the movie. It should have been put on the very back shelf after its debut. If you like \\"corney\\", here it is.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Loved this story...the characters were lovely and the little boy was lovable, I liked being in his world. Was sad the story wasn't longer.  I gave this book a try based on the reviews and was so glad I did!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game. It is very addictive. It is pretty tricky sometimes and makes you think. Play play
B00D41H2PS|1.0|I cannot play it. Several of the mini games will not work on my kindle fire. The ship for one and the code in the bedroom. Very irritating. Also the help button up top comes and goes on a whim apparently. Refund?
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|I like Sci Fi but I like a great movie with a beautiful story even better.  This is both so it is a winner.  Very well done and I usually read the book before I watch the movie.  I am glad I did not in this case.  I had just watched Pacific Rim with my son at the local IMAX 3D and was amazed at the special effects but it was missing something, like a story.  The Host filled in the gap and I am very glad I watched it.  I guess I am saying it was better than Pacific Rim in my book!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I Couldn't put this book down!! Kept me interested the whole way thru.  Now on to book three... can't wait
0753541637|5.0|I haven't finished reading this yet, but I'm impressed with Sandberg.  I really bought the book more for my two daughters.  I lived through a lot of what she talks about - and I'd like my daughters to read it before they encounter it - better warned . . .
142314189X|5.0|Hardbound books as a nice box set, it is great to get them all in one! Good value for what you pay.
B009C30K4W|5.0|If you are into musical this is a great one.  I don't normally like musicals.  But this one was very lively.
B0095MVOMC|4.0|Pretty fun and hard when it comes to the last 3-4 numbers.<br /> &middot;Warning to all kindle fire hd users: on the third or fourth level the five is under the home button so you cannot click it.<br />Not worth two dollars, but still pretty fun.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|love this game I love the minions they are so cute and I love the movie :) it such a good game
B009GLHF5C|5.0|One of my favorites by one of my favorite bands. Holds up well every time I play it. If you like Muse, you will love this album.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The weather Channel app used to be simple and to the point. Not sure why they decided to &quot;update&quot; it this extensively but it is now annoyingly complex and slow. I switched to the WeatherBug.
B0045KS6M0|4.0|Lovely story, enjoyed a lot. Richard Gere and Jodie Foster did a great job keeping the story going and interest the viewer.
B00BQ1D7X4|3.0|I was willing to accept Aic without Layne, but what we've ended up getting are Jerry Cantrell solo albums under the Aic name.  Jerry is a decent vocalist, and the way things were going he was going to end up fronting the band regardless.  Look at the self titled album and the 2 songs recorded for a box set.  All Layne's vocals were distorted.  Jerry did all the clean vocals, because I'm guessing Layne with all his issues probably couldn't do them anymore.  So I was willing to accept Jerry as the front man, but unfortunately this project, now in its second album,  comes off as a weaker version of his solo albums.<br /><br />The pacing of these songs is a big issue for me. The pace seems to range from really slow to slightly upper mid tempo.  AIC was a band that would have the slow and drudgey songs like I can't remember, and Junkhead, but they'd also have the heavier faster songs like Them bones, We die young and Again, as well as some really nice slower/softer songs, Rooster Over now, No excuses, and then the other random songs that don't fit any of these categories.  Unfortunately with both this album and Black gives way to blue it seems the songs just sound like stale jerry Cantrell solo songs, with a few exceptions.  I say this and I did find 6 songs on the previous album that I liked ok.  I prefer an album to change tempos with each song, and neither of these albums do that, especially this one.  This pacing works on Hollow as the slower pacing helps emphasis the chorus as the song picks up its pacing a little during this point, but 12 really slow songs is a little much.<br /><br />And don't even get me started on the line \\"the devil put dinosaurs here Jesus don't like no-insert slur against gay people\\".  I don't know if they're hating on Christians or gay people or both or more likely saying \\"religion bad\\".  It's probably the latter, to which I'd reply, \\"Well gee that's original.  A rock band writing a song saying religion is bad.  How original.  So let me guess your next album is going to have a song about how bad the government is or a broken hearted song too, cause those are wild and crazy song ides nobody has done\\".  OK I guess I did get started on that song.<br /><br />I also find this album after track 3 ot get way too soft for my taste.  Now granted a couple of my favorite songs on here are the softer ones but geez.<br /><br />On a positive note I find the songwriting much improved over the previous album.  While the previous album had 2 songs, check my brain adn the title tack, that I really liked, and a few others I found passible, but honestly I can't remember how any of them go now, this album I like 8 songs and I can say I legitimately like all 8.  Hollow is a fairly cool opener with a cool chorus.  Pretty Done and Stone are decent follow ups that pick up the pace slightly.  Voices is an acoustic based song and one of my favorite songs on the album.  Low Ceiling is slow but decent.  Breath ona window is mostly faster, though there's a slower part I wouldn't mind if the album wasn't so freakin' slow.  Still it's a decent track.  Scalpel is a fairly cool mostly acoustic song-possibly my second favorite song on here, and Choke is another mostly acoustic song, but a god one.<br /><br />Overall this isn't a terrible album, pretty good for a Jerry Cantrell solo album, but I really expect more from the Alice in chains name.  But most people seem to really like it, so if you're a fan of the band, and Jerry's solo work, and especially the previous album then you'll probably like this.
B00BEN0YP8|5.0|What a great movie! Steven Spielberg definitely deserved an Oscar for this one. Casting was great and story that will preserve.
B0076NKLRQ|4.0|First, some background. This film encompasses the summer of 1956, in which Marilyn Monroe travelled to London in order to star alongside Lawrence Olivier in [[ASIN:B006SA5XRQ The Prince and the Showgirl]], a light romantic comedy. She was hoping to gain some credit as a serious actress, whilst he (or at least the version of him that exists in this film) wants to recapture his youth. And how better to do that than opposite the world's most desirable actress? Marilyn was still six years away from her death-by-overdose in 1962, but that foreknowledge casts a shadow over the entire film, for the cracks in her life and psyche that ultimately drive her to her untimely end are apparent throughout.<br /><br />Based on the memoirs of Colin Clark, a twenty-three year old at the time, he shares in his biographic account [[ASIN:0006531792 My Week with Marilyn]] that he - well, quite obviously spent time with the famous movie star. As third assistant to the director, Clark struck up a friendship with Marilyn that left enough of an impression on him that he was compelled to write about it many years later in the book of the same name, and upon which this screenplay is based.<br /><br />It's really quite a simple bio-pic, chronicling the behind-the-scenes drama of the filming of \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\", as well as portraying snippets of the movie itself and Colin Clark's budding relationship with Marilyn. The woman was notoriously difficult to work with on-set, keeping her co-stars waiting for hours while she prepared and frustrating the director with her attempts to get inside her character's head even though the role itself was feather-light. The stress gets to her, and it's only when she reaches out to Clark as a confidante that things begin to get back on track - though this comes at a heavy personal cost to Clark.<br /><br />The film is jam-packed full of British thespians playing other British thespians. Kenneth Branagh as Lawrence Olivier, Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh and Judi Dench as Dame Sybil Thorndike, as well as Dougray Scott as Marilyn's American husband Arthur Miller, Dominic Cooper as photographer Milton Greene, Zoe Wanamaker as Marilyn's acting coach Paula Strasberg, and Emma Watson as Clark's love interest Lucy (possibly the only fictional character in the whole piece). Heck, even Derek Jacobi pops in for a brief cameo.<br /><br />Some of these actors are better showcased than others, but in their short amount of time, each one manages to not only project an understanding of their own character, but to demonstrate just how much of a turbulent impact Marilyn had on their lives. As the protagonist, Eddie Remayne does his best with a wafer-thin character, but let's face it - in a role that requires little beyond looking dazed and awestruck, he simply exists as an audience surrogate for viewers to experience the Marilyn effect. Most of the time he just stares at the actress in awe, and as early as the first three seconds of the film, in which his voice-over narration is discussing his background, you're already thinking: \\"who cares? Get to Marilyn!\\"<br /><br />And it is Michelle William's performance as Marilyn that naturally provides the film its purpose, a challenge that she tackles with remarkable self-possession. Who would have thought that the girl from [[ASIN:B005CGI3ZG Dawson's Creek]] had this in her? In her hands, it's easy to see why the world was so captivated by the woman she plays, and Williams captures Marilyn's breathy speech patterns, fragile beauty, effortless sensuality and enigmatic nature with eerie accuracy. The entire purpose of the movie is really a character-study of one of the most famous film actresses of all time, and you find yourself scrutinizing her every time she's on-screen. At times confident, skittish, cheerful, seductive, vulnerable, childish and desperately unhappy, it's difficult to pin her down - which is precisely what makes her so alluring.<br /><br />While watching, you begin to wonder: it is Marilyn's personality or the mystique surrounding her that enchants everyone? Is she really as vulnerable and helpless as she seems, or does she know exactly what she's doing when she makes the rest of the cast wait hours for her? What is hurting her more, her army of sycophants or her impatient critics? And who has the woman's true measure? Lawrence Olivier loses his patience with her on more than one occasion, yet ultimately acknowledges that her instinctual ability to work the camera is like nothing he's ever seen before. Vivien Leigh sees only a beautiful young starlet that reminds her of her own advancing age. Clingy Paula Strasberg does more harm than good when it comes to coaching Marilyn in method acting. Arthur Miller confesses that his wife \\"is devouring me,\\" whilst Milton Greene jealously warns Clark that Marilyn's only interest is in breaking hearts. Sybil Thorndike is gently encouraging, and Clark is just hopelessly smitten.<br /><br />The final conclusion drawn is that despite her apparent instability, a woman like Marilyn Monroe needs to be as tough as nails to make it in Hollywood - though her eventual fate surely puts a damper on this interpretation. Yet as she says to Clark in the movie's final moments; as much as her lifestyle is harming her, she cannot do without it - demonstrated by a telling little scene in which she and Clark are accosted by a group of fans, Marilyn whispers: \\"shall I be her?\\" and so instantly transforms from a demure young woman to a smoldering sexpot.<br /><br />The time period is beautifully rendered through costuming, location and props, and despite the film's rather slow pacing and lack of any real narrative drive (in my father's words: \\"this was the most boring movie I've ever seen\\") those who are interested in the subject matter of old films and the actors/actresses that starred in them may be intrigued by what \\"My Week With Marilyn\\" has to share.nder: it is Marilyn's personality or the mystique surrounding her that enchants everyone?

B0045INOCO|4.0|A really good movie. I would definitely recommend to watch. A movie from Vietman, but not a typical story you would expect.
B005PV81MS|5.0|A young nurse is walking home at night when she's set upon by a gang of masked and hooded delinquents that demand that she give up her phone and wallet. Things look as though they're about to turn ugly when the mugging is interrupted by a large unidentified object falling from the sky and crashing into a car right next to them.<br /><br />You'd be forgiven for assuming what happens next: the nice white lady rushes back to her apartment block and rallies her neighbors together for the imminent alien attack, whilst the teenage hoodlums are quickly dispatched as the first victims of the invasion to demonstrate just what the monsters from outer space are capable of. Well, you'd be wrong.<br /><br />Sam (the nurse) makes a run for it, while the teenagers do exactly what you'd expect teenage delinquents to do in this situation: investigate the car, disturb the strange creature that lurks inside, and then bash it to death with cricket bats. They head back home with their trophy to store it in Ron's weed room (the local marijuana grower) only to watch from his apartment window as more aliens begin to crash land about the block. The arrivals go unnoticed by the police due to it being the fourth of July, and the boys eagerly head out to kill some more aliens. But a short montage in which they hurry into their apartments to gather weapons and briefly interact with their families belies the opening mugging sequence: that for all their bluster and swagger, these guys are still just kids.<br /><br />Heading back out onto the streets, it soon becomes clear that this new wave of aliens don't go down as easily as the first one. As black as hairy shadows with rows of glow-in-the-dark teeth and the speed and strength of simians (the kids coin the term \\"big alien wolf gorilla mother******s\\"), the aliens are terrifying opponents that quickly accrue a bloody body count.<br /><br />Taking refuge in the council block and running back into Sam (who is still shaken by the mugging) they try to come up with a plan and defend themselves against the aliens that seem to be coming after them in particular. Winding in and out of the narrative are several other characters to help or hinder them: a pot-smoking college student, a drug-dealing criminal, a couple of nine year olds who insist on being called Props and Mayhem, a group of teenage girls who are easily the most intelligent characters in the film, and Nick Frost in a small role (with the best lines) as Ron.<br /><br />The young cast is impressive, particularly as most of them seem to be complete unknowns. Choosing to cast actual teenagers instead of twenty-something year olds makes all the difference in keeping the protagonists fresh and genuine, as does using the idiosyncratic speech patterns and slang prevalent in lower-south London. John Boyega as Moses, the gang leader, is especially good - starting as a drug-dealer-in-training but concluding his character-arc by facing up to what he's done and risking his own life to set things right. Towards the end of the film he partakes in a phone conversation with Sam that reveals a particularly poignant detail to his life.<br /><br />A really nice touch is the fact that the progression of his character is marked by Moses's interaction with Sam. And by \\"interaction\\" I mean several moments in which they simply stare at each other - first with fear and hostility, and eventually with respect and trust. Each gets the chance to save the other over the course of the film, and by the time the credits roll you can tell they've reached a level of understanding that only a life-threatening situation could have ever granted them.<br /><br />Joe Cornish (writer and director) takes plenty of risks in a low-budget sci-fi/horror that actually has something surprisingly profound to say about its subject matter. Glancing over some of the one-star reviews, it would appear that a few viewers took offense at the idea of hoodlums being cast as the \\"heroes\\" of the film, a viewpointthat (to me at least) seems to miss the point spectacularly. Yes, the opening scene in which Moses and his cohorts mug Sam isn't easy to watch or forgive - and the film doesn't expect us to. Sam remains furious with them over the crime throughout the course of the story, and the teenagers' female friends give them plenty of flak for it as well. Yet having demonstrated that the mugging is just one ugly aspect of their characters, Cornish goes on to force the teens to face up to the consequences of their actions. Not all of them make it through the night, and those that are left are clearly in a heap of trouble by the time the credits roll.<br /><br />He's also to be commended for the creative reasoning behind the alien invasion. I won't give it away, as a mystery is sustained over the course of the film as to why they seem to be targeting the gang, but it's a unique take on a familiar trope, and the low quality effects of the aliens themselves mean that Cornish resorts to camera techniques that prevent the audience from getting a good look - which has the advantage of making them all the more scary.<br /><br />The best part is the snappy dialogue, which is heightened immeasurably by the actors' performances. Whether it's Pest hypocritically chiding Sam on her potty mouth or Dimples matter-of-factly listing her reasons as to why she's not letting the boys in the flat or Biggz leaving a series of near-hysterical messages on voicemail, the fast pacing and naturalistic delivery makes it almost a necessity to watch a second time just to catch it all.  Plenty of gritty action sequences, quick pacing, dark humour, and plenty of surprises - it's not for everyone, but I loved \\"Attack the Block.\\"that (to me at least) seems to miss the point spectacularly.

B00594MB2M|4.0|For a good review, visit the late Roger Ebert's website.  The film is about relationships and the city they take place in. Juliette Binoche is a marvelous actress.
B008R14YBK|5.0|I like Bridgit Mendler and really enjoyed her voice in Lemonade Mouth and the song she sang for one of the Tinkerbell movies. I got this CD thinking it would be some of the same stuff, but it's not. It's a little more grown-up and bold. It took me awhile to warm up to them, but I now love every song on this album. She's a talented musician and I hope she keeps making more music.
0440246318|5.0|I liked this one.  As usual with Jack Reacher, hero of heroes.  If you like JR, you'll like this one.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best shows ever.  We have enjoyed the entire series and look forward to the beginning of the next season
B004IPPINW|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  It was well written and put a new spin and how a fundamentalist might get there.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I previously had seen and enjoyed &#34;Before Sunrise.&#34;  Pondering whether or not to see the third-generation sequel &#34;Before Midnight,&#34;  it seemed logical to first watch the immediate sequel.  &#34;Sunset&#34; begins awkwardly reuniting the two principals from &#34;Sunrise&#34; but builds steadily, moment by moment, to a tantalizing ending that requires further exposition.  &#34;Sunset&#34; in fact could be enjoyed on its own without viewing the first entry and would still demand a sequel of its own.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT: &#34;Midnight&#34; lacks the charm of its first discovery and young love predecessors.  Perhaps that's the nature of middle age.  I am not holding my breath for a fourth offering.
B000005RUV|5.0|all of Wham's best in one collection, I am very pleased with some of the remixes
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love this app. When I get a new phone it is always the first one I download. It makes texting and typing so much easier!

B000000OSE|3.0|a good collection for fans of GNR
B002SSUQFG|5.0|Ordered on a Friday and it arrived on the next Tuesday with the free shipping. Well pleased with the watch. It runs quietly and I haven't noticed the time inaccuracy some people talk about. Mine does not loose or gain time. It is lightweight and the band is strong. I am well pleased with the watch and transaction.<br /><br />Pay attention to the size in the description. It is not as big as I thought it would be.<br /><br />It has been about five months since buying this watch and I am still pleased. No scratches and the band is holding up well. I wear it during the week at work and take it off at night.<br />The watch keeps great time. Its not an atomic watch so I don't expect millisecond accuracy. Its within the same minute of the phone I use to set it with on Monday. I take it off Friday at about five and the \\"wind\\" will consistently run out during the two o'clock hour early Sunday morning. I reset the time and date from my phone on Monday morning after giving it a few shakes. The lumescence last the same amount of time as my more expensive Seiko.<br />I am well pleased with the watch and get good comments about it. I would defiantly buy this watch again.
B000JJSPXQ|4.0|a great revisit to a group that had a lot of fun songs

B0020BUWX2|5.0|There Is little I can say about this book. Few words would do it justice. This book is a mixture of constant heartbreak and the most purest form of hope. It takes you through the challenges of life, death, and love in a way that's so effortless. Truly an incredible story. Wish I had more of it to read.
1781162646|5.0|I received this item which was exactly as it was described, I had no issues with delivery and I am happy with it.  Actually loved the book now that I've read it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|so I downloaded it on my kindle fire thinking it would be fun seeing good reviews on it. I went to my carosel to click on it and I did and it took forever to load then it shut me out. I tried it 3 other times and it still didn't work.
B0051MKMNC|5.0|The idea for the movie Limitless is based on a new experimental drug that allows you to access and tap into the previously untapped potential in your brain.<br />Limitless is well written has Bradley Cooper acting opposite Robert Deniro. Truly great actors have the ability to bring out the best in actors casted in opposite rolls. This is especially true in this film. Limitless is also well paced so the movie doesn't drag in any area. I also have to commend the way this movie was filmed. It has a visual richness to it.<br />I highly recommend this film.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Love it! Great series! Watched all the episodes several times.... Never gets old. Superman throughout high school and afterwards.  Good actors too.
B000N6TX1S|3.0|This movie had a lot of potential but somehow managed not to deliver. This movie had a great ensemble cast with Clive Owen, Michael Caine and Julianne Moore. It was set in the future. Somehow humans in the future lost their ability to reproduce and have children. It was never explained what the cause of the infertility was. There was also war in the future.<br />One of the things that was disappointing was the gloomy set and tone of the film. It had the same sort of feel as Alien 3, dismal almost from the start. The ending was undefined but also a big disappointment.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a life changer.  By that, I mean I wanted to make some real changes (eliminating gluten).  This well written, informative book is such an eye opener to the evils of wheat on our bodies and minds.  Plus, giving up he gluten has been the easiest thing ever, and the least painful than any other &#34;diet&#34; I have ever tried.  READ THIS BOOK.  It is important to your health.  Then buy the cookbook.  After this, buy Daniel Amen's The Amen Solution, and you will feel so much better, and probably look a lot better too.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Big Bang Theory has a great ensemble cast and great writing. I love great comedy but I must confess that most of the comedy shows on television today I don't find remotely funny. The Big Bang Theory is comedy done right. It's intelligent humor based on a group of nerd friends, who have difficulty adapting socially.<br />I started watching Big Bang Theory thanks to the reruns on Fox shown on week nights. As a result of seeing the reruns, I now watch the Big Bang series on Thursdays now. I have also enjoyed the series so much that I bought seasons 3,4 and 5 for home viewing. I am looking forward to the release of season 6 in September to acquire it for my collection.<br />Season 5 is especially good because nearly all of the friends now have their own story lines.<br />I can't wait to see what the writers will come up with for season 7 in the fall.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|When I heard there was going to be a Superman reboot I was very skeptical.  I was in favor of a continuation, and I thought \\"Superman Returns\\" was pretty well done, although it had an odd plot.  I wanted to find a reason to not like \\"Man of Steel\\"; after growing up with \\"Superman\\" and later watching/enduring 10 seasons of \\"Smallville\\", I thought the last thing the public needed was another retelling of the origin of Superman.  I am a big fan of the original Superman movie and the spirit behind \\"Superman II: The Richard Donner Cut\\".  I did not think a reboot could capture the spirit and good feeling of the original.  \\"Man of Steel\\" turned out to be a movie I thoroughly enjoyed and even came back to see it again.  I don't mind at all if my initial presumptions are proven wrong and I have to eat my own words - \\"Man of Steel\\" exceeded expectations and was an awesome movie.  The story on Krypton was ok, but when the movie really gets moving it does not let up.<br />I was initially skeptical of Michael Shannon playing General Zod, especially given his eccentric role on \\"Boardwalk Empire\\", but he did fine.  The pleasant surprise is the character of Faora, General Zod's second in command, played by basically unknown actress Antje Traue.  She has these beautiful, yet predatory eyes, and stands out in the movie. There are some actually unique aspects of a story told many times, like with the Kryptonians having a hard time adjusting to the Earth's atmosphere.  The cheesiness of Superman past is diminished, and he is often known as just \\"Clark\\", \\"Kal-El\\" or \\"Kal\\".  The story of his growing up in Smallville is smartly told in flashbacks to get right to Clark/Kal as a man.  Amy Adams does a nice job as Lois Lane as does Laurence Fishburne as Perry White, Kevin Coster as Jonathan Kent, Diane Lane as Martha Kent, and Russell Crowe as Jor-El.  Henry Cavill does an excellent job in the title role; his face conveys a lot of emotion, he is absolutely ripped, and probably looks the closest to the comic book version of any actor yet.  The franchise follows in a solid foundation that Christopher Nolan established with the newer Batman movies.  Like \\"The Dark Knight\\" series, the movie has a good story and has the best interest of the franchise in mind vice following a basic formula to try and just make a blockbuster movie.  \\"Man of Steel\\" is a homerun; it does not take away from the original \\"Superman\\", but compliments it as a different, modernized version.  The special and visual effects are amazing as you would expect.  I highly recommend.
B00BOUL9DM|4.0|Very fun game to play. Interesting and hard to put down. Good exercise for your mind. I really enjoy this game.Keeps you thinking.
