B008XX6J4C|5.0|This music is simply incredible. A very classic take on many contemporary songs, The Piano Guys are sure to inspire many young people of this generation to start piano (or cello!) lessons. \\"Cello Wars\\" is sure to draw many movie buffs, and  their take on One Direction will get the attention of many fangirls. I have nothing bad to say about the album. Great job guys! Looking forward to the future!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Piano has always been my favorite instrument and Jon Schmidt is amazing!<br /><br />Add the incredibly talented Steven Sharp Nelson on Cello and WOW!<br /><br />Whether you enjoy classical music, popular music, or both, this is an inspiring CD to listen to...
B007A2O3FO|5.0|I'll be honest, I adore Maggie Smith, so I probably would have loved it just because she was in it, but the movie was very good.  I truly enjoyed it.  Maggie's co-star is a brilliant young actor.  I've passed it around to all of my family. Definitely recommend this one.

B004EBUXSA|5.0|I bought it together with the memory Corsair Vengeance Blue 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM Dual Channel Memory Kit CMZ16GX3M4A1600C9B, OCZ 120GB Vertex 3 SATA 6Gb/s 2.5-Inch Performance Solid State Drive, and a ASUS P8Z68 DELUXE.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are amazing!  I never used to like classical music, but I sure do now!  The beautiful instrumental combinations are just stunning.  Very relaxing to listen to!
B000YHE4AG|5.0|I'm not a Will Ferrell fan but I LOVE this movie.<br />Worth watching this time of year, every year!<br />Classic.
B002V091IO|5.0|I saw the movie many years ago and decided to read the book recently.  Very well written and an interesting story.
B005OGYH90|5.0|If you're a fan of Slash like myself, you must have. I have most of his stuff from his solo carreer, Snakepit and VR Era, special fan packs, guitars, signature pick-ups & pedals, books...you name it.<br />Great concert. I had the chance to meet him after the concerts in Rio de Janeiro.<br /><br />Just buy it!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Very Very Refreshing. I accidentally bumped into their Desert Symphony song on youtube when it was used for an (anti) iphone spoof video .. and boy that was a lucky find. They are have absolutely brilliant covers and original music. Me and my 7 year daughter enjoy listening them every week.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is uplifting, stirring, beautiful music made by guys with great talent and a brilliant sense of humour. Well done, Piano Guys.
0375851569|5.0|Books for grandchildren..great beginner books.  My kids loved them when they were small.  Still have them but very worn..4 kids can be hard on books.
1400069181|5.0|I don't own a pair of TOMS. My wife owns several pairs, but TOMS are not really my style. Despite my lack of interest in shoe design, I have grown fond of the mission and passion of TOMS.<br /><br />I was in college when I first heard about TOMS shoes. Popping out of nowhere were these young men and women who could not stop talking about these relatively simple shoes and the story that accompanies them. At first I was rather indifferent to the TOMS shoes story. I chalked this company as another manifestation of slacktivism: people buying shoes in the name of helping others but in the end they just like wearing a fashionable shoe.<br /><br />Once a girl told me that buying a pair of TOMS was the right thing to do - even though I did not need another pair of shoes. I told her I could donate the money instead, in which she replied, \\"But why do that?\\" I continued to mention that TOMS is not a charity but a for-profit company, to which she just left me alone.<br /><br />At this point you probably think I am anti-TOMS but I am not. I truly believe that the business model created by TOMS founder Blake Mycoskie could be the redeemer of capitalism. In this book, Mycoskie walks through the steps and missteps, and the joy and challenges of starting something that really makes a difference.<br /><br />Mycoskie spent many years as an entrepreneur looking for the next big thing that will make him wealthy. What he inadvertently found was a calling to something much higher. TOMS is a for-profit company because he found that model much easier to work with. Non-profits rely completely on the whim of donors. The idea for TOMS came after he met a woman in Argentina trying to run a non-profit shoe drive that didn't have enough shoes.<br />I highly recommend this book, especially to college students who are globally-minded who want to make a difference in the world. You don't have to travel to the other side of the globe to make a difference. You don't need all the know-how to be successful. You don't need all the resources immediately. You just need to start it and you need to start it now.ful. You don't need all the resources immediately. You just need to start it and you need to start it now.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|The author invites you to become a part of the story, feeling the rain,the excitement of the race, and all the joy and sorrow. I will recommend this book to all of my friends. Although I read it on my Kindle, it's one of those books that you have to buy and keep on your bookshelf to savor and share with family and friends.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First let me begin by saying I am a chick lit reader, so my knowledge on intellectual subjects such as writing and what may or may not constitute as historic and classic literature is about a zero.  Having said that, I do appreciate a well written novel that takes the reader into the depths of the characters souls.  That's what I think Gillian Flynn does with Gone Girl.  You feel so connected to the characters.  You love and hate them at the same time.  I felt so affected by these characters as I was getting more and more into the story, which to me, makes for a well written novel worth reading.<br /><br />As for the story itself, I thought the twist and turns kept the story interesting and made me want to keep reading. I don't want to give too much away, as most people do with reviews, because you shouldn't enter the story with a predisposition towards any part of the book.  What's the fun in that?<br /><br />Anyways - I highly recommend this book if you are looking for a nice, juicy read.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Enjoyed it end to end and it is a part of my rainy day Dexter Marathon collection. There is nothing Dexter can do wrong...and this series was one of the best
B002MFX0RQ|5.0|Harvey has always been one of my favorite movies. It has such heart, Jimmy Stewart is so wonderful in this movie and it always makes me smile.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|Interesting movie...not really much of a plot, but it's fun to watch Meryl and Tommy Lee.  Steve Carroll provides excellent support as well.  The couple, married 31 years, find themselves seeking help from &#34;intensive marital counseling&#34; and of course Tommy Lee would rather be anywhere but there.  I wish there had been more back story.  Can't believe that one week would change 31 years of behavior, and Meryl's character is so timid that it's hard to imagine she would really act this way.  Enjoy it for what it is!
B005VTGB0S|2.0|The cover is nice enough, and the adjustable stand works perfectly - my main reason for buying it.  However it does not turn the iPad on and off when opened/closed.  I am unhappy with the tabs that hold the ipad in place.  The iPad is not secure and my kids are constantly taking this cover off.  The previous cover I was using holds the iPad in much more securely and the kids left it alone.  I bought this one because my old one does not stay put when using it adjustable stand.  Not great for the price.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical about the book at first reading all the bad review. But lucky me I just went with my instinct and bought it. It was the best thing ever. I immediately fell in love with Christian and Ana.although the book is mostly about the sexual pleasures. I read between the lines and found the true meaning of love. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good romantic steamy and hot hot read.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I read this book and immediately stopped eating wheat.  It has been three months and I feel great.  This has been a life changing event.  Thank you, Dr. Davis!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 10 year old loves this game...I'll admit, I do too.  It is a fun game and made well.  Would definitely recommend it.
B000002AQQ|5.0|While you might of seen and the movie and loved it.  Did you pay close attention to the music.  I didn't.  This CD i can listen to every day.  It is a must buy for those who lived in the 60's to 70's!!!!
B000K8EQ5W|3.0|Cute idea & certainly not a bad movie, but how their relationship develops is unbelievable.  But the movie does a good job of not making the time travel letters cheesy.
0307887960|5.0|Get the book and get started you won't be sorry!<br />Lost 7.5 lbs in phase one and currently in phase two.  It works and you aren't hungry.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is pretty fun and gets more challenging as you complete each level.  It is an enjoyable little time waster.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I had seen the movie and liked the music in it. I was happy to find out that every song on this CD is excellent. It's my new favorite.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is a must have for romance lovers!!!  I have read the first and second books. I couldn't put either one down. If you get the o e you should go ahead and buy the second. Curl up on a cold day when the hubby and kids are gone and fall in love.
B000HKW7E0|4.0|So I was probably the last person in America who had never seen this movie before.  It was enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for an amusing holiday film.
B005LAIGZU|4.0|Borderline terrible acting, but I cannot expect SEALs to be oscar worthy actors.  That being said, I loved this movie.  Great story, great action.  I am former military and have worked in the Special Ops community so I hold a special place in my heart for these guys.  Worth watching if you like military action flicks.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|After several decades of watching episodes of Fawlty Towers, it still tickles the funny bone.  We initially recorded episodes on our DVD player, then bought the DVD series.  Now it is available on CD and we needed to update our collection.  Too funny not to watch!<br /><br />We think this is the greatest comedy series EVER!  John Cleese at his finest!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was pleaseny surprised!!  It does pick up right where it left off so you may want to refresh your memory. I have enjoyed both these books can't wait for the third !!!!
B000I9TY4G|5.0|Ok, you REALLY need to see the series before you watch this movie...but it was the best thing Joss Whedon ever created, so  you are missing out on an excellent series if you haven't!!  This movie was a perfect conclusion to a really outstanding show.  I loved the series (you can probably tell) and this movie helped tie most everything together.  Even if you never watched a single episode, you can still appreciate this movie on it's own as a great story with some incredible characters.  I have only scratched the surface of the extras included on the Blu-Ray, but they are really cool to a fan like me.  BROWN COATS UNITE!!!  BUY THIS MOVIE!!!
B008XX6J4C|3.0|This is so pleasant to listen to!  What a way to wrap gifts or bake cookies to, it will make the madness of the moment go away!  Just a relaxing time!
B002MEW7YY|5.0|During the past five years of attending the Live from the Met Operas at my local theater complex, this has remained my very favorite, only next to Madame Butterfly.<br /><br />Beautiful, soul-wrenching, and took my breath away!  I had to own it for myself.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|For those who have never listened to the piano guys I suggest you start! They make some amazing music that re inspired my own interest in music!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is read in just a couple of hours. Read it on outgoing and return flights.<br /><br />Thank God for our soldiers
B0081JDMUW|5.0|This album along with his Live In London are essentials. If you like blues, jazz, JJ Cale, Clapton & ZZ Top you're gonna love this amazing, passionate artist. Unbelievable talent!
B0013V33DG|5.0|During the past five years of attending the Live from the Met Operas at my local theater complex, this has remained among my very favorite.  Natalie Dessay's performance is totally charming and delightful.  This one EVERYONE would enjoy, even young adults and children.<br /><br />I had to own it for myself.
0756697875|5.0|My 6 year old will love this book.<br />He's into everything lego batman<br />can't wait to give it for Christmas.
B008LV05EG|4.0|I enjoyed listening to Ora. Worth the money.  I am waiting for Rita Ora to release an album in America now.
B00899E5B4|5.0|A long overdue project from this Icon of American music. He's still got what it takes & has a clear message to his old & new listeners. Life has purpose & never give up hope. This album really rocks in a super cool way. Thanks Joe! Bring on some more.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|The story continues but it drags. I have read everything Follet has written and this is probably my least favorite. I am still slugging through it, I am half way through and hope it picks up. I would still recommend it though. His writing is stellar, it is just that the story is very slow moving with very little action,.
B006XBSC8C|4.0|Great songs but was glad I did not get the explicit copy. Songs are catchy. Stay with you in your head for a long time.
B0049985XW|5.0|I can't think of a major star at this point who was as willing to get as down and dirty as Bogart in this cautionary tale.  Even coming up through the movie ranks as the heavy as he did, he reaches for rockier bottom here and gets there brilliantly in the hands of John Huston and a great script.  Frothing at the mouth with paranoia and greed, it's a beautiful thing.  Walter Huston practically runs away with the film but Bogey gets the gold.  65 (!) years on this is a great movie.  Anyone who has seen it knows of its salty charms, those who haven't will not be dissapointed.
0375842209|5.0|What an excellent format for a book, and an excellent view of life during the Holocaust.  It's a &#34;must read&#34; for all ages, junior high age to great-grandparent age.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book sucked me in from the first word to the last. A great sophomore book for E L James
159420411X|5.0|A readable approach to a very important non intutional task: forcasting. Nate is known for his analysis of poll data, but his book covers many more applications of forecasting.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE this music. My 12 year old daughter LOVES this music. The Piano Guys play with such passion and originality. They take the classics and mix them with newer sounds in such a way that you see the beauty in both genres. I am continually amazed at what they come up with and am always waiting for a new song to be released. Do yourself a favor and bring joy into your life by purchasing their music.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|SImple - this is a great series. Get the DVD so you can watch a few in a row. Great writing and acting.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This is a great read. it brings this time a live. I am only to Lincoln being elected and forming his cabinet.  I wish for more time to read.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|When I saw the preview scenes for this film, I was pretty sure those scenes were the best scenes in the film and I was right, somewhat. However, the film was a good one to see anyway. This is a cute, feel good film. All the actors give great performances. When I saw the cast list, I feared that it would be one of those films that had a great cast but wasn't worth watching. This isn't true with this one. I'm so glad I was wrong. I liked this film. It wasn't as funny, as I thought it would be, but I liked it anyway. It touched me. Overall, I would recommend it as a film worthy to view, if just for one time. I think I'll be purchasing this film for my video library.
B0009HAHD4|5.0|Best replacement for the money! Same quality as orginal equipment. I bought two to keep a spare handy just in case.
B003DS3GC0|5.0|This is a guy film.  The stars' performances were what drew me to the film to begin with.  Not a story that I would sit the whole family down to watch.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Friends at work got me started with Pinterest- what a great place to post and collect all my favorite things! as well as the ability to follow my favorite sites and people!
B004SIP71M|5.0|First off, I didn't know whether or not I was going to like this film, but it sounded too interesting to just ignore. Thus, I rented it. It is a character study: well done. It takes place in a middle-class neighborhood in the Bronx, New York in 1964. The setting is a Catholic school and church. It is an interesting film with strong performances by everyone involved. An old school nun butts heads with a modern minded priest. Meryl Streep does an excellent job as the stern nun prinicipal from the \\"old school\\". Bravo. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Ms. Adams and Ms. Davis also does a fine job. Ms. Davis' role was small, but compelling.<br />This film does a great job of casting doubt on whether or not the priest, Father Flynn is a pedophile and will the nun, Sister Aloysius get him for it. It is interesting to see how human these characters are, and watch as one crosses the line in order to prove their point.<br />I don't want to give away anything, which is the reason for the brief review. All in all, this is a film worthy of your time to view.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|Got for a birthday present, my 6 year old loves it. It is creepy, fun and funky. Great deal too!
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf is a Christmas classic and required viewing if you want to laugh away the holiday stresses. Highly recommended by me!!
B008M87GJK|4.0|This kindle app is easy to navigate in addition to being a good news source. I'm glad I have it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a beautifully written book.  Very interesting.  Pi is unforgetable.  I still can't decide which ending is true.  For very discerning readers.
B008Y2VTIS|5.0|What can I say about Boardwalk Empire.  Each season gets better and better.  One of the best series that I love watching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very fun game that you can pick up at anytime and play.  Very nice distraction while waiting for people.
B007ZTN07O|1.0|This is a scam please dont make the same mistake i made do not buy this app.<br />it not does not work. be warned.
B000A7DVR2|5.0|Truly, this is one of the best movies ever made.  That's what my rating is meant to indicate. I don't know about this specific edition, because they seem to release a new edition every couple of years. I just went for a cheap one.
B00574PQDU|3.0|It was fun and interesting concept. A little hokey at times. I liked it but not a great movie, just a nice ez evening.
B008NMT684|5.0|I was letting my 2 1/2 year old play the trial version of this on my Kindle Fire, and he ended up buying the full version BY HIMSELF. Best $2 I've ever spent. Keeps him entertained a lot longer than expected. I helped him with each puzzle the first 2-3 times, and he's now able to do every single one by himself. He still wants to do these puzzle every other day or so on average, and we've had this for about a month or two.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I did value DeMille's previous books but this is bad<br />About 60% of the writing is just 'rambling', like trying to fill pages. Plus non stop 'smart Alec' comments that gets boring.<br />I would not recommend it to my friends.<br />Sorry Nelson...
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|CLEAR, EASY TO READ AND USE - Downloaded directly to my kindle. Handy to have with me. I would reccomend.
B008Y6WO88|3.0|There was good action in the movie but things story line.  What do you really expect though?  It was good for the money.
B003EYVXTG|3.0|After reading the reviews I thought the movie would be better than it actually was. One problem was the sound. As other reviewers noted, there is a lot of mumbling going on and you don't understand what the characters said. You cannot help but have admiration for the main character, who is the mainstay of her family, with the father missing and the mother sick. The movie is slow and also depressing. Despite this, the acting is good and the cinematography captures the desolate landscape of the wintry ozarks to perfection. Not the movie I would watch twice, though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Best Trilogy I've read in years!!<br />I highly recommend it to people who enjoy love stories with some drama. Enjoy!!!!
B003L77GG0|5.0|They did a good job putting together the last season.  Sad to see it end.  It was a lot better than season 9.
B003719G40|5.0|Animal is a on going story which I enjoy reading. This book is a page turner I have to slow myself down when reading about him or nothing will get done.It's not just Animal all of K\\"wan books keep you in the moment. I'm waiting on the next book now! K'Wan is a wonderful and gifted writer.[[ASIN:1936399253 Animal]
B008XX6J4C|5.0|on of the best music duo's i have ever heard. my favorite song by them is Cello Wars. pure genius. id buy it ten times if i could.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|I ordered this dvd as a Christmas Eve gift. I knew it was a Widescreen dvd but I didnt know it was a two disc with excellent bonus footage. I will buy from this seller again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just absolutely loved the ending! Keeps you on the suspense and makes you thrive for more. I'm definitely going to start up on the last book today.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|If you like Rod Stewart (I do) you'll like the first 10 songs, Nice Christmas music in Rod's unique style. The last 3 songs are traditional Christmas tunes that, well, charitably, Rod's style does just no do justice to.<br /><br />All-in-all, I'd highly recommend this album.
B007V65R54|4.0|There's no question Nate Silver is bright.  Seeing him on live interviews, I found that his ability to summarize large, complex subject matter into concise, understandable information was remarkable.  Reading his book, I was impressed with the main points that predictions by their nature are difficult, and the more sure someone seems about their precidtion, or forcibly states their case, the more caution should be taken in acting on that prediction.<br /><br />His discipleship of the Bayesian approach is made clear: a better way to predict because it takes into account prior assumptions and post-event data.  Expressing predictions with probablities rather than a yes/no is also a good practice to follow.  His observations on the stock market are fascinating, especially with the idea that no one can beat the marked long-term without insider info (not even congressman).<br /><br />An interesting read and worth buying.  Silver does repeat himself a bit and ramble in places, but there's always a new and interesting section around the corner.
B000005RS1|5.0|fantastic perfect addition to any Fish or Marillion fan. Had these on vinyl much much better on compact disc. Thanks
B007THA4FI|3.0|The difficulty is all the British references and verbage.  The plot is somewhat slow in developing.  Having read all the Harry Potter books I can say this is not page turner material.
0812992784|5.0|The book arrived as scheduled.  And, it is wonderful; we both enjoyed it.  This will be read several times.  It  is highly recommended.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|This compilation is excellent.  The inclusion of the illustrations is key to any Dickens reprint or collection, and this one has them all.  I also have enjoyed reading the critical reviews by Dicken's contemporaries - not everyone was a fan.  It reminded me of any modern pop-icon who just by the fact of being so popular find themselves under fire by more &#34;serious&#34; intellectuals.<br /><br />There are other works included that were not mainstream, along with biographies, along with, well, a ton!  Having this genius's life works and so much related content about him all on one slim, ergonomic device like my Kindle Fire is a dream come true.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Some of the most talented musicians on the scene.  Their mashups are creative and powerful, respectful to the sources while taking them to new heights.  Masterpieces.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Absolutely love this album.  Great music that always makes me feel happy.  I particularly love what they did with \\"Peponi,\\" \\"Beethoven's 5 Secrets,\\" and \\"The Cello Song.\\"
B0000024JN|5.0|I am not really a Rap fan I really only listen to Heavy Metal but I had to have this again. Classic album from when I was in High School. Gotta love this one.<br />As usual Amazon was very fast with the shipping and it arrived early and in perfect condition!
B005HSL626|5.0|Sometimes it's just good to have a game that you don't have to think about.  Fair warning--it's somewhat addicting though.
B009GEDP26|5.0|We've been following Castle from the beginning, based on a recommendation from our kids. The show itself is great. The characters are well developed, and it has just the right mix of humor and drama with mysteries you try to figure out. The acting is great, and it's overall &#34;fun&#34;. Not too deep, but a great way to spend an evening.
0312323859|5.0|The book I ordered was the second in a series, and the estimated arrival date for this book was December 10-24th and it arrived right on the tenth! The first book in the series which I bought from a different vendor was supposed to arrive on december 4th through the 19th, and still has not arrived. Needless to say I will be doing all my ordering through these guys from now on!
B003EY7JH6|3.0|Here's how I review. No synopsis, no narrative. Just get to how I was introduced to the book, what I liked and didn't like and maybe some spoilers. Enjoy!<br /><br />I was introduced to this book through a youtube broadcast that said this was one of the best sci-fi series of all time.  I heard that there were essentially two ways to read through the series: by publish date or chronological.  I decided to read through them chronologically.  Unfortunately, about a month has passed since I have read this book.  So my review will be short and not as specific as I would otherwise like.<br /><br />::: Things I liked :::<br />-I liked the different cultures and the concept of predicting the future through mathematics.<br />-I liked Seldon, Dors, Hummin amongst other characters<br /><br />:::Things I didn't like:::<br />-[ ***spoiler*** I was able to call that Hummin was a robot from his first encounter with Seldon. The same went for Dors.  However, this didn't really ruin the book for me. Rather, it just made it a tad predictable ***spoiler ***]<br /><br />Overall I really liked this book and am interested in reading the rest of the series. I put it down for a while because I wanted to explore a few other books at the time.  I plan to read them chronologically and list future reviews right here on amazon.com.  Stay tuned.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've been looking for a cross-platform rich text editor with cloud sync for easy access from multiple devices. I've found my answer in Evernote. The company regularly updates the app and there is a vibrant community for support. I have integrated Evernote into my daily workflow for both work and personal task management using Secret Weapon's flavor of Get Things Done. The Outlook integration has made data collection very effortless. Great app! I've already upgraded to Premium.
B004I11VZA|5.0|Easily among the Top 10 martial arts movies of all time. Action and spiritual triumph. A must see, highly recommended.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I got this movie really fast. It was the same price as the regular store. i got it for an xmas gift and got it without hassiling with going out to the regular store!
B0072OFOM6|4.0|If you are a Spartacus fan like me you might be a little disappointed in this installment of the series. It is not as good as the first season, or the mini-season. However, it is still Spartacus, and is full of the gruesome action we have come to expect from the series. I don't mind the &#34;love&#34; scenes (if you know what I mean) in the series that much, but in this season they went way overboard on some of the scenes.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I resisted reading this series, since I understood that the target audience was young adults, so I thought it might be trivial.  Also wondered if it would hold my interest with the dark theme.  I am glad I relented to the recommendation of a fellow avid reader!  The series pulled me in right from the beginning and posed many philosophical questions regarding human interaction/ government power/ revolution of the masses/ trust/ betrayal and rebuilding.  Definitely recommend the series for book club discussions!
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|There is a round sticker on the front of the shrink wrapped CD that says the song \\"Fade Into You,\\" only the best song of the season (imo), is on this CD.  Just so you know ... it's not.  And it should have been.  What gives?  (Wonder if song rights were pulled at the last minute?)<br /><br />Other than that (which is a major one to me .. the song should have been included), it's a good CD.<br /><br />Post T-Bone Burnett Post:  Thank you so much for making it right.  You didn't have to do it ... but I so appreciate that you did.  YOU are the reason the music is so good on the show.  You're gift of song selection has never been more apparent than on this project.  The artists are fantastic, but it all starts with great material.  You, sir, are the master at finding good material.  Hats off to you!!

0684824906|5.0|A long read, but difficult to put down.  The research makes one seem as though thery are there.  You get to know Lincoln & the turmoil of the time period.  Highly recommended; the kind of book that educates, informs, is imaginative and puts things in perspective!

B0092MKFIY|2.0|radioactive is the only song worth listening to on this entire album.<br /><br />alternative rock or alternative pop?<br />there's nothing rock about this band. this is the kind of music that plays on disney soundtracks.<br /><br />i'm not hating, i'm just sayin'<br /><br />still loving radioactive though, worth a 2 out of 5 stars for that

B0095GZDMK|1.0|This was the first Murakami book I ever read, and apparently it is not a good one to start with if you're unfamiliar with the author.<br />It started out pretty good and it had me intrigued for a while, but near the end things started to fall apart.<br /><br />The idea of a 'parallel dimension/world' and I use the term loosely here because it's never actually confirmed that this was a parallel world. Many ideas, such as the \\"Little People\\" was never quite fully developed. They are entities that are manipulating humans, and that's as far as he gets into anything really deep about them. The world has 2 moons, but nothing is ever explained about how exactly this comes to be. The book was VERY detailed for just about everything, except what it NEEDED to be detailed about.  And we're talking about a 900+ page book, so needless to say I was very disappointed with the ending. A lot of questions were left unanswered and a lot of assumptions has to be made on the part of the reader as to what the author was actually trying to say.

B009WO7NQO|5.0|I love star wars.  Han Solo yells while he shoots...is hilarious.  All the scenes are great.  If you love star wars and angry birds, you have to play it.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Watched this initially on Netflix, assuming it was going to be another dreadful D or C+ movie. Boy, were we wrong! This easily became a cult classic for us and we use the one-liners every day in conversation. I mail this DVD to every single deployed military friend that I have. The actors are believable and the plot is unique. Never judge a DVD by its cover!!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|While the story may seem rather painful to some, it demonstrates how the human spirit can overcome adversity, the will to live, and that love can conquer over a lifetime of pain and mistreatment.  Forgiveness is another big lesson within this story, and the concept of the language flowers bring to life is very intriguing.
B007JRU2UK|2.0|I did not like George Clooney in this role. The movie was boring too. I didn't even finish watching it.

B000T45C32|4.0|Trying to find a good movie now days is kind of hard, so many of then is a waste of time. This one I wasn't so sure about either but I found it to have a good story line and it kept me interested. It had a good ending to it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys do an impressive job of creating a full sound, with a lot of flair with whatever music they select.  They apply a modern beat to classics and use modern computer methods to provide a very entertaining presentation of very old compositions.  The video portions are cleaverly staged to complement the music, as well as utilizing natural surroundings.  I am a subscriber on YouTube, and look forward to their newest works as they release them.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|A good premise hurt by being eighty pages too long.  Detective Corey´s incessant wisecracks also detracted from the story. I did enjoy the new characters introduced into John Corey´s world.
B002BCNK1Q|3.0|I love Clint Eastwood and am kind of sorry to see him playing old roles now.  Wish he could stay young.  But he played his typical tough and grouchy man in this movie which I think is his namsake.  But it was a nice movie.
141659521X|4.0|neither book lived up to my expectations. Aquestion of Identity was too long with too little of the Serailer family in it. The Last man was repitious and I skipped a lot of the torture etc. I will have to find a better way of vetting books before I buy them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the first book.  Second book I thought was okay.  Definitely a middle child book.  It could have been that I was getting a little overcooked on the explicit details.  So, I waited several months before reading Freed and I am glad I did.  I definitely enjoyed it and loved the ending.
B008A1NSTG|3.0|It's a nice story but was kind of boring. I know they were probably trying to stick to the true story but it needed something to liven it up a bit.
1423140605|5.0|Really good book. Finally, annabeth's and Percy got back together! It's one of my favorite books that I have read including the maximum ride series, the hunger games, matched, and the Percy Jackson series!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|As with many book series, book 2 and 3 seem more like part 1 and 2.  But I loved the Mockingjay.  The ending was perfect.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely love listening to the piano guys! Their music helps me no matter what mood I am in. My daughter who is 2 loves rocking out to their songs. We play them on Sunday mornings to help set a more somber mood as well. And just recently, a dear friend of mine lost her sweet little baby boy and the piano guys music was what helped them cope. They played all Piano Guys music for the service and it was beautiful. Thank you for such great music!

034580404X|1.0|Normally I don't buy in to romance novels or \\"girly\\" type fiction but when SNL made fun of it I thought it was worth at least browsing through because it might be funny. What I got was a book filled with horrible writing, misconceptions, and dangerous behavior. This should come with its own warning label - DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME! But, you know, what can you expect from Twilight fanfiction?<br /><br />Brava to ms. james for staying with ms. meyer's original male trends of misogyny and abusive behavior. And to ms. meyer's idea of having a singularly unrealistic and outright -stupid- female lead that blindly follows her controlling jerk of a boyfriend straight into hell never questioning if this is worth the cost. Of course it is! She's \\"in love.\\" Oh, right, I forgot underneath the crippling BS. She's in love and wants to make him a kinder, gentler Mr. Grey while he just wants her to be his slave. This sounds healthy, doesn't it? He even stalks and bullies her and she laughs it off in the way of a 50's housewife on tv. \\"oh you!\\"<br /><br />This author is clearly confused about the concept of love and how it relates to real life. ms. james must be very unfulfilled to think this sort of dependency and delusion is something worthy of sharing with the world. Literature should inspire one to be better, not worse. Likewise, I think anyone that clings to it is likewise unfulfilled and should spend more time opening up about their desires than staying closeted by this tripe.<br /><br />As a member of the BDSM community for nearly 10 years of my life I was horrified by not only the abominable prose but by the implications of ms. james that Christian was only into bondage because he had issues and possibly a mental defect of some sort. As someone who is both sadistic to a degree and masochistic I have to protest that there is nothing wrong with my mental faculties and many I have met along my journey have nothing wrong with their mentality, either. We're not all aloof controlsfreaks. Submissives are not door mats. They can be perfectly assertive in every aspect of their lives, unlike our dear female lead. (I refuse to call her a heroine)<br /><br />And, again, I cannot stress this enough - DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME. A lot of the things Christian does are not only dangerous but seem to not even have Anastasia's health in mind. It's like he doesn't even care how she comes through this. Bondage is not just tying someone up to get your kicks. There are risks involved and should be done with more care than anything Christian showed. Clearly ms. james is not familiar with these practices and I would encourage her to stick to writing what she knows in the future.<br /><br />There is nothing about this trilogy that is even remotely realistic. Lovers do not climax together as often as the couple in question seems to. The prose is horrible and made me laugh in places so hard I could not actually focus on the main intent of the scene because I kept erupting in giggles.<br /><br />Please don't misunderstand me. I am all for sexual revitalization and trying new things. I encourage couples to talk about their fantasies and try to keep that elusive spark in their relationships so long as it's done with consideration and respect. I encourage people that might be into BDSM to talk about it and to engage that curiosity in a careful and safe manner. What I don't enjoy are the hundreds of unrealistic, dangerous, and insulting things found in this crapshack of a book.

B009KHDT0C|5.0|All you fans of the original series of Dark Shadows will enjoy this continuing saga of the Collins family.  Johnny Depp makes an awesome and quite comical Barnabas. The only downers were that Dr. Julia was not as I remembered her although the new Julia was amusing. One original character left out was Quentin and he was one of my favorites. All in all I enjoyed the flick.
B004WR125O|4.0|- Operating on Onkyo Home System HT-S9400THX  - Concrete apartment  - Distance between AV receiver to router is 5 metres (with 2 concrete walls in between)    We wanted to play our music on our iPhone and Nexus phones, but our router is too far for us to connect via LAN. We decided to go with the Onkyo adapter since we are not sure if the Belkin N300 will work with our AV receiver.    When we initially plugged the adapter into the USB port of the receiver, it did not connect to our router. We found out quickly that we have to update the firmware [...]. Once we updated the firmware, the manual setup was pretty straight forward. We are now able to play music wirelessly from our phones and tablet.    Our router is not too far away, but the adapter's signal strength is only 54% (hence, minus 2 stars).

0071390111|5.0|I purchased the 4th edition of Principles of Neural Science back in 2001, when I was studying at McGill in cognitive science and neuroscience. This was the most useful introduction on the subject matter of neuroscience, and its amazing breadth and depth was sufficient to cover all the basics and find references for further readings on specific topics.<br /><br />I used it extensively when I started my PhD in cognitive science at Carleton University and had a challenging, full-year course in behavioral neuroscience. The fourth edition has aged well as an introduction, but the neuroscience community was longing for an update in a field which is less forgiving about years-old sources. It is sad that it took 12 years (!) for an update, but what an update it is!<br /><br />The 5th edition clocks at 350 additional pages approximately, and while the original material has been preserved where it is required, it *has been updated*. Sections on cognitive processes and behavioral features have been added, more details on aging and neuropathologies/lesions, and of course, the artwork is wonderful. It is slightly more pedagogically-oriented, which was not even a shortcoming in the previous edition. Awesome updates on the reference material to cover the work between 2000 and 2008-ish (I know, it's not up to 2012, but that's how editing and publishing works, viz., slowly).<br /><br />The icing on the cake is the new computational neuroscience stuff, which is to me invaluable, considering that I study cognitive science in general, and computational cognitive modeling in particular. Add appendices on the theory of neural wiring/engineering and computational modelling, and this is a good A+.<br /><br />I might be biased, since I wanted this book to be awesome, but hey, they did it again.<br /><br />Only gripe: at 1760 pages in hardcover format, it's heavy as hell and anyone under 125 pounds will likely hurt their back though, so carry this book in a cart or something ;-)<br /><br />I wish there was an eBook format like epub or even pdf at an affordable price, at least for purchasers of the hardcover version! I would *love* to have this book on my iPad.wish there was an eBook format like epub or even pdf at an affordable price, at least for purchasers of the hardcover version!

B007TXN4TK|3.0|It's a cute app idea but it's not very responsive. A metronome at least at the beginning would be nice. The keys are too small as well. Also, on a Kindle Fire, you cannot hit three key chords so you lose points by default. A fix would be welcomed.

I will update later if my friend gives me feedback.

0525952926|5.0|Obviously I haven't read all of the reviews, but I hadn't noticed anyone  stating similarities to \\"Winds of War\\" and its sequel \\"War and Remembrance\\". Also the brief discussion of the Berlin Airlift reminds me also of Uris's classic \\"Armageddon\\". (Though  the start of the Airlift in \\"Winter..\\" was greatly simplified.)<br />If you liked \\"Winds of War\\" and its sequel I think you will also like \\"Winter of the World\\". Whereas \\"Winds..\\" featured the Navy and the Henry Family, \\"Winter...\\" features a much broader cast of characters and focuses on many different areas.<br />I cared about many of the Characters in this book. A lot of the characters made very correct and courageous choices.<br />Some of the one star reviews complained about the graphic sexual scenes. A number of Follet's books have a lot of sex in them. If you didn't like the sex in other Follet books why are you reading \\"Winter of the World\\"? Read it and enjoy!

B002LANLDK|2.0|I'm not much of a fan of the original, and not at all of the spinoffs or ripoffs. Fast and Furious was as entertaining as the original without the originality. I only watched it because it was broadcast. In the age of mma, Vin Diesel's tough guy machismo is comical rather than intimidating, and Walker's beta male as leading man style is an awkward phenomenon. An action movie will only ever be as good as it's protagonist is inspiring.<br /><br />There were a few scenes that were fun to watch, like the tunnel scene at the end, but the fun never lasted long. The only standout was the actor who played Braga, the main antagonist. This movie is summed up by the scene where Diesel and Walker say to each other, \\"You thinkin what I'm thinkin\\", referencing a plot revelation the audience saw well in advance. That is to say, \\"Fast and Furious\\" is essentially a collection of well-used action movie techniques stitched together unimpressively.
B009KHCT94|2.0|Tired and boring, sad story line. so close to being a cult classic but it in the end it fails! The ending credits show what would be realistic about how the world really is, beside that it is a pass.
B00A23MYCC|3.0|This movie was funny not as funny as I thought it would be as I am a Family Guy fan.<br />I thought the acting was not that good but could be due to the directing, maybe he should stick to cartoons.<br />Overall worth the watch.
B007MJSQSK|4.0|A well made family adventure with the feel of Indiana Jones and Speilberg's storytelling ability.<br /><br />The odd part about it was the lack of significant female characters which does seem to leave the viewing experience lacking.<br /><br />So 3.5 out of 5.

B005IQ39AY|4.0|Game graphics are good, touch responsiveness is good, physics are mediocre.<br />Good:<br />Graphics, music, no links to internet or appstore that I ran into. Gameplay was 7/10 but I am biased for the original.<br /><br />Bad:<br />Permissions require phone identity and open network sockets.  This is, as I saw to show you your score on the world rank after each game.  I have a hard time believing that over 170,000 people play it tho.... (Edit: someone else informed me it is on the playstation network with a high number of downloads)<br /><br />Overall it is a decent game and I won't be uninstalling it as of now.

1457514508|5.0|This book is an excellent debut novel in the black comedy/crime genre written by talented newcomer, Duncan Whitehead. The pages turn themselves (and are very dog-eared by the end!) in this quick-tempo satire of small-town snobbery, vicious female rivalry and macho male posturing within the white, middle-class enclave of Savannah,USA. The author writes with an observant eye, a wicked sense of humour and with more than a hint of misogyny. The novel begins dramatically with an anonymous male digging a grave in a suburban park, a most unlikely scenario for a contract killing. The main users of the park comprise The Gordonston Ladies' Dog Walking Club; all women who own dogs and who like to gossip, fuelled by cocktails. But this is no ordinary gathering of pooch-loving, frail old dears. These are humanoid Rottweilers with their own agenda and motivated by their own brand of discontent. Duncan Whitehead concentrates on examining the female psyche under stress, from the beautiful bubble-head, Kelly, to Heidi a Wagnerian xenophobe with a very old axe to grind. The final scene involving the latter, surrounded by her childhood memorabilia, is hilariously funny and worthy of Mel Brooks.<br />The hole having been dug, the author leaves us guessing about which character most deserves to fill it - and they all qualify. This is a female-only dog-walking club, where bitching is prevalent and in which it is expected that dog eats dog. The irony is that the men we meet are not worth fighting over, being a motley collection of frauds, wimps and opportunists: poor specimens when compared with the one outstanding hero Kurtze, a gifted writer, a public benefactor and urbane raconteur. His is the most deadly secret of them all and its revelation comes as an enormous shock.<br />Duncan Whitehead weaves and plaits the strands of his narrative into a satifying unity, keeping the reader straining at the leash and panting for more. There's plenty left for a sequel and the book would easily adapt into an exciting big screen film.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I stumbled upon The piano guys and their music by 'accident' and I was instantly reminded that music can be an experience and not just entertainment. This is music that will move you, send chills down your spine and tears down your cheeks. I wish they would give concerts outside of the US but until then I will make do with this album and hopefully more to come.

6305657947|5.0|I enjoyed this remake more than the original film.  The modernized version is MUCH better... MUCH more exciting,... MUCH more sexy to watch.
141694737X|4.0|Bought this for my 14-month old and she LOVES to lift the flaps, but a couple of them have ripped. Honestly, to me it's not very exciting and fairly short, but she seems to love it.

0671449028|2.0|My 14-month old daughter loves books, but for some reason she lost interest after two pages and hasn't picked it up since (in three months). Disappointing because I think it's cute, but for some reason it didn't hold her attention for more than a minute. The same is true with the other Boynton book Doggies. Her illustrations might be too subtle and busy for this age so we'll try again later.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|I downloaded this for my 3 1/2 year old daughter, and she has been very happy with it. That means I get around 20 minutes of quiet.... Which is the best Christmas gift I could ever get!<br /><br />Very accessible for young ones and very engaging as well!
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Very good movie and probaly true if ever you were stranded in the North-Alaska. I have heard of these trials when you are alone<br />or by yourself in the wilderness and animals do attack people-other animals. Not a movie for the young or faint at heart. Do see and know what life may be if you are alone.
B007WULJ5G|4.0|I read all the reviews about this movie being disturbing, shocking, sick, disgusting, so on and so on. I must admit, all those reviews only peaked my curiosity and they were all right! 'A Serbian Film' is all of the above but I also found the movie to be better than just a shock film (which it does not pretend to be anything else). In my opinion, I thought this was very well made film and the main actor who plays Milos, does a fantastic job! He captures the raw emotions from a loving family man to a drugged up porn actor who goes over the edge of insanity, all the way down to a man whos soul has been completely and totally broken. This film is disturbing to say the least but a good watch to satisfy ones curiosity.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|Great movie... allows you to use your imagination and keeps you entertained! Classic movie to add to your dvd collection
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I really like like this app. it works well and has a nice weather feature .I would recommend you make sure you have the volume turned up. . lol I forgot the first time.

CHECK OUT THE NEW 25th EDITION OF `TOLLEY'S CAPITAL ALLOWANCES'<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If you're a lawyer, or accountant, or other variety of tax advisor, this publication from Tolley's covers a subject area you've probably been crying out for.<br /><br />In fact, Tolley's assures us that requests from tax practitioners for a reference book covering this specific area of revenue law was the catalyst that led originally to the publication of this book.<br /><br />`There are few existing publications on the subject,' says `Accountancy'...`and none are as current or as comprehensive as this'.  The fact that this volume is now in its twenty-fifth edition attests to its enduring value and certainly its popularity.<br /><br />So, here in a single practical volume, of well over 500 pages, is the law and practice pertaining to capital allowances.  In this new edition you'll find the legislation and relevant case law, including the provisions of the Finance Act 2012 to 17 July 2012.<br /><br />There is a wealth of other information of course and much later material where relevant.  For example, this new edition includes the new rules relating to the claiming of allowances for fixtures in buildings and the first-year allowances for plant and machinery being used in certain assisted areas.<br /><br />In all there are five chapters on plant and machinery allowances, including new material on the transitional rules for reducing the rate of such allowances.  There is also a new chapter covering allowances for capital expenditure which are not formally capital allowances.<br /><br />Of course a wide range of other relevant subject areas is also covered, from renovation of business premises and flat conversion to mineral extraction and patents.  Above all, your attention is drawn to the two chapters on tax planning.  The two contributors here are each acknowledged experts in this field.  John Endacott, for example, is the Tolley's Taxation Awards 2012 \\"Tax Writer of the Year\\".<br /><br />Clearly written and logically organized, the book includes worked examples to illustrate key points, especially in problem areas.  There are extensive tables of cases and statutes for your further research and a useful index at the back.<br /><br />Also note the two appendices, one of which includes a comprehensive list of what may qualify as plant or machinery.  For those who pay tax, particularly in business, or for their professional advisers, acquiring this book should be regarded as a necessity.he two contributors here are each acknowledged experts in this field.

B0076DELIG|5.0|A typically great Michael Connelly mystery.  Harry Bosch has the same personal issues as do many average people and it's wonderful to see how Connelly develops the character.
B00887490Y|2.0|This movie starts off really good with it's spooky plot but midway through it nosedives and fizzles.  At the beginning I was expecting a scary sort of \\"Jeepers Creepers\\" type of movie but this film changed plots at least 3 times (I think) leaving me confused as hell! Was it scary? Yea. Well directed? Yes. Good storyline? HELL NO!!!  I checked and this film cost $18 million to make but only brought in a little more then 4.5 million. Can you say flopper? Sure you can!<br /><br />At first the \\"Tall Man\\" is this spectre sort of charachter who lives in the woods and abducts children yet by movies end was the Tall Man was just a myth to mask a...child trafficing operation?!?  Help me out, I'm confused!! The acting was good but this movie morphed itself into an off the cliff clunker! To the director -if you start on course STAY ON COURSE!! Dont bait and switch and jump plots all throughout the film!<br /><br />And to you greenie directors just out of film school let me address you with the following: If this is the future of horror movies then no thanks, I'll just keep watching the horror classics from the past!  And NO, please dont insult directors of old by butchering their work with a remake either...come up with your own ideas, or can you!?
B006LSZECO|4.0|After the big buildup I actually was expecting more. I did enjoy the book but a &#34;Top 5&#34;<br />book for me is one that I can't or don't want to stop reading. This was not one. Maybe<br />some of the reviews I read had me thinking I would be bowled over, it was good but not<br />great.
6305073341|1.0|This isn't a DVD.....they converted from VHS to DVD, but the picture quality is poor, and don't have a menu neither.<br />Bad choice!!!
B00AF6B22E|2.0|If you have any intention of seeing the movie Flight with Denzel Washington, I'll give you a heads-up. He put in a great performance, probably much better than he did in \\"Training Day\\", for which he won an Oscar, and definitely superior to the \\"phoned-in\\" performance on \\"Unstoppable\\", a totally not-believable train movie. (Please, \\"Runaway Train\\" was a million times better!) But..., and this is a BIG but...., Flight was not about airplanes, or particularly about a flight. It was about alcoholism and drug addiction. If you want to see Denzel get drunk over and over, snort line after line of coke, and smoke a bunch of joints, this is your flick. John Goodman plays his drug dealer, and Kelly Reilly, a really fine English actress, plays a heroin addict, cooking her goop in a spoon and injecting it in her arm, then passing out. Family fun. Language? Forget about letting the kids see it!<br /><br />I was terribly surprised. Denzel and Robert Zemeckis, of \\"Forest Gump\\" fame? I thought, it's gotta be good. I was expecting a movie more along the lines of \\"Flight Plan\\" with Jodie Foster. That movie was about a flight; \\"Flight\\" isn't. It's about drug abuse, lying, deceit, very bad, stupid behavior, and the inevitable decent to the bottom, where Denzel loses everything. He could just as easily have been a bus driver, a riverboat captain, a truck driver, or a cable car conductor. Anyway, it's not how you want to see Denzel, or remember him. Not a hero.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Elf has become a new holiday tradition in our family. Ferrell gives one of his better performances as Buddy the Elf.
B002BPRZU0|5.0|I must admit that my first impression of Joe Bonamassa was less than favorable.  The fact that he was a child prodigy prompted me to label him as overly technical and lacking in true feeling.  Boy has this album changed that opinion!  Joe really nails it on the head with this one.  His hard driving and soulful guitar playing, coupled with heartfelt lyrics, has made a believer out of me.  If you're shopping for your first Bonamassa album, this is the one for you!!!
B004X4R49Y|5.0|A moving tale. Both Rush and Firth do an excellent job. As always Helena Bonham Carter turns out an amazing performance as well; nice to see her not as an evil side-kick to some Tim Burton character.
B008JFC6F0|4.0|Kevin Parker is the main brain behind Australia's Tame Impala, and the band's debut album, 2010's \\"Innerspeaker\\", was quite the intruiging debut album. Now comes the second album.<br /><br />\\"Lonerism\\" (12 tracks; 52 min.) starts off with a nerversly drum-driven, high-energy \\"Be Above It\\", a fantastic track. It is followed by \\"Endors Toi\\", another all-out energy track. It isn't until track 3 \\"Apocalypse Dreams\\" that we start to get a real sense of where this album is going, less guitar-oriented than \\"Innerspeaker\\", even if the next track \\"Mind Mischief\\" actually finds guitars and drums very upfront. The album truly takes off with the next track \\"Music to Walk Home By\\", with synthesizers all over, a theme that would continue for most of the album. \\"Why Won't They Talk To Me\\" is in the same vein, and at this point I'm thinking that Tame Impala has become the (beautiful) bastard child of Film School-meets-The Secret Machines. Now we are into the heart of the album, with an outstanding lazy-feeling \\"Feels Like We Only Go Backwards\\", followed by an even greater \\"Keep on Lying\\", with a delicious 4 min. instrumental outro (with lots of sound-trickery overdubbed, and I mean that in the best of ways). It is one of my favorite tracks on here. It is followed by a guitar-heavy (and hard rock sounding) \\"Elephant\\" (1st single), which sounds out of place with the rest of the album, yet somehow it works great. The first 9 tracks are a prefect 5 stars. After that the album starts to falter a bit, we've had the best moments by then. The album should've closed with \\"Nothing That Has Happened So Far Has Been Anything We Could Control\\" but instead is followed by an unnessecary piano-based \\"Sun's Coming Up\\", but it's a minor quibble.<br /><br />In all, this album is one of the biggest (pleasant) surprises for me this year, and clearly one of the year's very best albums, period. Sure to make my \\"best of 2012\\" albums list, and very high at that. I can't wait to see this band in concert at some point! \\"Lonerism\\" is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />*UPDATE* New US tour dates have just been announced and these guys will be in Columbus in late March. Barring unforeseen circumstances, you can bet your last dollar that I will be there front and center.<br /><br />*UPDATE* (March '13) I saw these guys live this past weekend, and they put on a blazing show, simply outstanding. If you have a chance to see them live, DO NOT MISS THEM.some point! \\"Lonerism\\" is HIGHLY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!<br /><br />*UPDATE* New US tour dates have just been announced and these guys will be in Columbus in late March.

B003SI9WYG|5.0|One of Burton's best movies in my mind; a Halloween classic. Jack the Pumpkin King is a great lead character.
B008K9SG9K|4.0|Imagine Dragons is an indie-band out of Las Vegas, and on the basis of several well-received EPs, in particular the \\"Continued Silence\\" EP from early 2012, there has been a buzz building around this band. If you are unfamiliar with their sound, think the Killers-meet-Coldplay, as incomplete a comparison that may be. This is the band's debut full-length studio album.<br /><br />\\"Night Visions\\" (11 tracks; 44 min.) starts off with \\"Radioactive\\", one of the band's best songs, period (also one of 3 songs reappearing from the Continued Silence EP, along with \\"Demons\\" and \\"On Top of the World\\"). Even though this is the band's debut album, they seem to have one thing on their mind: to have a sound so big that it screams \\"arena-sized\\". Check out \\"It's Time\\" as a good example. \\"Demons\\" take a cue from latter day-Coldplay. \\"Amsterdam\\" is a more reflective tune (and NOT a cover of the Peter Bjorn & John track of the same name). \\"Hear Me\\" is a great track (it originally appeared on the \\"Hell & Silence\\" EP from 2010. \\"Bleeding Out\\" is a slowburner that builds to a massive song. It all works towards the epic album closer \\"Nothing Left to Say/Rocks\\".<br /><br />In all, \\"Night Visions\\" is a pleasant debut album, nothing more, nothing less. I have to say I am really surprised how much attention this album has been getting (including here on Amazon, closing in on 200 reviews already!). That said, I wouldn't mind checking out Imagine Dragons in concert at some point.
B00881VLCE|4.0|i love this app because i love puzzles. and i can get a quick puzzle fix when I don't have any floor jigsaw puzzles to do at home. plus my cat can't get to it and destroy it.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Great graphics although a little on the sinister side. Don't think this game would be good for youngsters; clowns aren't always good guys!!  Very user-friendly and the clue system was one of the best I've used. Absolutely loved it and am anxiously awaiting Alawar's next Kindle fire game.
B009E3EY38|5.0|I was amazed at how great this band from the seventies sounds. I thought for sure Plant had lost his voice, but no, he still sounds good.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I absoloutely loved Bruno Mars' debut album and thought it would be impossible for him to top it but my, I'm so happy to be wrong! There's such a variety of songs from different genre's and I just love his old-school sound. My favourites are 'Moonshine', 'Natalie', 'Locked out of heaven' and 'Gorilla'. Give it a listen cos there's something for everything.  Gonna be permanately stuck in my CD player for the next few months!  and I'm just gonna put it out there - there's no way he can top this! ;)
B0091LRZZW|5.0|Paul sings great, as expected. Beatle fan or not, everyone will love it. He deserves a grammy for this effort.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Steven and Jon are the most marvelous duo who give us 'mash-ups' of contemporary music with classical pieces. Their recent album is another example of their talent. I have enjoyed listening to this at home, traveling and sharing my joy with friends.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This season has been the most intense of all three seasons thus far.  The acting is superb and the storyline can literally go a millon differnt directions.  The creators of the show have done an outstanding job with this.  Please keep it going!!
B005IQ39AY|4.0|this game downloaded and functioned fine on my kindle. it reminds me a lot of a game on pogo - it has the same idea of special balls to be released and different layouts for each level - I enjoy the one on pogo and this one is a good copy (although easier) this is a good time filler as you can walk away and come back to it.
B005IQ39AY|3.0|There are plenty of these games available and unfortunately this one doesn't bring anything extraordinary to the tablet. The premise of the game is to connect three or more bubbles to eventually clear them all from the screen. You are occasionally given power-ups to help accomplish this task, such as a saw that goes through anything or a bomb that will blow up whatever it touches. Graphics are pretty good, but sounds/sound effects are just average. As others have mentioned, occasionally a bubble will just go through another one. Not a horrible game, but not a great one either.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are a fantastic group. They are doing a wonderful job of making classical music easy to listen to and entertaining for the masses.<br />Great Job guys! Keep it up!

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Everything Grisham writes is good reading, and The Racketeer is a good and easy read.  Our hero clevers himself out of prison, beats a sucker out of a fortune, makes love to a ravishing beauty and ends up happy on the last pages.  Who could ask for more?  And why would anyone rank it high as literature?

B006H3MIV8|1.0|The producers of this travesty should be ashamed . Some of the tracks are astoundingly bad .Perhaps 15 tracks are listenable without compelling skip .Most are so bad that one could easily find better renditions by amateurs on Youtube . Really , did the producers listen to this / Do any of them have previous knowledge of Dylan's music. At least the $ is going to Amnesty . But , it made me wonder if Dylan was behind the scenes , trying again to get people to leave him alone by allowing this dreck to be released .

B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a fun and interesting game. From working at a lemonade stand to building a city its a very good game.
B003O86FMW|5.0|THis book begins with a twist, and then upon sucking you in negotiates a series of overhangs, ledges and hairpin turns. I devoured it from beginning to end. Expect to left wanting, anticipating the outcome, only to be known in teh final book.<br /><br />An excellent read by a skilled, detail oriented artist with a pen!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This is a fresh new story line of drama, lust, and love. I couldn't put it down and cannot wait for the next installment. The only part that annoyed me were the typos in the ebook.  If it weren't for those I would have given 5 stars!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really enjoyed the book although I was able to predict most of the scenario outcomes throughout the book. There were a few unsuspected twists to keep my interest up to the final pages.<br /><br />The series has made me a fan of Suzanne Collins works, I look forward to reading more of her work.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I enjoy Stieg Larsson triology books.  I get lost in the characters because there are so many of them.  If I haven't read it for a little while and pick it up to read it again, it is hard to keep up with who is who.<br />But, the story is a good one and does keep your interest.

B00AM0W4UC|4.0|I have been a fan since i was a child watching a new hope in 1977.  But lets get real we all know that Ahoska has to die.  IF the markers of this series avoid that then they are Jabba the Hutt's waste.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The first time I watched a Piano Guys video on You Tube a year ago, I was completely mesmerized and immediately hooked!  These guys are unique, unlike any other performers out there with an amazing blend of modern contemporary songs with classical favorites. I have 3 daughters, ages 10, 9 and 8, and they all LOVE the Piano Guys, and are developing a love for classical music.  I agree 100% with this comment on You Tube:  \\"God called, He wants His hands back!\\"  These guys are that GOOD! I'm buying several CDs as Christmas presents!  The Piano Guys are simply awesome, amazing, destined for greatness and always inspiring us all to LOVE classical/contemporary music!
B0084U0IEG|5.0|Well written...no, amazingly well written. And fun. Surprising. Great background and tidy. No unfinished buisness. I would definately recomend this one. I was sad to leave it...
B008K8U13K|5.0|I think that just from looking at the reviews that their is a lot of cheap people. But come on its only 4 bucks and what does that get you?Post what you think about what I said?
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've followed The Piano Guys on YouTube for quite a while and we were already great fans. When we saw that they were coming out with a CD, we pre-ordered! The music is fantastic and the CD quickly became one of our favorites. Whenever we're in the car, my 7-yr-old son asks for it, on the rare occasion it's not already playing. This is a CD you can (and we do!) listen to over and over again - we never get tired of the songs. We need more Piano Guys!!
1891252089|4.0|Great Ashtanga Yoga book that runs through the Primary series and more.  I wish more books were spiral bound. It makes for easy read and practice manual.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this CD!!!  My favorite by far.  So glad I decided to get it.  The Piano Guys are so talented.  My kids even love listening to their music.
B0046A9MRW|4.0|Excellent book for a read on a journey. Considering the cost of the book, it would be worth every penny..
B00914JWSW|5.0|i love Barbra. Though there are a couple songs that she has recorded before, the rendition of them on this CD gives it a different sound. There are beautiful renditions of songs I've never heard her do that were sung by other artists. And there is a nice mixture of songs. If you're a fan you'll, love it.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|Let me start by saying I'm relatively new to Mastodon. I didn't discover them until about 6 or 7 months ago with \\"Leviathon.\\" After hearing that album I became hooked! I listened to \\"Blood Mountain\\", loved it! \\"Remission\\", awesome album! And then \\"Crack the Skye\\" and I have to say after listening to this album as many times as I have, it has become one of my favorite albums of all time. It's a HUGE, epic album. Both \\"The Czar\\" and \\"The Last Baron\\" stretch over 10 minutes. It's very proggy and brutal with huge meaty riffs, but not quite as brutal as \\"Remission\\" or \\"Leviathon\\". Clean vocals run throughout almost all of the album, expanding on what they did starting with \\"Leviathon.\\" While it is very heavy, it's also very mellow, every song oozes with emotion, probably Mastodon's most emotional album to date. When Brent's vocals come on in the song \\"Oblivion\\" I get goose bumps every time. I would say this is the best progressive metal album I've ever heard. This would be a great album for anyone new to Mastodon. I urge you to give this album a thorough listen, as well as their others. I hope to see these guys live soon!

0321885112|5.0|Mike Rohde has put together an excellent guide for beginner sketchnoters, no art degree required! Pick this up if you find yourself dozing off in meetings, lectures, presentations, or conferences, or you feel overwhelmed by all these cool ideas that disappear the day after the event. Sketchnoting might be what you need to pay attention and remember good stuff.<br /><br />Here's a one-page visual summary / sketchnote of the book:<br />[...]<br /><br />Enjoy!
0321885112|5.0|This book really is a joy. Beautifully illustrated and excellently written.<br /><br />Mike takes you on a great ride in to learning sketchnoting, something that will change your life.<br /><br />Highly recommended
B00AHSINKO|5.0|I enjoyed this very much.  It's therapy for older couples who have lost the sexual magic.  I don't think a younger audience could understand or relate to these problems.  I did get fed up with the holding back of Merle's character and the negativity of Tommy's character.  But then again, I just have to say what I need to say.  It's intense and cheap therapy.
B009VL28W2|5.0|What another great Metallica concert DVD. The World Magnetic Tour at it's best, in the round. The video and audio quality is top notch. The 5.1 sound mixing is probably one of the best, compared to others and the setlist is a Metallica fan's dream. Horsemen, Straw, Battery, Whiplash and everything in between, how could you go wrong! 5 out of 5. Pick this disk up immediately, you wont be disappointed!
B0091REZMW|1.0|This is more a money pit than a game. I am not a tech Guru, but have been around the block a few times, and this one is easy after you figure out that you pay your way through the game.
B000050HTO|4.0|Peter Paul Markin was restless, restless like he had never been before.  Just out of the military service (Army, `Nam, 1969-70), just out of a war marriage not made in heaven, just out of love with a woman he had met in Cambridge, just out of dough since his savings had been depleted to nil, just out of luck, good luck anyway since he got back to the \\"real world\\" he decided he had to drift, drift west into that good night. Drift west in search of that almost childlike belief in what he called the great blue-pink Great American West night. The night when he could rest his mind and his dreams out there maybe in some pacific coast cave around Big Sur, north to Mendocino, or some ghost chance thunder road.<br /><br />In 1971, however, the roads west, the main highways and back roads too, were clogged full of lonesome pilgrims seeking their own blue-pink nights. And so he found before he was long out of Boston where he started his trip that he was among kindred more often than not on the great hitchhike road dream brought by forbears like old okie hills Woody Guthrie and Lowell mill boy Jack Kerouac. So he walked roads, grabbed rides, got picked up for \\"vag\\" a couple times, went hobo jungle railroad tracks more than once , headed south a little to avoid the cold, then west landing just off  Los Angeles in sainted ghost-ridden Joshua Tree National Park on some wayward Volkswagen minibus explosion. He bit good-bye to those fellow-travelers who were heading south to Mexico and cheap, cheap everything and sun but mainly cheap and righteous herb (ganga, mary jane, sister, marijuana whatever you call it in your neighborhood).<br /><br />Carrying his life-line (and life's full possessions at just that moment) bed-roll knapsack combination he headed into the park. Walk some dusty stone-etched miles to one of the camping sites expecting to find some more kindred and stews against some hunger. Sundown was approaching as he fixed up his assigned site when he heard a loud blast of Bob Dylan's youth nation national anthem,  Like A Rolling Stone, coming from, coming from somewhere. Maybe it was the dust of the road, too many roads, maybe it was his time, maybe it was some tumbleweed passing by remembrance, but at first he could not fathom where such music would be coming from in the high desert.<br /><br />Then he saw it. Saw the biggest yellow school bus now all painted in the six hundred colors of psychedelia with a huge speaker mounted on its top and about sixteen crazed lunatics (although that information was only confirmed later) dancing in various conditions of  dress, and undress.  He approached, someone passed him a joint, another some cheap fine wine, and another pointed him to the fireplace stew broth. All without a word. Home, home among the rolling stones.
1452110581|5.0|This book is perfection.  The title was enough to catch my eye and guaranty that it came home to us.  With a name and cover like that I can honestly say that the to book met and exceeded my expectations.  Somewhat opposite of a romantic evening, but a truly enjoyable evening nonetheless, my husband and I took turns reading select poems out loud to each other as our three furry smittens unleashed their fury all around us (read: rabbit-kicking the snot out of that damn stuffed weiner dog toy, sitting on top of this book when ever the opportunity did or did not present itself, sitting in the middle of us on the couch to lick themselves... down there, visiting the litter box and then turning into crazy stampeding little ponies running amok all over the house before morphing into squirrels who could run across the vertical surfaces of the couches and chairs).  Yes, in a word, it was perfection.
1400069289|5.0|It is an amazing book to read. I really loved reading it. The author had done lot of research and presented in a easy read format.
0761169431|5.0|This book was a lot more than I expected given the price .... with the origami paper included it is definitely great value for money.
0062086529|5.0|I ordered these books to give as gifts to my new grand sons. It was always one of my favorite books and hope it will become one of theirs.
B008BM9L72|3.0|It get's a little repetitive, and probably best read over a number of sittings, else you'll start developing a headache.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|I love this! Love how you can play random people, facebook friends or pass and play! its kind of like words with friends how it lets you play your face book friends but its way better. you don't have to wait as long for turns since not much thinkink is involved. this game is for sure worth $2 :D
B0079XPUOW|5.0|The book is self-admittedly something of an existential read based around what Scalzi chose to be the source of the \\"Redshirt\\" phenomenon, that not my usual fare but I don't balk from it either and John pulled it off excellently in this book.  Scifi fans and perhaps even those just interested in the some of the processes involved in character development and fiction writing should find a fair amount to enjoy.<br /><br />I got a fun kick out of how the end of the main story was done and the extra codas were also interesting. Being a bit of an on again off again romantic the last coda was my favorite and a great way to end the book overall.
B000UX6TRK|1.0|This is the MOST HORRIBLE DVD in my collection, and YES, like all reviewers kind enough to share, THE LEFT CHANNEL DOESN\\"T WORK.<br /><br />I was setting up my new Pioneer LX-56 Receiver and after wiring all up, i spent two hours trying to fix my Pioneer.  It is unfortunate that i use my most love concert on my new AV System and i was switching wires around like an idiot thinking the my new Marantz and Pioneer is faulty.<br /><br />I have never choose to believe that a DVD will have such a flaw and yet they still sells it.<br /><br />What a crazy thing.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Love this c.d. great hip music, sexy, mature. Ifeel like its my music not tweeny bopper stuff. Love her duets!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Easy to learn, fun to play, keeps your attention, and grows in challenging your puzzle-solving skills. And it's cool to fingerpaint with light. Love it!
B000U0F7RG|5.0|The item was exactly as described.  The shipping was ubber fast and the price was better than expected.  I also really appreciated that the item was available.  Not too many left!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Very nice film. Not an over the top Indian movie but well balanced.<br />Great characters. A bit rushed in spots but like a light novel it was a Quick read.
B009EP3DJM|3.0|I love Kesha and I love going to see her in concert. She is fun, exciting and talented. This album doesn't deliver. Her first two albums had the mainstream catchy songs but had additional fun or sweet songs. This album only has two and a half good songs. I love the collaboration with Iggy Pop but I wish Warrior had more of it. Overall, for how long this album took to come out and how good her two previous albums were, this is a huge disappointment. Let's hope she releases something else soon or she will fade into obscurity.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|Interesting how they tied it all together and he ended up being the President. Fast pase movie, liked the hatchet.
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Unknown does keep you guessing and can be pretty intense at times, but I'd rather watch Taken over this one.
1419705849|5.0|My child gets excited over every new Diary of a Wimpy Kid book he receives! He has been reading them since kindergarten and was super ecstatic to receive the latest edition.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|Another Amazing album.  Fabulous renditions of great songs. I would highly recommend this CD for any music lover. Thanks Piano Guys!!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. The author has a great way of writing so you keep wanting more. Definitely recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly, thank you for a wonderful book yet again!! When is the next one??? Can't wait to read it!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|A friend introduced me to the music by The Piano Guys, about a year ago.  Now it is my favorite \\"go to\\" for listening enjoyment.  These \\"Guys\\", have amazing talent, fresh compositions and great energy.  You won't be disappointed.
B0067TQQI8|4.0|I have an iPhone 5 and I use this battery when I travel.  It will fully charge the phone about 4 times before it drains.  It's build quality is ok.  I have noticed that there is some light coming through the case near the power button from one of the power indicator LED's.  For the price it's a nice little battery and it will fit in a pants pocket if necessary but you would do better to put it into a coat pocket or bag.  The flashlight is handy if you are in a totally dark room and need a quick light source.  I do wish the unit would have a soft touch coating instead of being a slippery plastic but that's a minor quibble.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I love Miyazaki films, and Princess Mononoke is no exception. This is a great film with amazing animation. I'll never grow tired of watching it.
6305428387|5.0|Seriously, this is my favorite movie of all time.  It is so darn funny.  I love it!  My 16 year old son has every word memorized - yes a bit excessive, but we love it.
1426308469|5.0|Very excellent book. Easy for young people to understand and learn from it and the pix are great; very useful.
0887307280|5.0|I've been in direct sales for over 15 years.  I have done a ton of private business coaching over the past 5 years.  I think my coaching would have moved more quickly had I read this book first.  But, since I didn't the book is helping me to see how everything I have learned through coaching can be implemented.<br /><br />I think it is a great resource for anyone in Direct Sales, and you may not be able to implement everything on your own without<br />some business coaching.
B00A77II0U|4.0|enjoyed the game and working through it/ ny young son and daughter enjoy the game<br />and all the activity levels
159562015X|4.0|I really do like the book and the test.  You have to buy it new to take the test with the online code.<br />But, for example the test said one of my strengths is &#34;Responsibility&#34;.  I have learned through my business coach that many<br />people feel they are responsible and in my case it comes from excessive responsibility when I was a teen.  So, it is not necessarily a strength of mine that allows me to be at my best for myself and others, but instead it is a burden for me to<br />always feel the need to be responsible.  So, in taking the test the outcome of the test gets skewed by our past experiences.  My business coach had me read through all the strengths in the book and find the ones that respresent me when I am at my best and &#34;in the zone&#34;.
B005544V6A|5.0|One of my favorite TV series.  Can't wait for the next season.  I plan to watch it in real time!
0679805273|5.0|I love this book! I give to graduates and people moving out of the area or taking a new job.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Definitely should be viewed as a precursor to Alien (I don't know why some people debate that?).<br />It wasn't a perfect movie... and it did seem a bit different than the previews made it out to be (but that always happens, doesn't it?), but it was a good movie. Entertaining and worth watching.<br /><br />Amazon's instant video version of the film shows a couple clips right before the movie, saying &#34;stay tuned after the credits to see this alternate ending and deleted scenes&#34;. The trouble is, those clips are sort of spoilers. It shouldn't show them then.
B000000WF0|4.0|Suddenly becoming one of the most universally recognized tracks of the year of its release almost directly after it dropped (1997),\\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" gained part of its ubiquity due not only to the insanely pronounced hook driving the melody of the track, but also due to the appropriation by copyright over the track itself by the former manager of the Rolling Stones (thanks to an orchestrated section of \\"The Last Time\\" being lifted to provide saturative contrast), who then proceeded to license it to provide a catchy melody for a television advertisement. Fortunately for The Verve, those who came for \\" Bittersweet Symphony\\" stayed for the other tracks populating the running order of \\"Urban Hymns\\", the last CD the band would record during the '90's, and in a myriad of ways, its most refined, though not, perhaps, its definitive statement as a recording entity.<br /><br />No longer adhering to lengthy build-ups toward explosive crescendos that marked much if their earlier material, including a sizable amount of what was recorded for their full-length debut, \\"A Storm In Heaven\\" itself a quasi- shoe gazing masterpiece, Nick McCabe and Richard Ashcroft don't mine peaks and valleys here; almost every track is either a slow-burning or mid-tempo affair over which guitarist McCabe lavishes a somewhat universally swirling wash of reverb, delay, and echo to create what in some ways is the band's densest yet most finely textured sonic tapestry yet, over which Ashcroft wistfully croons his ruminative (and somewhat personal) lyrics, his vocals as by turns sensitive, nuanced, brash, and challenging. And the rhythm section reaches their most heavily syncopated plateau, bassist Simon Jones and drummer Pete Salisbury providing an unobtrusive yet gliding and propulsive background that anchor McCabe and Ashcroft's excursions into the rich musical universe found within the dimensions of their own inner space.<br /><br />So which tracks are worth downloading onto your iPod? All of them, really, as there is a sense of universal cohesion that \\"A Storm In Heaven\\", for all of its brilliance, didn't quite capture. If you pressed me I'd have to include \\"Catching The Butterfly\\", \\"Weeping Willow\\", \\"Space And Time\\", \\"Lucky Man\\", \\"Velvet Morning\\", and \\"The Rolling People\\" with \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\" as the most compelling of the bunch, but like \\" A Storm In Heaven\\", this is made and meant to be listened to straight through. Seal of approval? Definitely.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|There is something magical that happens when these guys get together.  Their music is transcendent and touches you deeply.  No matter what the occasion, they have an arrangement that fits....from the upbeat &#34;Canon in D&#34; to their newest single, the etherial and hauntingly beautiful &#34;O Come O Come Emmanuel&#34;.  This album is a cross section sampling and features innovative arrangements, from &#34;What Makes You Beautiful&#34; and &#34;Over The Rainbow&#34; to the always fun &#34;Cello Wars&#34; to the classic &#34;Cello Song&#34; and &#34;Beethoven's 5 Secrets&#34;.  Makes the perfect gift as there is something to please everyone.  Enjoy the CD then check out many more great songs online.
B0007KIFGE|5.0|Having seen this movie several times I can relate to the issues faced by the Weapons Officer (Owens, who is not a Naval Aviator/Pilot) He has to escape but at the same time has to report what he has witnessed. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I so enjoyed this book on many levels and so did our Book Club.  The author had an amazing way of telling this story.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is a fantastic example of music making and creating.  The combination of style, instruments, and passion lead the listener on a journey of fantastic scenes, and feelings.  Buy this CD and help support music making.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Mr. Smith's writing style allowed me to enjoy each of the Trilogy books.  Very exciting and I hated to see them end.<br />Agent 6<br />The Secret Speech<br />Child 44
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game I already built my house,my beach and their is so many building crafts to use and I think people should always play mincraft
B008QTVNUI|3.0|After watching 4 episodes, I still don't understand all that hype about this series.<br />It has a good plot and it may feel like a movie sometimes but the story moves so slow, I can't concentrate. This was supposed to be really interesting and breath-taking but I feel like I'm in a history class. It is not fair to compare this average work with great TV phenomena like 24, Alias, Oz or The Wire.<br />Another note is that they are using sexual content even though it has no positive contribution on advancing the plot or revealing the emotional states of the characters.
B007STBUIW|5.0|I have liked this ever since it was in the movie theaters in the 70's.  It still has the impact it had then.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Awesome!!!<br /><br />My Father Will Be Happy...My Grandfather Would Be Happy Also If He Were Here...So In The Mean Time...Visit  killloverbleed.ch ; )
B00A5052YE|4.0|A few of the songs are tricked up. The album's title song would be better without Nikki Minaj. I will say Alicia has a great voice.
B003OCWF6I|5.0|The first time I watched it on TV I enjoyed it immensely. The next day, I put it in my shopping cart.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I was disappointed. The first puzzle I did was incomplete. The last piece was missing. I've seen other reviews with the same complaint. Too bad. I havn't done any more.
B0046MOVD0|5.0|Milla Jovovich is superb in this flick. All of the Resident Evil movies are destined to be a cult classic. She's great in all the movies she's made. Lots of action in this movie. I love it, and I recommend it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box is one of the best of the Harry Bosch series. Keeps you guessing til the end! If you like Connelly, this is for you.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This movie comes out on TV every Halloween. It's a classic. It's funny and shows a possibility of afterlife. Micheal Keaton is a hoot, he cracks you up in every scene he's in. I recommend this movie highly
B007C4ZJ0S|4.0|A good flick,,<br />I don't understand why she had to explain what she did when she high jacked the car.
B007PFD90G|5.0|The book was about how to have dignity in the face of darkness and how valuable being truly free is.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Love this! The first season characters were just being crafted, but the second season, they got it right on the money! Love it!
B001L62REY|1.0|On different BD players (same model, up-to-date FW), the disc played exactly once from beginning to end, then never loaded again.  I got a screen stating I needed to update my FW.  Only BD that has ever done this to me.  So, my options were to toss out my otherwise serviceable BD player, or this one disc that refused to play.<br /><br />During the two occasions I actually watched the BD, I experienced some of the same low video quality issues as other reviewers. I could not set screen contrast and brightness correctly to see some of the scenes.  The video quality of the VHS is definitely better.
B009DKCBM8|5.0|If you don't buy the Blu-ray, throw your money away!  The stand out track is waiting at<br />the end; \\"Horseback\\" drifts through Neil's studio and into your soul.<br />When you don't think that it could get any better; they bring it down, and then rise<br />slowly into \\"Cortez...\\"  The comic and poignant video clips that are interspersed<br />throughout the kaleidoscope images are very well done.  Punch that, 'buy with one<br />click' and wait by the mailbox for a most entertaining visual/musical experience.
1449410243|5.0|If you love The Oatmeal comics, you will really love this book.  A lot of the comics in the book are from his website but there are just enough new ones to make it worth the expense.
B005LAII12|5.0|Ted is one of the best movies of the last 10 years. It is beyond funny and beyond very funny. It is ultra funny. And the little person they dressed up like the teddy bear did a wonderful job playing Ted. I smell a best acting Oscar.<br /><br />Here is the story: little kid gets a teddy bear he names Ted, and wishes it would come to life. Boom! It comes to life. Kid and bear grow up together without ever really growing up. Plenty of traditional American profanity, toilet humor, drug references and abuse, told against a backdrop of existential-neoclassical philosophy. I just made that last thing up. Don't even know what it means.<br /><br />My only criticism is that I don't think they should have implied that President Johnson was involved with the assasination of President Kennedy. What? * * * You sure? * * * Okay. Never mind. Please disregard the last paragraph. I got Ted mixed up with another movie.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Quick to ship and items are exactly as advertised. I recommend this product to any photographer that has nikon products
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My 9 year old son is an avid fan of YouTube.  I was so happy when he came across the piano guys.  It is so wonderful to hear their beautiful arrangements coming from my sons bedroom.  Their talent encourages my son to continue to practice the piano and the cello so he too can play these songs someday.  It's great that the piano guys show that you can have fun with music.  Thanks guys for bringing beautiful music into my home.
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|After two years, Bruno Mars is back in the spotlight. It's immediately clear that he's back in full force and is showing no signs of slowing down. His debut album \\"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\\" was solid all the way through consisting of mostly upbeat songs that had \\"Chart Topper\\" written all over them. While Bruno has tried to do the same thing on Unorthodox Jukebox, he's taking it all in a different, genre bending style.<br />We start the album out with \\"Young Girls\\" a slower song about relationships gone wrong. The hook says it all \\"All you young, wild, girls, you make a mess of me\\", the song is very catchy and stands out among the others as one of the best songs on the album. \\"Locked Out Of Heaven\\" was the lead single for the album, it's almost as if he took the catchy beat of \\"Just The Way You Are\\" and mixed it with the lyrics of \\"Our First Time\\" and then gave it a Prince meets The Police vibe to it. It works well, though it doesn't feel as strong as the singles off of \\"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\\".<br />Another thing that you will notice almost immediately about Unorthodox Jukebox is the fact that it's a lot less innocent than his initial release, the songs \\"Gorilla\\", \\"Treasure\\" \\"Show Me\\", and \\"Money Make Her Smile\\" are pretty raunchy in their own right, mostly consisting of lyrics with strong sexual themes. The song \\"Gorilla\\", also gave Bruno the \\"Parental Advisory\\" sticker on the album.<br />\\"When I Was Your Man\\" stands out among the other songs as one of the deepest songs. Bruno sings about a relationship that he messed up. The piano compliments him very well and helps set the mood very well, it almost makes it seem as if he's singing out of pain all by himself, not caring if anybody hears. A little ways into the album, we hear one of the best songs from the album, \\"Natalie\\". It's almost like a \\"Grenade Part 2\\" type song. Both the beat and lyrics strongly remind of \\"Grenade\\", and I could see it as being one of the most successful songs from the album. The hook is oneof the most infectious found on the album, and is one of the most immediately likable songs. Bruno sounds oddly deranged singing about yet another bad relationship, he paints a picture very well of a gold digger who took all of his money, leaving him with nothing.<br />Unfortunately, the album falls a bit flat at the end. \\"Doo-Wops and Hooligans\\" neared perfection, with only one song really being unlikable (Our First Time). So it's kind of disappointing to see only six or seven tracks that are really worth listening to. The songs \\"Show Me\\", and \\"If I Knew\\" stand out as the weakest songs on the album both really bringing no heart or soul to the table. \\"Money Make Her Smile\\" was decent at best, but the strong sexual content detracts from the already marginal beat made it passable at best. \\"When I Was Your Man\\" was a terrific song, but the deepness of the song makes it hard to listen to when shuffling through the album.<br />Overall, Unorthodox Jukebox is a good album. It's impressive to see a big name mainstream artist such as Bruno Mars experiment with different genres while staying on track and not really losing focus. Unorthodox Jukebox is a solid effort that hits it's peak before falling almost flat towards the end.<br />FINAL SCORE: 7/10<br />Songs Worth Downloading:<br />Young Girls<br />Locked Out Of Heaven<br />Natalie<br />When I Was Your Man<br />Moonshine
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Not my favorite but way above average.  Lots of twists and turns.  I have to go back and see which book I missed, as I don't know why Jack Reacher started with a broken nose.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is a fantastic collection of music! My kids and I love listening to this after school! My daughter knows all the names of the songs and tells me what is coming on next. I look forward to more good music from The Piano Guys!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|When you think that all of the musical ideas out there have been discovered, along comes a totally new and inspiring performing group.  I love the musicality and emotion that is presented in this CD.  These men are brilliant musicians.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Mine keeps perfect time. No battery issues to worry about. Day and date display great feature. All at a low price.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I don't have anything else to say about this product; Amazon shouldn't make a minimum on the amount of words required for feedback.
B009GJCFL8|5.0|Great live album from a fantastic progressive rock band.  After all these years, they still sound great.  The DVD is a nice added bonus.  These old dudes make it look easy.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Its a great game for bromide to play and pass the time. Awesome just to sit and play this game and see all the ponies from the original show.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Similar to fifty, language is a bit more forward than the shades book. But it fits the type of books it is meant to be.
B007MDB548|5.0|Funny cute movie. Looks great. 3D is awesome! I've had 3D plasma for a year but never really took advantage of 3D. It feels gimmicky. I bought the movie as a gift and I sat down to watch it. I recommend =)
B00846REIS|5.0|Similar to fifty, language is a bit more forward than the shades book. But it fits the type of books it is meant to be.  Can't wait for the last one
B008XX6J4C|5.0|We were introduced to TPG over a year ago.  Their Youtube videos were fun, creative, and the music BEAUTIFUL. What puts The Piano Guys above other artists out there?  Passion and joy! They absolutely LOVE what they do (make music and videos) and it shows in everything they produce.  This album showcases some of their many pieces.  I really appreciate that they choose music that is not \\"Rated R.\\" Any pop song they use to create their classical/modern mash ups and/or any movie music is going to come from pretty clean sources.  (In other words they won't mimic some profanity-laced or sexually explicit song.)  The album is wonderful, full of music that will stick in your brains and NOT LEAVE. :)  You have been warned! Enjoy!  P.S. We bought a dozen copies of this album to give as Christmas gifts to family.  I am not kidding.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Well written, such an awesome book takes you where you completely do not expect!!!! It would be cool with a follow up on how the family life happens.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|In a world starved for truly inspirational music, The Piano Guys are a blessing poorly disguised. While most of the work is re-made covers, they find ways to incorporate incredibly complex classical music into almost every piece. You'll find goosebumps on your skin at least 2 times per song. Beware!<br /><br />If you have a chance, get out to see these guys live. Their enthusiasm is not limited to video shoots!
B000FA5SMK|2.0|This is the first book that I have attempted<br />to read by this author.  For the first 40 percent of<br />the book he was desccribing Plum Island and in too<br />much detail.  I didn't stick around to find out<br />who murdered the victims or why.  Waste of time.
B005VPRET4|3.0|The product we liked but recommending that wearing blue base is complete, because when my daughter was opened to armo each time while joining the other pieces would<br /><br />Best Regards
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|The music was great. It's not a &#34;pick-me up&#34; kind of story, but it's something that we come across often in relationships. I saw myself a lot in both Zoe Daschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and realized that I have been both at different points in relationships. Great story told well.

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|[NOTE: I am NOT concerned with revealing any spoilers here in this review, as they would only serve to help you to know what it is you missed by the time this movie is over.  Believe me, you won't figure it out when you see this movie.]<br /><br />Years ago I acted in a school play and became friends with one of the leads as we practiced.  The good news: the play got rave reviews, and his role was particularly well received.  The bad news: overnight, he became an artiste, and his Army/Navy duds were quickly replaced by beret and ascot, and from then on he was too cool to be friends with the likes of me.<br /><br />I think Terrence Malick might be along these lines: the darling of the elite, he frequently is awarded epithets like \\"auteur,\\" \\"cineaste,\\" \\"master,\\" \\"genius,\\" etc....  He is famously reclusive, has put out a miniscule amount of work (this is his sixth film in a little over 40 years--to which I say thank God) yet each release is cause for a film community that could not be more tickled if you stood beside them with a feather and a rubber glove.<br /><br />I also assume that working for him must also be \\"de rigueur\\" for anyone who wishes to consider him or herself truly to have reached the pinnacle of the art.  I think it must be just as important to be able to drop the word bombs so loved by those elites who are, in fact, much like my old acting buddy: \\"I was talking to Terry yesterday...\\" or \\"It's just like Terry said the other day...\\"  I cite as my evidence the ridiculous thatch of pubic hair Brad Pitt has been sporting on his chin in public over the last year or so--one can only wear such a ridiculous doo when he's been up on the mountain, man, and \\"seen things...\\"<br /><br />I don't know why I keep coming back.  While I liked the outlaw movie \\"Badlands,\\" in 1973, I truly believed I was DONE with him after watching several hours of windy grass in 1978's \\"Days of Heaven.\\"  Unfortunately, I found myself too ready to forgive him twenty years later when I went to see \\"The Thin Red Line,\\" having read and really loved the book.  I have never wanted to switch places with a WWII soldier in the Pacific islands before, but I sincerely thought they got the better end of the deal a few hours later.<br /><br />Still, I went to this one. ..what the hell was I thinking?  Sure, sure, I have no one to blame but myself.  I feel like a smoker who attempts to protest the eventual tube in my esophagus -all the while holding the cigarette to my throat and STILL puffing...<br /><br />Oh--in case you're wondering--if you've read this far you MIGHT  just like this film.  We're up to the seventh paragraph and I haven't told you A THING about the plot.  You'll be waiting a lot longer to get one in this movie, and if you want to get to the meaning of this film you'll probably have to wait almost as long as the time span it covers.<br /><br />Which brings to mind this fact: did I mention that it has some scenes from the DAWN OF THE UNIVERSE in this film, and they don't even occur at the START of the film?  No, they only occur after the film has shown many fuzzy, blurry shots simultaneous with inaudible whispers wherein characters without names are shown reacting to bad news we can't hear over the phone.  I for the life of me don't have any idea why Sean Penn is looking sad, as he has the second easiest pay day in recorded cinematic history:  he only has to look morose whenever the camera is on him, which is not often.<br /><br />(In case you're wondering, the EASIEST payday in recorded cinematic history goes to the famous mime Marcel Marceau in Mel Brook's \\"Silent Movie,\\" who only had to say \\"No,\\" which I wish I had had the sense to say myself.)<br /><br />OK, so after establishing so much so well in the early part of this film, Malick then makes the aforementioned cut to the Dawn of Time, and then of course back again (by a doorway in the sea--don't ask) to the heart of the movie.<br /><br />Incidentally, this is my eleventh paragraph, and unless you've been reading them at, say, ten minutes per, I am still beating Malick's screenplay.  HERE, for about 45 minutes, the story begins to make sense, though this fact evidently must have gotten back to the director, who quickly ended the movie.  So that you will be able to tell WHEN this occurs, because nothing in the storyline will, just look to your left and right.  If people are visibly sitting there trying to read the bottom line of their movie stubs to see whether there is a refund policy, then indeed this is the end, and you may leave.<br /><br />In case you didn't know--and I'm reserving this for Malick fans, as nothing obvious seems to work on you--I think this movie SUCKED, and I'm someone who LOVED \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\"  Douglas Trumbull worked on both films, and I respect his craft...something I can't say about my good ol' buddy Terry.<br /><br />However, I did hear he's working on another one, so don't look for me when it comes out.  But, please, do what you can for the living.less you've been reading them at, say, ten minutes per, I am still beating Malick's screenplay.

B009P13RQY|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing The Sword live last night in Sacramento.  Only heard that one song Greya on guitar hero, I wasn't all too excited.  That changed once they hit the stage and rocked the venue and the outside.  They played a majority of the songs off this album including my now favorite \\"Cloak of Feathers\\".  The whole floor was lit up electric and I moshed for the first time.  Rock and Roll is not dead.  I am now a huge fan.

B0089BSM70|5.0|I bought the orginal Goodtimes and the Universal VHS. Both tapes were okay not bad one was HI-FI one was mono. But then the goodtimes DVD came out I bought it first was inpressive. The Universal was about the same and the blu-ray they realesed sucked. I bought this one think it would be the same dead wrong. I love the copy I got haven't yet watched the TV VERISON(DVD) yet but I will. It has all the scenes on the blu-ray that are deleted and the ending from TV so to me a great edition to anybodys HALLOWEEN COLLECTION.

0143117009|4.0|Collapse has the distinction of being a non-fiction book which is as exciting to the reader as his/her first time reading \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.\\" Each case study is like a short story which holds the reader in suspense. Jared's conclusions are not initially obvious, but are supported by the evidence he presents. His case studies are diverse with regards to location, time period, and cause of collapse, and he does a good job of discussing the connections and similarities between them. As a scholar, my one criticism is that Diamond chose relatively isolated societies, and is unclear about how to extrapolate their lessons to a global scale. As a lifelong devourer of novels, I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good story or appreciates lifelong learning.
B00AE2IJIE|5.0|This movie, not surprisingly, has a similar feel to Coraline, and places it's main character in a pretty dark, somewhat isolated, world.  The pop culture references, the language use, and the character development was fun!  This is a fun movie to curl up to, that just also happens to have a lesson at the end.

Hope this is not happening in the future.
B006LSZECO|1.0|After all the hype I was excited to read this book but I was very disappointed with how the story ended. Not worth your time.
B0091XRRQC|3.0|If you've seen the preview, you've pretty much seen the movie.  It was okay and had some funny bits but doesn't compare to Wallace & Gromit and his other stuff.
B0091LS07E|1.0|I like AK and was looking to buy this CD. My 4 yr old daughter love the song Girl on Fire atleast the version we hear on the radio. I wanted to download the song on her Innotab2 I got her for Christmas. Well I listened to the songs before I purchased the CD and I am glad I did. Girl on Fire on the CD is not the same version we hear on the radio. The version on the CD has rap on it and I did not like it, I was so disappointed. Mainly because that is not what I want to put on my 4 yr old's Innotab2 & she really likes the radio version. It would have been nice if they had both on the CD. I was not crazy about the other songs on the CD, but I would have bought it anyway for my daughter for the radio version of Girl on Fire. Needless to say I will not be buying this CD.<br />Disappointed mom & 4 yr old fan.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|A loosely connected Star Trek (the original series) parody.  Tim Allen does a great job as the showboat captain and Sigourney and rest create a great cast.  I especially enjoyed Tony Shalhoub's engineer character and his nonchalant attitude throughout the movie and &#34;boldly going where no human has gone before.&#34; An awesome movie for any sci-fi comedy buff.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The PianoGuys are an amazing group of highly expert musicians who can play just about every genre of music.  It is a wonderful experience to listen to music performed by this group, and by Jon and Steve, both individually and together.  I love their creativity, innovation, energy, and downright \\"near-perfection\\" in making older songs sound modern and contemporary music sound ageless.  My all-time favorite is their arrangement for \\"What Makes You Beautiful\\" by One Direction.  But, in reality, all of their selections are on my list of most-played and best-loved music.  They are simply the best!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|Love this episode.  Full of action, time alterations, and great character development and interactions.  Definitely a must-see if you enjoy Sci-Fi.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I bought it, and when I played it - my friend liked it - so I gave them the CD and bought myself another. I then gave that copy away to my brother (who was in town) for his car drive back to his home. (He loved it) I bought another one, and played it all weekend to study for finals. THis is uplifting and beautiful music. Loved seeing the PBS special on TV (and was there for the recording of it!) You will love to give this CD awasy for Christmas gifts!

0071766588|5.0|I have taken TOEFL Test and scored 115/120... Certainly, this book was important during my preparation. Actually, I first bought the Barron's Superpack, and it was really useful because it has 8 model tests, and I really like to overprepare... When there were only a few weeks before the test, I bought this book from the test-makers, and I believe it was a great deal... Even though it only contains 3 model tests (quite a few in my opinion, but ETS is working on it, releasing now volumes with actual tests), they are authentic ones and -as expected- provides students with a real sense of the test difficulty and what the test taker is expected to do in each type of question during the test. It explains all answers comprehensively, highlighting not only why one option is correct, but why the others are wrong. There are also plenty of examples of writing questions with actual students' texts and their scores; the same is true for speaking questions. Finally, the CD-ROM is, in my opinion, really good and I have not experienced any problems with it. However, its design on the screen and the way the students need to go from one question to another is a little bit different from the actual test.<br />In conclusion, I believe that if you are gonna take the test, buy this book; preferably, if you have time, in addition to another book with more model tests, even though they will not be authentic...

B009SQQRH2|5.0|Nothing 'life changing' in this movie, but the performances & comedic timing are masterfully executed.  We used promotional AIV credits we had accrued from other purchases to rent this film for 24 hours.  We weren't sure we would like it going in.  The linked trailer for the movie helped us make our choice.  Upon completion of our first viewing, our whole family agreed it was a great family film and we were glad we sat down together in the darkened living room and watched it on the big screen TV.  We were laughing our butts off multiple times throughout the film.  It was really that much fun to watch together.  Now if only AIV could find some way to embed closed captioning or subtitles for those few times where we find ourselves asking, &#34;What did that character just say?&#34;  UPDATE:  I just read elsewhere that AIV is starting to add CC to their movies - Yay!!!
B0034JKZ86|2.0|Warning: Rant and spoilers ahead.<br /><br />Let me first say that this movie was a capital effort.  It's very obvious that they cared a lot about the characters and put effort into putting in lots of cute character moments.  However, it fell so far below the standard of what I've come to expect a Disney princess story to be.  I mean, dang, Sleeping Beauty almost bankrupted Disney when it came out, and yet it still turned out with fewer plot holes than this.<br /><br />But first with the good.<br />- The animation was grand.  A lot of people here on Amazon complained about it, but quite frankly, it's honest to goodness hand drawn animation.  Absolutely nothing wrong with it at all.<br />- Dresses!  Not only does Tiana get more dresses than most other princesses, but her friend Charlotte has several as well.  And dresses are awesome.<br />- Fun side characters.  I simply adored Duke, the cook at the cafe, because he was just so hilarious.  Tiana's dad was cool, and Charlotte was just plain nuts.  Good times.<br />- Avoiding racial issues.  Honestly, a Disney movie really isn't the place for discussing that sort of thing, and it was handled properly without being offensive.  I've read other reviews where they claim it's somehow racist or racially demeaning, but this is simply untrue. The only people it stereotypes is hicks, and well, everybody in Hollywood does that.<br />- The concept.  Expanding on the fairy tale of old and setting it in New Orleans was a great idea.  Fault the movie all you like, but it had the potential to be good.<br /><br />And that's the end of the good.  Honestly, so much of this movie just went so wrong. Princess movies have high standards of being fun, having good writing, and being child friendly.  This movie is none of those.  I was not nearly as entertained or wrapped up in the story as I would be for any other princess movie.  This happened for several reasons.<br /><br />1. The music was not that great.  While I do love the scene whereTiana is singing to her mom about her restaurant and the animation changes, in the end none of the songs stuck with me.  They weren't catchy or emotional.  None of them had the fun of \\"Under the Sea\\" or the simple sweetness of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\".  The tunes didn't stick, and neither did the words.  Also, the song Tiana sung in the swamp with the croc and the prince was just unnecessary.  It added nothing to the story because we already know that Tiana wants a restaurant, Naveen is a playboy, and the croc wants to play jazz.  And did the croc seem like a rip-off of the crocodile in All Dogs Go to Heaven to you?<br /><br />2. Voodoo is not appropriate for a children's movie.  The entire reason we buy princess movies for kids is so they can have something to watch that isn't full of all the grown-up junk modern movies like to stick in there just to be \\"rebellious\\".  Parents don't want their kids exposed to black magic, tarot cards, and other spiritual hazards.  Especially not if their children are spiritually sensitive or prone to nightmares.  That leaves this movie without a target audience, because while the rest of the movie is intended for children, no sensible parent will put on a movie with voodoo in it.<br /><br />3. While the villain had a lot of potential, Shadowman was just wasted.  Besides being way too scary for the target audience, his motivation was unclear.  First of all, he has a clear character moment near the beginning where he sells a malfunctioning hair potion to a bald man just for the sake of money.  However, this is contradicted by his later admission to the spirits he works with that he wants to take over New Orleans.  So which is it?  Is he motivated by conquest or cash?<br /><br />Also, if Tiana and other characters know better than to talk to Shadowman, then he obviously lived in New Orleans for a while.  If he really wanted to conquer the city, why did he wait until then to do it?  Why did his plan hinge on a foreign prince, the prince'sdoofus caretaker, the Mardi Gras parade, and a whole bunch of spells?  Couldn't he have come up with something more straightforward, especially since he was able to send the shadows after Naveen?  And if he's motivated by money, he could get it from Big Daddy a lot easier than by voodoo.  After all, he saw the big stack of cash Big Daddy gave the newspaper boy.  Surely he could put himself in a position to get a constant stream of cash from Big Daddy without having to stop BD from making more money.  That would be more practical.<br /><br />What's more, they never explain why Shadowman is doomed if his necklace breaks.  It ends up just being a cheap way to get rid of the villain.  What they should have done is let him get away and then cause trouble in sequels.  Tsk Tsk, such a waste.<br /><br />I could go on about Shadowman, but I'll finish with this: the movie is not him vs. Tiana.  In every other movie, the bad guy was a direct villain of the princess in question.  However, Shadowman mostly antagonizes Naveen (and that from a distance) and doesn't even know that Tiana is trying to stop him until the end of the movie.  Come on, the very point of a princess movie is to overcome something.  This movie really should have been Tiana's practical mind versus Shadowman's crazy head.  That's what this movie needed.<br /><br />4. Despite the fact that Tiana gets so many dresses, she never wears any of them for very long.  In other stories, dresses had significant plot reasons for existing and were setpieces for the princess in question, ie Cinderella's ballgown, Aurora's birthday present, and Belle's dancing dress.  Instead, Tiana's best dress is only worn for about thirty seconds during the movie.  Come on, now.<br /><br />5. So...yeah...anybody else notice that Naveen is not really good enough for Tiana?  She's worked really hard all her life, and Naveen is just some wasteful playboy whose only credit is that he can play a little guitar.  There was no real reason for them to fall in love, and the idea that after only a few days with a girl a playboy would decide to propose is laughable.<br /><br />6. I personally found the firefly creepy.  The idea with him in love with a star should have been cute, but it just really creeped me out.  If he had to have been in the movie, then he should have been just some side character in the swamp that goes away after a while.  There's actually no reason for the firefly to be with Tiana and Naveen after all.  The croc wants to become a jazz musician, so he has an excuse, but why would a firefly go along for a spell breaking session?  His home is in the swamp, not the city.<br /><br />7. Plothole city.  I have never seen a more plot-hole filled film in my entire life.  They spent so much time animating and coming up with all these characters, and they even went so far as to cast Oprah in this film, but they couldn't get the story together.  Let me think of all the plotholes I can mention off the top of my head.<br /><br />- If Shadowman turned Naveen into a frog, why was Naveen's servant dumb enough to go along with Shadowman's plan?  How does he know Shadowman won't betray him?<br /><br />- If Charlotte is such good friends with Tiana, then why wasn't she at all worried about her disappearance?  She surely would have noticed when she saw the mess the frogs left in her room.<br /><br />- How come Tiana's mom didn't worry about her daughter's disappearance?  Or heck, why wasn't Duke worried?  Surely he'd notice if his hardest working waitress didn't come in.<br /><br />- Why does Shadowman need to make Charlotte marry fake Naveen just so he can stab a Big Daddy doll with needles?  Can't he just do that anyway?<br /><br />- Does Naveen really think Tiana is a princess in the beginning?  She was just another girl in a fancy dress at a fancy dress party.  Surely he realizes that America doesn't have official princesses.<br /><br />- If the shadows can go after Naveen and be all scary-like, then why can't they take over the city by themselves?  They don't need Shadowman's help.  And if they do, then why do they kill him after one slip up?  Can't he just go to another city and try again?<br /><br />But there is one plot-hole that eclipses all the rest.  It is the biggest plot-hole I've seen in a movie since Star Trek: Generations.  Namely, why is Tiana going about getting herself a restaurant the hard way?  She's even willing to kiss a frog for it, when it's already been established that she doesn't like frogs.  However, she has Charlotte.  Charlotte doesn't even care that Tiana is working all the time; she'll just rush right on in and tell Tiana all about the arriving prince.  She even stopped dancing with the guy she thought was her prince just to get Tiana a new dress.<br /><br />So why doesn't Tiana just ask Charlotte for the money to make a restaurant?  I mean, if she's willing to kiss a frog, she won't be too prideful to ask her friend, right?  Or she could just skip Charlotte altogether and go right to Big Daddy with her business plan, convincing him to loan her the cash by saying that her restaurant will increase the property value of the other nearby plots?  Starting a business is about more than just raising a bunch of cash.  It's about who you know.  Heck, Big Daddy might even make money out of investing in Tiana's work so that he can pay for all that nonsense he buys for Charlotte.  Everybody wins.<br /><br />Oh, and it was pretty uncouth of Tiana to threaten those real estate agents (I think that's what they were...) with a crocodile.  The entire point of free enterprise is to avoid being threatened into doing business deals by either the government, other businesses, and Disney princesses.  Sure the guys were jerks, but that's not appropriate.  You can threaten them, say, with Big Daddy's presense, but nobody should be afraid for their lives if they don't make a deal with you.<br /><br />So yeah, this plothole really ruined the whole movie for me.She didn't even need to kiss the frog in the first place.<br /><br />8. It was pretty contradictory to have themes of working hard instead of depending on luck alongside themes of not letting work take over your life.  In an adult movie, these themes could possibly have worked out.  While I'm not a fan of dumbing things down for children, it's really best for child-like Disney movies to have more or less straightforward themes.  These just got confusing together.<br /><br />So, there's my big ol' rant.  Two out of five stars.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|My 2.5 year old daughters love movie! I can't believe I've never seen it before! The price was very reasonable and can't believe this classic is on Blu-Ray disc! A favorite in our house!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I never had an NDE but I always felt like there saw something more to the world, something we could  never  understand. This story, even if you don't believe it (which I do), shows how it's possible, if not proof, our state of awareness isn't driven by just brain waves. Even if you're a non believer, I strongly recommend this. It gets you thinking. And believing.

B0041KKYBA|5.0|This film explains VERY CLEARLY how the latest financial disaster occurred and why we were crushed beneath it.  It is the best explanation you will ever find of the events that put us so far under.  Simple, unambiguous, concise, completely explained--no confusion here.  Every &#34;regular&#34; person in America would benefit from seeing it.  (Especially the part about how those who freakin' caused the crisis are STILL IN THE GAME while the rest of us are scrambling, trying to figure out how we're going to manage, since our retirement funds were wiped out.)  Excellent film.  Excellently done.  Well worth the time.

1451695195|5.0|Dr. Eben Alexander, a neurosurgeon who has practiced at such esteemed locations as the Brigham and Women's and Children's and Harvard Medical School, never believed in near-death experiences (NDE's) until he had one.<br /><br />On November 10, 2008, at the age of fifty-four, he contracted a case of E. Coli bacterial meningitis no one could explain the cause of. His case was the first of its kind in recorded medical history. As a result of his illness, he spent seven days in a coma with his neocortex (the part of the brain that makes us human) \\"shut down.\\" Even with the best medical care available, by the end of the week just about everyone had given up hope of any sort of recovery.<br /><br />Most NDE's take place while the neocortex is still functioning. But, in his case, \\"the neocortex was out of the picture. [He] was encountering the reality of a world of consciousness that existed completely free of the limitations of [his] physical brain.<br /><br />What Dr. Alexander experienced on the other side makes for compelling reading, although he emphasizes the difficulty of even trying to put it into human words. He states that trying to describe it is \\"like trying to write a novel with only half the alphabet.\\" But he is adamant that \\"the place [he] went was real. Real in a way that makes the life we are living here and now completely dreamlike by comparison.\\"<br /><br />He describes beings that we would most likely refer to as angels as follows: \\"The joy of these creatures, as they soared along, was such that they had to make this noise -- that if the joy didn't come out of them this way then they would simply not otherwise be able to contain it. The sound was palpable and almost material, like a rain that you can feel on your skin but that doesn't get you wet.<br /><br />\\"Seeing and hearing were not separate in this place where I now was. I could hear the visual beauty of the silvery bodies of those scintillating beings above, and I could see the surging, joyful perfection of what they sang.\\"<br /><br />He describes the ever-present feeling of unconditional love, that \\"none of us are ever unloved. Each and every one of us is deeply known and cared for by a Creator who cherishes us beyond any ability we have to comprehend.\\"<br /><br />The fact that Dr. Alexander fully recovered from his illness with no loss of brain function is a medical miracle. Prior to this experience, he had never examined the testimony of those who had experienced NDE's at all, instead dismissing the phenomena as simply the neocortex at work. In true scientific fashion, he wrote down his own experience on the other side before he began to delve into the literature already out there. He was amazed by what he found. He began to feel that it was his mission as a neuroscientist to help convince other doctors that this phenomena is real.<br /><br />Dr. Alexander writes, \\"I simply had to take seriously the possibility that it really and truly had happened for a reason. That only made me feel a greater sense of responsibility to tell my story right.\\"<br /><br />While Dr. Alexander, an Episcopalian, does touch on religion and emphasizes the love of God and the power of prayer, this is not primarily a religious book. Rather, it is a scientific one, designed to convince those who dismiss belief in an afterlife on scientific grounds. As a result, it does include quite a bit of scientific explanation. If that does not interest the reader, those sections can be skimmed without any loss of meaning in the book.<br /><br />\\"Proof of Heaven\\" is a must-read for anyone who doubts that there is an afterlife or for anyone interested in what life on the other side might be like.fection of what they sang.\\"<br /><br />He describes the ever-present feeling of unconditional love, that \\"none of us are ever unloved.

B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Bruno Mars knew what he was doing when he named his sophomore album, \\"Unorthodox Jukebox\\".  There are so many styles of music on here.  I can't really pick a favorite song, because every single track has it's own catchy vibe to it.  I'm really lovin' the throwback, 80s feel to some of the songs... just brilliant! Bruno's team is one huge package of talent.  I don't even buy hard copy CD's anymore... but I had to pick up a copy today because I knew this would be one of my favorite CD's.<br /><br />Good hit, Bruno! I can't tell you how amazing it is NOT to hear an overproduced auto tuned, album. You are the savior to  REAL music again.  Much Love!

B009NQKXYK|4.0|Overall this was a pretty decent movie if you are an Aliens fan... It has a few slow spots but they are in deep space and I would imagine that at times it would get pretty boring? At the other end of the spectrum it would probably be really exciting until $#@! hit the fan.... I really like the twist at the end that helps sum up the the alien race... Thats all im going to say.lol

1936850028|5.0|Since I have skied over 20 Birkebeiners and have completed the American Ski Marathon Series, I couldn't resist reading a book entitled \\"Beyond Birkie Fever.\\"  The book did not disappoint.  Rhein's witty account of how he got into skiing, how he got into racing, training and racing blunders he made, how the Birkie became a yearly \\"must-do\\" for him and how the Birkie has opened up many doors for him, doors to friendship, travel, adventure, fitness, training resonates with me and with anyone who is passionate about xc skiing or endurance athletics in general.  The book is well put together; each chapter is an adventure, a story in itself.  Even though Rhein fills his story with witticisms and humor, his respect for the sport of xc skiing and the outstanding event that is the Birkebeiner comes through loud and clear.  I recommend \\"Beyond Birkie Fever\\" very highly to anyone who has ever strapped on a pair of xc skis.
159420411X|3.0|Silver is at his best when he's explaining why some things are more predictable than others, and what it takes to make those predictions.  The fun gets derailed when he goes off on a dubious rant against frequentist that reveals either a serious lack of understanding of his own (Bayesian) methods or a troubling lack of candor.  To forcefully make the point that Bayesian statistics are legitimate is one thing (and wouldn't be objectionable), but Silver misrepresents the assumptions the two methodologies make and ignores the capabilities of frequentist techniques.  At some point he forgot that both are simply tools for analysis, not religions to be proselytized and fought over.

B0084U0IEG|5.0|Ian McEwen has done it again. It's more than an Insanely well crafted novel, it speaks to us of the 70's in Britain. There is occasional pot smoke in the air, but it is Serena we care about. Her Anglican dad \\"the Bishop\\" her lost sister, and her men. Enjoy the story of espionage set in London, but stay for the characters and the very beautiful language.

B0041KVWI4|5.0|Everybody already knows what a great record this is, so this review is about the audio/pressing quality. I've heard some rumblings about pressing issues in some of these vinyl remasters. I can only speak for myself and say that I have various other copies of MMT on vinyl including an original pressing, but this is the finest example of Beatles audio quality on vinyl that I myself have had the pleasure of hearing. Yes, it sounds that good.
B00006FDCD|5.0|Out of all Stephen Kings scary films, this is the best for me. (Well, the first 2 hours, anyway.) And no gore, so all the bad stuff is in your head! Too many lines to quote- beep beep Richie, kiss me fat boy, and when you are down here with me....
B007IE4DT0|5.0|This is a very exciting little release and honestly, I can't believe it took this long to see it on the market. I can listen to each track on the record through and through without skipping any tracks and enjoy the entire thing. The audio and pressing quality is top notch. Also, these are (mostly) acoustic demos so they are bare bones versions of classic Harrison tracks. Because of that, they don't contain any of the shiny over-produced sound that George Harrison records are often criticized for. I think it's actually may be my favorite George Harrison record to date and it makes me wonder how much more successful he may have been without the fifty instruments and horn sections on stage and in the studio. If you wondering what this sounds like, think George Harrison meets Nirvana's Unplugged in New York City. This is a must have for your collection.

B0041KVXLK|2.0|I give this two stars for the quality of the audio and vinyl pressing, not because of the songs on the album itself. I ordered six of the new vinyl remasters and Sgt. Pepper was one of them. All of the others sounded absolutely amazing, but this one sounded atrocious. The bass won't come through without serious static, the highs sound like they're scratching on the way out of the speakers, and it just sounds horrible. Now, I don't think that all of the new Sgt. Pepper albums will sound this bad, this was just a problem with my particular copy. Buyers should beware that there have been some fairly widespread issues with the quality of these new vinyl pressings. Open and play them as soon as you get them so you don't way too long to get an exchange or refund if you happened to get a bad copy.

B0041KVV8U|5.0|This is the first quality release of Past Masters on vinyl ever. I have to say, it sounds amazing and since most Beatles fans probably don't have a copy of Past Masters in vinyl LP form, this makes a great but and a must have for a completist collector.

159562015X|1.0|Somebody (probably lots of somebodies) must have already written this review...and I should have read them before buying the books...3 used copies, none of which cost much money, but all of which cost shipping that I will not be reimbursed if I return the product. Two of the three came with used or no access codes for the online assessment, therefore now I cannot give them as gifts. Luckily one of them came with an unopened package, so that one I can give. Hopefully I can write a happier review after we use the one good copy. Just wanted to warn others...

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|The ever prolific Brandon Sanderson is back again, this time with a novella from his Cosmere titled The Emperor's Soul. After a few adept attempts at writing short fiction, The Emperor's Soul is in my opinion the first piece of short fiction that Sanderson has gotten just right. With a fascinating study of clashing beliefs, another inventive magic system, and highly entertaining action sequence, The Emperor's Soul is the book I would recommend to anyone who wants to find out for the first time what Sanderson is all about.<br /><br />The story follows a young girl named Shai, a Forger who is imprisoned after an attempt to steal a famous sceptre on display in the emperor's palace. Shai has the ability to alter any object by creating a stamp that forges a new history for the object it is applied to. For example, a plain old wooden table can be transformed into a masterpiece by altering the history of the plain old wooden table to say it was created by a master carpenter. When an assassination attempt leaves the emperor in a vegetative state, Shai is offered her freedom in exchange for a stamp that will alter the history of the emperor so that he is able to recover from his vegetative state. But crafting such a stamp is highly complex and controversial process, and Shai knows she is a loose end that the emperor's council will be desperate to get rid of.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this story, not only for the plot points from beginning to end, but also for all the themes that the story generates along the way. The idea of forging a person's soul generates a theological debate about the nature of a soul which Sanderson embraces whole heartedly. Sanderson also generates debate about the nature of art, whether forgery can be considered art or not, and why a skilled forger would not create their own art. There are many arguments generated, and Sanderson presents both sides in a surprisingly balanced fashion, never giving preference to one side over the other and giving thereader all the information they need to form their own opinion. I felt connected with both main characters used to explore these debates, and Sanderson delivers an ending that gives a great pay off for both characters.<br /><br />Speaking of the two main characters, Shai and Gaotona are a fantastic pair of polar opposites who are connected by their passion for knowledge and understanding. These fierce enemies at the start build a unique relationship, and watching both of them grow throughout the story is rewarding in itself. Sanderson tries to introduce more characters and tries to give them importance in the story, but these characters end up feeling a bit tacked on and they take away from the main character conflict between Shai and Gaotona.<br /><br />The Emperor's Soul is a fantastic addition to Sanderson's already bulging bibliography. At 175 pages, it is on the short side, but unlike his previous attempts you really feel like you get a full story in these 175 pages. For those big Sanderson fans, there are a number of neat little Cosmere Easter eggs scattered throughout this story, but you don't need any knowledge of prior Sanderson works to fully appreciate this novel. This is an easy recommendation to every fantasy reader out there.

B006BDHAX0|5.0|This game is so much fun!  I usually get bored quickly after playing Mahjong for a while, but instead of reading, I have found myself staying up much too late playing this version of Mahjong!  It's addictive!  I think it's the thrill of trying to beat the clock, that makes it so much fun.<br />The puzzles are not too hard, yet not too easy.  Since there are so many puzzles, I feel like I will never run out.<br />I like that you can change the background too.  When your eyes get tired you can just change the background and you feel fresh and ready to play some more.  It even has Christmas-themed backgrounds.<br />Overall, this is one of the best Majong games I've ever come across.

B001ANSSDC|1.0|I downloaded the book to read after seeing the movie. I really enjoyed the movie and based on the standard of &#34;the book is better than the movie&#34; immediately purchased it. I was sadly disappointed as the two stories could not be more different. I will not go into great detail so as to not ruin either for anyone but where the movie is focused on relationships and builds some suspense the book is flat lined and focuses mostly on watching football games. I also felt the voice of the book was incredibly childlike and hard to sympathize for. I would like to say that seeing the movie first is what spoiled this book for me but I am certain that I never would have enjoyed it regardless.

B004BLDD9Y|4.0|Instant on (some LEDs have a delay of a second or so); bright but not \\"burned-in-image-on-your-retina\\" bright; very pleasing, almost incadescent warm color (most LEDs - and I've tried quite a few, most from right here on Amazon - are bluish to some extent regardless of what they say in their advertisement). Just slightly smaller than a regular incandescent bulb, which I find to be advantageous in a lot of situations - but still large enough for an old-fashioned clip-on lamp shade to grab hold of. Like any LED but unlike CFLs, instant full brightness and almost no perceptible heat. Only downsides: a) it does have that annoying bulge at the bottom so it won't fit into the super-long, super-narrow neck of my kitchen fixture (but oddly, some CFLs do fit); and of course b) new technology so it remains to be seen if they really last as long as promised, they said the same thing about CFLs and they don't last a fraction as long as the hype indicated. I liked this bulb so much I ordered ten, and then I ordered another ten (I installed a small generator with limited power output so I am motivated to cut down my power draw as much as possible).

B000KIPT30|1.0|This is the worst product I ever purchased. I was gonna use it to listen to my vinyl records but it sounds way too bad.The songs were just distorted and gave me a headache 5 seconds in. I don't even know how a product is this bad. I thought maybe something with the analog vinyl just wasn't working right so I tried it out on the most basic digital music device, an iPod Nano. Same thing happened, completely unlistenable music. So it just didn't work all together so i'm gonna send it back and get a different one that might give me a USEFUL product that is listenable.

B007WFTFG6|5.0|Keeps my 3 year old nephew entertained when I shop or have to run errands.  I would highly recommend this for toddlers
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is an amazing game with great graphics and a cute feel to it. I don't usually like games like this but this deserves a five-star review. It does get annoying in some aspects (it notifies you if your habitat is full with coins) and the fact that it takes so long to collect 'gems '. But overall this is a great game and I highly reccomend it to everyone.
030758836X|1.0|from the beginning to the end. I never believed the characters and felt duped from the beginning. I compare this books popularity to the appreciation of the mundane and the lowering of standards running rampant in society today, in the art world, with reality TV & with the endless talent show parades of one note un-remarkable performances.In so many of the online reviews the readers who liked this book feel the need to explain and even teach why the book is supposedly great but reading is a personal experience..you either relate to the story and enjoy the experience or you dont. No amount of dissection of the story and defending the author's motives can make another person like a book. I disliked the book so much and complained about it the entire time while reading it but forged ahead with fairness to the author and the hype. In truth i found not one likeable or believable character in the book. Even Boney came off as half baked to me.<br /> Now that it's over, I am so glad to be on with my life and rid of the thing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I couldn't wait to read the second book. If you can get through all the sex stuff, it gets a little monotonous then the rest of the book is really interesting.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is absolutely awesome!  It deserves 10 stars out of 5!  Even my 6 and 8 year old LOVE listening to it!  The Piano Guys are absolutely talented not to mention inspiring!  The way they use music that touches all generations is absolutely beautiful!  I have yet to hear an arrangement I don't like, and that's saying something, because as a musician, I have a reputation for being a musical snob in my opinions of music.  Every house should have a copy of this CD.  It enriches every person who listens to it!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|There really was a little too much sex.. of course all the books were the same though so no surprise. The story line was really good  in all three books but it the sex got a little old. I liked them but the epilogue was really the best. A book on Christians view point would be interesting reading.
B003JJA59K|3.0|This movie was good but beingthat it was based on the book by Cormac McCarthy, I think it was significantly inferior. As is the case with most book-to-movie scripts, a lot of detail was left out from the book. It's still a moving story of survival and how even though there is &#34;bad&#34; in humanity, there is also a lot of &#34;good&#34; that comes natural to us all.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Interesting story and plot.  Great descriptions of his ocean trek and the hardships encountered.  Some descriptions may be off putting to those with tender stomachs.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|None of them can watch the movies without the &#34;home made&#34; popcorn.  It's a tradition to watch movies when the grans stay overnight. Sometimes I wonder if they really want to watch the movie or just eat the popcorn! LOL  BUT it's always a happy time and I love having them stay with me.
0061733199|5.0|I have the first edition and now the revised edition.  These books are great to keep nearby at all times but especially when hiking, back packing, camping, hunting trips, etc.  You may never know when this fine tool and catalog of knowledge will come in useful and wish you had it rather than not.  Great book, some interesting facts.  By the way  there are certain things that are actually fun to practice just as a single or group activity.
0743496736|5.0|I am a big fan of most of Picoult's work, but this is probably her best. Both heartbreaking and heart warming in places, this novel really runs the gamut of human emotions. As she often does, she really makes you identify with and feel for many of her characters, particularly the protagonists. Also as usual, she manages to make you really see multiple sides of a controversial, emotional topic.<br /><br />That said, the book is not without flaws. One thing that stuck out to me re-reading this book for the second time was that she seems to run the gamut of teenage issues; it's almost like she is trying to create a montage of teenage problems. No book can be all things to all people on all issues, and I feel that at times she seems to be trying to do that here. Fortunately, she doesn't go too far (in my opinion), and it doesn't really detract from the overall quality and enjoyability of the book.<br /><br />I also think she slips up a bit on the legal points, which is of course understandable given that (to my knowledge) she has no legal training. For one, I'm very skeptical of Alex's rise to judgeship so young and so early in her career; particularly at the federal level I found that a bit difficult to swallow. I also believe her portion about bail was inaccurate; she states that the state has a law making withholding bail compulsory in Peter's situation, which I believe is unconstitutional (don't quote me, it's been two years since my Criminal Procedure course). That also may be a function of the book's date; it may not have been unconstitutional when she was writing. I also think the prosecutor's powerpoint for her opening statement probably wouldn't be allowed; she's using items that haven't been admitted into evidence yet (and may never be admitted into evidence), which is a big no-no.<br /><br />I also think she almost went too far in humanizing the shooter and demonizing the victim's - almost, but not quite. She seems to be good at toeing the line between enough and too much.<br /><br />Overall this book was really exemplary; she tackles tough issues and really makes you think, and feel for the people involved. I challenge anyone to read this book and come away without truly thinking and feeling about the topic at hand. Kudos to Picoult.and too much.<br /><br />Overall this book was really exemplary; she tackles tough issues and really makes you think, and feel for the people involved.

0618154248|5.0|I used these books as part of a baby shower centerpiece, but they will be the beginning of his library.  Read to children early if you want them to succeed!  Curious George stories are perfect for boys and girls!
B009VB97EY|3.0|Ive never been to a show so this was a wakeup call for me.  i enjoyed Majoc mike cause I enjoy his dancing and....rest is annoying especially they never develop the love between the only stable woman in the movie.  Sorry for the spoiler but true.
6305388458|5.0|Some might consider this unholy, but I love it's take on how we take ourselves too seriously at times. Once again, I think they have assembled a fabulous group.
B005LAIHSQ|4.0|Why is everyone dumping on Kristen Stewart? Sure she started in some pretty corny teen movies about vampires with bulging pecs etc etc but she has grown as an actress in my opinion and I think her performance was quite believable within the realms of the story being told here.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|The Black Box continues the good read tradition of the Harry Bosch series.<br />Although, there were no last minutes twists and the majority of the book focuses on catching the baddies rather then identifying them, it was a great read from start to finish.
B009LROCJI|5.0|Recomposed lets you explore The Four Season as if you've never heard it before. I fell in love with it all over again.
B001AQMBNC|4.0|Jeff Bridges does a superb job playing the alien &#34; Starman.&#34; Old school sci-fi from the 80s but still many good twists and turns.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Some moving, some just plain fun. Interesting lyrics and great music. Although Ho Hey is on the charts, my favorites are Flapper Girl and Classy Girls. This group is talented!
B002RBZ13Q|3.0|The concert was okay. If you like the Killers you will probably enjoy the concert very much. My husband really likes the band but I'm not their biggest fan. I like a few songs but not love love love them.
B004EI3ON4|4.0|I downloaded this afte rewatching the movie and have enjoyed listening to it for the past couple of days.<br /><br />If you like the music in the movie then this is for you.  My daughter bougth the Daft Punk CD from a few years ago and it doesnt really have the same sound.
B0019HQIFE|4.0|I like John Mayers music a lot. I think this concert was strange that he had the trio singing portion. I could have done without that but overall the quality is very good
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app works well.  I like the different features (hourly temp, daily temp, and other cool stuff I don't really use).  Special weather alerts are a nice bonus.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I am usually not a fan of the &#34;classics&#34;, but this book is great. I will re-read this book many times.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I give this book only two stars. The beginning of the book is a true page turning murder mystery but the ending totally sucks.  I think the author must have had a case of writers block.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This movie is just wonderful. Growing up with the over-exposure of this movie, I never gave it much of a chance until I was an adult. I am glad I did. It is a wonderful example of everything that is right with the human condition. The quality of the blu-ray is awesome. Though I could do without them having ever colorized it. Great movie and great purchase.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|I really liked this story. A very enjoyable read and fun continuation of a childhood favorite of mine. Would recommend it to others.
B005FMZX9Q|4.0|Si bien funciona perfecto y luce muy bien. Es un tanto pesado en la mu&ntilde;eca.<br />Para usar en ocasiones especiales y no en el d&iacute;a a d&iacute;a.
B00AA0TJO8|2.0|Really think this is probably a good game but resolution is all wrong for Kindle Fire, which makes it unplayable. Fix this &amp; you'll get a better rating.
B000YHG72E|5.0|This movie is hilarious and good fun for the whole family.  My wife and I watch this movie every year at Christmas.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I didn't know if I would like this at all, but I find it very informative.  You will love it!
B008K7PS1Q|5.0|this album was everything i was hoping it would be.  i had only heard three of songs on youtube and absolutely loved them.  decided to get the cd and was not disappointed.  definitely recommend!
B008FRFN7A|1.0|Just another item of something you think might be just what you want and then, you find it isn't.  Will try to be more careful next time.
B007EECSFA|3.0|It started out hard to get into but I stuck with it and it came trough.  Very touching with this woman who only want to be happy and regretted in the end how she got it.  Life is funny that way!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I was so excited to see the Kindle finally get a pinterest app.  I am definately a pin head and love to look at all the information and ideas on this wonderful site and now I can do it from my Kindle Fire.  Would recommend this to a friend.
B005FLX1HS|5.0|Great service all around, Item was just as they said it would be. Thanks a bunch! Would recommend to anyone.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|They are really amazing, I haven't listened such a nice music for a looong time. Titanium cover is my favorite and Pachelbel's canon in d. I keep watching their videos also on Youtube. Creative and passionate. I am lucky that I found their music via youtube. It's an all day music. You can listen to them wherever you are and whenever you want.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book was not just a story about killing Osama Bin Ladin, but also a wonderful insight to the dedication and work that the SEALS perform. The book is written with excitement on each page.
B001O03NCW|5.0|Needed a group of folk songs, heard this was good...<br />and you know what? It wasn't good, it was GREAT.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Van Morrison still has it. One of the best, if not the best, songwriters today. Every track is a gem!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very good story, kind of slow starting out, but necessary because he builds everything up and it works out very well in the end. I really enjoyed the strory line even though I don't read very many legal type books, but I would recommend this book.
B006P96PAO|5.0|I loved it. Teaches biblical values - trusting in the Lord and values for living courage and having friends you can rely on.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I like the format, ease of aquiring information and the amount of information it provides; and it's very easy to use
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|I liked how Batman Begins had a slight sense of realism to it. This one went over the top in the &#34;oh come on&#34; factor.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This is a well done adaptation from the original VHS done back in the 80's.  The only drawback is that it is in the original 4X3 format rather than widescreen common now.  Very reasonably priced, all should buy and enjoy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun and not stressful.....  I recommend this to anyone for relaxation.  It also had different variations as well.
B009ESIGHI|4.0|This is a well done update of the Muppet Christmas Carol in BluRay format.  It does not have the song included in the VHS version, but I believe too much is made of that omission.  It's much more enjoyable to watch in high definition format.  It should be part of everyone's Christmas collection.
B008EZVNO0|1.0|I' ll make it easy on you. If you liked Van's last 2 cd's you' ll like this one go right ahead.<br /><br />If you are a long time fan, waiting for another  transcendental music experience, a \\"state of wonder\\", a moment of brilliance that has made you anticipate each release and a dedicated fan despite a uneven discography......do yourself a favor and skip this release.<br /><br />I won't go through a blow by blow analysis of the music as it is painful. I'll just say what Van has committed is a cardinal offense, the music is BORING. Ironically he laments about \\"phony pseudo jazz\\" yet there isn't t a cut on this CD that wouldn't be comfortable in any elevator on the planet.<br /><br />If you feel that Van's latest releases lack the depth, emotion and, yes, soul you crave from him then this release will leave you flat.<br /><br />One star as the pipes are still fine and it is a good band in a bad situation. Oh, one other thing, there are so many talented saxophone players that know what an alto should sound like please lay yours down Van and hire one of those Blue Note pros you claim to admire
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Pure Genius is what The Piano Guys are. I LOVE music and they come out with some of the best stuff out there. The best mashups ever created...Thank you, Piano Guys, for making music even more enjoyable than it was.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I first saw this film when my girls were little.  It was a go-to every holiday season.  Now we are watching with the grandkids we are raising and its a favorite of theirs, too.  The muppets out-act Michael Caine at every turn.
B0098VXBIA|5.0|I laughed so hard the whole entire movie. I have 3 kids, and could totally relate to the characters. My husband thought the &#34;Dad's club&#34; in the movie was pretty funny.<br />If you have kids, i'm sure you'll enjoy the comical view on childbirth.
B008FDOS66|2.0|I have been a life long Skynyrd fan, but this album misses their famous sound. It seems more \\"mainstream\\" than Southern Rock . Of course I will buy it, but I doubt it will grow on me. I just plain do not like any songs.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|I don't know what I expected, but I got so much more. Neil Young and Crazy Horse take the songs we've all known since childhood and Crazy-Horses them up. Very enjoyable!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the continuation of the life and love of Grey.  If you read book 1 then book two is a must.
B00979CS50|5.0|I have to admit I keep playing Driftin' Back over and over. I know it has a message about sound quality in mp3, and I get that, but I just drift back while listening. For me, Neil is never better than with Crazy Horse.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Extremely different type of love story, but one that makes a person think would I consent to this type of relationship or enjoy this type of intimacy!!!!!
B005G5PPGS|4.0|If you like baseball this is the book for you great story about Oakland success. Now want to see movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|the finalization of cementing a love between two people.  This is the best conclusion to book 1&2.  I loved all three.
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|this is what my nephews wished that santa will bring them.....you were the first place that i looked....i knew that i could count on you-fast.
B00886XQO0|4.0|I came from a TB x41 headset which I thought was really nice.  But this definitly is a step up from that.  Very nice features, Bluetooth is awesome.  Presets are a little tough to figure out.  the software from TB which you download, is the hard part to understand!  Unless you have a degree in music editing youll be shooting in the dark trying to customize the headset presets.  TB could have done a better job with making the software easier to understand.  Besides that I would buy again!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Everything they do is magical. They have a gift for interpreting each piece and making it their own. Love,love,love everything they've done.They are my favorite section on my itunes playlist.I would highly recommend to anyone needing a lift.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|Overall a good movie, but not as good as The Dark Knight.  And Bane's and Batmans Modulated voice really gets annoying.
B00296A4F4|5.0|Love love love this show.  Love the dancing and singing and the comedy and drama.  It is a great show
030758836X|3.0|This book took some time to get in to, it starts slow and then grabs you and hooks you in.  I was extremely disappointed with the ending.  I felt sorry for Nick and I hated Amy throughout.
B0012HEB32|3.0|It was nothing like the movies but I still enjoyed it, was disappointed that it didn't succeed and it was cancelled
0060578793|4.0|this book is so long and detailed i dont know where to start. Gives good advice and my favorite part is showing poisonous plants and animals and where they can be found. I would recommend it
B007THA4FI|3.0|More adult than her other books, nothing like Harry Potter.  Obviously not as good as the teen books she writes
B009SIE6AA|4.0|If you like JT's style, this CD will appeal to you. There's a hint of jazz in the first few selections; the second half is more mellow and laid back. The most interesting tracks were numbers 7 and 10. Taylor's arrangement of the Beatles' song &#34;Here Comes The Sun&#34; (Track 7) is slower and sounds a bit more melancholy. Track 10 is his take on &#34;Oh Christmas Tree,&#34; but sung in French. I've heard plenty of versions of this song, mostly in English and German; hearing it in French was a pleasant surprise. He sounds like he's truly having fun on his duet with Natalie Cole, &#34;Baby, It's Cold Outside.&#34; If you're looking for a change of pace from traditional Christmas music, and if you're a fan of James Taylor, you will like this CD.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My daughters loved the book and then they went to see the movie and they loved that too, I still have to read it.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I loved Gone Girl, so as soon as I finished it I bought Dark Places.  The storyline alternates between the main charcter's present day life and her past life.  The story of the past is told from two other character's points of view.  It was facinating how each character perceived the same events in different ways and how this affected their actions.  The story of the past unfolds slowly and suspensefully.  A true tale of a situation getting terribly out of hand in just a single day.  I would never describe myself as an avid mystery reader, but based on my enjoyment of Flynn's novels, perhaps I am.
B003Q97D48|3.0|I only watched a few episodes because I think it's horrible but my teenage daughter loves the show, it is a teen soap opera
B0030B624E|5.0|Best dark comedy I have seen in a while. A fresh idea in a Hollywood that needs more fresh ideas and less remakes.I need a Twinkie.
B0044CBMVG|5.0|I watch every season and I still enjoy it, some of the story lines are repetitive but the main characters keep it interesting
B0079J28NW|5.0|Mesmerizing animation, low tech, and brilliant! Sweet story and of course terrific music. Loved it then, love it now. Get it for your kids and grandkids and watch with them You will not be sorry!
B005LAII80|5.0|I am a major film snob. But I have to say that this film is easily one of my top 10 favorite films. It's simple, fun, exciting, refreshing and just freakin' cool. A shame it didn't do well in the theaters, but I will preorder it on Blu-Ray and enjoy it forever.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Awesome trilogy set! I sold my previous DVD-versions of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. I'm glad I have the Blu-ray versions now since I finally acquired a Blu-ray player.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is worthy of the great reviews. Loved the form- one so based in reality as we all see the same thing from subjective ego-centric perspectives. And as such, it's a gripping cliff hanger.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie came out just in time for the Holiday season! I gave it to my brother as a gift. We watched it already. :)
B0083SBJXS|5.0|The DVD came exactly as advertised and came in a timely manner.  It also came at a good price.  We have watched it several times now.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|i recommend this product, quality is nice,  and motion sensor works correctly,  i like it, i didnt use it very often, only vhen i am in village house
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I just run this regularly on my tv for background calmness when I'm cooking or doing the laundry.  Love the visuals some of the best available on Blu-Ray
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book was wonderful - took the essence of simple time and showed what time really means and how precious it is to everyone in a different way.  Very very good!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books in the whole wide world!!!!! I don't curse on reviews like this cause it's just wrong, who agrees????
B0014KFV6I|5.0|A timeless collection of great songs.<br />Any Carole King fan must have this album.<br />Surprises in the style of songs on this album.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I played this music last week for my 9 yr old daughter and we were enthralled!!!  We had to find and watch every video on youtube!!!!  I shared with everyone on Facebook and sent links to those not on Facebook.<br /><br />This is a new family favorite!!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Starts out with two or three colors then each successive page<br />gets more colored dots to connect.  Got my best friend hooked on<br />it also. Some seem too hard to crack then 'BAM' it just clicks and<br />on you go to the next one. Love it.  Also believe it helps my<br />memory when I have to start the same game over.
1453693319|5.0|I had to read this book for AP Literature class, and it was a really good book! One of the classics.
B008G59IBI|4.0|Man, I have said it countless times before, and I will proudly say it at least once more again: Green Day is pure, hardcore, pro-capitalist, money-making, radio- and Disney Channel-friendly punk at its very best! If you don't think that Green Day and drummer Tre Cold are the most hardcore incarnation of punk since the Sex Pistols and the Dead Kennedys, then you must be a poser-teen who loves watching Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel!<br /><br />I also tremendously respect and enjoy how Green Day have just become increasingly loyal to the punk ethos. A great example of this is putting out a \\"new\\" \\"CD\\" every couple of months since last September in order to make as much money as absolutely possible and cement their reigning status among the 1-percenters of America and the world! If this is not the very epitome of anti-establishment rebellion and social justice that punk epitomizes, then I bet you also think that Barack Obama is just a wealth-redistributing socialist Marxist!!!!<br /><br />Anywho, on to the songs, all of which are the very embodiment of punk rawk! Take Brutal Love, as just one example, the unbelievably catchy pop hooks and woo-woo choruses easily make it among the very best pure-punk songs that have ever been devised. To boot, Tre's mad drumming--that is easily at home on a Hannah Montana record or, better yet, a Spice Girls live DVD offering!--is just punktastic! This can easily be said about many of the songs on Tre because Green Day is so, you know, original and not derivative at all with their songs. A Little Boy Named Train is a bit of a weird inclusion here because it is all about Green Day's love and devotion to the band Train. However, now that I have thought about this for a little bit longer, I agree that its inclusion makes perfect sense since Train, too, is the very epitome of one of the hardest, most aggressive and anti-establishment punk bands that has ever crawled out of the San Fran Bay Area (Hi Nancy Pelosi!!).<br /><br />In short, I urge you to go out right now and purchase Tre, thereby helping Green Day perhaps become among the even more elitist 0.5-percenters! Now that Obama has won reelection with a stunning and powerful mandate that is defined by barely getting more than 50 percent of Americans' votes! If you don't buy Tre, then I guess you're just a Nick and Disney Channel poser!urge you to go out right now and purchase Tre, thereby helping Green Day perhaps become among the even more elitist 0.5-percenters!

B0053O89IS|5.0|This season was just as good as the rest of them. Always fun to watch the funny chemistry between these two.
B00A50PE6K|5.0|I have said it plenty of times before: More music has to sound like the type of music that emanates from the highly talented actor-singers of Glee, who have single-handedly revolutionized the music world with their brutally copious amounts of autotune, covers of more popular singers' songs, and lip synching awesomeness!! When you hear even just one minute of any Glee cast karaoke cover, you immediately forget about the so-called \\"good\\" singers of the past! I mean, Elvis who? John Lennon what? Freddy Mercury who?! You get the point, girlfriend!<br /><br />And so, I am receiving this CD with arms wide open because I see it as the true messiah this Xmas season of the winter solstice, non-denominational festivity. One thing about it is that it will instantly make you forget about the so-called \\"great singers\\" who previously sang these traditional winter solstice songs. Bing Crosby who?!?!? Judy Garland who?! The Glee cast of overly talented actors who also double as lip-synching singers abusing autotune like crazy OWN all these Xmas songs, homes!! There can be no doubt about it...unless, of course, you also believe that Barack Obama cares about the poor. Psych!<br /><br />Lemme tell ya that I absolutely hated Bing Crosby's version of White Christmas more than Barack Obama hates moving people off of food stamps. I mean to hear Bing Crosby sing White Christmas, you have to tolerate his old-dude voice and his slow-minded way of singing. It is almost as bad as having to listen to an Obama press conference where he strategically refuses to answer a reporter's question and then beats around the bush for 15 minutes until no one can even make sense of what he's talking about! The same goes for the f/u/g/ly Judy Garland version of Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas. I mean, c'mon! That song suffers from Garland's bad voice that doesn't have the range, control and depth of a brilliant singer such as Ke$ha!!<br /><br />I'm glad the autotune-happy and vocal overdub-crazy Glee cast of 30-somethings playing teenagers has taken over these Xmas songs. White Christmas sounds a zillion times better when Leah Michelle, Cory Monteith and the geeky-looking cripple-kid in the oversized wheelchair croon with all of the autotune power in the world! The same exact thing goes for Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas, which sounds a trillion times better when the Glee cast whips out its messianic autotune power, harmonizes with its actor-singer voices, and reimagines the song in such a way that an elementary school production for Asperger's syndrome kids would be proud.<br /><br />What else can I say to add even more helpings of utter praise on this CD? Just go out and buy this CD. Please, you'll do yourself a favor, and you will also help the Glee cast of unbelievably talented actor-singers save the music world from horrible musicians like Barbra Streisand, Mumford and Sons and Led Zeppelin.ast of 30-somethings playing teenagers has taken over these Xmas songs.

B00932A2MC|3.0|Good action movie.  Nothing heavy, just good entertainment.  It is nice to see that the screen writer pulled a naval maneuver from the war of 1812.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I try to expose my kids to a wide variety of music, but they don't generally like music \\"without words\\"...  They love this!  The Piano Guys are great and our whole family loves the album!  Thanks!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|i was impressed that the delivery was right on time. the packaging was great ,there was no damage at all.i love the movie in the theaters,so i could hardly wait to get my own copy to watch over and over again.i would recommend amazon to others whom would like to purchase from this site.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Thank you for putting together such a wonderful cd. I love the variety of songs.<br />I also enjoy watching your videos on you tube.<br />Thanks again.
0345803507|2.0|You kind of get tired of reading about how often they have sex and how many ways can you describe the orgasm.  But I will give the author credit for at least writing about sex in an interesting, informative, way that women can enjoy.  I just wish the story had a little more adventure and suspense to it.
B004G6TD4S|5.0|Got this when I was 14 years old and have always been a fan, saw them in High school with full orchestra and choir.
B005F3XV62|4.0|This a real good movie and the copy was good as well we have watched it several times and will watch it again
B008XX6J4C|5.0|After all the songs that I have listened to by the piano guys, including this album, I have found only one problem...They don't have more Albums!! This album is nothing short of spectacular. I recommend this to everyone who wants to give their ears a nice gift.
030758836X|2.0|There was so much hype about this book, but I wisely waited until it was available in the library. The plot is so ridiculous and incredulous that it seemed as though the author was making it up as she went along. A lot of it was predictable, but the twists and turns were as nonsensical as the basic storyline. The book went on much too long and had a very unsatisfying ending. The only character I liked was Boney. I'll say one thing for the author: she does the male POV perfectly, but unfortunately that does not merit more than 2*.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|Always a classic! Hilarious and really puts you in the Christmas spirt. If you like comedy's especially the vacation movies this is for you!
B00723NWJE|5.0|This is a great effort by Norah Jones.  I love this CD and look forward to more like it in the future.
B008G59IBI|5.0|Well, this is the final stop of our big journey, Tre. No matter what some people might think about the idea of making three albums instead of one complete set, I think this was a great experience for the band as well as their fans.<br />Tre is a stand out because it has that Green Day vibe that most people love them for, and in some parts it reminds me of their previous albums like Nimrod, Warning, American Idiot, and 21CB stuck ck all together in one album, but with more simple and shorter songs. Brutal Love is a wonderful ballad which is great to listen while getting up in the morning; Missing You is kind of mix of Nimrod and American Idiot features; 8th Avenue Serenade is my personal favorite with its unusual stops and exceptional harmonies; X-Kid is another fans' favorite song; Drama Queen is a really pretty ballad that was performed live already three years ago; Sex, Drugs, and Violence could perfectly fit on Uno since it has some pop-punk vibe; Little Boy Named Train was the one that I didn't dig at first but eventually got used to; Walk Away is a great song and sounds like it could be a single of the Warning album; Dirty Rotten Bastards is probably one of the most fun songs Green Day has ever made; 99 Revolutions is another stand out, though chorus is on the loop, which makes the song a little repetitive; The Forgotten is a perfect ending ballad, and I am not surprised that \\"The Twilight\\" movie picked the song as one of their dominants.<br /><br />Anyways, I am glad to hear some new songs from these guys. They really deserve much more attention than they currently have. Rock is literally dying, and all people have now is old records of The Beatles, The Stones, The Who, and other great artists that made wonderful music. Fortunately, Green Day are still making a good stuff, and we should be thankful for still hearing some new good songs.<br /><br />Thank you, Green Day.

B0002F6AH0|5.0|I remember the first time I saw this on public TV.  I was very young when I first saw the series, but there was something sincere, and humane, about the work that made me want to watch.  From the excellent theme by Carl Davis, to the unflinching look at the malevolence of man, it's a landmark production that makes you understand the human condition.  It, along with \\"Come and See\\", the disquieting movie by Elem Klimov, seems to fearlessly look evil in the face, and makes the case for fighting against evil for the sake of good, and not for the sake of jingoistic nationalism, or profit, or the settling of old scores.  At 22 hours, it's just scratching the surface, but it does an excellent job of educating the viewer.  It will change your view of WWII and of war in general.
1419705849|5.0|My son doesn't like reading much but he will read this series. I know he'll injoy it & the price was great too.
1611761069|5.0|As always, enjoyed this audiobook from Patricia Cornwell. The narrator does an excellent job bringing the book to life.<br />Fully met my expectations.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This definitely rates 5 stars! For me, this series is nail-biting and had me wondering who's next......I like the incorporation of friendship, love, growing up, sticking together, and fighting back. You will love this if you like the hypothetical existence of Zombies. I would recommend this to any intriguing minds. This fierce drama had me on the edge! Of course once I purchased season 1......I had to see more.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Excellent mixture of history and fiction. Despite that I don't share the author's lone gunman point of view, I just couldn't stop reading until the end.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|The author of this book did a wonderful job of describing her experiences and perspectives.  This could not have been an easy task given the limitations of human languages compared to the apparent richness of what she experienced.
0345803485|5.0|I bought the book expecting greateness and that is what I got. The book was great and came quickly in great condition.
0812979656|5.0|I believe I bought this as a used item but it came as good quality with no writing inside, which I appreciate.
B007V65R54|1.0|Not what one expects from a book categorized as \\"math & science\\". Maybe better listed as \\"history\\" or \\"business\\".<br />This is why we need book stores.<br />Don't expect to come away with much in the way of tools to use in identifying the signal from the noise. It reads more like a \\"hay, look at me\\" book.<br />Maybe Nate should read some of Leonard Mlodinow's works. I would recommend his \\"The Drunkard's Walk...\\" a far better and more useful book.<br />Nate should stick to playing poker watching the Red Socks.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this is so awesome I even got my dad to get it (I have only had this for like 2days but so far I LOVE IT) :)
B007THA4FI|1.0|I was really disappointed with this book. I love to read & I was looking forward to this novel. I must say, it is one of the worst books I have read. It took long to actually understand the story.  Too many characters. Story all over the place. Not worth the money or the time to read this.
1881273156|4.0|Our preacher recommended this book to us when we did our marriage counseling. I definitely recommend this book! It helps you not only understand your partner, and how they're motivated - but also helps you understand yourself! Only reason it didn't get 5 stars... once you know your language and know your spouse's language, you expect them to start acting on it! Sometimes knowledge is ammunition! Overall a good, easy, helpful read.
B009NTNHJU|4.0|Well good news first:<br /><br />The eight new songs on re up are really great. There's Va Va Voom from the deluxe version. Though it follows the marketing strategy of Lady Gaga's Fame Monster, Ke$ha's Animal/Cannibal and Lana Del Rey's Paradise edition. Release an EP and then bundle it with the original album.<br /><br />Dear Old Nicki, the woman with da penile complex. If you listen to the lyrics, quite a lot of it is about having a d!@k and the various things you can do with it. Basically a lot of it is aural porn. Get a strap on Nicki and get it out of your system.<br /><br />Then of course there's Roman Reloaded - a very fun mix of pop, rap and dance. The hits Starships, Pound The Alarm, Right By My Side and the cracker Stupid Hoe. Really love Whip It and Automatic, very dance crazy. Cash Money put in the standard version here.<br /><br />Ok the bad:<br /><br />Nicki was complaining on Billboard.com that Target did not want to stock The Re-Up. After viewing the 90 minute documentary, I agree with Target. It does feature lots of fellow celebs, backstage footage and minimal concert clips. But it's just Nicki hugging her friends, fans and making small talk. Ok, there's a little of Nicki with some strippers but do not expect Truth Or Dare here. At least Madonna did ham it up for the camera to make an enjoyable film. The Re-Up is just very blah, very superficial and yes the music industry is dog eat dog. Then again which industry isn't? One rapper said the business is hostile - better not do that to fans since people can download for free. Not much insights into Nicki the person. Shelve the documentary instead and fill the disc with remixes.<br /><br />The DVD do not contain any of her music videos as some write ups have claimed.<br /><br />The lyrical content can be verbally abusive, unpleasant and extremely vulgar to listeners. This could be one reason that the album did not sell more than expected.<br /><br />The album gets my vote for worst packaging and design.Nicki's loud, colourful and flamboyant. So the cover shot is really off putting. And I hate digipak. Why make it so hard to take out the discs? I'll end up tearing the sleeve.<br /><br />The South East Asian edition printed the discs wrong. The artwork for The Re-Up is on Roman Reloaded and vice versa. A deliberate mistake?<br /><br />Still, at the local store, this is going for the same price as a single CD. So the two fantastic CDs make this a great buy.<br /><br />My personal preference is the deluxe version because of the additional dance pop stuff like Turn Me On and Masquerade. The splash paint artwork is also a lot more vibrant and colourful. If you like more rap, then Re-Up is the way to go.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Avengers is a great movie.  Awesome and a must add to the movie library.  But this includes 3-D, Blu-Ray, DVD, and Digital.  You are covered in any format.  A real deal when you think the DVD alone costs $15.  Gift one.  This is a real steal.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I LOVE the Piano Guys!<br />When I'm at work, I'll open their YouTube channel and stream all of their videos.<br />So, when their CD was released for sale, my fiance' bought it for me...and it's been playing in my car ever since.<br />I can't even pick a favorite track...Thousand Years and Michael Meets Mozart are in the top two.<br />These guys are very talented, and do wonderful work. I look forward to seeing what's to come in the future for them. :)

Unfortunately, the writing on this movie could have been so much better. I felt as though the story did not develop fully and could have been best served over a series of movies than just one.

B00AHXDECG|5.0|Simply put, Bruno Mars' Unorthodox Jukebox is an excellent album.  Bruno stays true to his pop/soul style while showing that his voice is capable of numerous styles.<br /><br />Personally I don't always listen to pop music, but Bruno Mars' voice seems to have a huge range, he's gritty, smooth, soulful, sharp, and gentle when it's called upon.  He does all of this while maintaining a relaxed timbre and cool about his voice.  It just a joy to listen to!  In fact his style reminds me a bit of Michael and even some of the old Motown stuff like Smokey Robinson.<br /><br />Although Bruno definitely excels at what are sure to be hits like \\"Locked out of Heaven\\" of which sounds a bit like The Police, my favorite songs on this album are when his voice is unaltered.  \\"When I was your man\\" is a beautiful ballad that really shows his vocal range and is a really sweet song about a man who looks back on his younger days when he should have bought his love flowers and danced with her.  It's just a great tune and makes me wonder if I should have this song played at my wedding which is next year...not that I haven't bought her flowers...or for that matter danced with her...I swear I have, but maybe not enough!<br /><br />Other favorites of mine are \\"Natalie\\", \\"If I Knew\\" (which is especially old-timey), \\"Young Girls\\" and \\"Treasure\\".<br /><br />Overall this is a great album, definitely recommended if you like Bruno's first album, \\"Doo - Wops & Hooligans.\\"  He doesn't stray from his style while he definitely adds some tricks to his toolbox.  As usual his voice is easy and brilliant to listen to!  I also love that this music isn't overly mixed and lets his voice shine through.  Yeah Bruno!<br /><br />UPDATE:  DAY 2 of listening<br /><br />After giving this album an extended listen through headphones I can truly attest that Bruno's voice is not overly compressed or mixed to sound \\"fake\\" like on many other pop albums.  I really appreciate this especially when half the time I turn on the radio and every other song is auto-tune.  This is part of what draws me to Bruno so much.<br /><br />Secondly, this really is a throwback album.  I have read that others don't like how this album crosses genre's quite a bit.  Personally I like this, especially when Bruno pays homage to 50's, 60's and 80's music.  He does it justice, and I really enjoy hearing him do his own take by making some modern classics.  This album has an analog, refreshing feel to the way it was recorded and performed.  It's great to have a modern artist like Bruno doing this!<br /><br />UPDATE 3:  A month later<br /><br />This is one of those albums that has songs on it that you hear the first time and you have that \\"yeah...okay...pretty good\\" kind of thought.  But then for some reason the melodies get stuck in your head.  I'll find myself getting a ditty in my head and then hours later I'll realize I've had one of these songs trapped in my mind all day.  It's annoying, but makes me realize how catchy this crap is...!  Then I just have to listen to the song/album and it goes away.  Anyways...still highly recommended.!radio and every other song is auto-tune.  This is part of what draws me to Bruno so much.<br /><br />Secondly, this really is a throwback album.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|This music is beautiful and fun.  These men love what they do, you can hear it in their music.  \\"Peponi\\" is fantastic- my boys love to watch the video daily.  I actually enjoy it more than Coldplay's \\"Paradise\\".  My favorite, however, is \\"Over the Rainbow/Simple Gifts\\".  It is a beautiful song that is so uplifting and happy.  What I love most about their music is it's ability to lift my mood.  It is impossible to be grumpy while listening to music from The Piano Guys!
B009O07NDY|5.0|One of the most anticipated scores of the year, TH:AUJ was released simultaneously in two Two-Disc versions- regular and Special Edition.  The SE shines in that it includes several extended and bonus tracks that all but render the standard version obsolete from the outset.<br /><br />New to the Middle Earth soundscape is Bilbo's motif- based on the Shire theme everyone now know.  There's also a four-note theme that mostly appears on cello/lower strings in the darker moments.<br /><br />Howard Shore returns to the scene of his greatest achievement without missing a beat.  In a recent interview he reveals that he always kept the book series at hand while scoring the films as a reference.  He and Peter Jackson had already discussed preliminary ideas while working on the LoTR trilogy.  He also shares Tolkien's love of nature, which also inspired him.  Shore also relays that he first begins composing based on the story itself, creating the themes and leitmotifs, without referring to the visuals.  At a later date he expands upon these ideas to actually begin scoring based upon the particular scene.<br /><br />Shore also explains that each LoTR score was deliberately created for concert.  This one doesn't quite have the same feel; the tracks have excellent continuity and flow well into each other, but the unrelenting action and intensity of the second disc doesn't quite lend itself to an evening out.<br /><br />Some highlights:  *= denotes exclusive bonus track for the Special Edition.<br />Disc 1<br />01- My Dear Frodo:  Prologue/montage piece where we get to explore a lot of the themes and motifs we'll be hearing.  Early on there's a brief tease of what seems to be Bilbo's motif before switching to a quick Shire theme reprise.  Around the 2:00 mark things start to get a little darker and dire as the pounding drums arrive.  3:30 is when the choruses start- first a lilting boy's choir, then the men's choir takes over.  After 4:00 the really dark and heavy stuff arrives- timpanis, lower strings and trombones all on display, highlighted by Bilbo's motif on brass.  It finally starts winding down with a mystical, mysterious transition before returning to the mid-strings and brass to guide us out.  All in about eight minutes  (whew).<br /><br />04- Blunt the Knives*:  Bilbo's dwarven guests have a little fun at his expense.  Performed by the cast to a jig and reel tune.<br /><br />06- Misty Mountains:  Another from the dwarves.  This is the madrigal sung in the trailer as they reflect upon their quest.  Still, it's only an excerpt, as a more complete version comes later on the second disc.<br /><br />09- The Trollshaws*:  Explores a few of the cues heard earlier on, this marks the groups arrival in a dangerous part of Middle-Earth.  Notable for the four-note theme on cello used here.<br /><br />10- Roast Mutton (Extended):  Picks up right where Trollshaws left off;  continuing the same cues and theme exploration, but with a touch of playful string plucking and some bodhran drumming underneath in spots.  A very rousing brass/drum stretch occurs right in the middle, rising to a crescendo before bottoming out.<br /><br />14- The Hill of Sorcery:  A bit of Bilbo's motif mixed in with that now familiar four-note low string followed by some isolated violin rush.  Tubas carry most of the final couple of minutes before switching back to trombones and some odd effects tossed in.  Mysterious and ominous with a touch of curiosity best sums this one up.<br /><br />15- Warg Scouts:  Opens with a variant of that familiar four-noter on higher strings before picking up the pace with some very fine ranged percussion.  Strings carry the sense of urgency and danger, emphasized by tuba blasts.  Bilbo's motif gets a workout on brass as well.<br /><br />Disc 2<br />01- The Hidden Valley: Most likely for the group's arrival in Rivendell.  Foremost in the piece is a staggered seven-note slow progression supported by an ethereal boys choir chant and harp.<br /><br />06- Thunder Battle:  Enough percussion and brass here to make even Hans Zimmer feel good!  Steady and unrelenting tempo laid under mid and high-string flurries and rushes. The last minute or so is dominated by lots of high tension strings before decompressing a bit and rising back to finale of tuba blasts.<br /><br />08- Riddles in the Dark:  Begins with some low, rumbling cellos that lead into a now-familiar refrain concerning a certain ring.  More strings reintroduce another familiar piece for its former owner.  There's even some mandolin picking in the background, adding a touch of madness to the proceedings.<br /><br />09- Brass Buttons:  Keeps the same vein as \\"Riddles\\" and includes a bit of hammer percussion at the beginning.  The \\"Ring\\" motif remains and leads into a descent before the tempo rises on timpani and a male chorus.  Horns and high strings are employed very effectively here as well as Bilbo tries to get away from Gollum.<br /><br />10- Out of the Frying Pan:  First two minutes contain great action as it hits the ground running (pun intended) with more familiar themes across the whole brass spectrum supported by a great string ostinato.  A very slight breather via the boys chorus before resuming speed.  A mixed chorus with timpani and strings rises to carry us to the finale.  Good stuff!<br /><br />11- A Good Omen:  Begins with the boys choir and strings combining an uplifting sequence before dipping slightly back into the action and danger.  The tension levels off but never dissipates until just after three minutes where it switches into a reflective, somber yet relieved mood.  Ends on a crescendo of brass and rumbling timpani.<br /><br />12- Song of The Lonely Mountain (Extended Version):  a rousing, call to adventure performed by Neil Finn, former lead singer of Crowded House. As the obligatory pop song included on the score, it's a variant but complete version of the dwarven madrigal from the first disc.  An adventurous, enjoyable piece that still feels a bit out of place.<br /><br />Exclusive Bonus Tracks on Disc 2<br />A Very Respectable Hobbit- light, melodic tune about Bilbo's life in Bag End.<br />Erebor- Scottish flavored anthem comprised of bagpipes, bodhran and timpani drums, stately trumpets and complimentary strings for this excursion into the dwarven realm.<br />The Dwarf Lords- an extension of Erebor; chiefly variants on the previous track.<br />The Edge of the Wild- slight reprise of the Erebor motifs before switching into a darker mode, filled with unknown dangers.<br /><br />Previously the underappreciated John Carter score was my favorite for 2012, but this one takes the prize!  TH:AUJ is grandiose, expansive, adventurous, mystical, magical, energetic and imaginative while also down to earth, rock solid, poetic and poignant.  The Special Edition is the one you want!r />06- Thunder Battle:  Enough percussion and brass here to make even Hans Zimmer feel good!

There are more twists and turns than ever--often the reader thinks Harry Hole has finally found some peace and a life of love, but alas, it's not to be.  He's just as gone as ever.<br /><br />The plot twists here are better than ever--you can never tell what's going to happen next.  The book is spell-binding.

Don't let this be your first Reacher book to read.  Others are way more enjoyable.

While the Army had it bad in Europe...the Marines has it much worse with a sucidial and crazed enemy un like anyone has seen.
B002WV5A9G|5.0|I enjoyed JJ Abrams take on the series. The sequel should be arriving next summer and I also expect that to be equally entertaining. I'd recommend this to all the trekkies out there.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Great game. I play all the Angry Bird games and so do my children; plus my children love the Rio movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book, funniest book yet according to my 11 yr old.  My 13 yr old read it in1 day.  Pretty funny
B001NEK2GE|5.0|Great product, i use it in combination with my G700 mouse, so I have plenty of programmable buttons to play with. The software to assign keys different task is very easy to use and understand. I wasnt able to use it to play skyrim which was a bit disappointing but still a great gamepad.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|All that I can say to anyone who is thinking about buying this is, Don't think just get it. You will not be let down in anyway. These gentlemen are at the top of their game and will continue to astound us all for many years to come.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|Had numerous buttons to program but some of them in bad spots to reach. Didn't care much for the different profiles on the mouse, I like one universal custom setting. The storm tactics stuff didn't seem too easy to work with and i always had problems with the commands looping.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Excellent commentary on the lessons of history......\\"bread & circuses\\" reference couldn't be more apt right now!  If we forget, we are indeed doomed to repeat our mistakes.<br /><br />This trilogy is for young adults, but everyone will enjoy the story of Katniss Everdeen---Tribute for District 12, along with Peeta. Mellark, in the Hunger Games: a televised fight to the death against each other and children from all the other 11  Districts in the former US. The. Games are a Gladiator style battle with only one Victor each year____all children ages 12---18 are in the lottery-style drawing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the series, had a hard time putting the book down! Enjoyed the little bits at the end, especially the viewpoint of Christian.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|One of my favorite things about this CD is that I am able to use it so many ways.  I can use it to relax, to study, or just want to listen to good music.  As  a student it is nice to have a way to listen to music that like without the lyrics and the Piano Guys does it in such a fun and uplifting way.  I could listen to \\"Over the Rainbow/Simple Gifts\\" over and over again.  Thank you so much for your music!  Kept up the good work! God Bless!!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|My 10 year old said it is Awesome.  He loves putting it together every day<br />He is Excited to finish it.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|i got to the part where it says to open all the crates to see how ti free my friend. im stuck help me<br />love this game other than that
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If you've ever seen a performance of The Piano Guys, you get a feeling for how much these men love their music and take great pride in performing it accurately and with emotional appeal. The care and enjoyment by the performers carries over to the listener, helping them to enjoy the depth of the piece as well. They have clever compositions and some rockin' tunes. My family are big fans!
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Murakami has a style of his own.  English not being his first language, some essential nuances might be lost in translation.  However a worthy read, like books 1 & 2.
B00005JPCF|5.0|Couldn't find this locally! It arrived in a short time, and was in great shape when it arrived! I would deffinately recommend and order again!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I felt like this was a very good animated movie for children, as well as adults. It is very imaginative and vibrant.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I discovered the Piano Guys on Youtube with their first video. I love their music, it is the kind you can just listen to over and over and never get tired of it.  My DS now wants to take cello lessons:)
B009LXEBD4|4.0|Overall, this is a solid collection of hits. However, this is not a complete set. It is missing Low, I Do Not Hook Up, All I Ever Wanted, and Dark Side. Those songs got pretty good radio airplay and should have been included here.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys first album is wonderful.  Everything that they do is fun, high quality music that you can listen to over and over.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Even though the season is only half over I like the excitement and action in it compared to the previous season.  I also enjoy the duel story lines and cannot wait for the second half of the season to begin.
B004IV32HU|4.0|The movie is in black and white, which adds to the authenticity. Johnny Depp plays the role well. All star cast.
B006O6F932|5.0|Was delivered on time. Just as the picture described, bought this for my grand-daughter for Santa to bring her for Christmas she will be so surprised Christmas morning.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is one my favorite all time Christmas movies.  I had the vhs version and wanted to upgrade to dvd.  I would recommend it to everyone.
B000I0QL82|4.0|This debut of \\"White Christmas\\" almost pre-steals the thunder of the next decade's movie by that name.  It's magical for the duet of Crosby and Astaire.  In passing, one might take the twirling blonde for Ginger Rogers, but an unknown these days, Marjorie Reynolds, does the honors with amazing similarity.  Virginia Dale, another dark horse for current day moviegoers, is also quite competent on the dance floor.  She and Fred's character deserved each other and ended up at least reunited as a dance team.  Old Fred, usually the good guy, is the tripping trickster here, egged on by a treacherous agent.  But Bing gets the last bong, thanks to some sage advice from his faithful housekeeper, reclaiming his girl at the 11th hour.  That's the back and forth essentially, but you must take in what comes in between.  Idyllic remodeled farm house and exterior form the perfect Christmas atmosphere, along with every other holiday of the year.  But it becomes a quintessential Christmas  movie for the blockbuster Christmas song of all times.  You get to hear it repeated, along with more Irving Berlin greats.  Crosby finally gets the budget his talent always deserved.  Unique one for not having a school of fishy remakes in its wake.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I found this to be engrossing and entertaining to read even though I am a lot older than young adult.
B0043RSK3K|5.0|This book documents a history which shows how powerful business interests<br />have controlled America and deceived the American people to enter wars like<br />Korea and Vietnam etc that served no interest but to protect powerful business<br />interests.
B000YHG72E|3.0|Great funny, holiday movie for the family. Not too long, typical ending but funny moments. Will Ferrell keeps the laughs coming and Ed Asner is a great Santa.Silly without crossing any lines.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a YouTube fan for several years now.  As usual, they deliver on this album as with all their videos and performances!
1476712042|5.0|Great book!  Read it in 2 days.  Bought from a reccomendation from a friend - and glad I decided to buy it.  I have been passing it around to other friends to read.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Was concerned about traveling with my new kindle, so I purchased the Marware Vibe Standing Case.  Can't beat if for the price. But it is comfortable to use.  Was very convenient when using my kindle for Thanksgiving recipes.  Hands free reading and the standing angle was easy on the eyes. Consider this if you are in the market for a case for your kindle.  Or get it as a gift for someone who has the Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.
0425263908|3.0|This book is very similar to 50 Shades series.  It took me a few days to read it, but I'd say it worth reading.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|great family movie.  We really enjoyed it.  it is definately one for the whole family and so fast to watch it straight over the internet.
0345803493|4.0|After the first book - you are left on a cliff hanger and want to find out what happened.  I breezed thru this one pretty quick.
B002MUAJ2A|3.0|A good overview of 37 Signal's way of running a company, but pretty much a rehash of their last book.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is simply amazing.  While they are classified as \\"classical\\" music, The Piano Guys have an obvious love for all kinds of music.  They can take a classical tune and put such a fresh spin on it that it becomes difficult to really classify them.  They just make beautiful music.  The highest praise I can give them is that my kids (ages 9 & 11) request to listen to The Piano Guys every time we are in the car.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is a great heart warming story.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Such a smart dog.  The movie was also great.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|It gives me peace for 1 1/2hrs as my children stay mesmerized to the TV and it is non violent...that is priceless.
B0009VSB06|4.0|My boys have enjoyed it (11 and 8).  They haven't found any treasure yet.  But they haven't given up just yet either.  I have never owned one of these before so I cannot say how it compared to others.  But it seems to beep when it should beep.  The beeps don't match up 100% of the time to what we should find according to the type of beep.  But I'd say it's close to 90% accuracy which isn't bad for one of the more inexpensive models.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Very nice ending to the trilogy. I enjoyed the book, and liked the suspense. I would recommend it highly. Thanks
B005E94WB0|5.0|This has a nice feel yet holds headset well and yet is compact.  It also has a clip for the belt
B00AKKS278|5.0|Just finished reading TMM and excited to start tomorrow. Hal goes into further detail about the six tools which he also talked about in the miracle morning audio. I especially liked the section talking about changing habits and getting started with the 30 day fast start kit
B0058VW36U|1.0|Bought for use on my Kindle Fire. The game is set up to have you buy power enhancements. It offers flashing icons for &#34;power enhancements&#34; to improve your score as you play the game. You are charged a fee for each time you use one of these &#34;enhancements. It is very easy to quickly spend money through the Amazon &#34;one-click&#34; purchase set up. If you lend it to your 5-year old grandson and don't shut off the &#34;one-click&#34; you can can rapidly incur cost that go way beyond the original price of the game. Be careful.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Once again Vince Flynn does not disappoint his readers. Mitch Rapp is the ultimate hero, and one can only hope that our government has people of this quality looking out for our safety and freedom. I look forward to the next installment in this saga.
B009POCG2C|5.0|Ever see a movie that connects with you so much you can't wait to talk about it?  Well I saw this movie solo and can't wait to tell you about movies that make you want to be a better human being.  Want you to work out the conflicts of who wants what, how much and how often.  Is it going to be the cheap seats for the rest of your life?  The history of a good story is that it educated you, told you about news down the road, had a message from parent to kid, friend to friend.  I don't see that much where most every movie solves their problems with violence.  Does Clint know a good story?  Timberlake?  I thought it was a safe bet for a my time and now I want you to know that if you are trying to work it out with a teen, a spouse, a friend... this movie will remind you of a continuation of the Cloud Atlas message of all time being connected. And that message is:  IT'S ALL FIXABLE, folks.  I left the movie so inspired that we just have to try a little harder, be a little more tolerant, hang in there a little longer, try a different angle. I think you should say it's a good baseball movie, a Clint movie, but between you and me it's family therapy to reinforce the goodness and make it better if it can.  to be continued....  MarkL.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Real action, awesome special effects, really great movie!!!<br />Definitly plan on watching it every chance I get.<br />Get the blueray version, you won't regret it!
B004R63MWQ|3.0|MADE ME THINK. THE COMPUTER LIFE,WE ALL MAY BE IN THAT WORLD, THEN WE CAN DO EVERYTHING, THAT'S ALL FOR NOW.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|I make the kids watch it in French then in English; it is the best tool to teach your kids two languages at the same time.
B009E3EY4M|5.0|I saw this on a big screen with a good sound system, it was unbeliveable. I got the blu-ray version
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Perfect size for len(s) and camera body. I searched all around and this was a great value for the money. Padded compartments keep the camera and lenses from baging into each other
B006LSZECO|5.0|Fabulous Book - Love the writing! Can't put it down! Stayed up until 2:00 a.m reading it last night. Haven't done that in a while.
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|I had great expectations for this flick, but now wish I would have waited for Netflix. Could have been a lot better.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I was on the phone with a custome service.rwp for over an.two for almost an hour over this it d to work Justine then one day it will not load p past 10 posts! Now im using Facebook fast app but what sucks about that is there is ads!!! Frustrating
B009HELT3C|5.0|If you liked the first 2 Men in Black movies, you will love this one. It kind of made me nervous with the whole time travel storyline, but they pulled it off very well.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|One of the best books I have read. This was one of those books you just can't put down. The plot and chacters are amazing and constantly make you want to continue. There were some editing issues however for the price and quality they are easily overlooked.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I have read all three books.  This book was not quite as good as one and three.  Not sure why.  Many people referred to the sex in these books but I was pleasingly surprised at the story content and the sex was not the most important part of this book.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|Kinda unbelievable, like James Bond, but Very entertaining, and a little different.<br />Okay product.  You will enjoy once you get past all the previews of &#34;coming attractions,&#34; which I HATE on DVDs!<br />Cecy Ivie
B004GVUPFE|4.0|Entertaining games that makes you think. Especially great price! Great product for use on tablet. Thank for the great offer! A++++
B009D7CP2M|5.0|THIS IS A BOOK YOU'LL FINISH: IT IS NOT A BOOK YOU'LL EVER SAY WAS FUN OR ENJOYABLE TO READ.  IT IS A BOOK THAT IS IMPORTANT TO READ AS IT GIVES INSIGHTS THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE NATURE VS. NURTURE DISCUSSION.  THE KILLING OF CLASSMATES BY WHITE, WELL-TO-DO YOUNG MEN MAKES ONE WONDER ABOUT PARENTHOOD, OUR SCHOOLS, AND THE IDEAS THAT MAYBE WE GIVE OUR CHILDREN TOO MUCH............
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I first downloaded this book. I saw it on the &#34;Best seller list&#34; and thought why not. This book encompassed all my feelings. It made me laugh, cry, excited and saddened me. Overall this was an amazing read
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark's story is inspiring!  But it stops about halfway through the book and switches to short essays.  They're GREAT essays, but I'd love to hear more about Broadcast.com and the Maveriks.
B009S8PEHY|4.0|Rod Stewart's voice lends itself to Christmas standards very well and is quite distinctive from the rest of our Christmas collection.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I have a very musical ear. I hear every missed note, every note that's put of place and every tiny mistake. Listening to your music is an absolute pleasure. Way to go guys!
0788812807|4.0|My daughter loves it, but as with it was years ago, the story line is a bit dry. Good if you liked it as a kid.
1588167461|5.0|Very intricate book for those that do not understand business class style. I only began to wear suits and classier clothes. This book will give the reader an in depth education on how to dress to impress. The intricate detail of what colors go with what designs, watches, and cuff links give an uneducated reader the knowledge they need to dress well and look sharp. Very impressed.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Awesome movie. Got it for my mother for christmas. Sealed and in excellent condition. Thank you for such a deal
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Great reading with Boston setting. Makes the story come alive. Would recommend to friends and Cornwell followers.<br />Good idea for Gift.
0446547654|5.0|I enjoyed this story line. I enjoy most of Nicholas Sparks's books and this one was excellent. If you like his work, this won't disappoint.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have it on Ios and kindle fire their is online multiply player in 6.0<br /><br />get it for minecraft fun :)
B001HN6922|5.0|Didn't think it would be any good, but it was awesome. Great movie, nice cast, and it was nice to follow Mater more.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I enjoyed all of the different aspects of this story. The zoo's, the animals, the beliefs, the survival, etc. I hope the movie can do the story justice.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I got this game when it was the FAOTD months ago. Honestly, this game is the ONLY game I play regularly and has kept my attention for more than a week. I regularly spend a combined average of 2-3 hours a week on this game. I really enjoyed the original black and white CrossMe, but this version took it to a whole new level. CrossMe is a nonogram, which is a logic type game that consists of filling in squares with various colors make a picture. It's worth it to do a Google search and read some of the techniques you can use to help solve the puzzles. Here's a few points about this app that mke it really great!<br /><br />-Tons of levels: It's divided into 8 individual levels, with approx 20-30 puzzles per level. They get really hard as it goes on. It lists the difficulty of each level (easy, normal, advanced or expert). Keep in mind that some puzzles will take a long time to do. I've worked on the harder ones for a couple days, just doing a little here and there.<br /><br />-Pinch: Pinch to zoom makes it easier on smaller screens to hit the cell you're trying to hit<br /><br />-Ability to jump ahead. You can start at level one or jump ahead to any level you want. You don't have to beat the previous levels to move on.<br /><br />-Tutorial: Great tutorial that helps a lot as this is a complex and sort of confusing game.<br /><br />-Interface: Easy to use menu and settings for music on or off. You can also set it to display time and battery in the upper left hand corner of the board. It's nice to be able to monitor battery life, especially with phones with large screens that drain your battery fast.<br /><br />-Easy to pick up and put down: This game works well when you only have a few minutes here and there. It automatically saves, so you can rest easy knowning your hard work isn't lost if you it the back button on accident or anything. It's a very addicting and satisfying game to play. I feel very mentally challenged when I play it. It only gets better with time because you learn new techniques and strategies that help solve the harder puzzles.<br /><br />The only downfall is, that the harder puzzles do get a little frustrating on smaller, phone screens. I'm constantly zooming in and out and panning left and right to try to see the numbers for where I'm supposed to go. I think it would be much easier on a tablet. This isn't anything the developer can do anything about. I think the app is perfectly done and am always looking forward to updates with new puzzles!you learn new techniques and strategies that help solve the harder puzzles.<br /><br />The only downfall is, that the harder puzzles do get a little frustrating on smaller, phone screens.

B0013F1D02|5.0|Great movie for any age! The cast is terrific. The set design is fabulous. I highly recommend this fun story.
B007H1HQW0|5.0|This product cuts a perfect line every time. The only had part at first is getting the bottle to break on the scared bottle
B0060FXBNM|5.0|Regardless of reviews I love these movies.  Brings back some childhood nostalgia of the Transformers cartoons.  Entertaining movies.  Great price.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|the plot was kinda stupid, the action scences were silly bloody and the makeup on the actors was terrible.  they looked like cheap plastic dolls. glad i didn't pay good money for this.
145162445X|5.0|The book came in perfect condition and it is a great one at that. I definitely recommend that you buy!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy read and lots of suspense!  I immediately bought the next book in the series and can't put it down!
B00992CF6W|2.0|He got a new computer but it doesn't have a touch screen and he was very upset to learn he couldn't use this app i wasted 7 dollars on it. I wish that it was clearly marked that it required a touch screen.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|In my opinion I think that this book is very hard to get into and is very poorly written. I couldn't even finish it.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I started watching Downton Abbey on a whim, mainly because my mother-in-law and wife had become obsessed with it. Naturally, I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. Suffice to say I watched the entire first series in one sitting and was craving more.<br /><br />The story focuses in the Downton Abbey, a lavish and beautiful estate owned by the Crawley family, its inhabitants, and their servants. I could write an entire raving review about the ensemble cast but that would take too much space and time so I'll say this instead; the cast is quite large but each member plays their part perfectly. I've seen a few British dramas but have never been enthralled with a show like this before, thanks mainly to the terrific job done by the actors.<br /><br />There really isn't anything about this show that misses the mark; the acting (as mentioned), the sets, the cinematography, the historical references, the costumes...it's all there and it's all great. This set comes with the first and second series, as well as some very informative featurettes.<br /><br />I haven't met anyone that's watched the show and didn't enjoy it. I've known quite a few people that were hesitant about watching it, mainly because they thought it would be boring or slow. Their minds were quickly changed upon giving it a chance. It's to those people that I would recommend this show; give Downton a shot a prepare to be amazed by how much you enjoy it.
B0028RXXE8|5.0|One of my favorite series, the box is nice and the features and extra material are great. Hours and hours of fun.
B008WCP2KG|4.0|Magic Mike is a fairly good character study that focuses on the lifestyle, relationships, and aspirations of a male stripper played by Channing Tatum. I was actually surprised by Tatum's performance here, as he demonstrates more depth than I've seen from him in previous works. His usual charm and good looks are all over the place, but I enjoyed seeing him take on something a little more serious for a change (even though I thought he was hilarious in 21 Jump Street).<br /><br />The story revolves around Magic Mike's profession as a stripper, but it becomes so much more than that, and in a good way. In my opinion, the trailers were trying to make the film look like a comedy, which it isn't. The movie is definitely a drama at heart, though it does have it's fair share of humor (in typical Soderbergh fashion) and a few lighthearted moments.<br /><br />Another interesting performance is delivered by Matthew McConaughey, who plays the part of the owner of the club in which Magic Mike performs. There's a subtle intensity you see in him, especially in the movie's final forty-five minutes.<br /><br />This movie made a lot of money thanks in part to girl's nights and sorority parties, but I'm here to tell you that, as a male, I quite enjoyed the movie. There is nudity in the film (more female than male, believe it or not) and you do see quite a few derrieres. Male audience; don't let this discourage you from seeing a good movie.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|It was just filmed in New York they put a sine up saying Gotham City  it did not look at all like the city
B001ILHY1I|5.0|This movie is full of action. Jason Statham at his best. If you love fast cars and destruction you will love this movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is the kind of book I love.When I read the subject material, I knew I wanted to read the book, but I did not expect the emotional roller coaster this book would take me on.Could not put it down. First book I bought on my Kindle. Reece Whitherspoon will be awesome as this psychopathic &#34;B&#34;
B007HACDLK|5.0|This book had so many twists and turns it was great! Another exceptional book by an exceptional author. Highly recommended!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Oh my God  Love this show.  Cant wait for the next season to start.  Watch all the seasons in one weekend.
B00ADYYY50|1.0|This album is full of lazy rapping with no flow and no meaning. There is only one song where Wiz does not rap about money or smoking joints (Up In It), and it is a bad attempt at making a love song. \\"Fall Asleep\\" may be the one of the worst songs ever made. The beats are also generic. The only semi-tolerable song is \\"Medicated\\". I think Wiz is just putting an album out there to make some easy money from his new fan base.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Clever and poignant and a well-written story.  I am recommending this book to all of my friends.  The author is masterful at creating a human/canine relationship that any dog lover would desire.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Obviously if you order this album then you haveeee to be a One Direction fan. Why else would you order it? Ahhh!!! I loveeeee it! This album is more amazing than their first one. Definitely recommend buying it! I don't know why I waited a month after it was released to get it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|These guys are awesome! Love,love them! They take music to a whole new level of fun and listening! Highly recommend their albums.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|This album is excellent for it being their first one. A lot of the songs are soooo catchy and are played on the radio many times. Love listening to the album! :)
B0052RDHTM|5.0|great character development, I do not even like historical fiction normally, but I have really enjoyed this book. He is an incredibly talented author!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|This is the first Taylor Swift album I ever thought about purchasing. There was nooo question about whether I wanted it or not. After I heard We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together I just knew the type of album it was going to be and it is a lottt more pop-like and upbeat than her past albums. I can't get enough of it!
B00005LELD|5.0|Found this through a friend. Love that it's adjustable rubber! Leave it on all the time for lens protection as well as sun flare. You can pull it all the way out for flare or less based on your needs.
B00AHSINKO|3.0|My wife and I just rented this and were let down.  The movie never really took off and was geared for older couples in their 60's.  I would pass on this one ad save your $5.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Normal intricate Harry Bosch plot - well conceived.<br />My only issue was the ending was more than a bit contrived.  Connelly can and has concluded his novels more tightly and believably previously.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Great so see so many actors from the original and the ending was wonderful! Didn't see it in 3-D, but this version is still excellent.
068485743X|3.0|You can learn from everything. This is a good text. I don't believe it's as good as Elmore Leonards &#34;10 rules of Writing.&#34; Leonard covers the same material more concisely.
0316069434|5.0|I love every single Harry Bosch novel, and this one did not disappoint!  Please Mr.Connelly, write lots more!  I truly anxiously await them all.  I love the weaving of characters that has taken place over the years, and cannot wait for the next one.  If you love a good mystery you must read this book!
B009NCM248|5.0|I actually hadn't heard of this band before which now I'm kicking myself for. I noticed this while I was browsing the other day and figured I'd give it a listen. I have not stopped listening to this since I purchased it. Although I like heavier stuff myself (making Absolute Zero my favorite song on the album, followed by RU486) I really like the mix of heavy, ballads, etc. here. It all works incredibly well together. Very glad I did, awesome album, can't wait for part 2.
B00866JL96|4.0|bought as a gift, i don't know what more to say. Seen it and enjoy it. at least like zak so makes the movie better.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Lots of sounds be a limited number of musicians and instruments, masterfully looped together.  Steven Sharp Nelson makes playing the cello 'cool'!
B009DKFSUA|3.0|ok but a bit more mellow that his other albums. definately pit but not on the dancefloor. dedicated fans will like eitherway.
B000Z45PEC|4.0|Very awesome, only issue is when I received this gift it was ripped in 2 places on the box, so a little annoying it cant be considered super collectable due to that...so its a good thing I'm not a hard core collector and just a lover of the movie and cars :)
B007HACDLK|4.0|This story gets you really involved in the interactions between characters, pulling for the good guys, wanting (and getting) payback for the evil ones. Many unexpected twists and turns and I'm only half way through. I really look forward to the priceless minutes I get to sit down with this book - can't wait to see how it all turns out.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|The book was another great adventure with Harry. It kept my attention and had the required twists to keep me interested.

0316223239|5.0|If you like to read books with exciting plots that are constantly changing and twisting, this book might not be for you. This book does not focus on the plot as much as it does the character development. However, the character development is very well done. Towards the end of the book, I found myself laughing and weeping at times at Jack's innocence and sense of wonderment. It's been days since I've read the book but I still can't get it out of my head. Great read, highly recommended!
B009DH371K|4.0|Yes, please!  Hungarian Rhapsody - Queen Live in Budapest may be the same songs you're used to from Queen's Live at Wembley and Live Magic albums, but it's still fantastic!<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed in the actual Blu-Ray of the concert because it's actuallly missing songs that are on the CD's.  Four songs to be exact - Another One Bites the Dust, Looks Like It's Gonna Be A Good Night - Improv, You're So Square (Baby I Don't Care), and Hello Mary Lou (Goodbye Heart).  While the last three are reasonable losses, how on Earth can you cut Another One Bites the Dust?!?<br /><br />Still, if you bought this mainly for the CD's like I did, then you're going to get your monies worth just from them, and the Blu-Ray is just an added bonus.<br /><br />I really wish that Queen would release more live albums from the past.  There have got to be a ton of them shelved somewhere.
034580404X|4.0|Got this for a gift.  Very nice.  Sell sent it & I received it before the time frame.  Made getting ready for Christmas easier.

B009JBWOU0|5.0|I could not believe the price of this even as a DVD set it came in a nice box set with an additional book.  All three movies for $17.00.  All three movies are excellent I enjoyed Batman begins to see how Batman really came to fruition and the other two were great as well.  I think everyone agrees the Dark Knight is the best of the trilogy but in my opinion it is very close between all three.  All great films.  Definitely a teen at the least film with some pretty graphic violence and dark outlook but a great collection to add to my film collection
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Great job as far as story and action. I think all of the actors fit the roles they were chosen for and the story was good, I can't wait for the Avengers 2!!!!
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I have read all of Nelson DeMille's prior works, some more than once, and have been a great DeMille fan for many years. This current work, however, is a disappointment. It reads as a boring stream of cliche's interspersed with John Corey's half-baked witicisms that soon lose all sense of humor. I could not read very far into this book before putting it aside and deleting from my Kindle.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|They got the origin down pat and the right choice in actor to portray captain america but the film drags in the middle luckily it picks back up in the end to finish well.
B00A2H9L2E|4.0|Silent Hill: Revelation (2012) = Alien(s) + Resident Evil + The Possession (2012) [the row of houses in Heather's neighbourhood and little Alessa look vaguely familiar from the scenes of The Possession (2012)].<br /><br />The original \\"Silent Hill\\" was more thrilling than this 2012 version looks to have combinations of a variety of other horror movies. The sounds from this 2012 movie are loud and clear though, good for theatre viewing. The scares could have been made better if they were more original, rather than being composites of sci-fi and other horror movies. IMO, this last factor seem to \\"dilute\\" the originality of this movie. I also don't like the ending which came too abruptly.<br /><br />I still like the plot of the movie which is why I'm giving this movie a high rating. But, it could have been better presented with more originality.<br /><br />Reference:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B009XTF8JM The Possession [Blu-ray]]] - must watch horror movie of the year 2012!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000GCFO08 Silent Hill (Fullscreen Edition)]]
0307887448|3.0|I enjoyed the suspense and humor enough to continue reading the book, which ought to say something. However, the plot is very weak, with countless episodes where the narrator seems in terrible danger, only to either 1) have an all-powerful outside character save him, or 2) use some sort of game/magic/scifi device to save himself. I'm not, nor ever have been a big gamer, and perhaps this is part of the reason I wasn't overly impressed. I won't give a rave review, nor will I crucify the novel, but I also won't read it again, and will probably forget it within minutes of starting my next book, whatever that may be.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is my go to radio on my Android phone and now also on my husband's Kindle.<br />Don't just listen to radio in your local area. Listen to any radio station anywhere.<br />The app also functions very well.

B009NQKPUW|5.0|I was hoping for the tie in to the movie that caught my attention some 30 years ago. I was not disappointed. A very intense story with incredible scenes, Mr. Giger would be pleased.

0743270754|5.0|Whether it is timely because of the movie, Lincoln, that is based on this book or because of the amazingly appropriate analysis  19th Cent politics and comparison with current political turmoil -- this book is GREAT reading. I am encouraging my friends to read this. Doris Kearns Goodwin is a remarkable writer and historian. The book reads like and absorbing novel and informs like a university text.
B000JY8F22|3.0|Not the movie that I thought it was going to be.  It was ok....nothing to write home about.  If there is nothing better to do on a rainy day, consider watching it.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|This is an excellent CD - production values are great, and the songs and stylings are what you would expect from Diana Krall.  I must add that I heard her interviewed on NPR and that's what made me immediately get the CD for my mother for Christmas, but I got to listen to it first!
B00328R21C|5.0|My boy loves Star Wars and Lego's so he had a lot of fun playing with those two things he loves.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire HD and have no problems with this app. I like that it tells you how much time is left based on if you're reading, surfing, etc as well as how long to charge. Reminds me of my Eco tool on my laptop.
B007MJSSCY|5.0|A wonderful movie - I enjoyed the fact that it was a bit long.  Wonderful adaption of one of the \\"Green Knowe\\" stories.<br />Maggie Smith fabulous as always and many other great supporting roles.
B000P5FH3K|4.0|This is a good lawyer movie, if such a thing can be possible. John Grisham is known as an author of many stories in which one lone &#34;good&#34; lawyer is fighting the good ole boy network to help the little guy. This movie would've been a little better, in my opinion, if some of the scenes they show in the &#34;deleted scenes&#34; section were actually incorporated into the movie.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you like the Harry Bosch series, you'll enjoy this book which expands the characters and has appropriate twists and turns
B007EDYN36|5.0|KISS came out when I was in middle school, but I did not really appreciate them till I got a bit older.  I got this book out of curiousity and I absolutely loved it.  Took me back to middle school. Peter Criss is very honest and straightforward.  His story is an entertaining and interesting one.
1938469003|4.0|Mitch Steele is a great person and is one of the best brewers I've had the pleasure to talk with (NHC 2011 and 2012). This book has great information about the history of the style, and the recipe section is great. I'd recommend the new book by Stan Hieronymus called For the Love of Hops if you're searching for a more fundamental understanding of hops.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I am not one for most classical literature, but after being required to read Jack London's &#34;The Call of the Wild&#34; in an 8th grade language arts class, I cannot wait to read more books written in a similar style.  London's choice of words and realist/naturalist style of writting are very interesting, even for me as a 14 year old.  Buck has become one of those &#34;close&#34; characters in terms of reading, though the story itself is more depressing than not.<br /><br />In my class, we were required to annotate the text, which personally made it easier to connect with the characters and harder to part with them.  In this set up, that is a good thing.<br /><br />I was hesitant to read this book even though I had to, but now I'm glad I broadened my horizons a bit more.  For the teachers out there, this is a story that I bet your students will truly enjoy.  I know I did.  :-)
1938469011|5.0|Without a doubt, this is most informative book about hops out there. Stan Hieronymus continues his streak of must-buy brewing/beer books. Any brewer that is serious about making the best beer possible needs to buy this book. I suspect that this is going to be an instant classic.<br /><br />Jonathan Permen<br />2012 NHC Homebrewer of the Year
B0024F08UG|5.0|The Towering Inferno has always been a Favorite of mine from the 1970's!! There is plenty of action throughout the movie. This movie has a long Cast of Characters. Starring Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Robert Vaugn(sp?), Robert Wagner, Faye Dunaway Jennifer Jones and many more.
0143036424|5.0|I bought this book as a gift after reading all of the series myself. I think this may be one of the best by Craig Johnson, even though it is the first. I am confident the recipient of the gift will be happy to have found something that is a bit different from your normal mystery novel.
1439152802|5.0|I believe this is the best of her novels thus far. Reading this is like peeling an onion. And towards the end, just when you think you have it all figured out, she continues to surprise, zig and zag until the the very satisfying conclusion. I am not generally a fan of historic fiction, but Kate Morton is a definite exception to my preference. I hope she is hard at work on her next novel.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Boring, confusing, no continuity, worst of grishom's books. I would not recommend it.his treatment of women characters Is degrading I believe.
B000KI6286|5.0|I was assigned to watch this movie for a class that I'm taking called &#34;Innovations in Marketing&#34; and was pleasantly surprised by how funny, clever, and entertaining this movie is.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is an album worth owning. The Piano Guys love what they do and you can hear that in each track. From fun covers of our favorite movies to moving, slower pieces, this is quality music. Do not pass up the opportunity to own it for yourself.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|my husband wanted this series and he really enjoyed watching it. It was a very good purchase and we are awaiting the next one
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is an excellent book and it captures your attentions from page one. I have had a hard time putting it down as I keep wanting to know what will happen next. I have never read another book quite like this one.
B00A6N7QIA|4.0|Good story, loved the ending. Violent with some gore. Definitely deserved the R rating. Just the right amount of action.
B005IQ39AY|4.0|It's like Phlinx on Pogo except it doesn't show you the aim line. It's an ok game. I will probably play it some. The sounds are harsher than Phlinx, also. I had to turn them off.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|My 13yo daughter and I love the piano guys! We listen to their music all the time! Either their CDs or on YouTube! We are huge fans! I highly recommend this CD and all of their music!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|The Panther. This was a very good book. A little over done with the third person narrative and character asides, but suspenseful.
B004XZR63M|5.0|I wish I had someone pointing out how to view personal finace the way Robert lays it out in his book. Everything resonated with me and I am following the principles his &#34;Rich&#34; father instilled in him.
B0010HOZXA|5.0|in great  condition plays well but would have like a box small quib still love it though without a box
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love the Piano Guys music. It is modern and classic. It has a great sound to it. I could listen to it all the time. It is definately worth getting their music.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I have to admit that I have never been a huge fan of fairy and princess films, but this one really enchanted the whole family- myself and my three year old daughter alike. My husband had to leave for work and missed the ending of the film the first time we watched it and the plot was decent enough that he asked to watch the ending the next day.<br /><br />The graphics are beautiful and for adults the magic really is in the cleverly designed details of the fairy world- using owls for transportation for instance. It's a very creatively and cleverly designed world that you feel like you've been given an exclusive glimpse into.<br /><br />My daughter was captured by all the forest animals, vibrant colors, and pixie dust- and now is a Tinkerbell fan. The film could also be a very fun introduction for young children to seasons, animal hibernation, and basic science concepts, like the reasons fire melt ice. We don't purchase dvds for our home collection often, but this one is well worth the price. Another great Disney film that I'd recommend to any parent I know!
0425263908|5.0|I thought I might spontaneously combust reading this book.  The connection and electricity that these two put off could be felt throughout the book! Couldn't wait till the next book came out!
0385523394|1.0|That's the author's pearl-clutching statement. Too bad she never figured out that &#34;nice&#34;' blonde, ladies who go to second-tier universities are exactly the criminal profile for the type of drug offense she was convicted of. Too bad her time in jail didn't seem to affect her character for the better.
0425263916|5.0|Love the rapport and fireworks between these two characters.  You can feel how much of a connection they have to each other.  A definite must read series!
B0085W09ME|5.0|I love it. Great app that takes guest work out of flight information. Used it when I was checking on a flight to pick up friends.
B008QE9XD2|4.0|This movie is a lot of fun.  I used to watch the old TV series, and loved the references back to the old series throughout the movie.  Johnny Depp gave a great homage to Jonathan Fried in the character of Barnabas Collins!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|These are very wonderful fantasy stories.  I enjoyed sharing them with my daughter.  We are also  enjoying the movies. Thank you
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This CD has all the songs that I have been looking for thru I-tunes.  I am happy that I found it.

B0035JRVBO|5.0|As long as there is a good internet connection, the film streams great. It was a pleasure to view the film again.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I would recomend this to others.  Kept me on the edge of my seat and wanting to keep reading.  Had to buy the next book too.

B005FMZWD8|5.0|I don't a big fan of watches but, this is really a nice and beautyfull watch, it's not to big and it's not to small.
B0013V8OFI|5.0|I love this movie, it reminds me of my childhood.  This is less popular than &#34;Desperately Seeking Susan&#34; but it should be just as known in my opinion.  &#34;Doom doom...&#34;
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This book was very creative and an interesting read.  I thoroughly enjoyed the premise and finished this in about two days.  Some of the plot seemed impossible but I played along as a reader because I really liked the writing style and plot. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for something different and creative.
B002U6CJO2|3.0|While it was nice to see that they remastered the video quality somewhat the new CGI effects that were added in seemed an unnecessary attempt, overall for the price I'd say go ahead and get this newer release but don't expect to feel wowed or astonished by anything with this updated releases other then a video quality upgrade.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Easy reading!!! Very interesting to understand how a BDSM relationship is based at and to try to psychologically wonder about how someone thinks when having this kind of behavior.<br /><br />The second book is even nicer, with a bit of suspense and drama.<br /><br />Nice to know that we can also enjoy trilogies for women our age and, of course, get the best out of it and practice with our husbands / companions.
B009MO57H6|4.0|If you're willing to turn off the higher reasoning of your brain and just watch an enjoyable zombie/monster action film then this movie will give you what you want but if you try and over think the plot holes and a few other scenes then you'll be disappointed.  Like with the previous three movie versions of the RE franchise you'll have the main character Alice kicking A$$ and taking names from the most recent boss threat which this time is neither Wesker or a mutated human/monster hybrid but something that is connected to the beginning movie.  While it's enjoyable to see that they brought in two more iconic game RE characters(Ada/Leon) overall the fight and action scenes while enjoyable also feel so repetitive of those from the mentioned previous three movies from before, also while not a big impact on the movie we are introduced to a few other characters from the earlier RE movies as well. Overall I can still enjoy the movies enough to forgive a lot of what they've done with these movies as many other RE fans will too just keep the expectations of a great movie down and pretty much accept a good movie instead with this one...
B005LAII1C|5.0|I heard Ted (Two-Disc Combo Pack: Blu-ray + DVD + Digital Copy + UltraViolet) was a great movie so i had to buy it.
B004DSX5B6|5.0|My first impression of this fine tool was that it was really compact.  Too compact.  Then I realized the beauty of the design.  I small, compact tool full of great items that would be needed in an emergency.  The tool is very well made, and the pouch is just a normal pouch capable of storing the  Multitool and the mini emergency guide that comes with it.  I carry it with me when I take rides on my motorcycle into the lesser traveled roads in Arizona. Well worth the money.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|I heard The Dark Knight Rises (Blu-ray/DVD Combo+UltraViolet Digital Copy) was a great movie so i bought it. I'm a big Batman fan.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Loads of action in this movie.  I did not see it in the theaters.  I own the first two and thought the third might be as good as the first two.  I was not disappointed at all.  This one has a great plot, and Christian Bale was great in this one.  The movies is supposed to be 8 years after the second.  Christian has matured and his appearance was exactly as it should be for an older, wiser Batman. (as if I know what an older, wiser Batman would be, lol).
B004EPZ0BQ|5.0|I heard that Friends with Benefits (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + UltraViolet... was a funny movie. Justin Timberlake was good in it.
B004EPYZOY|4.0|Geeze, by some of the previous reviews of this movie, one would think it was terrible!  The movie is entertaining....let me say this again....the movie is ENTERTAINING!.  Isn't that why we go to/rent/buy movies?  Sure, there is gratuitous violence, sex scenes, and terrible language (for some)., but the movie is not bad at all.  The performances are great!  Silly premise?...yup.  Impossible feats??....yup, strange ( to some) characters?..yup.  Fun and enjoyment?...oh hell yeah!  If you are looking for Oscar material, do not watch this movie.  If you want some entertainment, fun, and pretty cool characters, DO buy this movie.  Oh, by the way....watch it several times.  There are so many one liners, reactions, and funny stuff going on during the movie that you don't really catch them all the first time.
B004EPZ06Q|5.0|The Hangover Part II (Combo Pack: Blu-ray and DVD - Ultraviolet... is funny movie. Better than the first one. Very funny movie.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|fruit monks is lots of fun. It keeps my children entertain for hours. It is perfect to have for traveling.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|I first saw this movie in theaters when I was 4 years old and sat on the edge of my seat watching it.  30 years later it is still my favorite movie.  it is timeless.
B005LAII12|5.0|Love this movie, it's up there with one of the funniest I've ever seen. Seth kept me laughing throughout the entire movie and i didnt want it to end
B002VECM4K|5.0|very touching film. Fine acting .This movie depicts thousands of girls (women) in todays world.So glad to see precious climb out.<br />There is hope for everyone in this crisis.
B00406UK5A|3.0|Movies like this are a little annoying for their silly assumptions, but this one was done OK and moves along at a decent pace.
1419553429|5.0|It approaches differents topics of the GMAT using highly complex exercices. I do recommend for those who are close to take the test or who have taken and need to improve score. Verbal exercices bring really great challenges and prepare practioners to the test. Highly recommended. Helped me to improve from a 660 to a 720 in one month (Verbal - from 31 to 38).
B003L20IJW|3.0|I bought this to place in my rental. It's a movie kids will watch and enjoy. That is a big plus all by itself.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really enjoy watching this, and can't wait for more episodes to be released.  Want to see how the &#34;new&#34; groups interact with the familiar family.
B005GG0MIS|4.0|Holds your attention from president to president with insights that have never been revealed in other presidential books. A must read.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys continue to amaze with this albumn.  I love the songs, and the tremendous talent that goes into combining old and new music, and re-interpreting  some classics.  There is definitely something to be said for the visual aspect of the Piano Guys that is missing when you just hear the music, but the songs are still epic.<br /><br />Also, this is the first item I have ever purchased that came with an \\"As Seen On Youtube\\" sticker.
B005K17RU0|4.0|plain and simplie. easy to use. fairy accurate and the radar is great. i recommend this app a the best part ... it is free.

B005FMZVLQ|5.0|I chose this rating because I think it really deserves the item and the seller. I really liked the article, was what I saw and what is written in such. Yes, I recommend it because it really is very good article
B008FYZIVY|5.0|it is a fabulous series well worth the cost and the service was second to none and it arrived in usa safe and sound
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This album is AWESOME!<br />My kids will listen to the Piano Guys all day, but will not listen to classical music at all. They tell me it is because of the videos. \\"It makes the music real, and the music combinations they create are perfect.\\" Congratulations Plano Guys, you have won us over!
B004JN1D2I|5.0|CRACK for Readers! I can't get enough! With all the levels of plots going on, I only think I know what will happen next. As I read, I find I was WRONG and need to read more. I LOVE IT!
B004XN3FHA|5.0|Great flashlight, bright, easy to use, well made, this is the best flashlight I have ever bought.  Good for seeing animals that will attack you at night before you stumble into trouble.  If you walk a dog at night this is what you really need.  If you don't think so you have never seen a light like this before.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This series is an amazing swim in the deep end of the ocean where the big boys play. This plot has so many levels that I have no idea what will really happen next! Every time I think I know whats happening and going to happen.... I find I am WRONG! I LOVE IT! I need more! This writing is crack for readers!
B009KHCT94|4.0|Clever satire somewhat following the style of Doctor Strangelove. Heavy on the steampunk from the Nazi side. Good B movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I've been a fan since I was referred to a \\"You Tube Video\\" of The Piano Guys. Just one person I knew about them back then...and I couldn't just not tell everyone how fabulous The Piano Guys were! I love their music and that they are not slotted into one venue. One of my favorite evenings was when I found The Piano Guys on Jango (a Pandora clone) of course, I made The Piano Guys a channel on my phone.<br /><br />I'm so glad that they have a new CD. Wait! Not just glad, excited and the CD is fantastic. My daughter saw them in concert at her college and said they're even better in person. I rarely write a review about any music, but this time.. couldn't pass-up an opportunity to share my excitement as a fan to try and promote this great musical group.
B00A11AN6O|4.0|Easy to use and I found the mass upload.  I like having the ability to view on my Kindle Fire.  Great for showing my family.
B00881PPTO|5.0|Bought during Amazon's Free App of the Day!  Wouldn't pay for the pro version, but since it was free, of course I will take it.  My experience with Kayak, the free app is just fine.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|It's best in its class. If you like this type of movie, the Planet Earth is a no-brainer in your collection.
0307346617|5.0|This is a great book.  I enjoyed the unique perspective on a zombie outbreak.  This was entertaining and I will read it again and again.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Good way to kill some time.  I haven't rotated the pieces yet but am looking forward to that challenge soon.
B00338QENI|5.0|What an interesting topic!  Very informative, but also depth of character.  It is evident that the author cared about this family and the legacy of Henrietta.
B0055MITYC|4.0|Got them to replace a 5yr old pair of Tevas that I was very happy with.<br />I was a little hesitant about the color but it looks great.  They are comfortable andI am very happy with them.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I greatly enjoyed book five.  Book three was my favorite, four took a little longer to read, but five was extremely interesting and a page turner.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Huge Vince Flynn fan, read them all but not as robust as Rapp usually is..still a good read, fan worthy.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys CD is awesome!  They are very talented musicians who create wonderful videos to go along with the music.  Buy their CD. Maybe, MAYBE, the Piano Guys will check out the kids from LANDFILLHARMONICS who create their own musical instruments (yes CELLOs!) from trash in a landfill and then maybe, MAYBE, the Piano guys will do a video with them.  That would be AWESOME!
141659521X|5.0|Grabbed me right at the beginning and didn't let go until the last page turned. For those of us who like to guess what Mitch will do next, the twists and turns made this a challenging task.  A story well worth reading.
B003R50FRI|5.0|Very evocative of the India that I love, I love the way the author captures the nuances of the fabulous indo- English, we used to love reading the signs in India. This book is a joy to read, really well written , very descriptive and brings back so many memories
B00000AFFF|5.0|This CD gets better and better the more I listen to it.  I love CD's like this.  And the last song is amazing.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|time for some of these guys to retire<br />not worth the price. and its crazy to have to have a certain number of words in the review
1451696205|5.0|I thought this was a great movie and a great book.  Very easy to read.  Interesting to get the different perspectives of the story-telling, because the book is written in letters.  The movie starts this way but unfolds more like a narrative.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is okay, but I'd much rather use the full-site view on my smartphone to access more of the features (like editing and sharing). It's not that the app is bad, it's just not packed with the features I want.
B009FB3W9G|3.0|Some of the performances are better than others.  But there's no banter between songs, so it feels like you're just charging through.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I really enjoy the wide range of sounds available on this and enjoy using it to &#34;quiet my brain&#34; when I can steal a short nap during the daytime.
0345529057|5.0|Highly satisfied.  I have read two of  the books and they are everything you could ask for in a paperback, Great reading
B008MEM24S|5.0|I love this app.it toke about 3 hours to download. please get this app.it should be worth 123456789123456789 dollers.bbbuuuyyy this app.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|expected much more, getting worse with every sequel...hard to follow the story, charters does not develop, not funny or adventurous
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|this game looked interesting from the outside, after having bought it, it became clear very quick how boring this game really is.
B0092C2X7U|5.0|this is one of those gems you cant search for but are fun after you discover it. awesome game..no other way to put it....
B006HTUZ1C|4.0|this game makes you think on your feet.  it seems to keep going and going and never stopping.  That makes it all the more fun.
B007VT6QSI|3.0|Im not usually a Bieber fan.. but I found a few of the songs on this album to be exceptionally good. I would've never have expected to like a song by the Biebs. But hey, ya never know! Anyways I think that this album is worth buying for the catchy beats and infectious lyrics!!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I thought this game would be a walk in the park, but after playing it I realized that it's no joke.  It makes you think,  I love it.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Walle is super cute and tons of fun.  I enjoyed it as much as my preschooler did.  Everybody should watch it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book gives a different view point then the<br />Twilight book.  I love this series. It is a must read. The story can be slow at times but stick with it and you wouldn't be disappointed.
B009A87Z6U|5.0|I haven't seen this, but it is for someone for Christmas who loves the movie so Glad that I was able to get it for under $10!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|wonderful, funny not boring. too cute. we really enjoted it, it was very refreshing, not that many good movies anymore.
B004SIP8SY|5.0|I love Kill Bill! I love pretty much anything by Quentin Tarantino and this doesn't disappoint. I was glad to get the collection of Kill Bill Movies for Under $15 and they are great to watch on Blu.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This scenerio would be any parents worst nightmare, having your child accused of a horrible crime.  The story unwinds and takes some dramatic turns just when you think you have it all figured out, maybe you don't.  Highly recommend this book.
B004SIP8OI|5.0|I love Kill Bill! I love pretty much anything by Quentin Tarantino and this doesn't disappoint. I was glad to get the collection of Kill Bill Movies for Under $15 and they are great to watch on Blu.
B008ETOSYI|4.0|this movie is pure chick flick. in a good way! It also had some action involved so that keep my husband's attention too. I really enjoyed it. and Zac Efron doesn't hurt the movie at all!
B005LAJ1PE|4.0|This show is unique in the fact that it always has me thinking how did they get away with that. While I watched the first season and started the second, I have a hard time getting into the new Asylum season. I guess I will probably buy it to watch it that way. Loved the first season though and recommend it to horror fans.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Good book, interesting story.  Starts off a little slow but definitely picks up.  I didn't care much for the ending though.
B008MU8ZOI|4.0|I have to say that I am one of few people that have watched this movie that liked it. I think it is worth a watch especially if it is under $5 like when I purchased it!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|TV junkies be warned.  This one will not leave you unsatisfied - just craving more Homeland!  Like Breaking Bad (my previous #2 show) it makes you wonder why you weren't watching this show sooner!<br /><br />For anyone curious about my #1 it's The Walking Dead.  :)
B0013O123Q|1.0|I didn't like it. It was too graphic and I couldn't get through the movie. I guess it wasn't for me.
030758836X|4.0|I didn't really like the story, but had to admire the author's ability to weave a plot.  I rated the book high because of the condition of the used copy I received.  Had I not known it was used, I would have been sure it was new.
B001D8W7CW|4.0|Infamous lines and first appearances of Hollywood stars are reasons to watch Carrie. I snagged my copy while Amazon had it on sale for under $5 and am really glad I picked it up. I am a fan of The Rage Carrie 2, The TNT Remake of Carrie and I can't wait for the Hollywood Remake with Julianne Moore as well. It is definitely worth a watch and a grab, especially if Amazon has it on sale for under $5~!

B009A87ZQU|5.0|Love that these movies are such a great price I was able to get all the Daniel Craig 007 films for under $20 and they are great to watch too!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent combination of character depth and action pace. The sci-fi scenes and plots are realistic and well thought through.<br />One of the best sci-fi stories I've ever read.
B002SSUQFG|5.0|This product was exactly as described. Great starter watch for anyone who appreaciates good time pieces. Would highly reccomend and thinking about buying another one in fact.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I enjoyed the book greatly and found each era exciting. The interactions between presidents is fascinating and surprising. It was just the kind of history book I was looking for.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I love this app! Nice big area to draw on. And you can't beat the price! It doesn't matter if you can't draw, it's easy to convey what you're thinking. The only drawback is that there isn't a way to do a screenshot of your drawing. I would give it 5 stars if that were an option. For now I just snap a picture with my phone if I want to save my drawing.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love this music! We listen to it all the time and even my 3 year old requests their music. Her favorite is Cello Wars. Love them!
B005V4FJC4|5.0|I love the arrangements of Christmas tunes.  Not so different that you feel they ruined the classics, just a little different twist on them.  A few new tunes as well
1932100660|5.0|After listening to the audiobook, I purchased 20 copies to give as gifts to my family for Christmas.  The information is so important.
B0090EJR1K|4.0|if you liked Borat I am sure you will like this one too. not as funny but it entertained us too.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I was so engrossed with this series I read them all in one day. But this one is just depressing and falls flat on delivering what we waited three books for.  I have to agree with what the one star reviewers say.  This book is depressing.  See those reviews for details but beware of the spoilers.
0451527712|1.0|NOT MY THING, MAYBE NEXT TIME I'LL FINISH AND GIVE A MORE ACCURATE VIEWPOINT ON THIS &#34;CLASSIC&#34; WILL TRY! TO.
B0007TKH66|5.0|its great on the flat screen-- visually very appealing--worth seeing again--box sets don't seem to be dropping in price--okay  ;(
B004P12SSW|5.0|Seen this 3 or 4 times.  Love it!  Didn't like Xtina until I saw this movie and Cher is always amazing.  :)
B001NLKT60|5.0|The second book picks up with some good review from The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and just keeps on with the action.  Larsson is a master, no-nonsense storyteller who feeds his readers on every page and keeps you turning the pages.
B0044KBQLE|5.0|I can't get enough of this series. And come on, we're talking serious eye candy here.  Great music and car too!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|The translation of this series is phenomenal - Lisbeth Salandar is one of the best fictional characters I've come across in a long, long time.
B00683JK9K|5.0|This game is very hard to get the challenge of it. I like the cahllenge but this one i didnt like it was to hard for me.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|My cousin invited me to play a long time ago and I am still playing. I don't draw, can't, but I have learned how to draw using this game and it keeps us in touch.
1936608618|5.0|Great to see all of this stuff in 1 book. Sharp photos, and easy to understand WODS (especially for running).
B002KDSBGA|5.0|To Kill a Mockingbird. The children actors were superb, especially the nuanced performance of the little sister tagging along.<br />Gregory Peck was perfect.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|The movie is spectacular, the special commentary rocks of Joss Whedon goodness, wish there was deleted scenes and the making of the Avengers included in the special features.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This could have been a silly movie, but instead the themes of hope. sacrifice, tribute, humanity, love, politics, and conflict were effectively dramatized.  A believable fantasy of the best kind, where the contrivances of the story line lead us to think about timeless themes.
1608871088|5.0|great ! a wonderful piece of art :)<br />recommended ! it's a very pleasure to read, what a making of !
B009GED3HS|5.0|I am so glad that I can catch up on HIMYM on Amazon and stream onto my TV on my Roku. It is seamless and excellent quality.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i just wish you didnt need so many friends for certain quests. its fun otherwise but it slows progression and is a bit frustrating when you need a friend or 2 to do quests.

0307931803|5.0|Using this book to help with a small speech impediment.  Nightly reading of small sections work.  Over time the speech will improve.
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|it gets to a point where you can barely do anything without buying things. but it's okay otherwise. spent a few hours with my little nephew playing it
1400052173|5.0|Excellent book.  A must read for many Black Americans.  It was hurtful that the family has still been denied the truth or the earnings from the writings or the research.
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie.  I was a bit apprehensive as I liked the Alien movies prior to this one and had heard it was an attempt to a pre-story.  It was a great movie and didn't have a lot of gore as my wife had feared.  It was a good storyline and one I would tell people to see.
B004UPAIDK|2.0|Maybe had I watched it in the 80's I would have given it a better rating. As it was, it kinda sucked.
B000001ESF|5.0|I have had the vinal of this for years. Excellent tunes and a must-have CD for any Rush fan. Play it loud!
1250004217|5.0|Just a wonderful book - I could not put it down.  I must admit that I cried through most of it as it brought back lots of memories.  Worth the time spent reading it.
B009VLX8FS|4.0|I have to turn the volume bigger than normal to receive the sound effect.  I like the download speed, easy and fast!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|We have this on our pc, so my hsb got it for my reader. I need to feel security when I use it.
0525953728|4.0|This book gives you some insight into what it takes to be a navy seal. The sacrifices these brave men and women deal with is incredible. God bless our troops!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|The Piano Guys are simply stated, awesome.  Their talent combined with their love of music create stirring masterpieces that warm the heart and free the mind to discover what creative juices are found within.  Good music when created with passion and dedication is hard to find anymore in the music industry.  It seems that everything needs to be techno or have a massive bass beat in order to draw in the masses.  As found with classical music compositions, hard beats aren't necessary to draw one in to the music and keep one coming back.  These pieces are unique yet take from other popular (and some not so popular) pieces and are combined to create a completely new sound that is refreshing in the music world today.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|The writing was excellent, but many of the stories were just too depressing for me right now.  Maybe some of them were just too close to home.
0783225547|5.0|Good drama. Pierce Brosnan and Linda Hamilton make a good acting pair. Good special effects and suspense well acted and well written.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Who can get enough of Harry Bosch?  Not only is he a great detective but also a foodie!  Great combination.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I seriously love the Piano Guys. Their music is pur genius! This album is fantastic. If you are considering buying it, do it without hesitation!
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great spiritual story--not at all what I had expected.  So different what I usually read but enjoyable.  Doesn't hurt to stretch horizons.
B00068TJM6|5.0|i helped my sis n law buy this for my brother as an anniversary gift and i have to say it is a great looking watch, price was great and with PRIME you can't beat the shipping
B007SGLZP8|5.0|My husband has read this first and says it's a gripper--so suspenseful from the beginning to the end. What else would you expect from Grisham?
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Very entertaining, my 14 year old daughter even enjoyed watching the Dark Knight.  She normally does not enjoy action adventure type movies.
B000R9RGF6|5.0|Exceded all my expectations.  We have listened to it while driving since we receiving it.  GREAT MUSIC for traveling by car.
1451620829|4.0|A must read for any KISS fan, this book documents Peter Criss's entire life but most broadly covers his years in the band.  Criss's inability to accept any responsibility for mistakes he has made in his life make him largely unsypmathetic to the reader. His bitterness towards the band, his ex-wives and such a vast majority of people he has dealt with his in his life leads one to ponder what sort of catharsis writing the book even brought.  However, his loathing is our gain as he tosses out juicy tidbit after juicy tidbit throwing Gene, Paul and most interestingly, Ace under the bus. Likely there is a lot of truth in the book and it was hard to put down, but it did lead this reader into having a lower opinion of Mr. Criss.
B0079L2XTE|5.0|Music from the movie motivated me to buy the CD.  Love the CD so much i then ordered LUDOVICO EINAUL. DIVENIRE
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The Panther is a good DeVille adventure where Corey goes after an American-born terrorist in Yemen. This DeVille installment is the next chapter in Corey's fight against terrorism that is written in nail-biting detail.
030758836X|4.0|This book came highly recommended by a coworker, and although I don't usually trust book reviews from people I don't know to be avid readers, I decided to give this one a try.  I also don't usually read New York Times best sellers because I find that the opinion of the masses does not generally match my opinion.<br /><br />I wasn't immediately smitten with this book.  In fact, I had to power through the first 100 pages before I was really, truly hooked. I found myself feeling guilty and depressed for the main character whose wife is missing and found it easy to put down and forget about.  Eventually I picked it back up on the strong recommendation of a friend who had already read it.  I must say, as I continued to read, I was pleasantly surprised.  It does live up to it's hype as a thriller, full of twists and unsuspecting turns.  The book is well written and very well thought out.<br /><br />Many people seemed to be dissatisfied with the ending of the book.  It wasn't so much that I was left wanting more, I just felt that the ending was weak, considering the strength of the rest of the book.<br /><br />It is definitely worth a read, or you can just wait until the movie comes out, which I'm sure will be just as exciting.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|it's just not that exciting of a book for me which is just my opinion. i had heard good things from a friend, but i enjoy more suppense for passion more excitement from a fantasy book. i feel like the book pertains around of 12 year old which kinda ruins it for me.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|Need something for my ematic cheapo tablet. Love the theft security. Got SOPHOS for phone but going to install this
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Grand but it could be a little more exciting I mean it was crap and it was very boring and I nearly fell asleep wow this typing is class I am sliding my finger across the page and it is making a word like I slide my finger along the letters of the word and the word I wanted will come up see this is more interesting than reading that crappy book
1400049628|5.0|This book was FANTASTIC! It was well written, illustrated, and hilariously terrifying! Max Brooks is really coming into his own (FINALLY!) with World War Z and this is it's companion (more or less). It's a reference book of sorts and the survival techniques are sound. Take out ZOMBIE and replace with any aggressor and this book still holds it weight. MORE PLEASE!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Might be the best sports movie ever. If you love Rocky you'll love this movie.  Great acting by all the actors
0345529057|5.0|Made it through the four books in under 2 weeks.  Called out sick at least one day and made it through the entire third book.  Got irritated when I got to book four and saw what Martin had done with breaking up the story.  Have purchased book five and read it.  My main concern at this point isn't the integrity of the series as written by Martin, it's what happens to the integrity of the story if Martin isn't writing it.  Considering George looks like the comic book guy from the Simpsons, aged 20 years, and he's most likely overworked and stressed from producing an awesome (although not as good as the books) show for HBO, and it took him 7 years between the fourth and fifth, AND he has 2 more books to write, I have some serious misgivings about the percentages on him actually finishing the books.  However I'm keeping my fingers and toes and eyes crossed, as this is one of my top-two favorite series ever.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I've heard nothing but horrible things when other people give their thoughts on Prometheus. I'm easily entertained and try to notice the positive things about a film, however, and I think it's a great summer sci-fi flick. The best sci-fi film in the past few years...
B0027BVMSY|4.0|Still good.  Really regret not reading the fine print about streaming HD movies before I bought it, and had to revert to standard def just to play it over my PC.  However, that didn't influence my rating.  Still give it 4 out of 5.
B002ZG9846|5.0|If you don't love the idea of Nicolas Cage playing a Batman-like figure, you don't deserve to be able to watch this film.
B007HACDLK|3.0|It almost seemed like Vince was hurrying to finish.  It was OK but not up to his previous standards, which I understand, given the medical issues he has had.  I'm still a huge Vince Flynn fan and will certainlypurchase his next book.
B0045I3EJM|5.0|A movie that doesn't seem to be in many people's lists, but is worth a watch. It's a cool premise, and an interesting look at the effects of a few seemingly insignificant decisions. Although it does take a turn for the weird at the end, the movie as a whole is actually great.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|esta pelicula esta mucho mejor que la primera,en efectos y la calidad del sonido ademas con calidad de full HD se las recomiendo para disfrutarla en familia!!...  :)
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Picky movie-goers complained that this film didn't live up to it's predecessors, but as a whole this film wraps up the trilogy and ends the franchise at a high point. Nolan pumped out another great film.
B004JMSIRC|5.0|esta muy buena la pelicula para verla en familia ,lo mejor disfrutarla en HD y un sonido digital si pueden obterla se las recomiendo
B001JNNDDI|5.0|This little film about a family's adventurous journey to a beauty pageant is one of the best road trip films since National Lampoons Vacation (but better).
B009FBX5M0|4.0|The soundtrack music on the album was great and the best set of tracks in years for a James Bond film. However, the practice of not including an artist's title song ('Skyfall' by Adele) is disrespectful of customers who expect an entire soundtrack to be included when they purchase a movie soundtrack.<br /><br />James Bond movie soundtracks have always included the title song until Casino Royale and Chris Cornell's 'You Know My Name'. The non-inclusion of a title song is a lousy way to treat customers, forcing them to make a digital download purchase in addition to the soundtrack album if they want to experience the movie soundtrack in its entirety.<br /><br />If an artist does not want their song on a soundtrack album then I would rather they not sing a James Bond film title song. It is all about content control and not satisfying customers.
B000EWBKK8|5.0|These days, Nicolas Cage isn't known for being an incredible actor. He's had a bit of a rough career lately, but watching this movie will remind you why he's such a big name. He pulls off the role incredibly well, and gives an awesome performance. Lord of War is, quite simply, badass.
B00003CXZ4|5.0|N now so grateful to have a copy of it! Saw it b4 I had my stroke and got to feel what it would be like when I watched this movie!!! As I recall it arrived w/in Delivery Window and started to watch it and it seemed to work fine! THANK YOU amazon.com!!!
0545123291|5.0|Shiver, the first book in the Wolves of Mercy Falls series, was one of the most enjoyable reads of 2009. Sam and Grace's fight to make Sam human and help him lose his wolf side was tragic, heroic, and portrayed with a lightness that showed us that not every love story has to be gloom and doom. Grace was a great heroine, logical, strong, and passionate she defied the stereotype that women in romance have to be weak or subservient.<br /><br />Linger is the second book in the Mercy Falls Trilogy, and while it does suffer from `middle book' syndrome, it's still an incredible read. The secret world that we are introduced to in book one is still there, there are still wolves in the woods that turn human when it becomes warm out, Grace's parents are still failing at parenting, and Sam and Grace are still in love, but now they have a new adversary. Grace begins to develop symptoms of an illness that they can't explain, and that the doctors seem unable to explain. It seems that Sam and Grace have fought the odds to be together just so that Grace can die while Sam watches, helpless to save her.<br /><br />Isabel becomes more of a character than she was in the first book, and we are introduced to a new character. Cole St. Clair. Cole was a rock star before Beck changed him into a wolf, and his reasons for wanting the change make him a great foil for Sam, who is utterly perplexed by the lack of attachment that Cole feels for his human form. Cole is the one who ultimately figures out what is wrong with Grace, and what is killing all of the Mercy Falls Wolves.<br /><br />While Shiver worked as a stand alone book and as part of a trilogy, Linger needs both the previous book and the following book in order to make sense. None of the new plot threads are wrapped up comfortably, and the cliffhanger is near infuriating. Therein lies the books greatest strength. Stiefvater successfully makes us care about every character. Even Isabel and Cole, who are horribly flawed, is written in such a way that everyone can identify with them. Splitting the narrative four ways instead of two does create a new challenge though, not flipping ahead to find out what happens to your favorite character is a constant trial, but a rewarding one. The four perspectives come together to create a more balanced view, and Cole provides a good break from the love story.<br /><br />Maggie Stiefvater is one of my favorite Young Adult authors for many reasons. She's funny, clever, obviously well-read, and truly dedicated to her characters and her readers. All of her readers should check out her blog, which is updated regularly.  Forever is the final book in the series.<br /><br />Meghan Drummond<br />wovenmyst.comh a way that everyone can identify with them.

B0091XIZO0|5.0|As I recall it arrived w/in the projected delivery window but the DVD was not labeled. ...That seemed a bit &#34;strange&#34; to me. Don't know what to make of that! None the less the music is GREAT!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I work out at home frequently with Jillian and Bob Harper, and Billy Blank's Tae Bo dvd's.  Jillians for me are always the most challenging.  I always sticks with hers as hers seem to have the best results.  What I love is that she has a realistic approach and doesn't say cheesy things in her work outs.  I work out 4- 5 days a week and Jillian's dvd's still make my heart pound and burn away my unwanted calories.  I highly recommend Jillian's work outs if you haven't tried them.  She is my favorite trainer of all, especially to keep yourself motivated when working out at home.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Delivered within days of order. Packaged well for shipping. No complaints at all! Can't wait to give as a gift!

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I love this album by the Piano Guys. I had been listening to many of these songs on youtube and was thrilled when my husband bought it for me. I listen to it in the car all the time. My husband just asked me the other day how I wasn't sick of it yet. I told him \\"I love it!\\" I love the passion behind the music. Watch the guys play, you really get a feel for how much they love making the music. It's wonderful.
B005HWUBZ0|5.0|he has that good old motown sound. it was refreshing to hear such nice music even with a little bit of rap
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is the most awesome thing that we have played.  this game is so cool. I really really really love to play this game.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Don't support these greedy people. Buy it on lego.com for $35. It's available now. Be patient if its unavailable. Lego keeps restocking!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|One of those books that are hard to put down. When I wasn't reading it I was thinking about when I could start again.<br />Can't wait for the next one
B003ZUTVJS|5.0|Great Movie my wife had to watch it for an ASD class and I didn't want to watch it with her but I ended up watching it and really enjoyed it
B0055SWM08|5.0|I find this game to be very enjoyable, and while it is easy to learn the basics, the puzzles become more and more challenging. My only complaint is the soundtrack. It's a nice little tune, very soothing, but it gets monotonous in a short while, and then it gets really annoying and I have to turn off the music or go loopy. Otherwise,  it's a great way to relax at lunch away from the office.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I absolutely love the Piano Guys.  They create a fun and lively rendition of what ever piece they are working with.  I look forward to more from them!
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Liked it a lot, it is morphing into a really good run. Hope to see more and soon. Oh so worth seeing.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Spoilers aside, this movie takes the &#34;we're just going to punch you in the face with funny&#34; approach. Not much subtlety, but they don't need it. There's a plethora of one-liners that they've worked in that you'll miss a few times, so I suggest coming back and watching it again in a few weeks just to pick up on everything you might've missed while crying your eyes out from laughing. Don't feel like writing a long review, so I'm not going to. Enjoy.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just bought this game 2 days ago and I haven't had any trouble so far. I recommend this game to people who want to be mayors, governors, and such because it teaches you how to run a city, state, or country!  Very nice game and I love all the G5 games.  I hope you enjoy this game aswell.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great series. I just love love love love love love old English movies. I would purchase again if I had to!
B005OK721G|5.0|DVD arrived quickly and in excellent condition.  It's a really good movie if you like to see justice prevail. Good acting, lots of action and a good plot.
0345803493|5.0|Love love love this trilogy! Story line is really good and entertaining. One of the best books I have ever read!
B005K17RU0|4.0|The longest term forecast for any weather app.  Nice screens for presentation of all the weather info.  Widgets would be better with transparent background and selectable colors for characters.  Gray is boring.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|love these guys!  We just went to their concert. Totally awesome!  We bought this album at the concert and keep listening to it over and over!  Nice to have good, uplifting music in our home and car.  Highly recommend these guys.
B004TN7QPG|2.0|I've been a user of Cool Reader for years. I've also tinkered with Moon Reader, but never was satisfied with its performance.  I decided to buy Moon Reader for it's ability to edit and annotate PDF's. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to try this feature before I bought the program. It's definitely not a big selling point: ezPDF is much better at annotation and using forms. The reader is nice, but seems several generations behind other free ebook readers. With recent updates to Cool Reader, Moon Reader is going to struggle to compete. The only advantage Moon Reader has it's abilit to open .cbr & .cbz files. But it's not as good as free alternative Perfect Viewer.  If I had bought this program through GooglePlay, I probably would have asked for  a refund. Unfortunately, Amazon's return policy is non-existent.<br /><br />EDIT: On a positive note, the developer does answer emails and helped me with a problem I was having.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely loved it!!! I couldn't put it down!!! I want a forth book And a fifth and so on, that's how much I loved it!
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Carol King was one of the best female singer/songwriters of this generation and I still enjoy listening to her as much now as ever.
1423140591|4.0|my son liked it so i had to buy it on line. Hoping it will come in soft cover but they mailed a hard cover version.
B000002KDX|5.0|This album contains some of their best vocals and guitar work.Put on a pair of headphones and you can hear all the work that went into making this album.
1423140605|4.0|son liked reading the series and was not available in the library so we bought on line expecting it will be in soft cover.
0439023513|5.0|I am in love with these books. I have lent them out numerous times to people who have ALL said how much they love them. I can read them over and over again and never get bored!
B004GNFSO0|5.0|I truly loved everything about this book and would not change a single thing about it.  What a great read!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Suzanne Collins is an amazing writer! I love all of her books. The characters, the details that make you feel like you are there and can really visualize everything!
B0087DFIYA|5.0|Expected a straight to video quality movie made by a former star who is currently on the Hollywood \\"NO-NO LIST\\" and was totally wrong. Unusual plot and setting. Held my interest throughout.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|It is always nice to go back and reread these stories. I am glad I invested the time to do it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|If I could translate into words every sound The Piano Guys produce, I would never cease talking. Absolutely incredible music from this duo!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I truly loved everything about this book and would not change a single thing about it.  What a great read!
B005MJ883K|3.0|I love the Perplexus line of toys, and own all three. Unfortunately, the epic doesn't live up to the standard set by the other two. Because it's significantly larger but uses the same materials as the other two, it's much more delicate and wobbly. This makes it harder, but not in a good way, in a very frustrating way, where it feels like you were just unlucky. Also, like another reviewer there are some slight molding issues that make a couple areas more difficult than they are supposed to be, which is doubly frustrating. Overall, I'd recommend sticking to the other two Perplexus products (which again are awesome), and trying to catch a Superplexus if you can.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Addicting but repetitive at the same<br />time. I loved it but then I hated it. Not a very deep story line but a cute/dark love story
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|I have been waiting months for this album to come out ever since I heard, \\"If I Didn`t Know Better\\" on the pilot. The sticker on the album said it had \\"Fade Into You\\" on it, but I was disappointed to find it was not on it. Such a shame. Other than that, there is something for all country/music fans on this album. The beautiful duets between Claire Bowen and Sam Palladino, Hayden Panetierre`s pop-country songs, and Connie Britton`s Martina McBride/Reba-type songs.
1451688091|5.0|Saw the movie, bought the book.  Looks like good winter reading.I look forward to spending some winter reading time with this book.
1609611543|5.0|This book is a staple in my kitchen. Thanks. For making it available!  I am trying to learn healthy eating!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|As a young cellist, this album is excellently done and inspirational! I'd love to make music like this one day with my best friend. This album is worth the exorbitant cost simply to experience the pure unadulterated bliss that is...THE PIANO GUYS.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|it a really fun game! good for little kids and hospital waiting time too lol! the only thing is I wish they would let u have is more gems in the beginning. but other then that fantastic game!
0780622650|5.0|dear amazon,that was a really funny movie and it was good too. but be careful amazon, if you ever go for a ride in space, make sure you bring a map with you before you leave, or at least make sure your car has a good GPS system. mom says space is big. anyway, thats whats happening in this movie. you see, this family goes for a ride in space but then they get lost and cant find there way back home. mom says getting lost in space can really ruin your day.she says not all aliens are frindly. she says lots of TV people got lost in space too, Jason vorhees, Han Solo,The leprechaun,Superman and even bruce willis one time. anyway amazon, you be careful when you drive in space and you check your GPS regurlarly.<br /><br />your frind kent
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Downloaded it right to my kindle fire HD. Watched it on our tv in the living room. It was easy and affordable.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Ever since I found them on youtube I have been a fan.  Their music is awesome and they make classical music enjoyable for all.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is always dependable. It always works great. I can tag items right from websites. I have used this product for almost a year and have never been disappointed.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Whether you're managing local content, something on your local server, or something in \\"the cloud\\", this gets it done.  You can cut, copy and paste content between local drives and network drives easily.  It also supports renaming files.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|The movie is amazing. Takes me back to when I was kid. I think Keaton had the best overall take on both Wayne and Batman. I wish him and Burton had the chance to do the third and fourth movie and it would've been a nice little quadrilogy to the Batman mythology. Still a great movie and worth the buy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is so helpful in many ways, including the &#34;tip&#34; calculator , which it does in percentage rather than decimal points. I can see all calculations on the screen as I go, and that is very helpful when doing adding, subtracting, etc.with the same set of numbers. The large screen is also a plus. It is so much better than the ancient calculator I have been using.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|So great to see and hear this group again, Jimmy Page is still by far phenominal! These songs took me straight back to my teenage  years
0307592731|5.0|You don't have to hike to appreciate Cheryl Strayed's memoir, Wild. You just have to be human. Strayed captures a world of experience and feeling in this book.
B008S6B41C|5.0|It sounds like you're in the recording studio with the band. Listen to it in stereo or 5.1 Surround Sound, either will be the best you've hear. It's worth the money.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Classic movie that everyone should have in their collection!  Fun, honest, and just an over all great movie for the whole family to enjoy!
B006X415GK|5.0|My niece was so surprised by this find! She has so many monster high dolls but this black and white one really stood out.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. There were lots of twists and turns. Drove me crazy....sign of a well written book!!
B006O6EOII|5.0|Great colors and accessories. such a unique doll when these dolls are every where! my niece is very excited too. :)
B008XCF7Y6|1.0|Should have stopped the movie after 15 minutes but I kept hoping it would get better. By far the worst starship troopers yet.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have been looking for a game for a time now. I used to play one on a web site for children and another was a computer version of the game Set. I discovered Flow Free today and had to force myself to stop playing. There appears to be a lot of levels and playing options ranging from simple to difficult.
B002LFAHBO|4.0|Been wanting a copy for a while now.  Limited special features on this version of the dvd.  So, that is regrettable.
B007PVHMCG|4.0|the box it self is size of 5*7 picture. and dudes inside are around an inch.So hope kid enjoys for price!
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Breading Bad is one of the best TV shows I have seen in recent years. Also the seller had the DVDs shipped ultra fast and they were in excellent shape.
B007SGM084|5.0|I do not care what some have said, this was a great story and I have read the series twice now. Just like a good movie, you buy it and watch it again and again.
B007C52NY2|3.0|which is fine, but i didn't realize they were used books. i'm just glad they were for me and not a xmas present!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|Better than most other similar gem swap games, but not exactly revolutionary or greatly exciting  ... 4 more words :)
0756655307|3.0|I was disappointed with the service provided ( lateness / damages occured ) and also no customer service was involved.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Weird aspect ratio changes in the 1 movie I watched so far (dark night) but great movies at an even better price
