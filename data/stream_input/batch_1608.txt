B008IJT0CE|5.0|I really enjoyed the free version and the pay version is even better. The variety and range of sounds to mix to your personal preference are amazing.<br />keep up the good work!
B008602KQI|4.0|The Movie was good but not as good as the book.  Some of the characters are miss matched according to the books description.
B0083ZBW2Y|3.0|The book was kind of boring I kind of got lost in it but overall it was a good book
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I find that doing ten minutes of this game before bed helps me fall asleep faster and sleep deeper. I highly recommend it for people who have slight difficulty unwinding.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Martin does a great job keeping you so caught up in all the characters, it's an amazing book, and a fantastic series! One of the best series out there!
B0031RS2HC|5.0|A great read,  hard to put the book down once you started reading.  It was the first book I have read from this author and will definitely read some of his others.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|The DVD combo set is amazing. I downloaded the item on itunes and was able to take it and the extras with me when I traveled across the states. Amazon is amazing, the DVD arrived the day it came out. I came home and popped in my DVD the instant I got it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Thus far I have only read the 1st of 3 books and it was marvelous.  I highly recommend this book it was a great read.  I could not put it down.  I can't wait to get the next book.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Works great. I downloaded my class reading assignments and they were all readible. Hope it works just as well with my kindle fire HD.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|This book is a great read because Taubes fundamentally changes the way you think about losing weight.  The evidence is compelling, the arguments are convincing, and it's helped me to lose some weight pretty quickly.  It's not a \\"diet book,\\" but rather an intuitive case for a lifestyle change.  Definitely recommend it!
B007SGM084|5.0|I usually do not like to read but thiese books... I loved it! I could not put it down. Wish there was more of it to read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I went into this Book thinking it would be something like a Needful Things type novel.  Where the \\"real world\\" is effected by a mysterious force.  But its not its something all on its own.  Its people changing history with what what they are given.<br />I think without giving a whole lot of details out, Its simply a book that deserves to be read by anyone who even has a small interest in History and how people react to situations that they are thrown into.

B004XZ99LO|4.0|Our family members are Cirque du Soleil fans. We all enjoyed watching Journey of Man in 3D high-def. It was short, but well done, and the 3D was fantastic! Journey of Man is now one of our better 3D examples to be showing off to our friends.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Fabulous rendition of the Dr. Seuss classic! Thoroughly enjoyed it and would recommend this movie for any family movie night! The message is worthwhile!
B005KR6NS6|5.0|This is a an excellent film, which becomes a character study of the tango and the two main characters.  How each character changes is well acted.  And the dance scenes are wonderful!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good game but you can cheat to make thing move faster.  if you change you date and time it'll move faster for you.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|A story about child abduction back in the late 20's and how it was handled by a corrupt police department. It is based on a True Story.  A must see and I must say, I do not know when I have had so many different reactions or feelings while watching a movie. As a woman and mother I was amazed how things and people were treated back then. Jolie gives a great performance.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I have an Acer tablet and this app works great.  I am able to look at my favorite videos anytime.
B00005JMYI|3.0|To read the cast of this movie is like a roll call of some of the best comedy talent of the last twenty years... Will Ferrell, Christina Applegate, Paul Rudd, Steve Carrell - yet the movie itself is just average.<br /><br />Ferrell has rounded up a posse of idiots in Champ, a loud-motuhed drunk with a country hat, Brick, who is very weird (and funny) indeed and the guy with the moustache, Fantana, all led by Rob Burgundy, who you wouldn't want to have reading the news, which is most exciting when reporting on cat beauty contests and panda bears giving birth.<br /><br />Sure, the movie is funny, but it's just not a great movie - The ending is so bland, with the rival reporter kissing him, and the idea aren't coming; Ferrell and his posse just act silly and clown around, but they ideas just aren't there. It's worth around 2 1/2 - alright for a viewing experience, a few laughs, but not much else. By the way, I thought Steve Carell was the funniest in the movie as  the character Brick.

0739321005|5.0|I am no Sigmund Freud. However, I related with 'Dreams of My Father' on many notes and numerous levels. I regret not reading the hard cover back in it's original printing as it would have affected my choices back a few years ago. However, never too late to put on a pair of ear phones, multi-task and listen to many interesting stories of how women, i.e. his mother Ann, his Grandmother have influenced and developed Barry/Barack (Ann Obama's affectionate reference) to a very critical time in our nations history. I, as always, will re-listen and re-listen in between times I am not tackling other challenges. I particularly appreciated hearing his voice as it felt I was in a room alone listening with both ears and one heart.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|it was fabulous ending of all three Hunger Games books))) It gets even more political in the third volume but Happy end made me cry)))
0345803485|1.0|This is without any doubt the worst book I have ever read.  Terrible writing.  Juvenile, boring and sad.  Don't bother reading it unless your idea of entertainment is reading the same page over and over again. I don't understand how anyone would pick up the second book let alone the third.  Can't believe this book was published and that any critic gave it a favorable review.

B007HO392S|5.0|First time purchasing any Carrie Underwood cd. Every single song on this cd is fantastic. I have since purchased 2 of her previous cds. What a voice!
0553582038|2.0|Listening to the audio books and playing catch-up on the series.  Book 3 was amazing, action filled and an incredible plot.  Book 4 just leaves me with an empty filling, and wondering what was the point.  For some of the other comments, Mr. Martin intended to age the characters, and have an entirely different book 4.  Which would have probably made more sense.<br /><br />I truly feel that Book 4 was a complete waste.  Sam did nothing.  Brienne seems like a stumbling idiot going from place to place. Excuse the image, but why hasn't someone bashed Cercei's head in Too many good people have died because of her lies, and all the realm knows it. And now we find out there's a freaking prophecy.  We could have found this out in the first two books, thank you very much. The only characters I found remotely interesting in this book were Jamie Lannister,  Arya Stark, and the wolves running around in the Forrest. Please no more filler books. It insults our intelligence and assaults our pocket books.
B000FC1HBY|4.0|As with Game of thrones I could hardly put this book down.  I got into this series when a friend of mine at work started reading it and recommended it to me, I have since recommended this series to my family and friends as well.
B008S7EPXA|5.0|Glad to see after so many years the duo have not lost their touch. I have been a dead can dance fan since the mid 90s and if you liked them before you will love the new album.
B003U6HQGW|5.0|I first read this book over forty years ago, I started it after working a night shift and could just not put it down.  Starting with vertually nothing, Slavomir and his companions broke out of a Soviet labour camp north of the Arctic Circle and walked across Siberia and the Gobi desert scaled the Himilayers and finaly to freedom in India.  What a true memorial tho human survival and endurance.
B007KZY1YY|4.0|I thought It was a great book, but not everyones choice. I have also enjoyed the rest of the triology.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I have been using Pintrest since their beginning.  It has come a long way and has quickly become my favorite site even more than Facebook.  I visit the site everyday.  There is a little bit of everything.  From great food recipes, homeschooling ideas, great fashion posts, make up and hair even architecture.  I wish that they had Pintrest when I was a teen in the 90's.  I highly recommend and love this site!!!

B000R7HY0K|5.0|I was honestly dead set against seeing this for the past few years because for one it being attached to Robert Rodriguez's \\"Planet Terror\\" (which may be a good movie, but it looked like a gore-fest, and I was taking a stance against those back when \\"Grindhouse\\" came out), and also because of all the negative reviews I've read over the past couple of years.<br /><br />However, I finally relented and let curiosity get the better of me and ordered a copy and watched it yesterday. And let me just say: WOW! WOW!! WOW!!! I fkg LOVE it! Did I say WOW?! Best movie I've seen in ages. True story!<br /><br />From the opening animated credit sequence to the final frame of closing credits, this is such a breathtaking, riveting masterpiece! And there are so many iconic images from everything 1970's drive-in cinema, and includes one of the greatest soundtracks ever committed to film. Tarantino even made use of Pino Donnagio's awesome score from Brian De Palma's \\"Blow Out\\" (the small piano piece that plays while one of the female characters reads a text message early in the film).<br /><br />Since pretty much every reviewer has mentioned the plot in pretty much every review since the movie came out, I am not gonna bore you with repeating that here. I will, however, say that I have never seen some of these actors in a better film. Ever! This is the best work from Kurt Russell since his glorious work in John Carpenter's classics, like \\"Escape From New York\\".<br /><br />And every single female in the cast is riveting! (Excuse me if I've used that word already.) Especially Zoe Bell, playing herself. You may recognize Zoe from her stunt work being Uma Thurman's stunt double in Tarantino's \\"Kill Bill\\". She is simply electrifying as an actress!<br /><br />Anyways, really don't know what else to say except that if you haven't already seen this movie, don't wait another minute: See. It. NOW! And I am gonna go now and watch it again (for the third time since yesterday afternoon).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! Thanks for reading! :)<br /><br />The End<br /><br />Randall Brooks<br />(author, \\"The Two Worlds of the Mind\\")HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

B008602KQI|4.0|As with most books that are made into movies this one leaves out a lot of the great details you find in the book.  The movie in itself is great though! I strongly encourage you to read the book!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never thought I  would enjoy this book because of the violence, but it was recommended by a friend.  Once I started reading it, I could not put it down. It is a cry for the end to violence and war. Just to have compassion and not send our children to fight wars that we and our leaders have created over the centuries.  I had to read all three books in this series.
B002R5QPRI|4.0|Whitney's singing is awesome in this movie, I see why they waited a year until she was available to do the movie.  Her acting is good too.  Kevin was good as usual and they had good chemistry together. I bought the soundtrack too.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy is a great series of 3 of the best action movies in recent times.  Filled with fight scenes, weaponry, romance, intellegence, surveillance, technology, and great acting by Matt Damon and supporting cast members, these movies are awesome!
B000V6Q9NU|5.0|The music reminds me of scenes from the movie. It was an excellent movie And the music was describes it all wonderfully.
B000FC1MM8|4.0|This was a well written book that presented the characters in detail.  The plot was twisting and turning so that you had to keep reading to see where you were going next.  There was enough action as well as exporation of the characters.

Am able to use it as a good instant messaging program for those who are on the go and you can even view deals from within.  Hopefully soon they'll add features to play a few flash games right off of it or something to that effect.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|from the tip of the spear, a great story told!  to bad we are denied the pictures and videos we paid for.
B006RXQBJS|4.0|I saw this years ago when it came on tv, and was hooked. Seeing it again was a real treat. However you can tell it's made by Guillermo Del Toro just by the factor that the plot is given away at the beginning of the movie, but still is a good movie nonetheless.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is addictive. I can't stop playing. I love it. It is so much fun. My kids love it also. Fun for the whole family.

B006BAEQB2|4.0|The Kingmaker's Daughter tells the story of the War of the Roses from the perspective of Anne Neville, the shy daughter of Richard Neville, who was instrumental in putting Edward IV on the throne of England.  What is so intriguing is the uncertain feeling about Richard III the reader is left with. First, we see him through the eyes of a young Anne, completely devoted to him and the strong, but loving and tender side of Richard's personality is showcased.  Slowly, cracks in the armour of chivalry appear, and a darker side is shown.  The reader is left wondering why Richard left himself an out by not filing for the papal dispensation as he promised Anne before they married.  After their son's untimely death and Anne's subsequent physical and emotional disintegration, is he really courting the young Princess Elizabeth of York (or Mistress Elizabeth Grey, as Anne insists she be called), or merely putting on a show for Hunry Tudor's benefit?  I'll let you decide, but it seemed to me that he was ready to put Anne aside. He had lost his heir and Anne was unlikely to bear another child- this left him politically vulnerable.<br />In the end, Anne discovers that so much of her life was predicated on apparently false assumptions- Elizabeth Woodville wasn't really out to get her, her sister was probably not poisoned, her nephew likely died of SIDS- not as a result of the Queen's vindictive nature. Her years of hating- indeed, Anne herself gave the Queen control of her emotional well-being and very possibly misinterpreted many of Elizabeth's actions because of her assumptions and fear.Over the course of the story, Anne evolves from an amenable young lady to a suspicious- dare I say-hateful- woman.I have loved all of the books in this series and like seeing the events through the eyes of three different characters.  I can't wait for the next book- I believe Elizabeth of York is up to bat.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|Never been one for TV or movies, but I cannot stop watching Dexter! Love that I can bring it along on my Kindle Fire<br />Recommended for anyone and everyone
B008MJC6ZS|5.0|I've been a Testament fan since their \\"Practice What You Preach\\" album came out, and along with the subsequent 2 albums, \\"Souls of Black\\" and \\"The Ritual\\" are still among some of my most favorite metal albums out there. As a drummer, those 3 albums were also instrumental in my learning and ultimately the style I eventually developed. However, after \\"The Ritual\\", I wasn't as impressed with Testament's work. Maybe it was the fact that Louis Clemente was no longer their drummer, or maybe it was the deeper vocals Chucks started to use. I just remember the later albums not being as outstanding to me. However, this one blew me away! It's still got the more gritty sound, but there's something about it that takes me back to those 3 albums I mentioned above. A great album from start to finish! Highly recommended even if you're not familiar with their previous work.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I've played Flow Free extensively on my Kindle Fire &amp; my Samsung Galaxy S phone, and it works flawlessly on both. I wish there were more 8x8 and 9x9 boards, as I find the smaller ones unchallenging. Overall, it's an excellent free game with puzzle diificulties ranging from child to adult.
B0018AM1ZS|5.0|This is the first LOTR soundtrack I've listened to from start to finish, so I can't compare it to the other 2. This is also the first score I've heard from this composer, so I'm not comparing him to other works either. What I am comparing this score to is all the other scores to \\"saga films\\" that I have listened to many times. (The Star Wars, Harry Potter, Narnia, Back to the Future and Indiana Jones films.) All in all, I thought it was a great listen, from start to finish with only a few slow spots. I'm definitely going to eventually get the other 2, but I figured I'd start with the film with the most action since I particularly enjoy scores to action sequences. I'm not going to go into details of certain tracks and what-not, but I can tell you that if you enjoy music from epic sci-fi or fantasy films, this score does not disappoint.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|So addictive, I couldn't put it down, was so ready for number three..ultimate steamy love story! A must read for the mature adult (25 or older)

B008D4AKYQ|5.0|In my 5 figure CD collection , prog holds a very special place. And in that special place are a few bands that stand way above the rest in that genre. Big Big Train is one of those bands.<br />I have everything released by the band including the very rare \\"Bard\\" , but \\"English Electric Part One\\" is soon becoming a favorite. There simply isn't a wasted or dull moment on this disc.<br />The lyrics are thoughtful , the musicianship is exquisite , and the performance is stunning from second one to the very end.<br />I love how they tied the second track of the album into the last without seeming gimmicky. A reprise has been done billions of times , yet this one works due to it's subtlety and without fanfare.<br />I believe one of my favorite facets of this band is that they continually make progressive music that is not bombastic or overblown. Although that technique works for many a prog band , Big Big Train succeeds on a usage of quiet , understated passages that flow so seamlessly that you don't realize 8 or 12 minutes have gone by. The flute work is especially welcomed , and is in it's best usage since the Peter Gabriel era of Genesis.<br />I wish \\"English Electric Part Two\\" was coming out next week , and not next year!<br />Buy everything from Big Big Train. You won't be disappointed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I didn't care for the first book at first bit now that I read all the way thru I m addicted

B008IJT0CE|5.0|My kids and i really enjoy creating soothing sounds wtih this app. The free version is good, and the paid version has tons more sounds. I like that I can adjust the volume level of each element individually - the kids have gotten very creative wtih it. The timer function is also great for bedtime, so it doesn't run all night.

B008EQIEWS|1.0|I downloaded in the US to watch after a flight over to Germany. I missed the 48 hour time limit I guess, it didn't work.<br /><br /> 1 star because it wouldn't play, I hear it's good.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|We have enjoyed all seasons of Dexter and season 6 was the best yet.  Being able to watch it through Amazon Instant Video before it came out on DVD and for less money made it even better.  I highly recommend Dexter and Amazon Instant Video!

B007J2TMQ0|5.0|I have read many books about World War Two. This latest book in one of a few written by Antony Beevor on this subject, and one I have been looking forward to reading and<br />I wasn't disappointed.  It is well written, factual and it kept me interested until the past page.<br />  Anyone wanting to know more about the battles of Stalingrad and Berlin, would do well to refer to Antony Beevors books on these subjects. It is money and time well spent.

B008FQ0S1W|5.0|This is kind of a mediocre upbeat George Michael song. He's done worse, and he's also done far better. It's certainly better than Freeek! or Shoot the Dog, but not better than Precious Box or Outside. Lyrically, it's pretty weak (which is unusual for a George Michael song), but it's got a catchy tune, and the vocoder isn't as distracting as it was in his recent True Faith. The vocoder actually makes the bridge in this one aurally interesting. Overall, a very good song for George Michael fans. Keep it up, George!<br /><br />I just wish the B-side, Song to the Siren, was available on Amazon, because I don't do iTunes, even for George Michael.
B0086DBE62|2.0|I can honestly say this is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen.  Children may enjoy it, but it doesn't provide much in the way of adult entertainment.

B00846REIS|1.0|Comparing this book to Fifty Shades of Gray is like comparing dog food to caviar.  A real loser.  Don't waste your money.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a romance novel with a twist. Hard to put down!  A great story line and well written.  The characters are deeply developed and very likable.  Can't wait to finish this book and start the next!!!
B001R6AW18|5.0|I have seen this version of the movie a lot over the past 45 years and I rate this motion picture the best of the bunch.  Even though it may be black and white, the vivid scenery is the best because it almost has a 3-D appearance.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not what i expected, but it was an ok read. Wouldnt pay as much to read again, therefore havent gotten other 2 books.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book, although highly technical, is immensly readable and should be more widely publicised. My wife has had severe pain in the abdomen for many years. Various experts and a multitude of tests covering everything such as lactose intolerance, diverticulitis, sucrose intolerance etc etc. She has been on a wheat free diet for two months now and, though the pain is still present to some extent, it is liveable with. I can't reccomend this book too highly.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I usually respect Oprah's opinion on good books, this was a complete disappointment.  The book was hard to get into.  The characters were so intertwined it was hard to understand what was going on. I want a book that compels me to want to not put it down. The plot didn't compel me to even finish this.  I'm so sorry I spent the money when there are so many good books out there.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|The book's premise and world building is done well, subtle details that give you a peek at a future that could be our near future. It gives most of the background for the 80's pop culture that is at the center of the book's central puzzle - even as a gamer born in the 80's some of the video game stuff was before my time. It is ultimately a cute story full of male wish fulfillment and the power of friendship against our inevitable evil corporate overlords. Despite a slight pacing lag in the center, the book keeps the reader engaged and the story moving rapidly - so much so that I finished this in a single day. Like my title says, it is light feel good travel reading for geeks, but not a terribly deep novel.<br /><br />I was not surprised that the author was one of the screenwriters on the movie Fanboys - which is similar in light fluffiness without too much heavy effort on the part of the viewer.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Good product.  Only problem I encountered is that it won't let me put on more than two email accounts.  I use it daily.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I've ready all 3 and the first one I liked the best out of all of them. But as a whole, I didn't like the series at all.  I just couldn't like the characters and if I can't like the characters, I won't enjoy the book.

B008JAGG38|1.0|Expected more than I got from this American Pie sequel. I think the characters have had their time and I hope this is that last time at trying. So long American Pie...I'll remember when you were still funny.
B008602KQI|5.0|muy buena pelicula, es muy apegada al libro , excelentes actuaciones , real y autentica.<br />y esperando la proxima... en llamas , para comprarla ...
B008UUPOVM|5.0|I love putting on this album when I know I need to let loose. It's a great collection of songs that have catchy lyrics and beats that make you want to \\"shake it out!\\" I would recommend buying this for your teen. I really like how Owl City writes songs that have a lot of meaning, and he doesn't make it cheesy. One of my favorite songs on this album is \\"Speed of Love\\" It has a catchy beat and fun lyrics that get you dancing. I hope that more people will check this out, because its Awesome!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As you can read right in the title, this is the 5th book of The Song of Ice and Fire (a title I consistently want to read as 'A Song of Fire and Ice', which I blame on Trojan condoms). Frankly, this book could have been horrible and I would have read the whole thing in a week or two; I am hopelessly addicted to George R.R. Martin's saga by now.<br /><br />Luckily, this entry in the series is excellent. You want the trademark intrigue, backstabbing, politics, incest, and battle that make this series so compelling? Well this book has all of that save the incest, so its even better than the previous titles. No brother-sister finger-banging going on here, so bully to that. Unless that's your sort of thing, in which case I recommend you reread the first book and seek therapy. You'll see a number of your favorite (remaining) characters all touched upon in good detail, and several ancillary characters receive the same treatment. I'm particularly fond of the Brazen Beasts.<br /><br />In any case, if you're reading this review without prior knowledge of the Thrones series, stop and go buy the first book. But you, you who is currently up to date and thirsting for more (as reading the first 4 novels is wont to leave you), stop wasting your time and read the book already. Its pretty long, but not long enough. If you restart from book 1 after finishing this one you can probably finish the series another two times before Martin releases the next book.<br /><br />I hear Winds of Winter is coming; let's hope it does while we're still young.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|so much fun.  I even had to tell my children it was my turn.  great when you need to pass the time and relax.
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl: A Review<br />By Autumn Heigle<br /><br /> If you are fascinated by psychological warfare, sexual deviancy, and unsolved homicide cases, you should add Gone Girl by Gillian Flynn to your book list. It was a satisfying vacation read. The story involves a married couple, Amy and Nick Dunne, who lose their jobs as New York writers due to the waning market for printed news. It is the tale of trust-fund only-daughter meets self-made man from the backwaters of the Mississippi.<br /><br /> But abandon all expectations for cheese-stuffed romance or glittering goth boys, because this relationship quickly sours into a depraved, desperate mess of a marriage. When the money is gone and the two are forced to retreat to a washed up, bankrupt town in Missouri, they begin to peel back layers of each other's facades, and discover who they really married.<br /><br /> Flynn was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up with an intense interest in books and films. She received her undergraduate degrees in English and journalism at the University of Kansas and later earned her master's degree in journalism from Northwestern University. She wrote for ten years at Entertainment Weekly magazine before ascending into the world of published authors.<br /><br /> Gone Girl is a New York Times best seller and Flynn's third novel. Her first novel, Sharp Objects, was released in 2006 and received two of Britain's Dagger awards. Her second novel, Dark Places, was Publishers Weekly Best Book of 2009 and Chicago Tribune Favorite Fiction choice. Gilles Paquet-Brenner (Sarah's Key) is to direct the movie.<br /><br /> The book is separated into two major parts. By the time I reached the second, I had accrued many theories about the turn in plot. But nothing prepared me for the rabbit hole I was about to fall down. I found no white rodents, only the dark corners of a psychopath's mind.<br /><br /> Flynn alternates between the husband and wife's voices chapter by chapter. Her insight into the male and female psyche is uncanny. The characters unique personalities evolve through the action as the pieces drift together. Be warned, they will lie to you. I found my opinions of the characters and their situations evolved with the turn of each page. I was ravenously hungry for the conclusion to their twisted tale.<br /><br /> Around the last hundred pages, I was unable to set the book down. Huddled in the sink below the tiny window in a Parisian flat, I read by morning light to avoid disturbing my roommate. She awoke when I slammed the book shut and released an uncontainable, \\"Damn!\\" I was intrigued, angry, amused, and unsettled all at once.<br /><br /> If you are looking for a pink ribbon-wrapped ending sealed in grandma's kisses, stay the hell away from this book. But if you believe that the best stories are the ones that stir you to feel something new, perhaps uncomfortable, and leave you asking just a few questions, then by all means, pick it up.
B00351YEVC|4.0|This book is a definite read. A very easy read taking me only a few hours to complete. I personally felt that this book covers a very deep and touching story but is written in such a way that you do not feel drained after reading. The characters are perfect describing the contrasting comparison between the innocence and naivety of one on the right side of the fence and one who is aged before his years on the other side.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm not an exercise expert or anything like that, just a normal person who has struggled with weight and fitness my whole life. I have been doing Workout 1 for the last couple weeks (every other day), and I have to say that I saw results after one workout. The workout is hard and intense, but it brings results. I tried to move onto Workout 2, but it is considerably harder than Workout 1, and I will have to stick with 1 for a while. My entire body is changing already - my arms have shrunk and my tummy is starting to have a shape it never had before. I have actually gained weight, but the amount of fat on my body has dropped and my muscle has increased.<br /><br />I like Jillian's attitude - she emphasizes having to work for what you get, and that you can't just phone it in. It's the same message as the normal \\"you can do it!\\" of workout videos, but with more of a tough love approach, and that works for me. By the way, I've never even seen one episode of Biggest Loser, so I just came to this fresh.
B008BM9L72|3.0|I think that these books are a must read. However, I wouldn't rave about them. Its a simple story to read, quite predicable but sill enjoyable.
B004PVKFR8|4.0|Wanted the song \\"sail\\" after hearing it on a car commercial, happy with the rest of the songs on the album too!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I do not normally read a lot of science fiction.  The sample I downloaded led me into purchasing this different and quite riveting story.  You enter another world that has similarities to the present time.  It is a thrilling and quite fulfilling read.  I heartily recommend it to anyone and everyone.<br /><br />Avid rabid reader
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Hungry games is the ultimate reality show for the video game generation. Full immersion technology, or telepresence, was inevitable from the beginning of entertainment. The negative side is that it appeals to Roman gladiator blood sport mentality filtered through todays twisted standards: showing a female breast would have given this movie an R-rating but cutting one off would be rated PG-13. The movie industry needs to change our culture.
B008602KQI|5.0|I listened to this on audio. I loved it.<br />The audio made it so much more real.<br />I listened to the whole series this way.<br />The people seemed like they could just walk off the page.<br />It was easy to imagine the story content
030758836X|5.0|Love? Hate? Sometimes the two emotions intertwine as one.  From the opening chapter, this masterfully crafted story weaves you between the love/hate relationship of the tragic couple Nick and Amy.  When Amy, the perfect wife who inspired her parents' \\"Amazing Amy\\" stories, goes missing, her golden boy husband Nick is the prime suspect.  With every chapter, new nuggets of information emerge, building up to an incredulous ending that is oh-so-plausible in this tightly crafted story.<br /><br />Gone Girl plumbs the torture and mind-games of the worst relationships while luxuriating in the idyllic place where relationships are the core of our existence.  The stark difference between the two extremes finds a disturbing co-dependence with the story of Nick and Amy - your new favorite psychos that you despise but yet you can't seem to turn them away as you watch their dangerous game of wills unfold.<br /><br />Each and every detail in this story leads to a new revelation.  No words are wasted, and every word leads you to wanting more. A brilliant book by a talented writer!
B000FVE3AC|4.0|Luminosity is below average and a full charge last less than 36 hours.  If you don't plan on wearing this watch every day, invest in a winder.  I can only estimate the accuracy based on two days, but it was within a few seconds.  I'm a small guy, but after removing 5 links from the band, I find that I hardly even notice I am wearing it (I normally wear a $20 Casio with a velcro band for work)<br /><br />*UPDATE*<br /><br />Purchased a Seiko Black Monster and it feels so much smaller and more comfortable (still love them both) I have smaller wrists, so sleeping in this watch is NOT recommended.  However, accuracy is decent (+/- 2 min/mo) and the water resistance is as rated (I spent close to 12 hours in the pool over 4th of July with the watch submerged, no issues).  It is definitely an eye catcher, and I will keep this line in mind when I decide on my next watch.

B004EI3ON4|5.0|I really don't get tired of listening to a majority of the tracks on daft punk's amazing vision that is the tron legacy soundtrack. The album has a great energy to it that really holds your attention throughout. A must buy in my opinion.

B007RP4D5Y|5.0|I freely confess that I'm a Pat Metheny fanboy, and have been since I stopped dead in a record store back in 1979 that was playing \\"New Chautauqua.\\" I've bought everything he's recorded (well over a full drawer in my CD cabinet). That being said, I don't rate everything he releases as five stars. For example, I still haven't warmed up to \\"What's It All About\\" (liked \\"One Quiet Night\\" much more). But this album...this is five stars, and it is, IMHO, the best Metheny release in years, even better than \\"Day Trip\\" which I thought was very strong. I can put this on and listen to it over and over and not get bored. I especially love \\"Signals,\\" much more than anything on the \\"Orchestrion\\" album.<br /><br />While I enjoyed the sax work on \\"80/81,\\" I have to say I enjoy it here even more.<br /><br />And as always, Antonio Sanchez is a standout. A great, great drummer. He jumps out at me, like Roy Haynes jumped out on \\"Question and Answer\\" long, long ago.<br /><br />Sorry, I'm drooling. I'll stop now.
B003SPCYP8|5.0|This is the third copy I have bought of this movie.  I keep giving mine away to friends because I want to share it with others.  Touching story and very well acted.
B0087YYHZU|4.0|The quality of picture and the sound are terrific - my only disappointment was the 4:3 format - watch Blu-Ray movies on a plasma TV and prefer 16:9 format - if I had noticed this feature I would not have purchased the item.<br /><br />Still a fantastic movie.
B007KOYEOC|2.0|As with the previous 2 books, very repetitious dialog. However, the storyline was a little more interesting this time. Something I would imagine a fourteen year old girl would dream up.  In spite of this I read all three books (skipping through a lot of it) and quite enjoyed them.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Very honest read that connected to my womanly wild side. Recommend to all who have a yearning to adventure and change.
B0088X7YMS|3.0|I was hoping that CGA had made some gains since CGA movies first came out.  This movie has the same \\"not quite\\" lifelike characters with guns the size of tanks that never run out of bullets, voices from the Whorf School of Deep Talking, women that teenage boys dream about, and a kill everything in sight plot. Disappointing.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great for notes on demand.  This is a good idea to have a good os every other day. I am a danger to Paul?
B006XIR9KM|4.0|DoubleTake is a fun little game of concentration. I haven't quite figured out the scoring, but the app is fun enough that I don't care. The challenge, and what makes it fun, is that the tiles move around and the game is timed. I like the challenge of beating my previous score. There are several variants to the game so it doesn't get boring.<br /><br />I've never seen this app act up or crash.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I love the relaxed feeling and quiet background music. Simple yet a nice challenge at the end of the day.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|I would love to give this app a 5. There is only 1 type of dominoes game in this app, which, to me, is a drawback, but the Straight Up game is something of a challenge when you have only a few minutes to play. The game play is between you and the phone and the phone wins an awful lot. This isn't bad. It just means I suck at this kind of dominoes. :-)<br /><br />The reason I cannot give it a 5 is that every now and then the screen goes wacky and the dominoes lay on top of each other and you can't see what you're playing. Once in a blue moon it outright quits. I haven't figured out what makes it do either of these things so I could let the developer know.
B007KOYEOC|3.0|If you read the first one you want to read the second and the third one. They are written quite poorly but the story is quite entertaining. The sex scenes get really annoning and I started skipping them already in the second book.
B008M87GJK|5.0|I like this app as it is informative and I like the the fact  i can review the world news at a glance.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Amongst the best novels I've read all year. Let me rephrase that: Amongst the best novels I've read, ever.  This book was absolutely stellar.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the various games are fun and entertaining. I like that k don't need an Internet connection to play. that's nice.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Standard action story. Definitely enjoyable and easy to read. Obviously if you read the first two you willdefinitely wanna read this one as it ties up all loose ends and completes the triology.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|If you've ever dabbled in writing and tried to write a sex scene, you know how difficult this can be without sounding completely corny.  EL James not only writes beautifully, but manages to sensitively convey the confusing feelings felt by a young and inexperienced woman , who is perhaps in over her head.  Christian Grey is also portrayed realistically as a tortured adult who has received confusing messages as both a child and adult.  This is a great read, not just for the hot love story between Christian and Ana, but the complex psychological story going on behind the scenes.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Love the game - hate that they continually strive for in-game money pack purchases with real cash.<br /><br />I wish there was a way to drop quests when the only solution is to purchase item(s) with cash packs. I recently got a quest to DOWNLOAD another App ! in-game? no longer good enough to view a video of one - now they want us to download it too.<br /><br />An in-game sale item marked down from $99.00 (99 cash packs) to 38? really?<br />So spending 100.00 was thought to be too much - but we might consider buying something for about 40? Is that really the cash break-point?<br /><br />Enjoy the game - as fun as it is - just be sure not to allow the kids to hit purchase additional cash-packs or your wallet will be the one to disappear.

B000RJW1Y2|3.0|I got it about 3 months ago from Microcenter as a cheap wheel for NFS Shift. What I say it really helped to deal with the game. It works way better then any gamepad and games feels way more driving simulatorish.<br /><br />The build is poor. I got right gear shift swich broken in two weeks (the plastic did not last and broke in half). I fixed it with a small piece of copper wrapped around broken part. Then in a month right gear shift fell off another plastic piece broke apart, I screw it back with a wood screw and it works for now. Then in another month the same thing happened with the left gear shift, so my wheel looks like a Frankenstein now, but works.<br /><br />So if I was not up-to fixing this little thing I'd be throwing it away in two weeks after purchase, but now I have it for over 3 months.<br /><br />The wheel is small and pedals are small but you can get used to it after a while and if you want to, well if you don't feel miserable using driving wheel size of your hand.
B008602KQI|5.0|I was amazed at how true to the book it was and the acting, scenes, and everything was perfection.  I would highly recommend this movie.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was eager but ignorant of the steps to follow. The basic step-by-step guide and tips in this short book were gold to me. I fixed numerous format issues before the book hit the electronic shelf. All converted to HTML as directed.<br /><br />My cover was built, and rebuilt, and modified, per suggestions.<br /><br />I made sure to buld a Table of Contents according to guidance I found inside, then found copyedit needed a LOT of work. I rushed to publish, only to have errors galore discovered by friends. These were fixed quickly, then I wrote a better book description, and several editions later, which this little book told me how to submit, I had a much better product to sell.<br /><br />This free book was simple and terrific. I'm pleased with the results of my first self published book, and my second book will be better the first time out because of what I learned.

042524489X|5.0|This week, we'll be looking at Kiss of Snow, one of the most memorable, and most anticipated installment of Nalini Singh's Psy-Changeling series.<br /><br />The romantic pairing that this book features has been hinted at in several book throughout the series, and the story was highly anticipated by many fans. It was absolutely worth the wait! Hawke and Sienna's story is memorable, and worthy of the character's strong personalities.<br /><br />Hawke is the Alpha of Snowdancer, the most powerful changeling wolf pack in the United States. He became Alpha at a young age when a tragedy wiped out most of the elders in the pack. Sienna is a young Psy woman who, with her family, became an adopted member of Snowdancer in her youth. She holds the rank of novice soldier within the pack. Sienna's situation is unusual. The training she had in her intensely traumatic childhood, paired with constant struggles to manage her destructive Psy power, have strengthened and matured her at an accelerated rate. She often seems older than her true age, but in some things she is very much the inexperienced young girl. There seems to be a huge gap separating the characters, including differences in rank, age, background, and experience. Then there is an added complication: the girl Hawke knew would grow up to be his mate died in a childhood accident, so it is unlikely that Hawke and Sienna will ever formally mate, even if they manage to overcome all of those differences. When you add in the external conflicts that come from the further development of the over-arching series plotline, you are left with a rich, complex series of plots that all have to be fully developed and woven together cohesively-- I believe that the author managed it beautifully.<br />Throughout the series, Singh has done a remarkable job constructing a believable alternate culture, and the world building is some of the best I have ever seen. The alternate culture and world are constructed through seamless integration withthe story in each book, avoiding the bulky chunks of information dump that are so often seen in scifi-fantasy, and paranormal novels. Kiss of Snow continues in the tradition of its predecessors, further building and enriching the world through the natural progress of the story. The elaborate over-arching plot of the series progresses nicely in this installment, significant events taking place, and influencing the behavior of Sienna and Hawke.<br /><br />One of the memorable features of the Psy-Changeling series is a theme emphasizing the interconnectedness, and interdependence, of life; the three major races in the world (the Psy, the Changelings, and the Humans) are connected in a myriad of ways, even if they don't realize it, and the major conflicts usually arise from a failure to acknowledge this interconnectedness. In addition, the deliberateness of nature, and the importance of balance is another prevalent theme. Psy powers are the most obvious example of this. Powers that are seemingly completely benevolent contain a potential for darkness, and powers that appear to have no purpose other than absolute violence contain the potential for powerful good.<br /><br />Sienna's power is one of the most destructive. Up until the end of the story, there seems to be no way it can be controlled, or channeled into anything other than absolute destruction; however, when the true function of her power is revealed, the subtly placed hints throughout the story come together beautifully, a web of fine lace finally settling into a satisfying completeness.<br /><br />The main plot, Sienna and Hawke's love story, is complex. They are powerfully drawn to each other, but they must bridge internal obstacles of power, age, status, and emotional maturity, as well as several external issues: hostile political climate, uncertain future, time constraints due to preparation for war, etc. Also, both characters have deep-rooted fears and past trauma that has affected their development as individuals, and affects the development of their relationship. As the story progresses, the reader sees both characters slowly grow and mature to a place where a functional relationship is possible. In the end, both Hawke and Sienna learn how to forge an equal partnership, despite their differences. Overall, Kiss of Snow was powerful thematically, well-paced and exciting in the overarching series plotline, and emotionally engaging, finely nuanced, and well-structured in the main romantic plotline. The balance between the romantic plotline and the secondary plotline was spot on as well. The grad external conflict of the world was further developed- the events of this book formed a major climax in the series plotline--and a significant part of the story, without overwhelming the romantic plotline, which remained the main focus (exactly as it should in a paranormal romance).<br /><br />Kiss of Snow was another wonderful example of world building, multi-plot management, and character and relationship development from Nalini Singh.<br /><br />This review was written by me, and originally posted on [...]
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Book one is so repetitive and lacking in depth or interest that I can't believe there are 2 sequels to this drivel.

A truly concept album from start to finish and not to be missed even for a bathroom break. You will sing the songs, rock the melodies and dance the grooves. Believe me a near perfect album no throwaway. A varied album with folk, hard guitars riffs, prog, Celtic country, rock, funk,symphonic anything this album has it. Some songs give you joy some melancholic. I have 4 cd versions of this album and I keep them all, one at home, on my travel,in the car and in a vault and played each over a hundred times and I still discover new sounds. Do yourself a reward by owning this album. This belongs to the same pastoral rock era of JT with Songs from the Woods and Storm watch and all are highly recommended.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very enjoyable! Great story well told...the writing was excellent. Lots of twists and turns, but what about the ending?<br />I needed extra Zoloft for a few days....
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I've been a Stephen King fan since my first reading of \\"Carrie.\\"  He is much more than a \\"Horror Writer.\\"  I consider him a MASTER of characterization and his dialogue is flawless.  The reader cares about the people King writes about, and readily believes they would do and say the things he MAKES them do and say.  I DO like his \\"less horror-ible\\" tales best -- The Stand is an epic that bears close comparison with The Lord of The Rings trilogy (THINK about it), and he earned my whole-hearted respect when he turned out \\"Gerald's Game\\" -- a thriller-chiller without a monster in it (Okay, one -- but at the very end, and there was a good explanation) and Deolores Claiborne.  In both these novels, King got inside a woman's head and presented two stories of dilemma (one physical & one introspective) with an uncannily spot-one feminine point of view that in some passages actually made me cry.<br /><br />I was an adult woman when Kennedy was assassinated, and in the ensuing years have wondered what he might have accomplished and how he would have influenced our country's future if Lee Harvey Oswald had missed his first shot.  This book didn't answer that question -- but of course it couldn't -- because none of us have the faintest idea, and not even Stephen King would dare to speculate on a U.S. born of a two-term Kennedy presidency.  So THAT didn't disappoint me.<br /><br />I WAS disappointed, however (not in a devastating fashion that made me throw the book down in disgust, but disappointed none-the-less).  I was disappointed because I really didn't care about any of the characters -- I really didn't think the premise was  believable at any level -- and most of all, Stevie, you screwed up a fact or two along the way.  I even checked them out, just to make sure that my own ancient mind had it right.  Those little glitches interfered with my enjoyment of this book -- they made me say \\"I don't THINK so, Stephen,\\" and sent me to my Google machine.  And this was sad, because inall the years I've been reading Stephen King books I have NEVER questioned the veracity of the details.<br /><br />Alas, we are ALL aging -- even Stephen King.  And I STILL believe that he is without peer in today's writing community (he's the best of the 20th Century writers, in my book -- and I don't care if he did write mostly \\"horror\\" stories).  But this book didn't cut it for me (although I DID read it from cover-to-cover).<br /><br />I won't tell you the mistakes in the book (but I DID write Stephen a letter pointing them out) -- if you didn't grow up in the 50's & 60's you'll never spot them, and in spite of all that, this WAS still a good read.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|I don't know what all the fuss is about with fifty shades. I read it and thought \\"so what?\\". I have read better sex stories and better love stories. Its an old formula with some more vivid descriptions of sexual activity.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|This is a book that no unpublished-as-yet author can afford to miss. It give a clear and concise method of selling your book. It is a pleasure to read a book that is both easy to read and gives you the information you need to succeed. I have already begun implementing this program to sell my first book. Bravo Mr Locke. Thank you for sharing this information.
B005LLSNNE|5.0|I love this show!  Couldn't wait for Season 4 to come out on DVD, so I purchased it on Amazon streaming.  Watched the whole season in about three days.  Love it!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|Very interesting movie on hope and love for fishing and one another.  I enjoyed this movie and its message.  The Sheik, although a yong man, was full of wisdom and understanding of what can be and about people.
B002JUXNOY|4.0|Maybe the best exorcism movie ever. Well written and great acting. Based on the true story of Anneliese Michel. Jennifer Carpenter shines in this.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This book is ok lots of sex a bit to much of the repeated stuff, but overall a good read.....
B0088WFZQG|5.0|Amazing and courageous story of a group of Navy SEALS on a mission to rescue a CIA agent.  Very humbling to see the bravery and sacrifice these men and women go through for us and our country.  A must see!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the story and how it was developed by the author.  Had me at the end of my seat all three novels.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've loved Pinterest since I first laid eyes on it and this app is a great way to access Pinterest from a Fire.  I've had a minor glitches with the app but overall it has worked amazingly well.
0671646788|5.0|Excellent book with practical ideas for easy implementation.  Although this book was written in 1965, the principles are timeless. Creating a personal vision is important for everyone.  Dr Schwartz focuses on positive attitude, focus and the importance of being a friend first.  I recommend this book to anyone.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|The variety in the levels is good.  there are challenges and successes.  The music is calming.  Just over all a game worth playing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I am very gratfeful and happy. this game has been created with care and thoughtfulness. God bless America and free app of the day as well. ty.
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought the movie was very entertaining and believeable.  I saw the movie in the theatre and viewing it at home was just as exciting.  I really enjoyed all of the characters.  Thought the ending was strange, so was the one guy going to be locked in the room with only the poisonous berries to eat or just the president letting him know how unhappy he was with his decision to have two winners.  Maybe a Part 2?!!!  Very enjoyable.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|The book consists actually of two books of about the same size. The first one after a teaser from Abbottabad goes way back in time, even to the first author's childhood and presents somewhat interesting stuff not specific to the Obama raid.<br /><br />The second half, however, writes too little about some details of the raid. Since the facts have been generally known for some time, I hope I am not spoiling much by mentioning a few issues here.<br /><br />I may have to re-read part of the book again but it does not bother to explain why the first helicopter went down. Not by hostile fire, as far as I can tell. Are these infernal machines so unreliable? It is not a job of a SEAL like the author to understand the specifics but, after all, he could have lost his life right there, just like the poor guys ordered to rescue hostages years ago under Carter. The seasoned pilot made the right decisions at the critical moment and no one got hurt and a modified plan was immediately implemented.<br /><br />I hesitate to mention the 'controversy' of apparent killing Bin Laden at the moment when he was not an immediate threat to the Americans. To me this fact is of no significance at all but the New York Times immediately wrote about this 'legal' aspect of the raid. Does anyone believe that Ben Laden would have surrendered peacefully if politely asked to do so? Not this reader.<br /><br />It is clear from the context that the author(s) are not Obama admirers. Their comments, however, are quite fair and bit bitter - Obama seemed to promise them couple of beers in the White House and it never happened. They guys deserve the highest honors this country can award them but a superb intelligence by the CIA (for a change from the Tenet years) has been duly acknowledged by the author - perhaps by a composite person identified as a female CIA analyst.<br /><br />As for the 'secrets' revealed in the book, there may be something to it. Not any specific secrets but people who mean us harm cansave some time mimicking our commando operations going through parts of the book that show the 'spirit' and general approach to the tasks at hand when you run this kind of operation.<br /><br />To me, this is a price to be paid to keep us Americans up to date on the state of our most advanced military units of the 21st century. Not only we spend a lot of money on the military but the author makes it possible to relate to them as completely dedicated human beings with their flaws under a very good control. I found one issue bit disturbing: the heavy dependence on the sleeping pill Ambien mentioned many time in the book. It is probably essential for people on 'vampire' shifts (not only commandos) but this is, as far as I know, an addictive stuff.<br /><br />As an agnostic I appreciate the  virtual absence of any religious references in the book. Both ways: no American military chaplains sending the commando with his prayers and blessings, no redundant mentioning of the Islam fanaticism except for reporting the factual Allahu Akbar shouted by the insurgents in Iraq in the first (non-Osama) part of the book. That's how it should be and not only in the elite military units.<br /><br />On a more general level, our enemies should realize that we can afford a luxury like this very expensive (just the IR goggles cost about $65K a piece) raids only very rarely.<br /><br />More typical are the drone attacks and they simply cannot protect the families of the terrorists like the men of our commandos usually do.<br /><br />Collateral damage by the drones is completely unavoidable while, as the book reports, a major care was taken in this case not to protect the 'innocent' (the women and children are actually facilitators to their murderous husbands and fathers) but not necessarily armed and fighting directly at the moment. The author acknowledges, being a really experienced fighter, that suicidal women and perhaps even small children (everyone can wear an exploding garment) wereon their minds while they avoided to harm most of the them.<br /><br />It is certainly more efficient to send over a drone and be done with it.<br /><br />This is my longest review in these places but this has been, so far, the most important book I have ever bought for my Kindle.<br /><br />A few words on 9/8/12. Just out of curiosity I used Bing (they have nice opening pages) and looked for the reasons for the helo crash that almost killed the author.<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY NOTHING but idiotic speculations not worth even looking at. No wonder the author did not want to get into it. Ground effects, some wise guys are saying. Who knows? 'Owen' just limited his story to what he really knew and what his job was over there. No nonsense guy, perhaps a hero. And a pretty good ghost writer as well. I can just see these two guys with the SEAL describing the facts and the other guy recording his words or directly typing them on something - there are many choices available now for doing so.<br /><br />Both did a great job. The author promises do donate most of the proceeds to the families of his 'brothers' who did not make it. There can be hardly a more admirable goal.<br /><br />I actually changed my rating to all five stars.
B003VTZXD6|5.0|This is a great book for beginners. It has great examples and doesn't read like a textbook. I highly recommend it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another awesome Nicholas sparks book. Easy reading but you don't want to stop till the end  I do enjoyed it
B005JABSB6|4.0|Glasses work well with my sharp 70 inch 3d tv. How ever the lenses don't keep out much of the peripheral which can be a distraction. The lenses need to be bigger and they sit at a weird angle on the bridge of my nose. They hold a charge well. Pretty content with these but will be trying a pair of sony's next to see if I can get more comfort. I don't wear glasses so this might effect my judgement.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is the perfect Gamecube controller with a longer cord than the original Gamecube controller as well as great input fuctions on the controller to the screen commands. These contorllers came brand NEW in original box packaging. They are from Japan though they will work for American Gamecubes as well as Wii which is what I purchased it for. It may not match my Red Wii though the white is still a great color for this excellent controller. The only minor (very minor) problem I had with the controller was because of it being brand new it needed to be broken in as the directional stick didn't respond correctly at first though this problem vanished within 5 minutes of playing some Super Smash Bros. Brawl. I use to just use my old Nintendo Gamecube Wavebird as I love wireless controllers though when it comes to serious 1v1 Super Smash Bros. Brawl matches it has to be wired to make sure no wireless faults are to blame for a loss.<br /><br />A great controller and I recommend this to anyone that wants a great responsive wired controller for the Gamecube or the Wii. Will work for American systems.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I won't give anything away but I will tell you that every time you think you have this novel figured out, you don't.  The author has a very expressive writing style that is mature and intelligent.  The whole style of the book is so unique that it's quite refreshing.  For me, it was a little slow at first but about a third of the way into the book I couldn't put it down!
B004P1JDJO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book. It was refreshing to know that fundamental ideas backed by innovative research are making their way into mainstream business books.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I really liked this book. I thought it gave an accurate and honest account of the killing on UBL. I liked Chapters 11 on.....the first Chapters were more about his SEAL life and how he got to the point to be on the Green Team.  I really like how he talked about 'Jen' who was essential to locating UBL. Worth the read, Democrats might not like his jabs at Obama, but a great story. 4 stars.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was a little skeptical about reading an \\"erotic\\" romance novel, but it's soo much more than that.  Mrs. James knows how to draw you in and leave you wanting more.  Don't listen to all the negative hype about this book being all about sex or \\"mommy porn\\" as i've heard some people say.  They obviously haven't read it.  It's a true love story.  Can't wait to read more from E.L. James.
B006HUJRK6|3.0|This is a classic cooking reference co-written by probably the most famous American cook ever, Julia Child. While it contains a good amount of useful information, I find that the Kindle version of most cookbooks are lacking due to very few hyperlinks. Searching for a specific piece of information, e.g., the right temperature for potatoes, is an absolute bear.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I thought this was an awesome album.  I love this album like I love Grouplove's album.  I use it to work out.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I don't think I've ever been bored reading a Stephen King book.  He's written some of the most imaginative, edge of your seat books, and I think he's not lauded enough! Nothing compares to his style, his characters and yes, his bizarre, creative stories.  I didn't buy 11/22/63 when it first came out, I didn't want to rehash the President Kennedy theories.  But the book was on the bestsellers list and I love his work so I read the first few pages. Still I wasn't drawn in, but I know and I love his work, so I went back again and read an excerpt. I was hooked. A portal in a diner into a time in our history that was simple and good, but also hateful and mean. Mr. King didn't just write about Kennedy, he meticulously unfolded a world full of suspense and mystery. You HAD to find out what was going to happen next, you HAD to know the Jake/George's next steps, and you cared about every character he introduced!  Classic King!  Although I find his use of the N word unnecessary and his freedom with the word unsettling, there's no denying he is a master storyteller, there's no one who can match his incredible imagination.  Mr. King, as always, thank you for the ride!
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love that this game is a puzzle type game.  It is a game where you have to think a little about your moves, but that you can get help if you need it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is horrible, I cant even give it away because it is on my Kindle!! I cant even get into the book it does nothing for my interest what so ever! Unfortunately Im out 9.99 but at least it wasnt more.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is such a great app and works so well!!! It is easy to use and the ability to scroll through the pages is great!
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This book is amazing and I could not put it down. Scott taught me so much not only about running but in life. Definitely recommend this book!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My sons and I enjoyed this book so much. My 8th grader wrote about it for his summer reading book report and was so inspired he exceeded the page limit. A great book!
B008602KQI|5.0|The film adaptation of the Suzanne Collins novel is excellent. The film is visually striking, effectively scripted and well-acted. The DVD/Bluray package is well put together, and the additional materials are interesting and useful (especially as I am a film professor). I eagarly look forward to Catching Fire, and The Mockingjay.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Great fun puzzle game. Got it as free app of the day. It really makes me think and helps me waste time.
B006LSZECO|1.0|This story was all over the board. When I finished the book, the only question I had was \\"why did I waste my time?\\"
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I bought this CD for my husband for his Birthday.  He absolutely LOVES it.  He listens to it all the time in his \\"Man Cave\\" and anytime we go somewhere, he takes it with him to listen to it in the car.
B002R5QPRI|5.0|You must whatch this movie more than one time because you will find parts that you will love to see over and over again .
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A very touching story about two people who needed each other. Characters were described in an easy way for the reader to envision them.
B00005RYL9|5.0|Highlander is one of my favorite movies. I am a huge fan of the series. I am really pleased with my purchase and watch the movie when I can. I was a kid when this movie came out, but as soon as I saw it for the first time I was hooked and have been ever since.
B008Z9YGEE|4.0|Good movie, pretty long but if you have time its a good watch. The storyline may be confusing so pay close attention or you might be explaining to the person your with.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|If you like logic games that make you think and that don't have a time limit thenthis is for you.
B005XN31LY|5.0|This is an excellent series! My Wife and I love it so far!  We can not wait for the next season to start.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I LOVED this book!i'm excited to read the second and third books of the trilogy. this is a MUST read!!!! seriously! get it! NOW!!!!!
B005IT0V8O|4.0|This book should be a point of reference by all English teachers or professors. It offers basic rules for writing while being brief and to the point with examples.
B008602KQI|5.0|great movie<br />saw it at the movies and that is why i bought it and i love it and can't wait for the next one
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|This is an old story I read when I was young As most of us have. It is a great story to relive again So many years later. I recommend the adventure
B003MXAQJW|4.0|A fun and light hearted look at all the odd and wonderful differences that make up a loving family. Very sweet.
B002BIULQC|5.0|This is a wonderful movie it has a love story romance that Ronnie (Miley Cyrus)plays very well. I like this movie because you get to see what every top superstar must choice between since your only in the fame so long then you have to go back to your old life in no time.
B008FRFN7A|1.0|I want to use it to print photos from my phone but it will only print  a 4x6 photo on 8 1/2 x 11 paper. Does not choose 4x6 photo paper even when I choose it on the phone.
B004HW7JI8|5.0|The Pretty Little Liars series so far is an awesome tv show that i was hooked to from the very first episode i would recommend this to anyone that likes a little mystery/friendship drama.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is just another book about sex.  I did not see the reviews before I purchased it, but to me it's not worth the money.
B003XKNFVA|5.0|The story line was captivating and I was completely taken with the book.  I did find it somewhat difficult to read in some places as Ms Austin did not differentiate women or men with first names but addressed them as As Miss ? or Mr ?. It took some rereading to try to figure out who was actually speaking or being addressed, especially when there were several characters in that particular section.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is very helpful for a lot of things I love it its awesome it helps me a lot please make some more
B0027MJU00|5.0|Well, so far I have read Sharp Objects and now Dark Places.  I was obsessed with Sharp Objects...easily the best book I have read in a long, long time and for sure the best suspense book I have ever read.  I loved the twists and turns.  At first it was a bit hard for me to get into Dark Places...I think I could hardly accept that I was done with Sharp Objects and really didn't think anything else could live up to it.  BUT...She did it!  This is SO SO CLOSE to being as good as Sharp Objects...and in fact, the more I think about it I am having a hard time deciding which one is the superior book.  I really can't tell too much without giving away the story, but if you want an extremely well written book, thoroughly developed and interesting characters, and twists and turns galore just read ANY of Flynn's books.  I can't wait to start Gone Girl!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Finally a game that requires thought and not silly violence, cartoon characters, or wildly impossible dexterity.  Challenging and fun for anyone over 20. I'm 67.
034580404X|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, I believe I read all three books in 3 weeks. I found it was very tastefully written while still be maintaining its sensuality. You become very interested early on about the characters in the book. Enjoy!!!
B0055SWM08|5.0|after seeing many great reviews i knew i had to have and sure enough i love it. keep up the great work
B0016CS0IK|5.0|This is my first M83 album & fell in love with it after the first time I listed to the entire album.  I had heard the song titled Couleurs via online radio so I took a chance at the entire album & love it!  The song Couleurs is all instrumental, but the majority of the songs on this album have words & is somewhat dreamy; but overall, a very beautiful album that is one of my top favorite at the moment. Thank you M83!!
B00486070K|1.0|IMPOSIBLE TO BELIEVE THIS PRODUCT NOT WORK ON WINDOWS. There is no way to make it work on windows 7. If you need this to have a ethernet port in the two system this is not the solution.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|this has great challenges I love these type of puzzle games and I certainly love this one... I hope there is going to be a second version
B006OCM0G0|3.0|It's entertaining but it's way too time consuming, would be better if there was a way to \\"pause\\" the game because I'm sorry but no one has 24/7 to spend on a game.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved reading the books. I. Couldn't put them down. I was afraid the movie would be bad like Twilight...but it wasn't! I loved it. If I have it playing in my room, you better leave me alone : )
B00130UFY2|4.0|The Bourne Ultimatum is must watch movie for me. The movie is great and entertaining to watch. However it lacks something for me to give it five star.
B007ELN8Y8|5.0|Weary of over the top violence and nudity \\"The Artist\\", for me, was a pleasant surprise.  There is drama, romance and humor. It seamlessly depicts movies within the movie and utilizes clever Dutch tilt camera angles reminiscent of \\"The Third Man\\" and \\"Citizen Kane\\" that heighten the dramatic effect. There are few surprises in the story line: an aging movie star becomes a has been and his protege becomes the new star.  Then again there are stories that bear being repeated (\\"A Star is Born and \\"All About Eve\\" have similar throughlines.)  But the story is not the main attraction.  The story is more of an accompaniment to the art. The art is in the authentic scenery, costumes and brilliant acting.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  The trailers and commercials don't do justice to the craftmanship and attention to detail that made this movie a gem, so I suggest that if you, like me, thought it might not be your kind of movie, you should give it a try if for no other reason than the rare opportunity to see a \\"feel good\\" movie you can watch with your children without being embarrassed.
B0085776BG|5.0|Iove the movie I even took my 12 yr old granddaughter she liked it she likes history like her grandmother
B008MEM24S|5.0|This game is fun! My grandson is 7 and we play it together, I like that he is learning about states of matter and their properties in an intuitive way while having fun.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|As Julia Roberts said in the movie, Closer, \\"I thought it was... accurate.\\" as well as absolutely hilarious and invigorating.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I ordered the first book in a \\"sample\\" on my Kindle, because I'd seen it advertised a lot and wondered what it was about.  The sample sounded ok, so I ordered the first book.  I'm glad I did not order all three because when I read on into the book it became so weird and twisted that I didn't finish it.  Was a total waste of time and money. The information was given on-line that it was the author's first effort, but if all three were as twisted as the first part that I read, I think she needs to try another field.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the development of Grey's character and his willingness to change some of his preferences.<br />The introduction of characters that want to harm him adds intrigue.
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Lee Child again draws you into the world of character Jack Reacher. This book like most of the others in the series is a real page turner, keeping the reader's attention throughout.<br /><br />Top class
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Really, really enjoyed this book.  The characters are grounded, flawed, and compelling.  The plot has a few unusual twists and the descriptive style is perfect for describing the wonders and locals that the book is set within.  Loved that there isn't a stereotypical villainous antagonist.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Its a good book but sometimes it feels like a teenager wrote this because of ana's behaviour.  Overall its good, im only half way but i think i will be buying the pther 2 books. Everything comes in packs of 3 these days uh?
B008XG1X18|3.0|it often has issues causing you to &quot;force close&quot;. fix this glitch and it'll be close to perfect! would be nice if you could scroll add pins easier as well.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I love this app 90% of the time. It sometimes sods not like to load and will &quot;force close&quot;  other than that it's great!
B007T9FRFS|5.0|I'm never left dis pointed by Ms Reichs, in her latest work I was left constantly surprised and thrilled by the twists and turns. No matter how many novels she publishes they never feel stale. If your a fan press buy now, if you new to the Bones series what are you waiting for!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Pornography should be free. The love story in between the sex is startlingly poorly written too. Not to mention that I really came to hate Anastasia by the end of the book.
0763639184|5.0|I got this as a shower gift.  My now 5 month old has LOVED it since the first day I \\"read\\" it to her.  She was very little but I could tell she really loved the bright pictures.  We now read it at least once a day, more often on days we're home together. A great book for babies!
B00742GBDM|5.0|This is a great movie. I enjoy watching this movie because of the overall story and premise, but also because I am a Jane Austen fan!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Amazing thriller from cover to cover. The story is exciting and keeps you hooked from the start. By far this his best work which says a lot.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|My eyes were opened to the fact that there were so many disparaging comments. I'm 50 years old, after being married for 25 years, I'm now on my second marriage of 4 years. Okay I realize I didn't have a red room nor did either of my husband's were going through a sadistic relationship, but some if not most toys I've used. The brutality that Ana was put through was by her own accord difficult and humiliating at times but she always worked through it. I know you could have stopped reading at anytime. My feelings are that for the plot to work you had to bring in Christians and Anastasia's backgrounds. This is part of the true love story and learning to trust someone so that you can be loved unconditionally. I would read more from this author as long as she would have the self confidence to write again after such negativity has been written. But she would almost have to immerse herself into the dominant and sadistic world that we all know is out there.
B004D38HOG|5.0|What an amazing story, told by a person who seems genuinely warm and caring. Portia is such a strong person to tackle her demons the way she has. A true inspiration.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|I found this movie/documentary about 4 babies from 4 different corners of the world absolutely fascinating. No matter what race, country, culture, faith...bless the parents who bring children into this world to love.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I've never played Quell before and now I'm addicted!! Simple and easy to learn. The graphics look great on the kindle.
B003O86FMW|5.0|in 3 days flat I read all three books of the hunger games series. Catching fire, I have to say was the most action packed one, it made me sad at times, but I love the ending.
B000FC1D0O|3.0|For modern casual readers, some familiarity to the Writing of Marcus Aurelius is a mark of a well educated person. However,  a detailed acquaintance is unnecessary and a bit boring except for scholars.
0525953728|1.0|the publisher of this book won the race to get the first book out on Osama Bin Laden's death. the publisher will get the initial windfall but no more. It is a poorly written, superficial account of the action padded out with meaningless training and minor actions. On the plus side it only requires a reading age of 7!
078322740X|5.0|The movie was brand new, in perfect condition, great price. We had a wonderful night watching it, very funny. The service was good, received it quickly. I rate dealing with Amazon an excellent experience.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|I thought she did a great job of telling her story. It was so sad. Hard to believe she was there for so many years. Was nice to hear her story.
0345803485|2.0|This is definitely a porno book.  Way too explicit.  Not something you would want on the coffee table.  Will not read the following books in the trilogy
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|Nice for the whole family! Just enough fantasy, real life, tears, and laughter to make a great movie for young and old alike.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read. One of those books where you promise yourself you'll stop at the end of the chapter and then say, what the hell, just one more.
B003MC5N28|5.0|In Middle School this was one of the many books that was on the assigned reading list. It was even better the second time around.
B00846REIS|5.0|Excellent read. Author pulls you right into the action. The reader gets anxious, angry, sad ...all the emotions the character is feeling.  Can't wait until the second book comes out
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The Walking Dead series is exceptional.  Once you begin watching it you will be hooked.  The costume & zombie makeup effects are great, very realistic.<br /><br />For a cast not filled with prime stars it is a must watch series.  Story line holds your attention and then never lets you go.
0525953728|5.0|This was a very easy read.  Got it in the mail last night, started on it in bed, finished it this morning.  Maybe 4 - 5 hours.  What I wasn't expecting was very little politics in it.  After all of the talk, I was expecting this to be smeared with thousands of words of anti-Obama slogans.<br /><br />Instead, what you get is a 10 year walk through the life of a Navy SEAL turned DEVGRU Operator.  Yes, he distinguishes them differently in the book, and by the end you get a much better feel for that hierarchy.  It begins with some talk of his early life in Alaska and how the harsh realities of being a modern day pioneer helped prepare him for his days as a future war fighter.<br /><br />Most of the 300 or so pages are dedicated to his life training for DEVGRU and the missions after qualifying for that team.  He takes you through several (of the dozen or so) deployments in and out of Afghanistan and Iraq, setting up the culture of DEVGRU.  In that time, the reader is introduced to the many mistakes and serendipitous events that shaped DEVGRU and the author's tactics during the War on Terror.<br /><br />The human side is not at all what one would expect.  No Easy Day goes out of its way to paint the Operators, as they are called, as normal working class husbands, albeit absentee husbands.<br /><br />The final 20% of the book is dedicated to the Osama bin Laden raid preparation, execution, and aftermath.  If you were looking to get only that in exquisite detail, you will be disappointed.  The details are there more so than they have been in the media, but you never are given access to anything that should remain \\"Top Secret\\".  The fact that this book has received so much attention lately for that purpose is surprising to me, as everything in No Easy Day can be found by piecing together other sources.  They just happen to be consolidated and actually verified by an eye witness in No Easy Day.<br /><br />If you were hoping for an indictment of Obama, you will not find it inthis book.  Yes, there are a few lines that mention President Obama and some of it is positive while some of it is negative.  However, most of the political elements are aimed at the process of decision making in Washington (not so much the decision makers), the leaks that came after the raid (the author never directs blame at any one person for this), and most importantly the fact that all politicians take more credit than they deserve for military operations gone well.<br /><br />The most enjoyable part of No Easy Day for me was learning more about the people behind-the-scenes.  There were a multitude of intelligence analysts, CIA personnel, pilots, DEVGRU command and trainers, and even the interpreter that made Operation Neptune Spear not only a smashing success, but also one without any casualties on the American side.  These men and women are finally given the credit they deserve by one of the men who actually fired the rounds in Abbottobad.
B008602KQI|5.0|I love love love this movie! It is a Masterpiece. Amazon made it easy to pre-order and even though I didn't get the physical copy on the release date, they gave me access to stream the movie online when it came out. Wonderful!
B004GBFF5Y|5.0|Loved this movie, presented real life issues that are not discussed in every day life. Finally a movie that doesn't paint mental illness in a negative mannor, we are all suffering just in different ways, I think this movie really showed that. As well as funny.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love this series! I seriously can not stop reading, I have to know what happens. There are so many major developments to the story line in the third book. If you love this series, this book will floor you!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author.  His characters have the flaws of human nature. You can relate to the decisions that face the character and think about how you would respond.  Mr. Sparks never lets you know the conclusion until the end.  You can't predict.  I love the suspence.
B00735HGQ6|5.0|I can't recommend this book highly enough.  Extremely well written, poignant, a beautiful gem of a novel.  The story often comes to mind throughout any given day and it will be one I keep on my Kindle for a very long time.  I have told as many people as I can about this book,  Normally I wouldn't be this effusive, but this book touched me deeply, as a woman, a mother and a lover of good literature.  Adore your style, Rachel Joyce.
B000FCKPHG|3.0|The book gets into the concept of fixed level of intelligence versus potential to learn if you put your mind to it.  I didn't see it as that mindblowing - but author apparently does. It's ok if you are in need of the motivation (or have a new boss who thinks its a brand new concept and wants everyone to bask in its enlightenment... Definitely a niche publication.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I want to like this book. I really, really do. It just doesn't seem worth the cost though.<br /><br />The one shining light though, is that the book sets up its sequel amazingly. All the loose ends from the others are brought back to the forefront and set up for the next book.
B008JH5FZ6|5.0|Campy, cheesy, predictable, action packed, and funny as heck!  Wife and I sasw this in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on Blu-Ray.
B00508W37K|5.0|Absolutely great movie for young boys.  My greatgrandsons love it.  I keep it at my house so they always have something they want to watch when they come over.  I think they know the script by heart.<br /><br />I purchased this movie from Amazon.  Great company; they have everything!!!
B008VBYN80|2.0|Perhaps I'm getting old because I just don't understand the popularity of \\"free\\" games these days. I put \\"free\\" in quotes because we all know that they aren't really \\"free\\". It seems that a lot of game publishers are jumping onto the bandwagon of creating business models similar to \\"Zynga's\\". Gameloft seems to be following suit. All of these kinds of games share the same model and \\"Kindgoms and Lords\\" is no different. I think the best way I can describe \\"Kingdoms and Lords\\" is \\"Farmville\\" meets \\"Age of Empires\\".  In a nutshell, you play the game for a little bit and there is a certain amount of \\"energy\\" with which you can perform tasks. If you run out of energy you have to wait a few minutes (there is a timer). If you want more energy now you can, of course, purchase it with your credit card.  For completing tasks you are given gold coins but are given a sample of \\"diamonds\\" which, of course, can be used to purchase \\"high end\\" items. No big surprise, they give you just enough diamonds to be a few short so why not pull out the credit card and purchase some more. Again, this type of game seems to be extremely popular, but they're just not for me. It's gotten to the point where \\"free\\" games are just not appealing to me anymore. Nowadays, I simply go to the \\"paid games\\" list when I come onto Amazon. I would prefer to pay for a game and never see an advertisement or be asked for money in-game.<br /><br />I am a programmer, I understand the resources and the time that goes into creating games like this and the need for developers and publishers to put food on the table. In fact, I kind of like the \\"Lite/Paid\\" versions of apps which gives the user the choice of experience they would like. Honestly, I would probably have paid $6.99 for \\"Kingdoms and Lords\\" had there been no \\"Zynga-like\\" business model involved. The only reason this game didn't get one star is that it is really, potentially, a good game. I just don't like being asked for money while I play.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was the third book in the series and It was very hard to put down. I read it in two days, it kept me wanting more. It was very rewarding to see how this character developed into a family man, good husband, good father. I was tearful at times and very sad when I came to the end of the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have never read a series that I could not put down. Excellent books. I will most likely reread them.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|i was so happy to find this as the FAOTD! it's a great game. but i'm running out of levels way too fast so i really hope it's as re-playable as they say. i also hope that it will stop asking me to review it, now that i have. but yay quell! awesome awesome awesome.
B005RUUUAI|4.0|This show is more than your average zombie shoot'em up.  It focuses on the characters and their struggle to survive in a post apocalyptic world.  However, if you really are not into zombies then this show will not be for you as it does have a lot of gory zombie killing in it.  Overall, I think that this is a good show and lots of fun for the whole family(as long as you don't have young children or don't mind that they have nightmares).
B007BVOF8E|4.0|Really enjoyed this update to one of my favorite John LeCarre books. Actors were great - Gary Oldman is always good.
B007IO1X5C|5.0|This book is a terrific combination of interesting examples and then arguments for and against the limits of our consumer, money oriented society.<br /><br />It puts into words what many of us think or feel but cannot articulate.  It is helpful to academics and to the general reader as the style is accessible but also informative.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to every member of society.  It will make you think and perhaps reflect on the values that have crept up on you - rather than the ones that you really want to hold.<br /><br />Michael Sandel is brilliant.
B0016CVN02|5.0|Not much that needs said... this is some of the best Rolling Stones from 1964 through 1971.  All ORIGINAL hit recordings for a reasonable price.  If you remember these songs, you already want them.  If you don't remember these songs, get 'em, you'll be glad you did.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has everything you could need in a Bible app. airs great and I love it. I use it every day.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Enlightening and fascinating. Living through Truman (too young to notice), Eisenhower, Kennedy, Ford, Reagan, Carter, Bush, Clinton, Bush and Obama I find myself amazed at what I never knew. Those were the times...for better or worse, the jury is still out.
B0031RSA24|5.0|The God Delusion is one very long but brilliant argument as to why there can be no such thing as God. It says everything that I have ever wanted to say to people when they ask me why I am an atheist. Now when they ask, I simply tell them to read this book and they will know why. Reading Dawkins's arguments and rebuttals of arguments posited by religious organisations and people, it is even more difficult to understand how anyone can believe in God. I was a very strong atheist before reading this book but always tried to be tolerant and understanding of others and their religious beliefs. This book has opened my eyes to the serious consequences of (some) religious beliefs, both at an individual level and on a more global scale. To begin with, I was a little horrified at some of the harsh, critical language used by Dawkins but soon came to realise that he is absolutely right. If you are already an atheist, you will love this book. If you are unsure about the existence of God, please read this book and at least gain a good understanding of the atheist viewpoint so you can make what will hopefully be a sensible decision. Overall, a well-written, well-argued book that will have atheists saying \\"Yes! That's right!\\" and believers in God shaking their heads in disgust (and defiantly ignoring all the unarguable facts against the existence of God).
0545265355|5.0|This is a really solid box set; the books are sturdy and easy to handle.  I'm sure you already know they come with nice dust covers and everything.  There's just something pleasant about holding a book in your hand versus a Kindle (not that Kindle doesn't have its merits!).  This same exact set was ~$45 at Costco when I called a few weeks ago (mid-August 2012) to check, so I'd highly recommend Amazon if you're looking to purchase this.<br /><br />My only complaint is that when you remove Mockingjay and try to put it back in there's a back corner of the box that holds all three books that seems to prevent it from going in unless you remove Hunger Games or Catching Fire, put in Mockingjay, then put Hunger Games/Catching Fire back.  I received this box set as a gift and purchased it for a gift for someone else and both sets had the same issue, so I assume it's just something inherent to the design of the box itself (or maybe I'm just lucky).  Overall, a really solid deal and I'd highly recommend it!
B004V9MU86|5.0|A truly amazing book. I couldn't recommend it highly enough. This book will have you laughing one minute and crying the next. It's a beautifully written story of a young German girl at the beginning of World War II whose mother gives her up to foster parents. We read of the many trials and tribulations she endures and through her story, we see the incredible power of human emotions, compassion, altruism, and love in its many forms. The portrayal of the residents of a German town during the second world war shows us that German people were no different to others around the world and that although there were many who supported Hitler and his appalling reign, there were others who risked their lives to help Jewish people. The story is told from an unusual first person which, although I am not a believer in such things, I found very refreshing and it added to the underlying message of the story. The structure of the book is also unusual but again refreshing. The vocabulary used in the book makes it very easy to read but it is still powerfully emotive. The writing style makes this book suitable for readers from early teens upwards and the story is suitable for anyone. Just one word of warning - keep the tissues handy for the end of the book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A must read series! I could not put the books down! Easy reading! Loved every second! I would recommend these series!
B004LE7PCM|5.0|What can one say about Sir Arthur Conan Doyle that hasn't been said before? This complete collection is amazing and is worth at least 100 times the price paid. What is so amazing is that every story (and there is a lot of stories) is different to any other one. Unlike so many modern detective stories, whether in books or on film, it is not easy to work out 'whodunnit' or what is going to happen next. The writing style is easy to read, despite being dated, and the stories are (almost) believable and very entertaining. Not usually a fan of short stories, I nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed this collection. The only negative about this collection is Conan Doyle's \\"Tales of Terror and Mystery\\" which just suggest to me that he should have stuck to writing detective stories. Don't let that put you off though, this is excellent value for money and will provide you with days, weeks, or even months of great entertainment.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Read the entire series! Could not put the books down! Can't wait for the author to write another book! Would recommend to every gal that loves a love story!
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Something different without a predictable plot, ends with a realistic outcome--not some Hollywood version of life.  And who doesn't appreciate the classic \\"Under Pressure\\" by Queen
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the series! I would highly recommend these series! Read and enjoy! I could not put the books down! This series are for any gals that enjoy a great love story!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Love the app. It has helped me through many a boring situations. Minus one star because sometimes it just shuts down. A second click on it and it works fine though. but I can see how some might be irritated by that.
B001NTHCXK|5.0|I had this on CD. I killed the CD. Lived in Kenya when I was a kid, and this movie takes me back there (so does the soundtrack).
B00846REIS|5.0|This book was the kind of book you cannot put down.  I was immediately wrapped up in the story and I would suggest it to anyone who likes this genre.
B008XG1X18|5.0|it's alot of fun seeing what others like. And you could become friends with them. You can get new ideas for recipes and crafts.
B006LSZECO|3.0|WoW this book kept me reading.<br />I loved Nick as a character.<br />I will write that I was unhappy with the anti climactic ending of the bOOk. It could have been so much more InterestIng.
B001M4YZ90|4.0|An audacious, in-your-face movie. It is defintely not for everyone's taste, but this should definitely please those who enjoyed Guy Ritchie's earlier Snatch and Lock, Stock, And Two Smoking Barrels. There are a number of seemingly unrelated plots, but they do finally come together. There is surprisingly little on-screen violence (the effective editng makes it seem like there is much more than we actually see). The accents may take a bit of getting used to, but Ritchie's dialogue has a wonderful feel, both humorous and menacing, for London's gangster underworld. The standout in the cast is Tom Wilkinson, who is superb, although that seem like a redundant statement - has Tom Wilkinson ever given anything less than a superb performance?
B008JGSM6G|4.0|my 4 year old can do the easy ones. and I like the hard ones. so good for the whole fam.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|After having read Black Swan by Nassim Taleb and also Blink by Malcolm Gladwell, this book goes into the really reasons of why Narrative Fallacy works and why Thin Slicing is core to our decision making process.
B008QMMEOE|4.0|This is a great ap to help toddlers learn puzzles! My 3 year old loves it. However, now that he can do the puzzles it is getting too easy for him. That is a good thing though because he didn't know how to do them before!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|very much like &quot;poke. fish &quot; except it is horizontal instead of vertical. played and played again. don't want to. quit. I am not too good at getting coins but am real good at crashing.
B008VBYN80|5.0|The app is free,  entertaining &amp; well detailed.  The players enjoy building a kingdom, interesting training of troops and excellent battle play.  just watch your wallet,  the in game purchases are high
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read all 3 books in 6 days, I loved them. Yes the writing could have been better but the story made up forIt in my opinion.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Using the CPU for my primary workstation with ASUS MAXIMUS V GENE motherboard.<br /><br />Works very stable, handles 16 GB RAM quite easily and overclocks very well.
B008602KQI|5.0|I haven't read the books - but the movie itself was good.  Good character development (of the main characters), interesting social class portrayal, bit of explosions and excitement.
0525953728|4.0|So I finished 'No Easy Day' (about the raid that killed bin Laden).<br /><br />I am a former Special Forces Officer, author and radio talk show host.<br /><br />I read the book with a critical eye. I REALLY was looking for any and all OPSEC problems and honestly could not find ANY (maybe the reference to a lead lined briefing room?). The author was OPSEC sensitive and careful. The author used aliases for operators, never gave specific training locations (no 8-digit grid coordinates), and compromised NOTHING that would appear in a 5 paragraph order.<br /><br />I have read dozens of SEAL books and interviewed the authors (and other SpecOps variations). This book is solid and less offensive to the community than comments made from the Executive Branch that outed the specific team.<br /><br />The alleged DOD efforts to 'prosecute' smell way political and total B.S.....
B008CP92ZO|5.0|We loved this movie, not for kids a lot of nudity n bad words or jest urges, but so funny, we loved it and would reccogmend for lite hearted humor, we don't regret renting it was well worth it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The book was exciting, sexy and very intimate.  The suspense kept me from putting the book down.  I loved the ending.  Why can't we all have a Mr. Grey?
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is probably the best game I have ever played because of its highly action packed graphics you will never get tired of this game!!!!!!!!
B0094K1QR8|5.0|will touch your heart and keep you laughing. great to watch especially with your \\"friend zone\\" guy/girl. will set a stage to bring up the \\"how come we never got together\\" topic. I've seen this movie at least three times.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|loved this app until I started getting an error message and noone seems to be able to fix it?  I see on web forums that I am not alone...what gives?!
B006ATJXQW|5.0|Amazing, suspenseful, an not the stupid follow-up I thought it would be! It's the 2nd best prequel I've ever read (which is saying a lot because I'm always reading.) Very well thought though and written.
B003B02O0A|5.0|Wonderfully written book about the deep south. A true page turner, it's an unbiased and historically accurate view of law and order compounded with racial contention.
B0046A9MRW|3.0|Enjoyed this book.  Agatha is a whizz at creating mysterious characters and making a vital clue just slip into the background, making it inconsequential to the reader.  Everyone has to read at least one Agatha Christie book in their lifetime - and this one might as well be it.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|I'm 45, and I've been listening to prog for almost 40 years.  I've been happily following the progress of Big Big Train for a while, and I'm firmly convinced that those who love the genre will look back 20 years from now and see English Electric as THE album of our time.  It will be what Close to the Edge or Selling England by the Pound were for the 1970s, what Spirit of Eden and Skylarking were for the 1980s, and what Brave and Ok Computer were for the 1990s.  And, this is high praise, as there are so many good prog bands making music today: Gazpacho, the Fierce and the Dead, Arjen Lucassen, Tin Spirits, Neal Morse, The Reasoning, and others.  I couldn't give this a higher rating or I would.  Long live the Train!
B0086DB566|1.0|This movie was supposed to be good. I mean it has Julia Roberts in it, right? How bad could it possibly be? Shes a mega-star and stars like that wouldnt lower themselves to this cheese. RIGHT?!?! It was the worse movie she ever made. What was she thinking? I mean really what? I really really really wanted to like it. I'm a huge Julia Roberts fan, but this movie may have changed my mind about her. Atleast until she does another good movie.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A fabulous plot with a heart-stopping resolution!  Others of the same genre that I read this summer paled in comparison.
B008602KQI|5.0|I read the novels before I watched the movie. Really was a great story and well made movie. Stayed very well along the lines of the novel.
B001AUEMFS|5.0|Love ALL coldplay music, so it would have to be REALLY bad for me to give them a crappy review!!
B007BZM30M|5.0|I LOVE MUSIC, ALL KINDS, AND THIS CD IS REALLY CUTE AND CATCHIE. I'D LIKE TO BUY HER NEW CD AS WELL.
B008602KQI|5.0|Love this movie! I can't wait for the next movies to follow! As close to the book, without all the extra detail, as possible!
B008EQIEWS|2.0|The special effects were great - too bad about the story.  As it stands, this movie is all glitz and no real substance.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|Apart from correcting the official version of events that ended OBL, it provides a great insight into the world of Special OPs. A very understated book that does not need to provide gung ho embellishment, the real events provide that. Good luck to the author, will be intersting to see if he does anything else.
B0088TG252|3.0|Great movie fast paced and great twists and turns the kind of movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat although it was a little predictable at times it's still a great movie.
0345803485|1.0|I was going to write out a long review, but then realized the fans of this series sum it up better than I ever could.  Almost all of them start off like this:<br /><br />\\"I don't normally read books but...\\"
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Fun to play, easy to pass the time. Would recommend this app for the kindle. No problems with it so far.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|If you liked tokein then hold on to your bootstraps because we have found a rival!! Twisting,turning and a cativating page tuner,no joke. I cannot wait to start the next in the series!!! Well done!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the story, is different and fresh and erotic tone is not as vulgar but is an elegant and inviting.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Out of the three in the series, I liked this one the most. I'll be sad when the series is over!
B008602KQI|5.0|This is by far one of the years best movies. It is surprising it even got made because it deals with children, even the very young. I recommend it for everyone since with todays economy it is possible this could be in all of ours future.
B003Y2BMVC|5.0|I really like this movie. Captain silver was the kind of character you find yourself really liking even though he's supposed to be the villain.
B000FVQLQQ|5.0|It is a wonderful movie that I purchased to help students understand the mind of a schizophrenic.  I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn't seen it.
B007SGM084|2.0|I can't get through the second book it's so boring. It's like it was written by a high school kid. It's very \\"vanilla\\" haha. Just not at all intriguing because the story line never builds.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|THIS GAME IS A GOOD GAME AND HAVE NOT HAD IT CRASH ON ME YET. I USE IT WITH MY KINDLE FIRE AND MY DAUGHTER AN I HAVE A BLAST WITH IT. GREAT TIME KILLER.
1883398088|5.0|This is a great book about H.R. Giger's concept and design of the most grotesque science fiction creature ever created. The only thing more horrific than the ALIEN is the asking price of Amazon sellers. This book was selling in new condition for about $18.00 plus shipping a week or so ago. Now every seller on Amazon in their greedy thirst has increased their prices to ridiculous expectations.
B003KGBIRK|5.0|This film is an amazing weirdlook at how television can change your mind. Im not a Cronenburg Fan but what he portrays is a techno mind twister that will keep you at your wits end. Although people say its weird and disgusting, the whole idea and story is pretty incredible! I was a little shaky if this would be good or not. It's awesome! The transfer was brilliant. The image is crisp, clean, and debri free! Sound is crystal clear, and takes you into the strange world of Videodrome! This purchase was worth it. Great extras as well. James Woods is an extrodianary actor and fits the film well. Highly Reccomended thriller!!
B008JB9NOG|5.0|Great album still, I had bought this album when it first came out and lost it, It's still pretty dame good as far as rock music goes these days.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book is everything the first two books were and MORE! I found myself so engrossed in this book it was painful to put it down! The way this man tells a story has so much finite detail its artistic and gives my mind a beautiful world to run away to! Love this series!
B008JAG2AA|4.0|It was great to see the cast back again for a reunion.  A very funny movie for those who enjoy American Pie.
0123694965|5.0|This is a great book for getting different perspectives on your game/product. Though its mainly about game design, it is just as full of insights for your product design if you think of your players as your users/consumers. Almost every lenses will remind you to think about a part of your game/product that you didn't think much about or may have overlooked. At the very least, it's a great book for covering all your bases and finding your weak points to improve on them.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Hated the book. Deleted it. Three story was good until it got too explicit.  it should have a warning label.  I would not have made the purchase if I had known how explicit it would get.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my daughter after a conversation about my sister's son, who, as a child, was diagnosed with a mild form of autism.<br />The book described my nephew's young childhood in a very disturbing way!<br />Like my sister, Kevin's mother was aware of the child's abnormal affect, and, like her husband, the father's defense - \\"He's just a little boy!\\" was chilling indeed.<br />When they had their second child, a daughter. . . . .  oh, oh, oh!<br />No, my nephew never did hurt my niece, but she grew up afraid he would. Just as Eva - Kevin's mother - was ever watchful in case Kevin harmed his sister.<br />\\"Kevin\\" was a very powerful and, for me, a very emotionally evocative book.<br />I couldn't get into another book for some time after reading and living it!
B00846REIS|5.0|I read some of the reviews saying this book was similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. A racy novel is a racy novel. They can all have similarities. I read the preview before buying Bared to You. I also pre ordered the second one to automatically go to my Kindle when it comes out. I'm glad I did because I like the first one and can't wait for the second one.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Really enjoyed this book.  Fifty Shades trilogy got me reading again having not read a novel for years.  Bared to You was equally as good as Fifty Shades.  Highly rrecommend it if you enjoyed Fifty.
B008602KQI|5.0|There are some obvious deviations from the book, but it still stays true to the story written by Suzanne Collins.  Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson do very well in portraying Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark.  If you loved the book, then it is worth it to purchase the movie as well (and then wait semi-patiently for Catching Fire, due out next year).<br /><br />I paid less here on Amazon then I would have had I bought the movie at Walmart, and the shipping was fast, so I received the movie in no time at all - very glad I purchased from Amazon.
B002U5HKZ6|4.0|This book opens a fascinating door into life in India, most specifically Mumbai (Bombay).  The imagery and language are just beautiful in all the descriptions of the vast city, and the whole vast subcontinent.  The Indian characters are all worth getting to know.  The foreign characters, not so much. This is a tale of people I wouldn't normally want to read about - criminals, drug addicts, shady tourist types, and so forth; and it gets much more violent as it goes along.<br />I could have done without all the violence, but the images of India have lingered on.  All in all it was worth the read, for that.  An inexpensive way to take an insider's tour of a very exotic place.
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|I really enjoyed the book.  It was a quick read and interesting, with much more background on the founding of the Mafia and how it came to be than the movie provided.  I was able to better understand the turn that Michael Corleone's life took and why he embraced the Family.  The characters were fleshed out and you wanted to understand why, the women especially, went along with the Family's rules of conduct and accepted their roles.  In short, I thought it was fascinating.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great plot. Fast read. A definite page turner. Interesting how none of the characters are especially likable. That's why this book will make a very interesting movie...
B007SGM084|5.0|I started reading the book on a Sunday morning and couldn't put it down. I purchased the e-books for 2 & 3 downloading them Sunday night and completed the trilogy Monday!  Did I note \\"I couldn't put it down?\\"  Like many, I was a bit unsure initially - the love scenes and/or plain old sex was a bit much but I learned quickly this was setting the stage for the other two books. While the sex very explicit - I must admit, I found it both yummy and educational!<br /><br />Putting aside the the steamy sex scenes, I enjoyed the essence of the storyline - it was a love story.  A very complicated love story but a love story never the less. The character development was brilliant.  Ana was much tougher than I originally thought - and maybe a bit over the top in her courage - but she was delightful.  Christian proved to be so much more than a hunk and I for one, appreciated his vulnerability and willingness to change in the name of love.  I'll be first in line to see the move and/or to purchase book 4.<br /><br />That being said, if it's over with this trilogy - I'm pleased I persevered and was able to get past the steamy sex to the essence of the love story.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I apsolutly love this game. It is a great way to pass time. I heard about this game on my friends ipod and couldn't wait for it to come out on the kindle fire. The graficts are excellent. My only concern is the missions in the game. I beat all but two in five days. Please Halfbrick, put more missions in the upgrade. Overall, THIS GAME IS AWESOME!!!!!!
B004HV54TU|2.0|The good news is that for as long this mouse actually functions correctly, it does help with tendinitis. In the few months I've had it, the pain in my mouse arm has decreased significantly.<br /><br />The bad news is that after owning and using this mouse for only a few months, it has stopped working normally. It turns itself off (or becomes undetectible by the PC) periodically every few minutes -- or even several times per minute.  When I have my speakers on I can hear the hardware remove/insert sound playing over and over and over as the mouse turns itself off (or becomes undetectable) and then turns itself back on (or is redetected by the system).  When it turns itself off or stops being detected, the mouse pointer stops responding to my movements or clicks, and I have to wait for it to \\"wake up\\" again.  Often it does this right when I am in the middle of a drag-and-drop operation, and when the mouse starts responding again I'll discover that I somehow selected the wrong thing and/or dragged something into a totally different location than I actually wanted to.<br /><br />I tried plugging the mouse into a different USB port and I tried checking for driver updates.  Neither one helped.  I also searched the Evoluent site for troubleshooting info, but did not find anything resembling this problem.<br /><br />Considering how expensive this mouse was, it's very disappointing that it didn't even last 6 months.
B007SGM084|2.0|The books were redundant, finished them because I bought them wish I could get my money back.  Very boring storyline I wish I had listened to friends reviews
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Jared Diamond is a masterful author. His book, Guns, Germs and Steel, is an awesome discussion and exploration of the rise of human technology, political organizations, writing, and languages in the different continents and areas of the world. Diamond's command of the issues and supporting facts and numerous insightful examples is stunning and presented in very understandable ways.<br /><br />The only criticism I have has to do with the Kindle version of the book. The figures that are referred to in the text are missing in this version. Maybe Kindle can't handle these figures. This is too bad because the figures sounded very interesting. Also, the formats of the tables in the book are hard to read on the Kindle.
B007TMON8M|5.0|super idea and super game. it was similar game abour bridges - i liked that game too<br />this game for men with brains
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|The dog from Up<br />Shakespeare<br />George Lucas (effects,creatures,vehicles, soundtrack, even the speeder chase scene)<br />Braveheart<br />Wild Wild West<br />Oh hell, I'm too tired from watching this thing to list it all<br /><br />Boring, formulaic and dumb. Too long. Unlikeable characters.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Terrific jigsaw puzzle application. Lots of free pictures to choose from. Great that you can control the degree of difficulty by just increasing the number of puzzle pieces.
B00845PV16|4.0|I liked the 1st Cage GR film and he seemed more engaged. This film he just seemed less engaged or connected to the character. I liked the story it was a fun movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was entertaining and hard to put down.  My biggest complaints were the vulgarity of the characters and the ending.  I disliked both Nick and Amy, so it was hard to root for either one.
B002OSXDAU|4.0|If your looking for a read that is more complicated than your normal mystery fiction novel, then this might be the answer. I really don't totally agree with the premise of this book as well as her book \\"Atlas Shrugged\\" which I read earlier in the year. In this time of election promises than never get resolved, this book may give you more to look for in your elected officials. I am not a higher eductated literary expert but I do apprecitate what I consider to be well written thoughts. Food for Thought<br />PS; The Kindle edition is much easier to carry around than the full hard cover edition.
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This was a great movie touching, enthralling, very good CGI (only the Tharks seemed generated at times). It is amazing to think this was written in 1912.<br />Our 5 yo girl through our 12 yo boy really enjoyed and asked if we could buy it after renting it (still wish Amazon had a discount purchase if you buy during the rental).<br />The story is deep, the science (why John is so powerful) is impressive for something 100 years old.<br />There is a \\"dog-like\\" creature in the movie that stole everyone's attention.<br />DO NOT THINK \\"biggest flop\\" of the year.<br />Think worst advertised and watch it for yourself.<br />If you enjoy Sci-fi, especially Sci-Fi with a bit of a love story, you most likely will like this movie.
B008602KQI|5.0|This story was translated well from the book by the same name!  The characters are well-cast and convincing, making for an excellent potential ending of victims-turned-heroes at the hands of the twisted totalitarian state or an equally plausible (and understandable) end resolution of surrendering to the overwhelming nature of the games without any personal guilt!  Without spoiling the plot, the two face the challenge posed by the Nazi-like state of being reduced to mere complicit drones, forced to play an immoral game of kill or be killed or to somehow seek an alternate route to preserve their humanity.  It does not disappoint and cries out for a continued peek into their ongoing destinies!  Highly recommended!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Puzzles are nicley laid out with enough instructions to make the game easily playable.<br />Would recommended this for anyone wanting a good puzzle game.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Read all night and used a lot of kleenex.  Highly recommended.  Loved this book and will read again.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This third book in a series continues with great characters and story line.  I'm sorry there won't be more books by this author.
B008JF8O9M|1.0|I was not able to use this app for my Epson NX Stylus 230 printer.  I even sent an e-mail letting them know that needed to update the app for this model but got no help.  I finally downloaded another app that does work.
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I had heard alot about the movie and of course the items for sale in stores. It was a dark story line, and weak in the end. Maybe its aimed at a younger crowd. Still, it was ok.
B008K8U13K|5.0|I saw a review that labeled this game as a 1 star based solely off of the OTHER one star reviews... Fail... I saw ANOTHER one that said that they used to like Sonic, but hated it when he &quot;started going through obstacle courses and stuff&quot;... give me a break. That's what Sonic's original gameplay was! Idiot.<br /><br />Anyways, the gameplay is great, the controls are fine and it is NOT TOO HARD! It's called skill! Runs smoothly on my Kindle Fire.
B007SSEU9O|4.0|We enjoyed this movie, it was both informative and very interesting. Meryl Streep is an amazing actress.  This movie streamed to our new tv  perfectly.  Thank you!
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Yes, I know it is an erotic fantasy, however the main female character had the emotional maturity of a 14 year old.  Basically fun to read but a lot of eye rolling.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was my first purchase with my Kindle app for my iPad.  This might be the best book I have ever read.  The five part Wool stories were  outstanding.  In fact it was so good my next purchase from Kindle was part 6 \\"First Shift\\".
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Very creative. I liked the character development, back and forth between past and present .  An interesting mix of sweetness and disturbing elements.  Plus, I learned a lot about flowers!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Simply brilliant! I am addicted to this game. I keep replaying levels to use less moves. Keep more levels coming.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|thought the book not only told us the story of SEAL life and combat missions but also delved into the emotional toll put on Chris Kyle and his family.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|A dictionary is an interesting, meaningful and educative book it reveals words and meaning you can use everyday it is a wonder.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|i like this app. it is easy to read and very precise. tells different things and estimates time for each. NIIIICCCCEEEE!!!!!! AAAPPPPPPP!!!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|A really Good movie.  Saw it in the theater and when I needed something extra for my $25 free shipping it was a great choice.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have to admit, I didn't expect to like this. But in order to see what all the fuss was about I downloaded the Kindle sample. And, well, it didn't really hook me.<br /><br />Then all of a sudden the Hunger Games seemed to be swallowing most of the known universe so I decided to give it another look. I'm glad I did, because once I got a few pages past where the sample ended, I was immediately and completely swept up by the story. Yes, it's a brutal story but everybody already knows that. There is also an undercurrent of humanity that balances the violence and puts everything into context. Reading this, you'll feel unsettled, angry, horrified, and relieved.<br /><br />it's a great read.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|the starting puzzles are a little easy but it gets a lot harder pretty fast. All in all not a bad game.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|It keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting ,as usual, is superb. Everyone in the cast puts their heart and soul into each and every story. I look forward to watching each and every week and watching the CD's often.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I read the first book of the Hunger Games trilogy, I thought where could this go? Wow! From the first page to the very last page, this book was very spellbinding! I was at the edge of my seat needing more. I purchased the books, and then downloaded the digital copy to my Kindle so I never had to put it down. It is amazing the talent that some authors possess. I can't wait to read more books by this author. I even convinced my father-n-law to read the books. He spent our entire trip at the lake reading them! It is very rare that a book get better with each installment, but the Hunger Games just builds and builds!! Do not pass up the opportunity to read these books! Enjoy!!
030758836X|2.0|Was really enjoying the fun, if insane, ride, but at the end, this book just abruptly ended.  So horrible that the author couldn't be bothered to finish what she started.<br /><br />Enjoy the first 3/4 of the book, then just stop reading - isn't worth your time.
B000FBJF7I|5.0|i have enjoyed every book written by this author especially ladies detective series he tells a story that most can relate to daily living regardless of their geografic locaation change the background and names and the basic message remains people are bad, good or a little of both but the choice is your own
B008742O32|5.0|Awesome App!  Allows me to send and receive text messages, transfer pictures and videos from/to the PC and manage most of the other phone functionality.  Indispensable while I'm in the office since I don't need to constantly keep looking at the phone.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|Steve Jobs! His reality distortion field pushed him to discover what all other people wouldn't ever seen. His wondrous ability to focus allowed him to make devices simpler by filtering out the unnecessary, likewise he sometimes adopted that approach with people, but in this case what is not essential for you may be life for others.<br /><br />According to his will, this book doesn't seem like an in-house book, you discover what you expected but also what you don't expect. Just for this, it is dutiful to underline the undisputed worth of the author.<br /><br />Accuracy of the photos and all the rest complete a very beatiful picture of this book!
B0037471TE|5.0|I bought this book because I enjoyed the movie but found the pace too fast.  The book fills in the gaps, and sets the scene for all subsequent titles in the series.  A classic and to be recommended.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great. Easy. Practical. I needed this for a nursing class and it was a great tool. I had no problem with this app on my kindle fire.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is disgusting and too sexually oriented for my taste. I am disappointed that Ana is so mesmerized by Mr. Grey but so in awe of him that she allows him to be a controlling sexual freak over her. Very sad for her, she is so naive.
B002VPE1XY|5.0|I keep my camera in my purse so it was necessary to have a case to protect it.  It is very nice quality so it will hold up well.
B0013DC9XE|5.0|Very Nice collection. Complete. My 7 yo son loves it. Has it on his mp3. John Williams is a masterful composer!
B000V6ACJ2|1.0|Didn't realize it was the edited version of the album. Would not have bought it if I knew. Oh well.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|this game I have been waiting and waiting and finally they made it but it always freezes on my kindle and I have to pause and restart the game&hellip;and the first thing it did to me the first couple times it said force close. so it is a very slow app!
B002MQYOFW|2.0|This book is poorly written and targeted to pre teen audiences.  It's a wonder that it has gained any popularity among adult readers.  The theme is disturbing and poorly crafted.  Also predictable.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I was appalled and i love horror stories.  soooooooooo creepy.  I had trouble reading this book as some of the childishness and control issues suffered by both main chaeacters made me sad and sickened.  I could not see past these issues to the romance author was trying to portray.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|not harry potter, but a great book, soft cover too - buy the entire set, its worth reading more than once.  a lot better than the movie...of course
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, but I do have a couple critiques that made some parts of reading this book slightly less enjoyable.  The author uses the same descriptions over and over again to describe amazon emotions.  The lip biting gets obnoxious and by the end of this book I wanted to smack Ana's subconcience.  This book series also is too closely based on twilight (with a raunchy twist) for me to not to expect Jacob to come ambling through Seattle.  Overall this is a good romance read but not a five star worthy book.
B002Q1YDLI|3.0|I was so excited to select another book from Emily Giffin after I finished Something Borrowed. Unfortunately, I'm a bit disappointed with Something Blue. It takes 6-8  chapters of recapping Something Borrowed before the story begins. I grew somewhat tired of lead character. Hopefully the next Giffin book I select will be better.
B008EQIEWS|4.0|We enjoyed the movie. Was pretty good entertainment. We love Greek and Roman mythology. Decent special effects and acting. Good action scenes too. Really liked the Cronus creature.
B0083B3KOQ|4.0|Windows Media will not play on Kindle, therefore; this App does an excellent job of converting and does it fairly quickly.
B0086700CM|5.0|So much fun! You can play for hours and not get bored! My cousin has it on her Kindle Fire as well and she loves it too!
B0000028M7|4.0|Pros: Musical, Driving, Variety, Mood setting.<br /><br />Cons: A little slow at times, a bit more mainstream<br /><br />Alice in Chains, along with Soundgarden, helped bring \\"Alternative Music\\" the metal fans. In my eyes, they are one of the greatest bands, not just in metal, but in all of music. Their sound was, and still is original, and a great sound. 1992's \\"Dirt\\" was their follow up to their Debut \\"Facelift\\". The release did show a slightly slower side of Alice In Chains, a trend that would continue. Even with the mainstream \\"Would\\" (which is a great song) and \\"Rooster\\", Dirt has plenty of hard hitting ammo with \\"Them Bones\\", \\"Dam that river\\" and my favorite track \\"Sickman\\".<br /><br />This is not an album for people who want to hear about the good things in life. It's written mostly about Layne's Heroin addiction and therefore is slow, dark, and self-depricating throughout most of the songs. The melodies, as well, tend to be darker, lower, and a little more hard hitting. Alice In Chains would prove to be master mood setters, and this album is a prime example.<br /><br />The lyrics are hard hitting and relevant, the music is slow, melodic and driving, and the album just has great flow to it. If you have not heard of these guys, or only know them by their popular songs, do yourself a favor and pick them up. \\"Dirt\\" is a great musical experience, and all in all, probably their most solid effort.<br /><br />(NOTE - The review was originally written 3/4/00)
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I knew he was musical...but this is even more then I was expecting.  And I was expecting alot!  I hope that you enjoy is as much as I do.  :)
B00000272N|4.0|Pros: New, exciting, Raw<br /><br />Cons: A little too raw, lyrics needed some work<br /><br />I still remember when I first saw \\"Man in the box\\" on MTV, and I remember rushing out and buying the tape as soon as I could. It's hard to believe it was so long ago, but I still love slapping the cassette in my car stereo and bangin' along to great tracks like \\"Man in the box\\" and \\"Sea of Sorrow\\". This album really helped defined not only metal, but grunge as well. As much of a crossover as their could be at the young age of grunge and the changing face of metal, Alice in Chains was a pioneer on both fronts, and rarely gets the credit they deserve. Not as refined as later releases, \\"Facelift\\" packs in power, emotion, and sometimes slightly more trite lyrics, but the end result is still great. Should be considered a classic and a must have for all music fans.<br /><br />(NOTE: This review was originally written Oct '99)
B007IXWL2C|4.0|[[ASIN:1612130607 Fifty Shades Freed]]Although it has a lot of repetition in her books. I still loved the whole series. It is nice to take a break from life and dive into some good books and the fifty series is just that I would recommend these to anyone (anyone of age that is).
B000002H33|5.0|Pros: Musically fantastic, lyrically powerful. Best of Metallica, best of Metal?<br /><br />Cons: Nothing.<br /><br />Master of Puppets stands today as what I, and many others, feel to be the crown jewel in the Metallica catalog. Sure it's tough to really decide between the first four albums, but I feel this was the perfect mesh of their thrash metal tinged with the \\"true\\" musical elements that had become the bands' hallmark.<br /><br />It was released in 1986 - As Metallica's third album - and would sadly be the last with bassist Cliff Burton - who would be killed in a tragic tour bus accident. And while Burton was not the primary song writer, and Jason Newsted has filled in admirably, it was clear the Metallica would never be the same with Burton.<br /><br />This release is from a less radio friendly era (Before Metal got much radio/MTV airplay). There are only 8 songs, but none of them clock in at less than 5 minutes. The songs are powerful - they run the gambit of emotions, the musical variety is astounding. These are not merely songs - but compositions - as if done by a classical master. This, may not only be Metallica's best release - But could be called one of the best metal releases of all time.<br /><br />Here's the track breakdown: 8 songs.<br /><br />1. Battery 2. Master of Puppets 3. The Thing That Should Not Be 4. Welcome Home (Sanitarium) 5. Disposable Heroes 6. Leper Messiah 7. Orion (Inst.) 8. Damage Inc.<br /><br />The album starts of fast and furious - \\"Battery\\" may be one of the groups best speed metal tunes - And followed the tradition of a Metallica album starting off extremely aggressive. The epic title track follows with it's power-hungry chorus still echoing through hundreds of teenage metalheads minds.<br /><br />Then Metallica switches up - Slows things down. Delves into the darkness with \\"The Thing that Should Not Be\\" - Which is really a song that I didn't care for much at first, but the lyrical mastery and the subtlety of the song have slowly grown on me over the years, and truly is an amazing song.<br /><br />Of course, the favorite of the repressed - \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\" - Is viewed by many as the best song of its kind - mixing the best of metal and rock ballad as well - as well as pertinent, serious subject matter - Into a masterpiece of a tune.<br /><br />\\"Disposable Heroes\\" - The anti-military song follows, and is fast and hard , and angry, much like \\"Battery\\". \\"Leper Messiah\\" - A slow rock tune that was probably the basis for their later song \\"Sad but True\\", musically anyway. In the great trend of instrumentals from the band comes - \\"Orion\\" - Which, while I don't feel is quite as good as \\"Call of Cthulu\\" off of Ride the Lightning, is still an amazing song - and really showcases the bands musical talent.<br /><br />And to wrap things up \\"Damage Inc.\\" - which really brings together all the elements of the album. Musically, lyrically, and thematicly (The album in general is about people in power) into one cataclysmic finale. No, it's not the best song on the disc - But probably is a great mish-mash of everything else you'll find on it - and still a great song.<br /><br />So try to put aside your current feelings about Metallica and whatever controversy they may be involved in. When you're talking about Master of Puppets - You could be talking about the best metal release of all time. And an entire generation of metal heads have to give it some credit for their influence.<br /><br />(NOTE: This review was originally written 12/8/00)
B004KA9VGA|5.0|So cleverly written, I just loved this book, a real fantasy, drama, action packed romance that had me gagging for the next book!
B000002H6C|4.0|Pros:Wonderful Musicianship, a few Metallica classics.<br /><br />Cons:Flat production, some overdrawn songs.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: The last of the Great Metallica albums, all metal fans should own it.<br /><br />Quick Facts:<br />Metallica - And Justice For All. Released 1988, Heavy Metal genre. Contains \\"hit\\" song - One. 9 total songs, 65 minutes total album time.<br /><br />Full Review:<br /><br />1988 was in many ways, the end of the 80's Heavy Metal sound, but it was a great fanfare. Danzig released his first solo album, Iron Maiden's Seventh Son was released - Anthrax put out State of Euphoria. In late 87, Guns and Roses released the classic Appetite. 1988 was really right before the explosion of industrial metal and alternative rock that was to follow. It was an end of an era for Metallica as well, in several ways. Metallica distinctly changed their sound after the release of And Justice, finding many of the songs simply to complicated to perform live. The formula that they had used for three straight albums (Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Justice) had worn a bit thin, and the band would go in a new direction with the \\"Black Album\\".<br /><br />What Justice became then, was really a swan song of sorts, not just for Metallica's \\"old\\" sound, but for it would be a gravestone for almost an entire sound of music. Metallica's most complex and ambitious album, And Justice For All is both loved and hated by many Metallica fans. Some find it to be too much, others view it as a great album with a few quirks.<br /><br />Something immidiately noticible is the production values. The snare drum pops out as a tad to sharp, the bass is quiet. The focus here is clearly on the guitars, which while very good, unfortunately takes some flavor out of the overall sound - which some have described as flat. Whether it was done to further the theme of the album (The ever decaying society), is uknown - but you can't help but hear it in the album.<br /><br />This albumwill also be known for the song that put Metallica toward the mainstream, with \\"One\\" - which became a classic heavy metal hit, and got tons of radio and MTV airplay, and really introduced the band to many people who didn't catch Headbanger's Ball. While One is viewed as one of Metallica's best songs by many, this album contains a few of the bands finest works. Unfortunately, a few of the songs end up a tad bland and overdrawn - No song on the album is shorter than 5:12, and 7 of them are longer than 6 minutes. While it makes the good songs enjoyable to listen to, it makes the poorer ones tend to drag on.<br /><br />Here's the track listing (Favorite cuts are *'d)<br /><br />1.* Blackened<br />2. And Justice For All<br />3.* Eye Of The Beholder<br />4.* One<br />5. Shortest Straw, The<br />6. Harvester Of Sorrow<br />7.* Frayed Ends Of Sanity, The<br />8. To Live Is To Die<br />9. Dyers Eve<br /><br />Blackened starts off the album, and is not only my favorite song on the album, but one of my favorite Metallica songs of all time. It starts of slow, then kicks in with a Battery-like power. Great vocals, great lyrics - and just a total power song. One of Metallica's finest.<br /><br />And Justice for All is a decent tune, though at 9:44, is a bit too long and gets a bit repetitive. It has a bit of everything Metallica has to offer, but it doesn't excel at any of them.<br /><br />Eye of the Beholder doesn't get a lot of kudos from most Met fans, but it really stands as my 2nd favorite tune on the release. The intro alone gets you rocking out, and then the song just continues with incredible guitar licks and a sweet chorus. I like the lyrics a lot too.<br /><br />One - Most people are familiar with this one, there's not a ton I am going to say about it. I like the song, but I don't love it.<br /><br />The Shortest Straw and Harvester of Sorrow both sound very similar to me - both are fair, and the flat production really shows on both of them. They feel like \\"going through the motions\\" songs, a tad to repeitious with nothing extraordinary to offer.<br /><br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity stands out because of the interesting tempo the song uses, as well as the chanting introduction. Maybe it is that intro that gets you singing along, but this song really gets me into it - Some great early guitar work - and a solid song all the way through.<br /><br />To Live is to Die is the instrumental offering on this album, co-written by Bassist Cluff Burton who had died on tour for the Master of Puppets album. It's actually quite musical, and very long - 9:48. But it doesn't stand out as being better than Call of Cthulu off of Ride the Lightning or Orion of of Master of Puppets, so you'll never say - \\"Man I gotta hear To live is to die!\\"<br /><br />Dyers Eve finishes off the album, and is the most thrash inspired track on the album. The best part of the song is the lyrics, but the music - while fast and furious, doesn't have enough direction or good riffs to keep one interested.<br /><br />Do you need what I need? Boundries overthrown, Look inside, to each his own!\\" (Eye of the Beholder)<br /><br />What I liked:<br /><br />Ambitious, musical album.<br /><br />Some of the best songs written by the band.<br /><br />Blackened kicks you in the teeth.<br /><br />What I didn't like:<br /><br />Production makes album a tad flat.<br /><br />Some of the songs are too long.<br /><br />A few of the songs are very bland.<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />This is the last of the great Metallica albums, and the end of an era. There are several great songs that make this a \\"must have\\" album, but it's not non-stop greatness the way Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets were before it. It belongs in any Metal fans collection.<br /><br />(NOTE: This review was written 4/3/04)
B005FWO3QK|4.0|Good sound and picture quality. Enjoyed the production, but it has a modern twist I wasn't expecting. If you want a more traditional rendition keep looking.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book, however be forwarned there is lots of sex and if you don't like that, don't get it.  If it doesn't bother you, you won't be able to put it down.  Where's book #4?  I want more!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|After reading all 3 \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" I didn't find \\"Baring For You\\" as well written as the Fifty Shades of Grey.  \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" left you wanting more even after the third book.  \\"Baring For You\\" left you ready for the end.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I haven't got very far but I like it a lot. good graphics and can barely put it down since I started playing it. would definetly recommend to anyone.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|I really liked this book.  I got introduced to Brandon Sanderson through his writing in the Wheel of Time.  He is building the story and developing the characters in a way that makes you want to read just a little bit more to see what is going to happen next.  When you check the time again, a hour or two has passed by.  The only gripe I have about this book is I have to wait until next year for the next installment.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton created a well written page turner. Loved the way it was written through the eyes of four generations of women.
0525953728|1.0|It took me less than an hour to read this book.  So, you can see that it is a light read.  There is nothing in the book but the author's self-interest.  And I'm also glad there were no secrets revealed.  It's a book about camp talk.  Guys chattering to pass the time with the expectation that their idle talk was in confidence.<br /><br />The book is not worth it.  Even though no deep military tactical secrets were revealed, the work of these men is best kept in the dark.  After reading the book, I thought, what was the point of sharing it.  There is no upside.  And this includes the ranking officers who are approving the Hollywood movies being made about the SEALs.
B0042QNP2S|5.0|I rate toys on how much children play with them.  My grandson selected this truck as a gift for himself when he was 3.  He loves it so much that he sleeps with it as well as the Bruder fire truck.  He loves great big toy trucks.  This truck is  true to scale and true to life with doors and compartments that open and close.  I don't understand why it costs as much as it does except that it is made in Germany where labor is expensive.  It is a big plastic truck, but it is more durable than other plastic trucks.  It is a heavy weight  plastic and not the least bit flimsy.  All the doors etc work.  Even tho it was suggested for children over 3 or 4, our grandson was 3 and he didn't break it.  After months of play  he still loves it and considers it his favorite toy.  Other than teaching a child how a garbage truck works, I don't see any educational value in this item.  However, my prime purpose for purchasing a toy is for fun.  If it happens to be educational then that is fine too.  We have since purchased a fire truck and he recieved a small tractor.  He loves them all.  We will be buying the crane for his birthday and the cement truck for his holiday gift.  His older brother took to the WOW trucks instead.  I'd buy this again and recommend it for any boy who loves trucks and contruction vehicles.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|The Heavy are an amazing group out of the UK.  They are the freshest and heaviest I've heard in years.  I find myself spinning their albums on repeat because it's so diverse and so unbelievably good.  Do yourself a favor and check these guys out - and if you're lucky enough to catch a live show, do it!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Was very excited to see the movie, as I read the book and loved it. Film did not disappoint!!! Stayed very true to the book, and the acting is amazing! Overall, great movie....can't wait for the second!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Long sought until I found it in Amazon. Does very well wha it is supposed to do and keeps you alert of the weather conditions in your area and abroad. Was included in a Samsung Galaxy Tablet and did not know it was also in Amazon and the Market. Fierce well deserved stars.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Way too much detail. I really didn't need to read a list of every food item of every meal. Found myself skimming through long sections to find the lost plot. And the focus on secondary and tertiary characters was a drag. I wanted the story to stay with the main characters - that's why I read the book - to find out what happened to them. At least 40% of the book could have been cut without anyone noticing.<br /><br />On the up side, I do like the world, the overall story, and the characters. Since I read the first 4 in the series, I am now hooked on reading them all. There's a plot in the book somewhere, if you don't mind digging for it. 8->
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a very well designed game with nice graphics. Smooth play makes this a relaxing app to play. Not too hard so far.
B008QDCZJ2|4.0|This album will be polarizing for Pet Shop Boys fans and non-fan musical acquaintances.  It is not the bombastic 21st century dance party that was the previous CD \\"Yes.\\"...This album is a lot more \\"Introspective\\" - and it's too bad that the boys already have a CD with that name, because it is perfect for this one.  Musically, this is more low key and lyrically it is more reflective.  From the beauty in the first few seconds of the opening track \\"Leaving\\", to the understated optimism of first single \\"Winner\\" - a really wonderful anthem that would have made a great official 2012 Olympics song, to the satirical comment on today's chart topping artists, \\"Ego Music\\", and the oddly captivating \\"Hold On' (based on Handel's Birthday Ode to Queen Anne \\"Eternal source of light divine...\\") and the lovely \\"Breathing Space\\", there is a variety not always seen on a PSB album.<br /><br />This deluxe edition has a bonus disc with instrumental versions of these songs which allows one an additional perspective to really appreciate the PSB's creative process.  Granted, it is not the kind of CD you play at a New Year's Eve blast, but there is beauty to spare when you take it with you and listen in the privacy of your personal music player. It is unfortunate that some PSB and casual dance music fans will feel let down, but that is due to their own expectations that this should be a non-stop 128bpm dance fest.  There is plenty to love about this album, if you actually take time to listen to it - and thank goodness the Boys didn't descend to tiresome trendiness by doing dubstep.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|An easy reading, light look at how we so easily forget to look at what's around us. Despite its \\"lightness\\", the eye opening reminder of what is (was) important in life leads to thought provoking retrospective.
B008602KQI|5.0|I never tire of watching this movie. Acting is really good, story is rich and interesting, I actually like this movie more than the book which is a rarity. Well worth the watch, can't wait for the next one to come out.
B0086700CM|5.0|Sooooo fascinating game. Can not stop playing with it. That's amazing, I spent 6 hours on bus with it. Hope you enjoy it.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|I kept thinking this book would get better.  Not the case.  Read 50 pages and couldn't continue.  It is not worth the time it takes to send this book to your kindle.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is amazing! It's fun and challenging, but never tedious.  I cannot recommend it enough! Wonderful, soothing music, too! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was so much better than the movie. Which is usually so but it goes above and beyond. I couldn't put it down!!! It explains detail better than the movie. The characters are so easy to relate to too!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great books...hope she writes more! Couldn't stop reading...read them all on just over a week even working 2 full time jobs!!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|Very well pleased with the Sherlock Holmes movies. Looking forward to the next and hoping they do not stop at a mete three. Very well done by all involved!
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Lots of levels, pieces, and formats. The game is easy to use and has brought me back to play time and time again.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this movie! Very much like the way the Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson characters are potrayed! Hope they keep them coming!
B008602KQI|3.0|I love this movie. I love this book. I love that Amazon gave me the digital copy free with my order(only reason that it is a 3 and not a 2)...but there are no deleted scenes, I'm sorry but that's a real deal breaker. This DVD should be a 2, it's a 3 for Amazon, but it's really a 2. It needs something extra, something that makes it worthwhile. 2 minutes of extra footage would have made this a 5...I only bought it because I'm addicted to the series.
039472903X|5.0|Of course, many parts of this book are dated because of the sea changes in the advertising industry. But, the advice and insights in this book remain the foundation by which all advertising evolves. It is a must read for anybody who has a career in advertising or marketing.<br /><br />A CMO who has not read \\"On Advertising\\" because they feel like it is an ancient text is like a Priest who has not read the Bible.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|it's a super fun game that you have to create monsters and train then to fight supeer evil play it
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Best books iv ever read. Wish it would keep going. Does this man really exist? ;-) when you put the books down you miss him. They all were my favorite. I will read again. This is a must read for adult women and men.
0345529057|5.0|Amazing series. I watched the first episode and decided to hold out until I read the books. Great decision. I'm halfway through the second book now and I love it thus far.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book out of the three was awesome. Page turner for sure. Its hard to pick a favorite. Thanks for a great read.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love this app! It makes Pinterest a hundred times better! It's easy to repin and like posts! I just love it
B0066W1AZK|5.0|perfect challenging game i love it sometimes i get bored and go &quot;oh i have chess&quot; and start playing and own
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. Does what it says. I had no problems with and have used it a lot. Easy to use.
B008M34CSI|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It contained action and adventure.  It was also futuristic, and yet, had a sense of realism to it.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Enjoyed the plot and was a quick read. I believe the last book was the better written one. I also liked the fact that she spent less time on the intense sex scenes because after reading two books of nothing but sex I was starting to skim over them.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book is an amazing creation brought out by some very peculiar pictures. It takes you on a thrill ride between reality, fantasy, the past and the present in a loop of action and drama with just a dash of spice.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the best book that I read in a long time.. must read.. make you read faster and each one anxiously..
B000NDMRCS|5.0|Excellent movie with a fantastic plot and out of this world special effects.  The cast was just right for this movie they all shined together.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|After reading all three books I was really looking forward to the movie. Saw it first in the theater and the blu ray couldn't have come out fast enough. Great movie. Enjoyable for young and old.
B0012PDVQ2|2.0|With all the hype this movie is supposed to be like the best movie ever. It's just okay but with such high expectations I'm not impressed.<br /><br />It gets an extra star because it has a very beautiful woman and a good soundtrack.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|If you do not know what good literature is, then you will like this book. All that happens is they have intercourse, talk about Christian's commitment issues and kinky sex, then have sex again. I just ruined the entire book for you. Absolutely nothing happens. There is no plot, no theme, and I can't count the number of times the author uses the word murmer. This book was so redundant I began to skip their sex scenes because they were all the same. This book does nothing more but emulate the trash on TV. How did this book even get published?
B008RKPC9E|5.0|I love this show and it is great to be able to get the next day on my kindle fire through amazon prime membership!
1400082773|5.0|This is one of the most thoughtful and moving books I've ever read. President Obama tells his own story with such sensitivity and heart that it brought tears to my eyes. The book is not political. It's autobiographical. It tells his story of being raised by a single mother and coming to terms with his estranged father. It also addresses the challenges of a mixed race child in a white society. So beautifully written, I personally think it should be required reading in our schools.
0525952616|2.0|I went into this book with high hopes but these were soon dashed. This book seems thrown together with pasted on characters that you never become attached to or even interested in. I really liked Daemon and was looking for a similar experience but it was not to happen. Rarely do I stop reading a book but I only managed to get 2/3 through before I just stopped caring what happened and put it aside.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Do you need one more cable? I had a cable similar to this one for my previous kindle and loved that it was not as big for traveling. I also have a car charger that uses USB connections so this Is great for road trips. I loved it so much I got one for my husband's kindle fire also!!
B0086DBE62|5.0|Story line was good. Very nice twist from the original story. The approach to changing of the original story line was very good and very well done. I enjoyed this movie alone and would like to share it with my grand kids soon. Thank you for asking for this review. I really recommend this movie to anyone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Catching Fire was amazing just as Hunger Games is. Initially, I  had put off reading the series because I didn't want to feed into the hype. It was sitting on my Kindle looking back at me but I never attempted to read it until I made a goal to do so. I'm glad I did!! Catching Fire, along with the other books in the Hunger Games series, is a book that sucks you in. You get attached to the main characters i.e. Peeta, Gale, Katniss, Haymitch, President Snow etc. It saddens me that the characters are subject to living in such a world. It really makes you think along the lines of \\"What would I do if I were in his/her position?\\" I would go on and on about the book but I don't think I would be able to do that without spoiling a good read for everyone. Overall, I think that Catching Fire and the rest of the Hunger Games series is by far the best purchase I have ever made. I look forward to rereading them all real soon.:-)
B0071XO8RA|4.0|There are three things that make this a good book...<br /><br />1) Its totally believable. You get the intense feeling that this truly could happen in this day and age, and that permeates your consciousness (and sub-conscious) throughout your read of this book. It doesn't have any future tech distractions or any alien conspiracy or alien invasion sub plots. It roots itself deeply in the fact that we humans are our own worst enemy and are own worst horror.<br /><br />2)  The authors ability to keep the reader in perpetual suspense regarding the big questions. What is this silo? How did it come to be? How was it built? Why are they in this silo? What is the real reason behind cleanings? How did the world outside get like that? How long, how many generations, has it really been? You discover the answers to some, not all, of these questions as the story goes on. Its like opening a multi-layered present layer by layer and it just gets better. You sympathize easily with the characters as they begin to unravel the truth because hey, you the reader are human too and these questions would eat at you too if you were in that silo right?!<br /><br />3) The idea that there is a lot more to this story that has yet to be told. Its like the Star Wars movies, the original ones. You knew there was a story before them and you knew there is a story after them and your imagination just continued to percolate about that world long after you had seen the last movie. Its the same with Wool. The mind just boggles at what else you don't know! Whats Solo's story, how did it go down? What is the story of the silo before this iteration? How does it go on...or gasp, end?!<br /><br />This is a good book to read and immerse yourself in. Really enjoyed it.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Great Games for Free,took awhile to get use to the controls . Play it daily and totally enjoy playing this game.
B008602KQI|4.0|Yes, it omits some stuff that some people seem to consider to be key plot points.  But, in all fairness, they did the best they could with the 2.5 hours they were given.  And, they did some things they could NOT do in the book (and still keep a clear point of view).
0525953728|1.0|Here is a great story please read!<br /><br />Bissonnette Will Be Disowned - fron the daily beast read thw whole story!<br /><br />\\"Members of the Special Operations community are well known for eating their own,\\" the book warns. If Bissonnette's relationship with special ops was in danger when he left the unit, it's dead now. It is likely that Bissonnette will be not only ridiculed and criticized, but ostracized from the military completely: \\"Some of these authors are considered personae non grata by their former units: members are instructed to never talk to the author and the author is never to be allowed to participate in unit functions again.\\"<br /><br />I have a family member who is a Navy SEAL - and to put him and his team at risk because of Mark Bissonnette.  He has no ethics and dishoinored his team and their community.<br /><br />Mark says the proceeds will go to the Navy SEAL foundation - HELLO the foundation will not accept any proceeds from this book.<br /><br />If you buy this book shame on you!
B00846REIS|5.0|Loved the book, can't wait for the next one due out in October. Better than 50 shade in my opinion.  A must read if you like the 50 shades trilogy.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a very entertaining portable game for ages 8 and up.  The requirements are WIFI Access and a Facebook Account.
B008FDOS66|5.0|This is the best album from my point of view since the dreadful plane crash.  This is good solid rock and roll.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I knew absolutely nothing about this series except the movie was being released in a week for the first book.  Several of my co-workers had read the whole series and raved at how good it was.  I read the first book in 3 days, could not put it down.  I was immediately drawn into the horror of the Hunger Games and what it was all about that it made me mad.  I visualize everything I read as I am reading which added to the drama.  I finished the other 2 books in the series within a week!  They hit on every emotion and make you think...is it so unrealistic that something like this couldn't happen?  Read it and find out, you won't be disappointed!
B006LSZECO|5.0|i haven't finished reading this just yet and i can't seem to put it down. i don't want it to end. also, highly recommend another book by the same author, Sharp Objects. i read this one first and it is completely enthralling and again didn't want it to end, although is was very intense and unlike anything i've ever read.
B001H68K8A|5.0|This is an SHM copy, so buy it!  With several different formats that upgrade older music releases, I kept searching for this one and finally found it.  Worth more, but glad I got it for this price.  When I look for either an SACD, K2, or SHM copy of older music, what I'm looking for is improved dynamic range and instrument placement, plus of course vocals.  As soon as you put this on and it starts playing the first thing that popped into my mind was \\"turn it up\\"--and you will too!  Chrisopher Cross' vocal really stands out, as well as the back-up singers, some noteworthy singers themselves (Michael McDonald is one).  The orchestration is much nicer than on the original release but of course with an SHM product, you get that.  This was one of those CD's that when released, it seemed like every radio station was playing it, and everybody had a copy that they played over and over and over and over--and never grew tired of.  I purchased all his succeeding releases but this by far is the best of them all.  I keep watching for an SACD release of this and will buy it as soon as I see it.  But until then, if you are a Chris Cross fan, this is a must have.  I am happy to see that Japan is doing many SHM releases now, many of older music.  I only had 5 stars to give it, if 10 were there, it would have received that.  BUY THIS!
B008602KQI|5.0|I thought this was a great movie. Was worried by the hype - thought it might be overrated - but it was really<br />entertaining.
B003EW4KCK|5.0|This is an SACD hybrid version.  I was not a huge Police fan, but of all their albums released, this was the one I liked best and was always looking for an upgraded (either remastered or SACD) copy.  I rated it at 5 stars, but at the beginning, it sounds like the dynamic range is being suppressed.  I noticed the vocal tract more than anything.  After that, it sounded much better.  There is a wider sense of instrument placement around the room which is missing off the original release but of course back when this came out, just having releases on CD was a huge advancement over an LP.  I would heartedly recommend this to anyone who likes the Police.  I have seen a DTS of their greatest hits but many of the songs on Synchronicity are not on that copy.  It's $60 well spent.
B0047Y0FGY|3.0|While amusing in parts it basically rambled from point to point. This doesn't mean it wasn't an easy and enjoyable read, just something I wouldn't necessarily recommend. If someone was looking for an intellectual stimulating or serious informative work this was not it. On the other hand, if one wanted to just kick back and take up time with words on a page then this was it.
B008602KQI|3.0|This movie is quite good, but I just can't like it. I do not care for the killing of children. Parts of the movie are good, like the beginning. The rest is just awful.
034580404X|5.0|I started this book and was telling my husband about it when we decided to read out loud to each other. It has been very nice sharing my book and we are spending a lot more quality time with each other. Whether you read it by yourself or with someone, it will keep you guessing what they will do next. Great reading.
0307279189|5.0|A truelly amazing book.<br />Very slow start and almost put it down for good.<br />Thank god I persisted because it delivered a motivational and inspirational reward.<br />Don't miss this read.
B004LX0D36|5.0|Sense and Sensibility follows the lives of two sisters, Eleanor Dashwood (Sense) and Marianne Dashwood (Sensibility). The story begins when the Henry Dashwood passes away, leaving his estate to his son, who is only half related to the Dashwood sisters. The girls, their younger sister, Margaret, and their mother are obliged to leave and seek residence elsewhere since they are no longer the rightful owners of the Dashwood Estate. Without much money to themselves, and a conniving sister-in-law who keeps their brother from providing them with any income, the family is forced to move miles and miles away near to their obnoxious cousins who have offered to allow a low rent. As if it weren't bad enough having to leave their home,  the move brought with it some other negative outcomes. For one, Eleanor had to leave her love, Edward Ferrars (who happens to be the brother of their snobby sister-in-law), and Marianne ends up falling for a man who is not quite what he appears to be. The story follows the lives of the two girls and their tumultuous relationships, as well as their loyalty to one another. Full of twists and turns, broken hearts, reputation-ruining secret, and surprising turns of events, this novel is sure to hold you until the end!
B008602KQI|5.0|I absolutley loved this movie! i cant wait til the next two come out! just the dept of the movie was awesome. the books did go into more detail than the movies did though.
0439023521|5.0|In book 1 the 74th annual Hunger Games are approaching. The way it works is that one boy and one girl between the ages of 12-18 from each district put in what I consider as a raffle with their name on it according to there age starting at one raffle at twelve and so on to be  chosen to fight to the death where only one remains (There are 12 districts). In the homes of District 12 lye some of your characters Katniss Everdeen (Main Character), her sister Prim(short for Primrose), her mother(her father died), Gale(her best friend), and Peeta Mellark. Also if you decide to take a tesserae or a years supply of grain and oil for one person that means you have to enter your name in the raffle another time(you can do this as many times as you want). Now getting back to the summary, Katniss, Prim and her mother are getting ready for the reaping(the reaping is the day the names are chosen). When they get there, Katniss and her mother believe that since Prim's name is in there only once that she will not be chosen. That all changes once Prim's name is called as tribute over the loudspeaker. Katniss and her mother are shocked and Katniss volunteers to take Prim's place where she will meet different people and have to choose between life and death.<br />  I thought that this book was a must read because of all the excitement and suspense that was put into this book like when it says \\"Effie Trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. And it's not me. It's Primrose Everdeen.\\" Another opinion that I had on this book is that I think it is 13 and older book because of how deep the book can get.
B008F5YDRI|1.0|i rented this on the plane and could not ever get it to load so i did not see it.  i would like a credit please.<br /><br />thanks,<br /><br />Katherine Feeman
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This is a very interesting, well written, book about a Seal patriot! While he has taken some \\"heat\\" about talking about Seal Life, I find little evidence that he is giving any important information away that might hurt national defense. Highly recommended book!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I found this book to have a ton of information.  The author never once said anything bad about his fellow soldiers nor did he make the book all about him. He used \\"we\\" countless times. He gave credit where credit was due. The reviews posted already saying that he is a selfish soldier could not be bigger lies.  I can only say they are jealous. Had the book come out 10 years after Bin Laden's death I don't think anyone would be saying such things.<br /><br />\\"Owen\\" gave us the real story.  He left out any information that the public should not know. There was nothing in this book that I would consider to be secure information. The fact anyone is threatening a lawsuit is absurd.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|Lottta hokum!! Strictly for the teen crowd. Bad acting, bad scenery, bad story, and a lot of scene chewing by Stanley Tucci
B00846REIS|5.0|Great read! Can't wait for the next book of the series to come out!  Would recommend this book to all the \\"Fifty Shades\\" fans!
B0080CL0HM|3.0|The story is essentially the plot of Georges Duroy (Robert Pattinson) weaving his way to wealth through a myriad of seductions of married women.  Along the way one of his seductions in particular leads him to love, with Clotilde de Marelle (Christina Ricci).  Still, our young Georges Duroy keeps his eye on the prize of obtaining wealth and financial security and despite his grand feelings for Clotilde de Marelle, continues on to one final seduction of Suzanne Rousset (Holliday Grainger).  Although all is not what it seems with the final seduction, which entreats our young George to wealth and the girl he's really after...Clotilde de Marelle.  Bel Ami feels much like what \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" strove to be but fell flat of achieving.
B008EL4YX6|5.0|Quite the fun game!  Looks great on the Kindle Fire and runs smoothly.  This was a great game to receive as the free app of the day.
B007712XAU|5.0|My husband and I have both loved watching both seasons of this show.  The production, the acting, the story--everything about it is phenomenal.  Can't praise it highly enough.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a great cover for Kindle Fire.  It is easy to use and definitely protects your Kindle if it should drop or fall.  I keep my stylus clipped to the elastic piece at all times when not in use. You can also fold the cover back to create a stand for table use or viewing movies on your Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is a very nice simple and clean application of a calculator. Easy to read the type and the calculations are all shown clearly so that there is no guessing.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|maybe McCartney's best yet - not like anything else I have ever heard from him - I absolutely love it!
B004RLPWXS|5.0|Have been avid Duran Duran fan/follower since the 80's when they entered the music arena; and have purchased all their music to include many import records. This by far is the best overall new album they have produced in my opinion since Sing Blue Silver / Arena. Many similiar melodies and underlying tones that bring back their original style. Every track is great!
B008578PMU|2.0|Skip this one.  The plot was thin and trite; most everything was cliched.  The only good thing about this movie - and you'd have to be a fan of WWII fighters to appreciate it - was seeing realistic CG renditions of classic Allied and Axis planes flying over the European theater.  (The only reason I actually gave this movie a two-star review is because I DO happen to be enthralled with Second World War history, and period combat aircraft, in particular.)  The aerial combat scenes were exciting, but almost comically blown out of proportion.  Looked like Star Wars, with Messerschmitts instead of Tie fighters!  Save your money for a better WWII air combat movie ... rent \\"Midway\\" or \\"Memphis Belle\\".  Even the flying propaganda-poster movies of 1941-45 had better plot lines, and acting, than this movie (see The Flying Tigers or Flying Leathernecks).  I can't exactly say that it did a disservice to the Tuskeegee airmen, but it certainly did not honor their memory, either.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Dark and fascinating story about how the unfettered power of government can quickly spiral out of control. As disturbing as the images of children killing children are the underlying theme of a government that can use  \\"bread and circuses\\" to control the masses is even more chilling. The characters are portrayed well by the actors in the film and it is an entertaining film.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This app does what it needs to do. It is easy to deal with and understand. I recommend it to others who need a simple calculator.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I absolutely loved reading this book kept me interested from cover to cover and couldn't wait to buy the next one.<br /><br />Only negative is that my 14 year old daughter and her friends wanted to read it and as the write up on the back really dosn't prepare you for what is in the book I allowed mine to read luckily I am a faster reader than here and stopped her from finishing the same should really have an 18+ rating on it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't read much. But I couldn't put this book down....:)  I kept on reading the series.  I love Mr grey..
B008IYR2BA|4.0|I am addicted to Dexter. For me this was the worst season, but I still loved it. I didn't like what was revealed about Debra. Too creepy! The last episode was my favorite! Can't wait to see Season 7.
B002RI90WM|5.0|Excellent story, well written, I couldn't put it down once I started reading. A story from a different view of the world. Makes us value our four legged friends and shows how easily our world can be turned upside down. Well worth reading.
B003EY7IRC|4.0|What is Barrons?<br />Who will be the queen of fae?<br />What will happen to Christian?<br />What happens to Earth?<br /><br />It answers a lot of questions. Yet, it leaves with a lot more. There's a lot more characters introduced in the end and seems not to be given much importance, though seems to be vital in ending.<br /><br />Moning just agreed to do 2 more books for the series to answer the hanging questions, hopefully she'll tie it all nicely.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|What an amazing book. I loved it, had to make myself not pick it up if I had things I had to get done because I knew I wouldnt get anything done once I picked it up. About 3/4 of the way through I went ahead and ordered the next one to my kindle.A love story with depth between vampire and witch a read that will have you spellbound from the begining...The second book is proving to be just as good.
B0083Z3O8Y|2.0|I thought I would enjoy this book because I like the author but I had a hard time getting into it.  Others may like it, it just wasn't one for me.
B0058YPL66|5.0|so i got the season in the mail very quickly. but i was very dissappointed by the cover for the season. this picuter , the one showing the item on amazon,  was the imagie i was looking forward to seeing once it arrived at my home. but when i opened it, it was not the imagie i had seen, which made me alittle dissappointed. i also, after opening the package i found it to be  unclose able.<br />  all in all the season works and it's a wonderful show! love once upon a time.
B002ZG9940|5.0|Wow!  Loved the movie.  The transfer is magnificent highlighting all of the different kinds of light.  Especially like the lighting in the coffee shop scenes.  Buy this blu ray with confidence.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Jetpack Joyride is a great game that I am so glad is finally on Android, but the game has a few issues, mostly with saving your progress. You can complete missions or buy things, and then quit the game, and when you come back the items are locked again or missions need to be redone.
0525478817|5.0|I'm a big fan of Green's earlier work - I'd recommend any of his books - and this one lived up to my expectations. Given the subject matter, it takes a skilled writer to not let the story spiral into a maudlin, sappy mess and Green is one of the best - the novel will make you laugh and cry and it never pulls at the heartstrings just to evoke a reaction. The characters are terrific and just when you think you've got it figured out, a small twist changes the direction of the story.  Just a great, great read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This kept my attention and I wanted more story.I hope she writes more on this family as the children grow up and the two grow old togeather.
0345803485|5.0|CAN'T WAIT TO READ THE OTHER 2 BOOKS! WOW! KEEPS YOU READING; NOT WANTING TO CLOSE THE BOOK. IT'S TRUE, IT IS AN EXCITING READ!
B007SGM084|5.0|Really glad I bought this book as one. Able to continue reading straight through without having to buy and download three times. Ok so the book is kind of written on a teenage level(easy read),but the content/story keeps your attention to keep reading! It's NOT just about sex..it's there to build the main characters from beginning to end. But those steamy scenes, Make you wanna try new things to spice up your love life!! Enjoy
B008IJTFYW|3.0|this doesn't relax me as well as I'd hoped but it's not too bad. I think it should have more soothing tones
B008602KQI|5.0|Read the books & liked them - thought the movie was faithful to the first book and the cast was great. Can't wait for the second movie.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Dialogue is high schoolish. Only the first book was worth my time reading it. In the other two, the plot is thin, predictable, and has just the same old weak kinky stuff.Books two and three sound like fairy tales. Girl marries rich handsome guy, etc.<br />I won't be fooled into buying any more of her \\"writings.\\"
B003H6KRIE|5.0|excellent, bluray brings out all the video in high def and all the sounds, from watching this on DVD and then bluray like a different movie, enjoy the movies, Drvon
B006VFLIYK|5.0|This was a very exciting and thrilling story with a uncommon occupation by the main character, Robie. An amazing relationship develops between Robie and Julie and helps fulfill her life again with some trust. She's a tough resourceful kid and the story makes you want to hug your kids more and more...
B000RLFJQ2|4.0|With films of this type being so popular now here's one from a few years back that can stand up with the modern genre.
B007SY3CEW|1.0|it wouldn't even load and it just says &quot;there was an error loading this app&quot; when ever you try to download the app. but the REALLY stupid thing is that it wont even give me my money back!!! so I just got the version but it was cool but still just get the free version!!!  :(
B0084AXZK0|4.0|This a well written unusual story with strong characters and definitely worth reading. Still, I would not rate this work of art as an excellent one. Its actuality for todays life is limited and, on my opinion, contains too much unbased social philosophy.
0525478817|5.0|I saw this book as a recommendation from Amazon and was impressed by the positive reviews.  I came across it two days later while on vacation and decided to give it a read.  I wasn't even finished with the second page and I knew I was going to love this book, and I was right. It is such an incredible story, funny and sometimes sad. You find yourself cheering for Hazel and Augustus as they discover first love and their adventure of meeting Hazel's favorite author. I read this book in 3 days...and I am reading it again to really savor it this time. I will definately be reading John Green's other books. Any author that can have me in love with a book before I'm even done with the second page, has a fan for life. Maybe he will be my very own personal \\"Peter Van Houten\\" of authors. Read this book. You won't regret it!
B0010SEMP0|4.0|I've enjoyed reading this series so far. It's entertaining and sexy and kept my attention. It also gives an interesting spin on the world of vampires.
B000QCQ8Y4|4.0|As usual a well thought out plot and an enjoyable read<br />Childs never disappoints in a well crafted book  Can't wait for the next one
B00122HW92|5.0|This is an awesome live album, they sound as good as when they were in their prime...sound quality is really good too, clean sound. Lots of songs that are new to me also. Buy this one.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love this app. Works great and is very helpful. Tells me everything I need to know. Would recommend it to all.
B00846REIS|4.0|Enjoyed the book, similar to Fifty, great sex scenes.  Eva and Gideon seem addicted to one another. Can't seem to get enough sex when they hit rough spots in their relationship.  Looking forward to the next book to find out more about Gideon's past. Once I started reading this book, it was very hard to put down.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Had this on my iPhone and it transferred over to my iPad. Son always want to play it when we go on trips.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I am new to Epublishing, and after Googling and Blogging for advice, it sounded like Amazon's KDP program was the place to start -- for a LOT of reasons.  So I did, and the experience was great!  The biggest trick is knowing where to click on the Amazon home page to get started, once you figure that out (easy when you know where to look), Amazon provides very detailed, yet simple and clear on-line instructions that take you through the steps to get the book published.  Thanks Amazon/KDP - you guys are Amawesome!  I'll see your system again the end of September when I upload my second novel. ;)<br /><br />FYI - To get to the self-publishing module - scroll to the very bottom of the Amazon homepage, click on 'Independently Publish With Us'.
0307730697|5.0|I actually got this book on audio to distract me on long drives. More than once I've found myself sitting in my driveway for long periods of time not wanting to turn it off.<br /><br />The review title says it all. This book will take you deeper into your soul and ignite a fire that very, very few books can.<br /><br />A MUST read!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I was hooked after reading Fifty Shades of Gray.I could not wait to read the second book and I wasn't disappointed.Yes it's erotic and wild,not the kind of book I usually read but,several friends recommended it and I decided to give it a try.I could not put it down.I have read all three and was actually a little sad after the third book I didn't want it to end.If you like something different and a little on the wild side read it,you won't be sorry.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This novel moved along very well and I did not guess the 'baddie' until almost the end... did guess what was ailing the mother tho... right from the beginning I knew what medical condition she had... won't spoil it... fair warning tho... i really despised every single person in the book!
B006IYFCIM|3.0|I heard the author twice discussing this book on NPR.  I wasn't disappointed and the research, I felt, was sound and thorough, but the conclusions were repetitive.  There are just so many ways you can say the majority of people cheat the majority of the time, but to a greater or lesser degree based on their attempts to maintain their positive self image.  This conclusion was repeated again and again in almost exactly the same words. The tests were not particularly singular in description to be individually interesting, and although there were a small handful of short, adjunct facts worth sharing with my friends and a couple of ideas I can apply to my life, I rushed through the last 75 pages at least, anxious for the end.  I often find it apparent that authors stretch the length of a book to command a higher price and sacrifice the quality that could be achieved were less filler used.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was full labyrinthine plot twists ... I would be reading then suddenly my mouth would drop open and ... well ... was one of those can't-put-it-down novels and as a result of reading her Gone Girl, i read the other two books Sharp Objects and Dark Places
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|This book was recommended by a friend so I thought it would be terrific. As usual, my expectations let me down. It was mediocre at best. It wasn't a page-turner. Most of it was predictable. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone and am not excited about the next book in the series.
0784011710|5.0|Somehow Sophie's Choice didn't make it onto the first release of the AFI Top 100 listing - but they remedied that when they revoted ten years later. Sophie's Choice earned the #91 spot for the amazing acting of Meryl Streep, along with Kevin Kline's breakout performance with his first ever film role.<br /><br />Meryl is stunning as a Polish woman who barely survived the German horrors of World War II. She saw nearly her entire family taken away and slain. It was only Kevin's intervention that kept her from dying in the US from the many illneseses she took on during the war years. So she is dearly devoted to him, even through his manic highs and violent lows.<br /><br />Peter comes along as a barely-of-age writer from the South who wants to write the next American novel in the streets of Brooklyn. The three form a friendship, and over time Peter is able to learn more and more about what Meryl went through.<br /><br />Have I mentioned Meryl is an incredible actress? She has so many emotions to portray over the course of the story - love, desperation, terror, hope, resolution. In each turn she appears perfectly in tune with her character. Her accent is pure music on the ears. She's shown in other movies that it's not just this Polish accent that she excels at, but she can do a wide range of characters.<br /><br />It's stunning that there's even scenes of females talking with other females, which you pretty much NEVER get in any movie. Usually it's all about men with perhaps a woman or two sprinkled in for entertainment. Here one of the most powerful scenes is when Meryl is sitting talking with a young German girl, and moving past initial class differences to touch on a more human connection.<br /><br />Certainly a movie that one could watch, and rewatch, and always find something new in the performances and meanings. From the twists in Kevin's moods to the subtle changes in Meryl's emotions, this movie is acting at its finest.<br /><br />Well recommended.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|this app gives handy info and lets you customize how the display looks. very cool and easy to use. i like it.
B008AITJ24|1.0|Why is this season so expensive when it's only 13 episodes???  All the other seasons have many more.  I was going to buy this season since my directv receiver died and I lost the episodes that I haven't seen yet, but jeez.
B008KPDYQY|1.0|This movie was garbage of the juiciest  variety. I think the next time I'll watch it I'll be masturbating with sand paper or something of the like. The end.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|works far better than ever expected. Can even stream music and videos to phone. Takes a little practice to get used to but percevier
0736092269|5.0|nice and detailed pictures , very breif and it shows the exercise in a way that the mind understands the motion effect on the desired muscle
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I really enjoyed this book, so I would definitely recommend it to all of those who like reading books about growing up, and religion,and animals...and many more issues that this book covers.
B008EQIA7W|2.0|Badly put together, just like the original. A movie with a bunch of great actors saying corny dialogue amidst expensive special effects. Loved the final battle with the rock demon, though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game. its so much fun. my little sis and I have to take turns playing this other wise we'll get into a fight.
030788743X|5.0|I wasn't sure about this title, however I was really able to delve into the book.  It hooks your imagination and carries you away.  The worlds Mr. Cline created are very rich and made this a memorable novel.  I really hope the author continues to write because I would love to read something else by him.  I hope the OASIS exists one day.  Don't hesitate, buy the book!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|i have had 0 problems with this game. very easy directions to understand. recommended to people of all ages. play now
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is cool! very challenging. a smart way to play what is a game that comes in many forms. keep up the good work!!
0385335997|4.0|The book is very well written - no fancy style, but a nicely flowing language which is user-friendly to readers - and Im satisfied with the fact that, while reading a nice romance with a hint of fantastic, I can learn a lot about the history of the time and about the Scottish dialect which, not being a native English speaker, I found very interesting. Therefore, the novel is an amusement and a source of education at the same time, which is exactly what I'd wanted from it. I recommend it highly.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|this is a chilling tale of Catherine Bailey and her unfortunate meeting with Lee, a charismatic and handsome police officer Tthe story spans three years, starting with Catherine and Lee meeting and the sad results of that relationship 3 years later. Each chapter alternates between then and now, and captures the horror and sadness that poor Catherine endures. a great book!
B008602KQI|1.0|This was mindless teenage drivel. The only thing it had going was an unlimited publicity budget.It was the same old bread and circuses with young love thrown into the mix. Do not bother with this one.
1439156816|4.0|We use this book in my creative writing class. Stephen gives great tips about writing as well as a look in his own thoughts an theory about writing. I recommend it as a good read and as a tool to better your writing.
B000W00IAK|5.0|After making the tragic error of listening to some of the \\"great\\" music from my high school and college days, and scratching my head wondering how I could have actually liked that crap, it was with enormous trepidation that I approached Copperhead Road. I was so relieved and excited to hear it again and find that it sounded better than it did back then. I wish Nashville had been listening back then instead of manufacturing bands to sing generic lyrics geared to appeal to people not quite bright enough to realize that Larry the Cable Guy is making fun of them.<br /><br />Anyway, back when I first listened to this in high school I couldn't realize what agreat song writer and all around talent Steve Earle really was back then and is today. \\"Wow\\" is all I can say, and damn am I glad I took the chance to listen to this one again. It's nice to know I had a little good taste in music way back then, and it's good to know that Steve is still putting out great music. Bichen!
B0063GORYU|1.0|cards don't go where you want them to go.  No fun playing.  Cards go to stupid places and you are charged for those moves. which. isn't fair.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I'd never heard of this band, but was intrigued by their name and five bucks wasn't much to risk so I bought it. I am impressed! The songs are well written, both lyrics and music, and none of them out-stay their welcome. Indeed, extended jams on a couple of the more tuneful songs would have been welcome. However, the artist is usually to be truted where their work is concerned. All around great album and I will be looking out for more by Imagine Dragons.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I use the yoga portion of this set ALOT. Its challenging but not so challenging that someone who does not do yoga regularly couldn't do it. You know you've had a good workout from the yoga alone. I found the Bellydance Technique instruction was very detailed and informative,the breakdown of each of the movements for the most part was clear and easy to follow. On a few occasions the camera does not show what her feet are doing which I found made it difficult to get the traveling movements in particular, just right. Overall a great resource especially if your a fan of Rachel Brices unique style.
B004UID2LC|5.0|The UI could use a lot of work but other than that works as expected.  Great app, nice on-the-go compliment to similar desktop programs.
1604680547|5.0|Really nice book with great designs.  Really impressed with the index.  I can look up by size of design I need which saves me time.  Great book with so many designs all in one book.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I always love to play this game. I like the spooky edition as well. it is a good time waster. :)
B001RU2YUQ|5.0|I enjoyed the story and also thought they did a good job of both acting and directing this adventurous movie. I especially enjoyed the little boys part in it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It started slowly and towards the end I had to plug my Kindle in to re-charge and sat in the perimeter of the cord.<br /> Never before have I read a book in which each character was un-likeable. Their flaws were true on so many levels, and I believe can be found in most humans. Myself included.<br /> It begs for a sequel.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I am reading the Outlander series for the second time and would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys rich characters and great detail. Rich with Scottish legend and history this series gives a captivating account of the riggers of everyday life in the mid 1700 and the struggles of a time traveler willing to risk everything for love.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I got this app because I wanted something along the line of Flipboard but wasn't sure that was one I could use. However, in using this app I absolutely love to look at the news stories each day and find out all different kinds of things. I use it everyday and even though I haven't had it long it is one of my favorites. I haven't had a problem on the Fire and it runs well but also when I have the option to go to a website for more details of a story it goes quickly. This is a keeper.
B009329Y30|4.0|Great soundtrack, has some great scenes and overall was pretty good, well-cast and great to see Efron grown up; not my favorite chick-flick, but definitely was worth watching and leaves you feeling good, and has something to say in it.
B000FC1MM8|5.0|1st time reading a Harry Bosch book.  Went back and found the first.  Plan on reading them all.  What a great character Harry is.  Love the detailed descriptions of the area and the police work.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Works very smoothly on my Epic 4g running CM10. Relaxing to play but a good challenge too. Music and sound add to the game play.
B003TJR2HS|1.0|Save your money.  Purchased in March.  Only used 4-5 times in my roadster.  Today it started static.  Need to be careful as these crummy products can burn out your speakers on the iphone. Another cable connector did that.  Useless piece of garbage.  Recommend trying something else.
031236198X|5.0|There are many many leadership books on the market that will help you be a better leader.  \\"Our iceberg is Melting\\" is one of those books that's is in the 'best in class' category.  It's a book that truly makes leadership easy to understand and easier to apply principles because the story is told in a simple way.<br /><br />There are no silver bullets in leadership.  It takes time, effort, and a \\"serving others\\" attitude.  Kotter does a great job of conveying to the reader what it takes to be a leader.
B000002WYT|5.0|Crash, Before these crowded streets and under the table and dreaming are the original classics!!!!  All of DMB's best stuff comes one of those 3 albums.  Crash is an absolute must!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app warns me whenever my kindle decides to not charge or not recognize that it is.plugged in - which is way too frequently even though it was replaced twice already. I like all the features the app has to offer and appreciate that it is free
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The second issue was filled with mystery, love, erotica and action. I love the email banter between Ana and Grey, I found myself laughing out loud.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I had a hard time putting this down. I was sucked in immediately and read it in about 3 days.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The third issue was filled with mystery, blossoming love, erotica and action. I love the email banter between Ana and Grey.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun and entetaing game I love it fun fun fun fun fun fun fun! so fun
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book kept my interest from the beginning.  Dragged in a few spots but on the whole it was filled with suspense.  Sometimes it seemed a bit farfetched and I found myself annoyed with characters.  Other times I could not put it down even though I was tired of reading.  On the whole I liked this book and am looking for another of hers novels to read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great games and fun for all. everyone should have this for good ole family fun... I would recommend this to any and all.
B004T4KQJS|5.0|It is hard to describe quantum physics with religious fundamentalists or others that didn't go beyond 5th grade.<br /><br />There is a well proven concept in quantum physics known as Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle.  It states that one cannot know with arbitrary accuracy such covariant pairs such as position and momentum, and energy and time.<br /><br />If their was such a thing as nothing, then we would know that energy was zero with 100% accuracy, which would meanthat we known \\"when\\" as infinity. Therefore true \\"nothingness\\"is impossible.<br /><br />Q.E.D.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best book I've ever read. It has uncovered issues for me that have taken many years to understand. Eckhart Tolles perspective is now helping me to recover from Post Traumatic Stress Dissorder, as I can now focus my attention on my present, instead of living in the past and future. He is an amazing writer and I would strongly urge anyone interested, to buy this book. Its a keeper.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I reccommend this to book to everyone! It has such a good plot and you really get connected to the characters.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kiddies and I really enjoy this game. It is fun to see if we can beat each mother's scores.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice graphics.  Puzzles get quite challenging to get perfect score as you progress.  Works great on Galaxy tab.  Music could use some work (but not enough to affect rating).
B000NQRE1E|5.0|One word...AWESOME! I was so worried that this was not going to get a great transfer, and it meets all my expectations and then some.  I was there opening night at the theater for this movie back in 1997, I remember standing in line at Blockbuster at midnight for the VHS release and of course, upgraded to DVD when it was released.  This new Blu Ray release is like watching it all over again for the first time!  Incredible, crystal clear picture and audio.  ONE HAPPY FAN!!!
B0092MKTL2|5.0|I had never heard of this band.  It was the number one seller on amazon so I played all of the song previews and heard a few tracks I liked so I took a chance...<br />Wise choice.  The songs are melodic, catchy, and have a unique sound.<br /><br />Give it a few listens and you too can make a fool of yourself sitting in your room alone randomly singing along and hitting the fictional drums next to your keyboard.
B004I744AS|3.0|Way too much extra stuff to wade through.  Configured it to get rid of the extra stuff then could not find how to clear the word search list without reseting it then had to reconfigure the app again to get rid of the extra stuff and reset home location for the weather.  Needs to be online to be fully functional.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I caught the video of Hey Ho on VH1 and decided to look into more by them and bought the album after listening to the previews. I am extremely pleased with the purchase and consider The Lumineers one of the best bar bands I've heard in recent years. I crank myself up for work listening to this album!!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This game is highly recommended  for its entertainment value.  It is fun and challenging to play.  A few head slaps when then hints are used to find out how simple the solution turns out to be sometimes.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I had this game on my iphone til it took forever to get energy. but I downloaded it just to do it on my spare time.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|I got these when they were relatively new to the market. I \\"upgraded\\" from a pair of Tritton AX360s that had terrible mic issues.<br />First the bad: Don't buy these - get a newer wireless headset. The frequent popping has reached the point of being unbearable. As I type this, I sit 8 feet from the base, with no wifi obstructions, and these things are popping like mad. I will likely be selling these on Craigslist and getting a thoroughly well-reviewed and recommended wireless headset.<br />The good: When they work, they're great. Sound quality is impressive for a wireless headset. The AAA batteries is fine, since you can flip-flop rechargeables, but don't expect a pair of AAAs to last more than a week with frequent use.<br />The bass is decent for a wireless set of cans, but doesn't compare to my newer Tritton AX Pros (that I got after getting rid of my AX 360s.)<br /><br />Comparing the X41s to the AX Pros, I REALLY notice how much I appreciate the self voice feedback in the X41s. I can hear myself clearly unlike the Tritton's where I just assume I'm talking at a normal level. Also, the mic is more sensitive on the X41s, so I don't wake up the family with late-night gaming. The AX Pros require a higher input volume to be heard by others. The wired AX Pros have a deeper bass as expected, and both sets have good surround sound.<br /><br />But good grief, the popping of the X41s just ruin this product. If you buy these, give them a solid testing at different distances from the base and different base locations to ensure you don't regret your purchase.

B008IJTFYW|4.0|I got this app wanting something to help with meditation and sleep. I absolutely got what I wanted. The urban rain setting sounds quite real and helps me sleep better. I sleep like a baby if it's storming out. The other settings for music or nature sounds are soothing and help me focus when meditating. I would say download the app, even the free version. I hooked my Kindle Fire up to my computer speakers and it has amazing sound quality. Love this app! Download it.
0525953728|1.0|It's interesting considering this 'SEAL' stated that this book is not political yet he wastes little time in bashing the president. It's read like it had a Rove like agenda and if this SEAL gets arrested and held in prison he has no one to blame but himself. It is even more interesting to note that this author has a Karl Rove lawyer defending him in court, yet again he insists this isn't political.<br /><br />I also btw have met veterans and one SEAL and very very few have put down the president like this hack. If Romney becomes president and he loses his pension and gets very little in retirement I will grin and call that justice. The government should take all the profit from this book so the author doesn't get a dime.
B007UPNA6Y|3.0|Well after eagerly awaiting a new Jack Reacher book I am very disapointed. The story line is ok. but it's so, so slow. At first I enjoyed reading it but then 75% of the way through it I realise there has been no action from Jack Just hope there will be more action in the next one.Poor value for money spent!!! Not Lee Childs best book by far.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Often I take a LONG time to finish books.  Mostly in my limited free time, I jump from book to book in my kindle based on my mood.  \\"Gone Girl\\" I stayed with for 3 days straight - looking terrible at work the next day - just so I could see what happens.  \\"Gone Girl\\" was a great read.  The whole book is amazingly clever.  While the ending was not my cup of tea, I would still reread it for every other part make up one of the best modern reads I've had in recent memory.<br /><br />Well-written, clever and a page turner.  I look forward to diving into Gillian Flynn's other novels.

B004EWFUQY|5.0|I needed to lose 30 lbs.  According to the diet program laid out for me, I am suppose to lose it in about 92 days, then enter the third phase for another 127 days to learn how to maintain. I have been on the diet for 25 days and have lost 11 lbs.  The diet is teaching me to cook and eat differently.  If you read the book and really understand what you can and can't eat, you wont be hungry.  This is a reasonable diet to follow.  We will see if the intructions really maintain the lost weight, as I plan on see it through. So far it has been right on mark to what it promises.  Good luck
B0066DNZCA|3.0|After reading and enjoying Hill's ghostly novel THE WOMAN IN BLACK, I went looking for other spooky tales she might've crafted and found this one right away (thanks to its subtitle, \\"A Ghost Story\\").  This novella is about an evil painting, but not in the way of THE PICTURE OF DORIAN GRAY (or AMITYVILLE: THE NEW GENERATION, for that matter, though technically that was a mirror, not a painting).<br /><br />It begins with a young man named Oliver visiting his elderly mentor, Theo Parmitter, who is ailing and close to death after years of being a revered but lonely scholar.  The two begin to talk and as Oliver studies Theo's apartment, a painting along the back wall catches his eye.  He goes to look at it more closely, and finds there an 18th century scene of a carnival on the streets of Venice.  It's very detailed work, and obviously old.  Only, the more Oliver looks at it, the more he becomes somewhat troubled by certain elements.  First, it seems every one of the people painted in it is looking right at him, even as he moves from side to side, and then Oliver notices that one of the men, who is depicted looking terrified as he's being carted off by two others, seems to look anachronistic.  Wrong clothes, strange facial expression, something just a little off.<br /><br />When Oliver mentions the painting to Theo, Theo decides it's time to tell someone the true story of the piece, so he sits Oliver down and begins.  After telling the first part of the story, which is primarily about how Theo came to own the painting, Theo is so exhausted he begs Oliver to let him finish the tale another day.  Frustrated and wanting to know more, Oliver reluctantly agrees and then is horrified to discover Theo nearly dies of a stroke later that evening.  Blaming himself for pushing Theo to tell him a story that was clearly upsetting, Oliver decides to stay in town and help him get back on his feet.  When Theo's feeling better, he finally tells Oliver the rest of the truth about the painting, a story that involves an evil woman and the disappearances of several people who later appear in the painting as if by magic.  Or, more accurately, by curse.<br /><br />It's not a terribly scary story, all in all -- in fact, it's kind of hokey.  But the same was true of THE WOMAN IN BLACK, and, as with both books, the reason I ended up really enjoying them is because Hill is extremely talented at setting a scene.  Her descriptions of both characters and the spaces they inhabit are subtle perfection.  She never spends paragraphs simply describing things -- instead, you pick up on things slowly, forming a detailed image in your mind as you read.  The way the characters talk, for one thing, plays a major role in how they start to look in your mind.  That's crafty writing, right there.  Same thing goes for physical sensations the characters report -- the smell of a room, the touch of an object.  She's very, very good at that sort of thing, which goes a long way toward letting me overlook some flaws in her storytelling.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is my first book by this author. I was pleasantly surprised. It started out a little slow for me, but once I got into it, I could not put it down!

0316044695|5.0|Marcus Luttrell is a true patriot and American hero!  I found this story incredible.  The book tells not only the fantastic story of how Mr. Luttrell survived, but also the 3 heroes who did not come home from that mission and deserve more than we can ever afford to pay.  The book also shows what extraordinary acts of valor and difficulty we ask of all of our men and women in uniform to do, but particularly the tasks to the special operations groups such as the Navy SEALS and other special ops groups from all branches of the military.  Truly they do the work that 99% of Americans cannot and will not do.  It also shows the difficulty of what happens when politicians and the media get involved in running a war and the extreme danger they put our troops in with some of their absurd rules of engagement, especially when you have an enemy who respects no rules and has no honor. I thought the book did a tremendous job telling the story of these brave men, but also showing the very human emotions they had and the honor and professionalism they demonstrate in all that they do. I believe every American should read this book and then go thank a veteran for the freedom we have, because it certainly wasn't free.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|WOW!  What a fantastic book.  I had heard that the Hunger Games was a good book to read but to be perfectly honest I thought it was a lot of hearsay. I will admit I was wrong! I bought it to read while my husband had a MRI. Well needless to say I started reading it the day before his MRI and finished that same day I bought it. That is because once I started reading I couldn't stop. Now that is the sign of a good book.  By the way the book was sooooo much better then the movie.

0385363125|4.0|Quick delivery process from Amazon. I enjoyed the book and by the end felt sorry for Grey. Good character development. Good read. Ordered the second book and got it in 2 days from Amazon. Looking forward to the new read and WILL order the 3rd.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|No need for an expensive white noise/sound machine! Plus, not only does this have so many more sounds, you can customize your own sound programs in great detail. Great for people like myself who cannot sleep without white noise, such as a loud fan, also very relaxing. Works while using other programs on kindle fire and after it goes to sleep. Good idea for travel! Now I don't need to bring along my little fan on vacation. Realistic, beautiful sounds. Fun to experiment with different combinations and different volumes of each sound.  Great for insomniacs. Also great for people with anxiety, use anytime to relax. Creative your favorite combination and either drift off to sleep or feel the anxiety and tension melt away!  Definitely one of the best and most useful apps I've found, and it's free! Don't see any reason to upgrade for $3.
0465011047|5.0|The situation in north Korea is one I find fascinating and compelling, and even though I've read most of the recent books by defectors, I couldn't feel as though I could speak with much authority on the matter until I had read Aquariums. The first part of the book is very slow, mostly the family background of his grandparents and the war. Force your way through that and the book soon becomes vastly more interesting.<br /><br />I hate hate hate saying that about books of this nature. I had a tough time writing a review to the Jaycee lee Duggard story because while the book was very poorly written, the subject was so horrifying and the author so brave that I felt like the worst person for not Immediately giving it a perfect score. I hate saying the first part of this book is a little boring because this is someone's life, and he lived through such trying circumstances and survived and now works to make things better for his former country. Still, I feel I have to say it. But seriously, just push past the first couple of chapters, and you won't be able to put this book down.<br /><br />What I found most fascinating about this book was that it was the first account I'd read of a north Korean defector who had money. Every other account I read featured a defector that was very poor and thus couldn't really afford all the bribes. I hate to say it, but this man's escape, while terrifying in its own right, of course, seemed a little smoother than theirs because he actually could bribe every guard and conductor and agent he came across. (Good for him. It saved his life!)<br /><br />His account is fascinating and devastating - his family was broken apart when he was a child and he was sent to labor away in a political prison, Yodok, Number 15. He tells of his life there, his release ten years late, his life in NK just as the famine was really starting, and his escape to China and then South Korea.<br /><br />One of the things I liked best about this book was that he devotes the epilogue to discussing the political situation in general, the idea of reunification,the views of South Koreans regarding defectors, how to best deal with the late Kim Jong Il's regime, and how to help defectors.<br /><br />Definitely check this book out.

0670023329|5.0|This narrative is so compelling and haunting, but there's an odd beauty to it. Shin was born in a political labor camp in North Korea, and his upbringing was far from normal. \\"Human rights abuse\\" is more accurate. He is tortured both physically and psychologically, and the descriptions are horrifying. But the beauty in this book comes from his reflections on who he is now, how he has grown and developed since his escape, and what he hopes to do now not only for himself but for his country. A great, traumatizing read.
B008XG1X18|4.0|does what it needs to do! sometimes a little slow but great sized pictures that are easy to repin and comment on. could use a &quot;share&quot; button.
0440180295|4.0|Many of the bad reviews seem to be from disappointed customers who heard this book lauded as an anti-war novel and, after reading, felt cheated because that was not the case. And to this I say, yes. You are correct.<br /><br />To understand this book, you have to read the first chapter, which (though unrelated to the plot of the rest of the story) explains why the novel was written. Vonnegut wrote the story because he was sick of hearing \\"war novels\\" that romanticized, overglorified, or hyperbolized war. He was trying to show how boring, nonsensical, and pointless war is, and he did that through a book that is (in the best way) boring, nonsensical, and pointless.<br /><br />If you're reading this book for the plot, I'll concede, it can be a little bland at times, and if you read it with the wrong expectations it seems juvenile, but overall I thought it was an impressive, well executed, and unique piece of literature.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|How can you beat a non-fiction murder mystery?  My father (USMC, ret) served in WWII China, so I enjoy reading about its history.  This book leads up to US involvement.  LOTS I didn't know.  To be honest, I didn't really understand why he served in China; now I have a better understanding.<br /><br />As a former teacher, if I were to teach history today (and didn't have to 'teach to the test'), I'd teach solely from books like this and historical novels and newspapers.  Give a FEEL for the times, the people, the cultures - instead of simply regurgitating facts.<br /><br />This book is tough, but I'd include it as appropriate for HS.

B003GDYN24|5.0|(Taken from my blog Junk In a Cup)<br /><br />Words cannot describe how much this album has inspired me in my personal life, but at least I'll try.  Kelis' Flesh Tone album was the best album of 2010! (TAKE A SEAT HATERS!)  I was going through some things, as we all do, and it was very encouraging and inspiring.  Who knew that 9 songs could be so powerful?  If you read my previous blog entry about Kelis, you already know how much I LOVE her!<br /><br />Before you even hear the music you see the cover.  She has a warrior like, yet majestic pose that demands respect, body armor for protection, preservation, and perseverance of life, and diamonds hanging from her crown for a touch of beauty.  Look into her eyes and you see someone who has been through something and has acquired so much wisdom.  THIS WOMAN MEANS BUSINESS!!!  The album cover encompasses everything that the album is--wisdom, power, and beauty.<br /><br />Kelis has always encouraged me to be myself, but now she encourages me to ENJOY myself and the things around me; to enjoy LIFE because we don't have much time.  Most importantly she taught me that it's ok to love, and that it's most important to love yourself.<br /><br />One of the biggest themes on the album is love but I believe that it also touches on responsibility.  The album was inspired by her son Knight, which was mostly recorded while she was pregnant.  Through the lyrics you can tell that she has a whole new way of thinking and living because she has just created another life.  No more negativity; just love.  She is in control of what she makes and wants it to be directed down the correct path.
B001152TL6|2.0|Our culture is so based on derivation and copy-catting that any artist who stands on his own two feet, masters his medium, and speaks to our heart with an authentic voice, even once, achieves something like cult status. This means that he receives the corrolaries of our unbalanced appreciation of his magic art: fanboyism and effusive appreciation. Essentially, his fans can begin to see his art as a perceptual bench press machine on which to exercise their powers of appreciation. There is very little the human mind cannot appreciate or find meaning in, when the intention is set to do so. There are rocks and trees which the Buddha would have given 5 stars, if you get my meaning.<br /><br />Lynch's Lost Highway disregards narrative structure and typical plotline progression, takes an oblique/surrealist approach to character development, and leaves the viewer mostly in the dark about what is happening through most of the film. The pacing is slow enough to allow the viewer to truly enjoy the delicious, almost unequalled visuals. The visuals are so stunning, that in spite of everything, I sometime watch bits of this film to enjoy them again. However the enjoyment of the visuals is such that it often leads the viewer to wonder: does this film have a larger meaning outside of its own aesthetic beauty?<br /><br />The viewer is given an intimate experience of stunning, sensuous imagery, but not one with any coherent movement or meaning. The dissonance coded into the film's progression is deliberately jarring and is effectively suspenseful, but in a bad, bad way. It is building a monotonic, unresolved, almost sadistic suspense which happens at the expense of the viewer's enjoyment. A chord progression that ceaselessly emphasizes the ii/vii/minor-7th chords is not going to give a pleasant resolution, and carried on for longer than 2 minutes would just be tedious beyond imagining. Yet Lynch isn't afraid to go into that territory plot-wise with this unending mystery-within-a-mystery shell game.<br /><br />Not enough love in this piece to make me forget that I'm looking at Art.

B002YCVX5S|4.0|This movie exists, like all good things, we are informed by Nietzsche, 'beyond good and evil'.<br /><br />If you can accept the obtrusion of Gen X comic-book sensibility into the world of European history, and the use of the former to create a fake fantastic universe within the latter - that is to say if you are not put off by the comic book sensibilities of the creator of this movie: then you are in for a treat.<br /><br />Christoph Waltz and Michael Fassbender bring character to this movie that is just not available in many, more sane flicks. The posturings of the various characters make absurd conflicts possible which are unique to this film. The central protagonist (Colonel Aldo Rain) is a borderline idiot, and the good guys demonstrate that, in an armed conflict, division into good and bad is mostly conceit: there is really just bad and worse. In that sense Tarantino waves a hand in acknowledgement of this universe's morally ambiguous nature.<br /><br />The best thing I can say in praise of this movie is that it manages to be genuinely fun, in spite of its subject matter. That is a miracle that only Tarantino could achieve.

B0064NTZQ2|5.0|Drive. Refn.<br /><br />Refn borrows some highly stylized visual elements from Michael Mann's oevre ('Manhunter'). However I believe the largest contribution to this film does belong to Refn, and is the authentic product of Scandinavian cinema and television.<br /><br />This element is: 'slow-moving character study of brooding protagonists harboring an inner dark side'. The dialogue here is the opposite of Seinfeld: few things are articulated, voice tone and facial expression are of great importance to understanding the character's nuances of emotion. In some ways this taciturn method of delivery mimics how people express themselves in Scandinavian societies. The fascination with brooding, taciturn characters and the portrayal of bleakness and foreboding - the 'inner darkness' - means that these films would be most appealing to those who relate psychologically to these characters.<br /><br />This is the reason for the film's 'slowness', and if the viewer cannot hook into the meaning of this slow-pacedness, they may assume that nothing is happening. To my mind, 'Drive' submerges us in an experience more profoundly than any contemporary film. Since I value this aspect of the experience, I don't take issue with those aspects of the film which would not withstand intellectual scrutiny.

0547564651|2.0|Author Tough asserts that we overstress pupil achievement and under-emphasize skills like perseverance, curiosity, self-control, and optimism - a postulate that strikes me as inane on its face, and another attempt by educators seeking to avoid accountability for poor academic results.<br /><br />The past four decades or more of public education have been filled with one fad after another - each announced with positive fanfare and smiles, and often backed by seemingly credible research. Unfortunately, despite all these supposedly positive reports, augmented by more than tripling inflation-adjusted per-pupil expenditures, U.S. pupil achievement has improved very little, if at all - measured by 17-year-old NAEP test results and dropout rate data. (Assessing pupil performance trends over the years has been made unnecessarily complicated by frequent changes in the tests used, as well as a series of new definitions of 'high-school dropout.')<br /><br />Why the disappointing overall results? Reality is that the field of education research has been dominated by poor research methodology - uncontrolled studies, small sample sizes, 'after-the-fact 'data-mining,' attrition of initial gains, and failure to replicate being the most prevalent causes.<br /><br />Author Tough continues in that unfortunate tradition, beginning with after-the-fact data mining of the Perry Preschool Project. The Perry Preschool project was a 1962 intensive preschool program for disadvantaged youth intended to boost academic achievement. Initial results were positive, but subsequently faded to the point that the program was judged a failure by those most objective. Subsequent 'digging' years later 'revealed,' however, that those in the program did far better in life outcome measures such as incarceration, welfare status, high-school graduation, and employment at age 27. Unfortunately, any competent statistics teacher will strongly suggest the need for additional confirmation since the original research was not designed to detect such differences. Regardless, Tough fails to report the sizes of the newly-found benefits - very poor reporting guaranteed to produce unwarranted conclusions. (The actual differences were operationally significant - lucky for Mr. Tough; however, I didn't have the time or interest in checking on the rest of his reporting.)<br /><br />Other anecdotal sources - Geoffrey Canada's social service organization in Harlem, and stories of individual teenagers in Chicago and elsewhere. More useful material comes from psychologist Mischel's studies from the 1960s reporting that children able to resist immediately eating a marshmallow in return for two marshmallows later did better in school and were more successful as adults.<br /><br />Another repetitive problem with books summarizing research findings - they often omit findings that contradict the desired conclusion. Unless one is an expert, it is very difficult to tell without doing one's own exhaustive review of the literature. Since the nature of social sciences is that contradictory findings are often found in attempted replications, mega-analyses by reputable, qualified statisticians has become the 'gold standard.' Author Tough doesn't even begin to approach that.<br /><br />Finally, the most useful analyses take Occam's Razor into any explanation of findings. Here again, Mr. Tough fails - he has his conclusion and he's going to prove it, no matter how complicated and hard to follow his logic becomes. The simplest explanation of what he found is that youngsters growing up without positive role models are unlikely to succeed in later life. This relationship is about as obvious as the fact that the sun rises in the East.<br /><br />Finally, to be fair, author Tough has a few nuggets of truth embedded in his long-winded, convoluted story. The correlation between both IQ and academic achievement vs. adult successes (eg. earnings, position) is far less than one would think. However, perseverance etc. w/o learning skills/achievement isn't likely to be very successful either. The Asian/Confucian model combines both - education is held in high regard, and perserverence towards academic achievement is strongly encouraged by high-stakes testing that determines college admissions. Collectively, its graduates (nations) are doing very, very well. In other words, 'culture matters' - the exact opposite of an earlier education fad claiming that all value sets were equal. And that conclusion is much more easily validated, and already been done repeatedly involving many millions over decades and across nations by sources far more credible than Mr. Tough.c. w/o learning skills/achievement isn't likely to be very successful either.

B007TMON8M|5.0|All the people rating it one star are being unreasonable whelps and forgetting that this is JUST A GAME! I would normally give it four stars, but it does not deserve those very low ratings. It's a fun game, not entirely realistic, but what game is?
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked the book although I wasn't crazy about the ending.  I don't think another ending would really have worked but it was frustrating because I could feel how trapped he must have felt.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|I bought this e-book based on the great reviews and cheap price thinking I could check it out and leave it if it sucked. Much to my and my family's chagrin, I haven't been able to put it down. This is a fantastic coming of age fantasy epic that I don't want to end. I was sad when I finished it and can't wait for the next installment. Please hurry!
B007TMON8M|1.0|Agree with the other real reviews, this has to be the worst &quot;physics&quot; game I've ever played.  Guess all the structures I've designed and built with my degree IN REAL LIFE fail should have failed by now according to this game because it completely lacks any sense of how weight distribution works, the concept of statics, or simply how gravity works.  HORRIBLE APP!!! DONT WASTE YOUR TIME!!

I lost 5 pounds and hardly ever get hungry now!  The sleep issue will take longer to assess, but I'm sold... no more wheat for me!  That stuff is no longer the wheat God made for us... but now man-made junk!

B0028RXXFC|5.0|Being a history buff, I bought this series hoping to get a better insight to Rome. I have really enjoyed the way the series has made people more than just historical figures and how they stayed away from the factless history such as; \\"Et tu Brutus\\" and the Cleopatra myths. I would love to see HBO do a series on Cleopatra with the same factual and personal views they used in this series.
B007TMON8M|3.0|I made it to the ramp challenge, got the boulder to go 20' and I still failed the level. Why can't I go to the next level? The game was fun but if I can't complete all the levels I'm going to be very disappointed.

0780622650|2.0|This is not the LIS of the 1960s (Thank God), but it doesn't really rate BIG SCREEN status either. Casting was fantastic! Hurt as John Robinson, Rogers as Maureen, Graham as Judy, Chabert as Penny and even Jack Johnson wasn't bad as Will. Oldman was perfectly cast as the sinister Dr. Smith and Matt Leblanc was also perfectly cast as Major West. Unfortunately, some characters were a bit wooden, John Robinson was a lot more loving father and Major West would never have misbehaved like he did with Judy. Besides those little problems, this is supposed to be LOST IN SPACE, yet they seem to spend most of the movie on a planet. Granted in the series they spent a lot of time on planets, but it did run for three years. I'll admit the time travel premise was interesting, but you knew right away that Smith, no matter how, was going to be the evil he always was, so it wasn't a surprise when he \\"changed\\". You also knew something was afoot when Smith \\"offed\\" himself and going \\"down\\" to get away seemed just as risky and just as dangerous. Plus too many people died in this movie, not to mention the bizarre graphics & effects, voice overs and silliness of the end credits.<br /><br />This movie needed a better plot, some more comic relief from the original robot's personality, better CGI for the monkey, Smith & other things, more time in space and less mindless music at the end. Perhaps they would have provided more space time in the sequels), but we never made it passed the first one. I mostly feel sorry for Leblanc because had this film had a better plot, it might have spawned sequels and he might have gotten out of the shadow of Joey.

It was nice just to get into someone else's make believe life and just not think and just read......I found myself almost pissed at times at how stupid she was.....but yet thithinkin....damn ....so I guess u call that my kind of read!  Thx.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|As the title implies, this book is darker and more intense than the first one which is more on the fun side. Again, the reader must set aside reality as far as the lead character's unbounded ability to trust and recognize it as a necessary trait so as to make her the perfect foil for her lover's lack of trust.  This gets us past all the details and on to the real purpose of the book - taking us to the far edge of and a little over what are considered to be \\"normal\\" sexual boundaries.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is simple and beautiful, it<br />does everything that its supposed to and it has great little counters to tell you how long you have left for each item.<br />it automatically launches when you plug the kindle in to charge.<br />Its a great little app!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I purchased this book after hearing that it was \\"hot.\\"  It was.  The sex scenes were great.  But it takes a lot to get past this woman's naivette and to believe that anyone can be so lacking in trust issues.  If you can accept that, which is necessary to get into the story at all, it's a good read.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I really liked this book as it is a rare thing:  a biography of a little boy with severe birth defects that is not saccharine, but uplifting.  A boy with severe facial deformities has been home schooled, but in the 5th grade his parents enroll him in a small private school. The book tells the story of one school year and how the students interact with the boy.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|By the 3rd book, even hot sex scenes got pretty repetitive.  I found myself skipping over them (which I never do) to get to the story, which was okay at best
0374530718|5.0|I agree with everyone who consider this book not deep enough or precise. This is normal for a popular book. The most important value of this book is a history of our society (societies) development reflected by philosophy. At the same time many critical questions of our life are covered (free will, conscience, if world is cognizable, role of historical context in events assessment and so on). Reading the book you can recognize who are you by nature or at least at particular period of your life. What are the roots of your believes. Some questions of modern philosophy. The major strength of this book is its width. I highly recommend this book to every one (except real philosophers who may hate simplifications).
B000002KE2|1.0|This is a stupid cover:( Yellow Ozzy with things hanging from his arms? He looks like a yellow hippy:( And what the hell is Vol? Black Sabbath was weird in the seventees!!!

Black Sabbath should have done album covers like Bananarama:) And they ripped off the musical style of Helmet:( Hippy thieves:( Dio and Gillan are not thieves;) But Gillan is a hippy:(
B008BO61BE|5.0|Yes, this 30th anniversary release of SFV is possibly just another ploy for the music companies to extract our hard earned $$$ by remixing/repackaging a CLASSIC like this 1982 Judas Priest release. But don't dismiss it so quickly. The bonus DVD is worth every penny on it's own.<br /><br />All the guys, but especially Rob Halford are at the top of their game. He hits those high notes and vocal nuances with relative ease, and brings us back to those good ol' metal days. I've seen Rob Halford and the boys recently on HD-NET, and I simply can't bear to watch them now. It makes me cringe to see poor Rob struggle on vocals as his days of engaging the crowd and charismatic on-stage persona have long passed.<br /><br />Fortunately, this US Festival show (presented in it's entirety, stereo PCM, 4:3 aspect ratio) brings back all the fond and impressive memories and once again reinforces why Judas Priest was one of the top metal bands in the 80's. Their performance is tight, polished yet simplistic and stripped of any fancy stage effects. Basically, it's enjoyably reduced to just 5 guys at the pinnacle of their career doing what they do best. It's hard to believe its been 30 years. Their music still holds up incredibly well. \\"Classics\\" in the truest sense. I say buy it. In it there's a fortune waiting to be had, if you let it go - You're mad!
B000002KFJ|1.0|I saw Black Sabbath live, during the early eightees!!!

1781002231|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1HA650F41GLQA]]<br /><br />OF TRADE AND WTO STANDARDS OF REVIEW<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />This latest book from Edward Elgar Publishing concerns more or less obliquely, the sometimes uneasy relationship between the WTO (World Trade Organisation) and its member states.  The author Ross Becroft, both a lawyer and academic, is a specialist in this area and has delivered a thorough critique of the workings of WTO review panels, the purpose of which is to review whether a WTO member state has complied with its obligations under the WTO agreements.<br /><br />Compliance appears to be the operative word here, another key issue being deference and the degree of deference that WTO panels should apply to measures enacted by WTO members; environmental measures, for example.  The WTO, it would appear, needs to aim for a balance between deferring too much -- or not enough -- as the case may be, to the wishes and whims of individual member states.<br /><br />Becroft therefore calls for a changed and more flexible standard of review that would correspondingly vary according to the type of measure, or policy under examination, i.e. in the author's words, `a non-deferential standard of review when examining domestic measures'. He concludes that `this new standard of review would significantly enhance the WTO dispute settlement system, thereby developing and strengthening the WTO and the international trading system'.<br /><br />For international lawyers and scholars in the field of international relations and economic law, including those with a special interest in the workings of the WTO and international organizations generally, this book is quite a find.<br /><br />Andrew Stoler -- formerly the Deputy Director General of the WTO and Executive Director, Institute for International Trade -- has called this `an important book' which, 'should be considered to be on the required reading list of anyone professionally involved in dispute settlement at the WTO'.<br /><br />Within its 250 or so pages, this excellent monograph encapsulates in a single volume at least eight years of the author's research.  If you are doing research of your own in this wide ranging area, this book's fourteen page bibliography alone will prove absolutely invaluable. Also, there are extensive tables of cases, legislation, plus a useful list of abbreviations and a detailed index at the back.  The publication date is 2012.of anyone professionally involved in dispute settlement at the WTO'.<br /><br />Within its 250 or so pages, this excellent monograph encapsulates in a single volume at least eight years of the author's research.

B000FC13Y0|5.0|Long ago, in the time when Queen Victoria still sat on the throne, in an England where magic was still accessible, Tristran Thorn, our protagonist, made a promise. What promise did he make? Why to bring back a fallen star to the absolutely dreadful woman that he thinks he loves. So now Tristran must leave the village of Wall and enter the lands of Faerie. These are lands where magic still reigns strongly. It is a land of unicorns, dwarves, goblin press-gangs engaged in endless subterranean wars, and all sorts of magical creatures. It is a land where large wooden ship sails the skies, searching for lightning bolts and where sylvan wood nymphs that have been enchanted into trees offer sage counsel, where mischievous faeries will steal your Bowler hat without a second thought, and where Tristran Thorn is not the only one searching for the fallen star. While Tristran races to find the star, others too are off to find the fallen star. Ancient witches, survivors of a drowned world, search for the fallen star to use in their potions which will then restore their youth. Entwined with this search, the living and dead scions of a king look for a stone that will guarantee their rule over the lands of Faerie.  But who will find the fallen star first?<br /><br />In this short, magical fairy tale, written in a charming Victorian style, Neil Gaiman has created a spellbinding story set in a well constructed world full of wonders. It is intelligently written, quick paced, and a genuinely fun read. I only wish it were longer so that I could inhabit that world a bit longer.

B007SGM084|4.0|Great trilogy,<br />I enjoyed all three books.  They were a quick read.  Yes, the sexual content is explicite, but i did not feel it was too intense or degrating.  Each book contained it's own (nonsexual) drama that kept me wanting to read more.  It made me reflect on my own sex life, reflection is always a good thing.
B008602KQI|3.0|Like I'm sure most out there,I saw the movie before reading the book. When I first saw the movie in theaters I loved every moment of it. But afterwards I went and read the book and realized how much of the movie was not only changed but missing. I felt that too much was changed around or not played out at all. The movie over all if not basing it off the book in itself is good.

B00338QENI|3.0|This book discussed several topics that I found very interesting.  I enjoyed the ethical questions it raised regarding the use of human cells in research.  It was also fascinating to learn of the experiments done on human subjects in the not so distant past without their knowledge or approval.  Many of the medical breakthroughs we've had over the last few decades is due in part to the research performed on these people. We can also thank them for the HIPPA, medical consent and privacy laws. I wished the book went into more detail on these subjects.  Where it lost my interest was with the lengthy discussion of Henrietta's husband, children and grandchildren.  Yes, its a shame that she died so young and they certainly would've been better off if she had lived. Frankly, I just didn't care about their incarcerations, weight problems, mental illness etc.
0062060562|2.0|\\"Before I Go to Sleep\\". What can I say about it? To put it simply, I feel like I over paid for the first 300 pages, but the last 58 almost make up for that.<br /><br />  The start of the book is slow, but I expected that with a book that was about a woman with amnesia. However as the book progressed and she progressed, I thought it would speed up and get more exciting, more thrilling but it didn't. It was like watching two boring middle aged English people live their boring lives. It made me say, \\"How do English people get on with their days if they're this lame.\\" Then they turn on a crazy dime! The last 58 pages is like the last 30 minutes of a Lifetime movie! Christine is piecing things together and thinking everything is going alright when really it's all about to come crashing down.<br /><br />  Overall, I think the book is okay. I'm not mad I spent precious time reading it, but I'm not happy either. I suggest getting the book cheap and save it for when you have absolutely nothing else to do. Like before you go to sleep.

B005LAII08|4.0|I went into this movie with very high expectations, because I am a huge Pixar fan.  From the trailers, it appeared to be about Merida and possibly other clan members, on the hunt to slay an evil beast and save their people.  The movie started out great, with the competition, a lot of laughs, introducing the characters, and an all around great time.  Still, I was waiting for those glorious bow and arrow scenes that the trailers and posters had constantly teased.  I was waiting for Merida to ride around on her horse and go into battle.  Essentially, due to the trailers, I was expecting a Mulan sort of movie.<br /><br />When we get to the part of the movie where Merida meets the witch and things start ramping up, I was thinking, \\"oh great this is going to get really fun.\\"  Still, I saw no sign of that happening.  Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed the mother and daughter scenes and thought they were touching.  Once the mother was a bear, it was endearing, cute, and playful to watch the bear and Merida together.<br /><br />Then, suddenly the movie seemed to end, and still there was no battle, no rush of adrenaline on the scale that I had expected, and nothing to make me cheer out loud for the protagonists.  Basically, I didn't have the fun rush of previous Pixar movies that I had come to expect.  Having said that, I still give the movie 4 out of 5 stars, because it looked gorgeous, the voice acting was top notch, and the story did touch my heart.<br /><br />To sum it all up, if you watch Brave for combat, whether it's single person or on a grander scale, it won't live up to what you are expecting.  However if you go into it with the mindset that it's going to be a princess fairy tale and a bonding movie, you will relate to it and love it.<br /><br />(This is my first ever movie review on Amazon, so let me know what you think. :)  )

0375842209|5.0|What can I say about The Book Thief? Hmm... The Book Thief. Well the truth is I can say a lot of things about The Book Thief because this novel is the most beautifully written but tragic, most heart warming but provoking, kind but beyond cruel book I have ever read. And that's why I love it. I must say I love sad books; ones that really strip you down so you become just a puddle of tears on the floor. It really brings an answer to why I have read Anne Frank, The Boy in the Striped Pijamas, Private Peaceful, Unbroken etc. but The Book Thief is beyond my favorite.<br /><br />First off I love the language in this novel. Markus Zusak is a beautiful writer who told his story through Death. He took his words which contained so much intricacy, quirk but depth and planted them into the soul of such a prominent character in the times of WW2. Zusak allows such detail and personality into Deaths words that no human could achieve. I found that the second time I read this book - I knew the story-  I put all my focus into the words. It took me double the time it took to first read the book because of how much thought you can put into each point. Every word seems to have two meanings which are impossible to ignore. So you grasp each word and hold on for the journey.<br /><br />Secondly, the story of the novel is so dark and cruel it sounds like Liesel (the main character) is in a survival story. It's not that she's sick- she was abandoned, her brother died and she never knew her father. Who could take that emotional roller coaster? Well the truth is her story get's worse before it gets better. But, before I turn you off this book, I'd like you to know it's the brief moments in the middle- whether Rudy is asking for a kiss or Liesel is stealing a book from the Mayor's house- you can't help but laugh at these happy moments but as Death tells you it won't last long...<br /><br />Lastly, this book to me was very real. Anything that happened in this book either was real or could have been. And that's what brought the most sting in the end: Lot's of people suffered just like Liesel. Many people were starving in their homes just like Liesel, Many people had loved ones die just like Liesel but what many people didn't have was the hope Liesel had and that's what made me love this book the most.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I use pinterest on my regular computer but I like the app better for repinning. It is easy to get a larger image of what you are looking at with out losing your place on the board.
B0009P42S2|3.0|Our family loves Anime but this movie was a bit of a letdown. With all of the Voiceover star power we were expecting better. The story is a bit slow and I hate to say it but we all fell asleep the first time we tried to watch it. We did eventually make it through the whole thing and it is OK so three stars.
B002RI9ZQ8|5.0|I was reccommended this book by a relative.<br />Wow what a great book! I loved it, really gripping, I read it in 2 days and couldn't put it down.<br />Already onto the next installment, where I have already read 45%. I would reccomend it to everyone who likes a thriller
0525953728|5.0|I finished this book in just over a day. I knew I would get an explanation of the Osama Bin Laden mision but what I didn't know is that I would also get a glimpse into the life of an uber elite Seal Team 6 member. I am blown away by the training and commitment these Seals exhibit for the love of their country. On a regular basis they suit up and effectively walk into situations akin to my son's Sony PS3 Call of Duty video games, only for real. Their mission to capture or kill OBL was hisotric, but to them, it was just another day at the office. Like all of their other days at the office, they were more than able to handle any and all contingencies that arose. To me, these are the bravest men on the planet and it is an honor that they represent the U.S.A. Although this book was teased abit for it's politics, the story is really beyond politics. It's just a story of men that love their country and want to get the job done regardless of who's in office, or who benefits politically. They just want the opportunity to do what they do best, Kick Ass.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I have been a fan of Edgar Rice Burroughs' Martian series for many years.  I had waited thoughout many failed attemps to bring John Carter to the screen.  At last Andrew<br />Stanton has acomplished it. I saw it in the theater 3 times and was not disappointed.  I got the DVD when it was released on June 5th, 2012.  I have watched it since many, many times.  It never gets old.  I see new things I missed each time I see it.  I am so fascinated with the CG, how intricate and real it looks, and how it meshes so well with the live action. The story, while a re-telling, is still engaging and keeps the same spirit of the books.  The actors did a wonderful  job.  Watch it for yourself and then judge.<br /><br />\\"John Carter\\" is a good film and deserves to have its sequels (\\"John Carter 2\\" and \\"John Carter 3\\") made to complete the story arc begun by Andrew Stanton. The Facebook group \\"Take Me Back to Barsoom! I Want John Carter to Have a Sequel\\" has initiated a petition to be sent to Alan Horn, Chairman, Walt Disney/Pixar Studios, requesting at least the next sequel. Your help is needed.<br /><br />PLEASE SIGN THE PETITION TO TAKE US BACK TO BARSOOM!!
B0019IMVDG|5.0|This is one my favorite movies of all time. Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci are always great together, and Sharon Stone is one of best actresses of all time.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I started out with the free version to get a feel for the way the app handled beyond what screenshots could reveal. When I saw for myself the slick graphics and not one, but four pages of details as to how much time is available for various functions, I was sold. Kudos to the developer on a very well - designed, not to mention extremely useful, app. (This is one you'll be showing to all your friends &amp; associates.)
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a very good game, but I was thinking, you have an Aether dragon (minecraft mod),but why not an Ender dragon(vanilla minecraft)?
1451648537|5.0|Excellent.  Let you in on the boys/men that built Apple.  Would recommend for anybody to read whether your an Apple fan or not.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I'm just rating this game. so ya. its a pretty fun game. the movie was good. nit was pretty funny , well I think so anyways.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good read, full of twists, keeps you engaged. Only downside, finish not liking any of the characters - not sure who I root for.
B007PVHANM|5.0|I enjoyed this documentary on Bob Marley's life. I learned some new things I didn't know before. The end saddened me.
B007ZBWJXI|5.0|This is a band I have loved since they came into being.  Each member are masterful artists in their own right and this most recent offering does not disappoint.  Chops are there, melodies are there, in fact this CD is as good as anything they did in their heyday.  Worth every penny!
B007Q4Y9I2|5.0|PERSONALLY,I THINK THIS 2 CD SET PLUS DVD-AUDIO DISC HAS THE AUDIO QUALITY AND THE OVERALL PRODUCTION CORRECT.OVERALL,I LIKE THIS PACKAGE INCLUDING THE BONUS MATERIAL/PICTURES/BOOKLET,ETC..BUT FOR ME, NOT HAVING THE ENTIRE--\\"THREE FATES\\"/\\"TANK\\" TRACKS ON THE NEW 2012 STEREO MIX CD NOR ON THE DVD AUDIO DISC AS WELL AS NOT BEING ON THE HIGH RESOLUTION MIXES MAKES THIS COLLECTION INCOMPLETE FOR ME.I'M A REAL ELP FANATIC FROM DAY ONE AND FOR THIS OLD ELP/NICE VETERAN I WISH IT WAS COMPLETE.BUT OVERALL,I'M HAPPY ABOUT THIS RELEASE.
B003DFJW9E|4.0|Steampunk music? I think so. As an author I like to block surrounding noise distractions. My favorite contemporary tunes hijack my imagination by offering another distraction altogether. So my happy medium... soundtrack music. As it would in the movie, it evokes emotion without overpowering the scene. Likewise I enjoy this soundtrack because it helps keep my thoughts in a nineteenth century frame of reference. Hanz Zimmer is a new favorite of mine. His action packed pace drive my fingers across the keys with purpose without tainting the results as I write the sequel to[[ASIN:B006YBHF8E Voices Amongst the Aether]] and [[ASIN:B005NWH9SQ Adventures Above the Aether]]
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I made the mistake by \\"taking a chance\\" on this product after reading other reviews. I am warning you! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT. BATTERY DID NOT CHARGE NEITHER DID IT MOUSE CONNECT TO MY COMPUTER. Stay far far away from this product!
B008F5YDRI|4.0|I liked it! Cute and funny comedy. It was romantic and clever. The acting was great, the topic was unusual. I enjoyed it. Good chick flick. Only of a smarter kind.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The 3rd of the Hunger Game books; started out great however the middle was a bit drawn out. The ending was good though!!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Really fun and challenging game. Highly recommended! The variations are original, stimulating and intuitive with a nice UI. Thank you!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing continuation of the Hunger Games. My 12 year old and I were reading at the same time and we both loved it!!
B00899EOIS|5.0|Murder Mystery, Suspense, Action, Fear, Fashion (yes, Fashion), and loyalty among friends ... all have me completely hooked on this show! Can't wait for the next season! :)
B00000J9HE|2.0|Okay, first off the performances are excellent but soncially this is terrible. It sounds gritty and unfocused. I was hoping for something better. In the 21st century this should be engineered to sound good. I think it's time for DG to redo this again.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I have really enjoyed Pinterest.  But on my kindle fire at times it will not open and at times it forces closed. I get very frustrated and I hope you will be able to fix this.
1878424750|5.0|I loved listening to this audio book. I also recommended it to my other friends and family as well. This guy is a genius and the quality of the CDs were great as well.
B00846REIS|5.0|I was skeptical, coming off my 50 Shades of Grey kick. Oh. My. Gosh. I have to say, if you liked 50 Shades, you'll LOVE Bared to You. I was instantly hooked on Gideon. Both he, and Eva, have baggage, it's a wonder they work! Make sure to start this book on a weekend, because you will not put it down! I only wish I didn't have to til October for the next one! Can't wait!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love love love this book! It is my favorite in the series. I am obsessed with reading this series. Enjoy!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I so love this game! Play it with friends! Just wish that you could cook so much of each dish to get your prize like on cafe world on fb..and friends can help you cook food to get your free dish or prizes..instead of cooking so much and finding hidden things..either way I still love it..just be nice!
B008CPZNL6|5.0|Flipboard is beautiful, immersive, and it hides how slow the Kindle Fire actually is. In Kindle Fire, even scrolling down my long list of apps and books lags, but Flipboard is the opposite. I can take two fingers and just go through all content without lag. It's amazing. New Favorote.
B008IEFP1E|1.0|Great album except for.... why do artists choose to write songs with such foul language?  Do they think it makes the songs better?  As a customer, I should have paid better attention to what I was getting.  Next time Maroon 5 make an album that isn't so foul.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded it for my 3yr old son and I ended up taking it over because its so fun. Easy enough for a kid to play but fun enough to keep an adult on it for hours. I normally get bored pretty fast with these types of games but not this one. There is also a mini game in addition to the villiage where you can win the coins or acorns or animals you need. I definitely recommend it!
B000EHSVSC|5.0|Purchased for my son - who is interested in anything about planes, pilots, war series and bravery .  And this movie just fitted the bill.  Given as a surprise gift, and he loved it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This series is one of the best reads I've had in years, and I almost devour books.  It is an unuslal love story, but be prepared for the exotic and erotic.  In my case I needed some internet searches to understand the story fully.  I'm now re-reading these books for a better understanding.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|At this point I am still reading this novel but I am fully engaged. I love that King has captured the feel of late 50's early 60's. The people, their attitudes, the towns and cities with booming growth just on the horizon. Technology not yet for the masses shows just how far we have come in that reality. As for the story itself, time travel is a subject that often times is difficult to follow but Mr. King brings us cautiously through the usual pitfalls of traveling back and forth. For this reason it gets all 5 stars.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Packed with action. I was litarally addicted to it. The story is cleverly said that i can never guess what will happen next, i ussually can guess.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Learns as you go. Great for fast typers who rely on auto correct. Try the trial and you'll see what I mean. 5 stars all day
B000FC1LOC|3.0|I liked how the story was told from all the characters points of view.  I didn't like that the story built and built and then just like that it was over.
B007TMON8M|5.0|This genre of game is one of my personal favorites, and this game certainly delivers! Check out his other games as well, they're awesome. Great, simple interface and clever level design!
B008XG1X18|4.0|nice to be able to access Pinterest on Aneroid!  Ive been waiting for this for a while. very nice job
B008Y212PI|5.0|Creative and challenging.  Fun for all ages. I would recommend to any one who enjoys puzzle games. I rate this game a 5
B008OM0M4U|3.0|This film is typically silly,stupid Sasha B. Cohen stuff. There's a few laugh out loud moments, a little more nudity from the harem girls would've been nice.
B0081KTI0E|5.0|I think that this movie is freaking AWESOME!!!!!! i was able to scare my whole family and when i received my order everything was in great shape.
B008XG1X18|3.0|Love Pinerest but it often crashes on my Kindle.  I have even off loaded some apps, data, etc in hopes of improvement but it did not help.  It takes patience but since I am a Pinterest addict it is okay.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this site is so addiciting on the computer, your just adding to my addicition, being able to put it on my kindle lol.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great games for passing time. some games are easy while others take some skill.  can pass a lot of time playing.
098478280X|5.0|Every chapter of this book is going to help you excel in your interview.<br />It is a very concise book. You skip all the weed that you find in the typical Algorithm Design books, while keeping the parts that you do need for a technical interview.<br />Plenty of examples and solutions, all well explained step by step.<br /><br />The first chapters are also very helpful in guiding you through the actual interview process and calm you down about what to expect.<br />I specially liked the \\"A Microsoft interview\\" \\"A Google Interview\\"... chapters. They cover the style that you will face in any of the major tech companies.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone interviewing for a tech position.
B008BM9L72|1.0|Thinking of seeing what all the hype is about?  Don't bother if you've read more than one book in your life and know the difference between excruciatingly repetitive trash and decent literature because these books will annoy the grey out of you.  Really boring and deeply offensive garbage about submission.  What happened to women's liberation girls?  Do we really fantasize about returning to the bad old days of being owned by someone else and told what to eat, wear, do, not do, etc?  I certainly don't. The only good thing about it was the Audi and the silly bint didn't even want to take it.  Blah Blah look at your hands, bite your lip and eat your food...don't you know people are starving?  Try Pride and Prejudice instead....now THAT is a good read!
B000FCKGPC|4.0|The story was slowing down much and finally seems not to move at all. Martin has not lost his abilities. The main characters still develope in an interesting and credible way. Yet somehow without time moving around them.<br /><br />The more I think about it the more I come to the sad conclusion that the story cannot go on. Winter will not come because it can't.<br /><br />The flaw lays in the very beginning of the first book. What I nice idea to create a world were summers and winters are not bound to their proper places within one year. A place with summer children who never see winter during their childhood. It was the implication of cruel winter of equal length which made the Others what they are: a looming menance, something you cannot avoid or hide from during a couple of chilly month in order to survive. You want to survive such a winter - you have to face and overcome the Others.<br /><br />But if you try to go into details of that winters you soon realize that it needs no Others to ruin Westron. This world is so closely related to our middle ages that it never had any chance surviving winters like this. The agriculture , the society, the towns, farms, inns, transportation everything seems somehow familiar. But such a world has no ability to survive years of snow covered frost. The seven kingdoms would go extinct on a regular basis non peace of any king could prevent that.<br /><br />Martin in not Tolkien. He invested all his creativity in interesting, fascinating characters. I love him for that. But he did not put equal consequence in creating a society that has the ability to survice 5 years without a harvest and without means of transportation in the blasting winter storms. Such a world simply could not be organised and look like our middle ages.<br /><br />And now he feels it. Winter simply cannot start, the story cannot progress. Winter will not come.<br /><br />Wolfgang
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This DVD is very good quality and the subtitles are very accurate. I really love this movie!! I saw it in theaters and enjoyed it so i bought it for my brothers birthday since he hadnt seen it before. He was very intriguied by the movie and payed a lot of attention to it.
0525953728|5.0|What a Wonderful Feat of Arms !  Mark Owen (not his real name) provides an exciting recount of the covert mission known as Operation Neptune Spear that killed Osama Bin Laden deep inside Pakistan in the city of Abbottabad and probably more importantly acquired tons of inside information on how al Qaedo operated and their numberous terrorist contacts.  One hundred years from now when Western Christian Civilization looks back at the milestones of its series of tough victories over barbaric terrorism this will be one of the salient events that led to its eventual victory.<br /><br />This book I predict will be the overwhelming best seller of the year.  Why ?  Because of the way it is written. It is written by someone who is patriotic, smart and a person who will not take no for an answer and one who writes a story that is sincere, determined, willful but not boastful.  It is a story told in a matter of fact way of someone who has no hubris but does have a ton of confidence in his ability and his team's ability to go into the most dangerous situations and get the job done that needs to be done in order to protect American citizens and citizens of the civilized world.<br /><br />I received this book a couple of days ago and read it in two sittings.  It was gripping and suspenseful.  It starts off with Mark Owen competing to be a Seal and the difficulty it took to make the team. He almost didn't make it but through luck, hard work and perserverance he makes it.  The SEAL requirements are physically and mentally daunting and few can pass the high standards.  The Seals only want the best and people they can count on to perform under extreme duress in the worst circumstances.  He is a perfectionist and a type A individual who grew up in Alaska with a love of the outdoors and hunting.  His father taught him gun safety and patriotism.  He also taught his son mental toughness and ways to fight extreme cold temperatures in the Alaskan wilderness.  It's the small things you know that can keep you alive when your body wants you to quit and give up.<br /><br />Mark Owen's journey with the SEALs leads him to several deployments with his team to missions in Iraq and also off the Horn of Africa to fight Somalia pirates.  Some missions go smooth and some not so smooth. He gains lessons learned from all of his deployments and builds trust with his SEAL teammates.  They learn to intuitively trust each and they develop a synergy of like minded mission-oriented skill specialists who love what they do and get immense pleasure protecting American lives and fighting and if necessary killing terrorists.<br /><br />By the time he is selected to be part of the SEAL Team that is chosen for the mission to capture or kill Osama bin Laden he is an experienced intuitive \\"old hare\\" SEAL member who knows how to plan and execute well dangerous forays into enemy territory.  If you can imagine a team of technology-wise savvy experienced \\"James Bonds\\" with the latest weapons, communication equipment and night vision googles who work together seamlessly with no big egos you will have some idea of what type of SEAL team we sent over to Pakistan under Operation Neptune Spear.  The key to their series of successes is carefull planning, being physical ready and tremendous amount of training for all conceivable probabilites.  And when things go awry being able to go to other options and improvising.  Failure is not an option with these people.<br /><br />Highest recommendation for this book.  Makes you want to be 21 again and try to become a SEAL.  I have finished this book and just handed it off to my 18 year old son.that can keep you alive when your body wants you to quit and give up.<br /><br />Mark Owen's journey with the SEALs leads him to several deployments with his team to missions in Iraq and also off the Horn of Africa to fight Somalia pirates.

034580404X|5.0|I read all 3 books in the Fifty shades trilogy. It started off as I wanted to see what all the hype was about but found myself getting engrossed in the story line. It is a good series and I could only hope that the author writes another one. The first two were EXCELLENT and the 3rd one seemed a bit rushed but was still a great read! I must say that it does have a Twilight type feel to it, but there is just more about the Fifty Shades that made it great. The story about how two people from opposite ends of the financial world meet and fall in love and how he teaches her the l/s it really good. I would suggest that anyone wanting to read the 1st one buy all 3 books because the author does a wonderful job of making you want more. I myself would like to know more about his side and thoughts. It was written mainly in Ana's voice, but at the end of the 3rd book you get a look at Christian's thoughts and I would be REALLY interested to see more of that. I enjoyed the Trilogy and can only hope that there is more to come!
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Great application! Would recommend to family & friends that like music videos, especially new videos. Tell your friends about this app.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|The characters are totally unbelievable<br />and the author nevers develops a coherent plot relying on moving back and forth from past to present to future to try to tie up all the loose ends of the story. This format gives the author lots of opportunities to weave sexual information into the book. My opinion... Skip this book!
B008VBYN80|4.0|nice town builder with cute graphics. good pacing and not too pushy in their sales. usually there is an in game coin alternative.
B007NESBK2|5.0|I am now in my 50's and remember Sade on the radio in the 80's.  I regularly check Amazon for top selling concerts and read people's reviews.  I ordered the Blu-ray a couple of weeks ago and got a chance to watch it last night.  I was totally blown away by her mesmerizing performance and the music.  This is now my top rated concert dvd.
B003G4W49C|4.0|I have kids, so this was a bit unrealistic for me.  It's hard to believe 6 year olds, even ones that are geniuses, would have the kinds of thought processes these kids did.  And I'm not super into military tactics, so I had a hard time with all of that.  But I do enjoy and applaud creativity, and that abounds in this story.  I didn't know there was a movie being made about it until I had finished the book.  I think they will probably have to change a ton to make it fit the screen, but I will be looking forward to it anyway.
B00782O7NE|4.0|I have always had a love for silent film.  I watched this movie after all the praise and awards.  I'd set that aside and was simply awed at the talent seen on screen.  The charisma of the actors, the humor and the truly touching moments.  I was whisked back in time.  I would put this up there with all the greats of the genre.  A true love story to the silent films.  And, hopefully one that will inspire others to appreciate classics from our past.  And, there are some truly brilliant films that ever fan of movies should watch.  The soundtrack to the film is perfect.  My only criticism, despite her fine performance, is that Berenice just doesn't look like she is from that time period.  She has a very modern appearance, which sometimes took me out of the movie.  However, that said, I'd highly recommend this film.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|hay gurlllllllll hey this game is like tots wasting my tiiiiiiiiiime. like i gots betta things tings ta doooooo then tis tots werido gammmmmmme
B006OOHYIC|5.0|most of the games i try get deleted after playing a few times.  Quell is a puzzler with no stress of a timer or the frustration of impossible solutions.  I know I will complete the levels and want more.

B0055SWM08|4.0|I like this game because it makes me think. I feel as though it's a great brain trainer. I'm using parts of my brain I haven't used in ages. Great levels. Great game. Just got the second part haven't played it yet so I'm looking forward to playing the new Quell.
B003PPDBQ2|4.0|I read this as the question whether death from suicide was accidential or murder or something else is one that appears to happen a lot.<br />So I started the book and it kept me interested with twists and turns.<br />An easy read.  The common discovery of lives that family did not know about, the inner workings<br />of the mind.<br />I liked the book.  A book linking bonds and sisterhood that starts and ends beyond life and death.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I am not finished reading yet, but it's keeping my attention, good characters, story line and interesting. Worth a read. David normally does not disappoint.
B008VBYN80|4.0|Great game, it's a bit slow going, fun,  and compared to other games of it's nature, like farm vill or tiny tower it's just as addictive. Since it is a slower paces game it's great to play on brakes at work or while your watching TV.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved it.  Worth the read.  Didn't want to put the book down,  if you like a twisted suspense, then I recommend this book for you.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a good game for lots of fairly mindless fun.  challenging enough so you have to plan but not so challenging that you get frustrated.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Probably one of the most exciting seasons yet can't wait for the next one. Seasons 4 and 5 kind of lost me for a bit but season 6 delivers big time!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This app is the most entertaining app you will ever find in your entire life. They are not just puzzles, they have the most awesome magic twist to the puzzles to make it more amazing than it already is! I recomend this app for people of all ages. The best part is, It is 100% FREE! Get this app for FREE right now. You'll love it, and I'll be able to say: I knew it!
B0086700CM|3.0|It was fun for a while, but it didn't take long to collect all I was going to collect and achieve all I was going to achieve. After that it was just monotonous.
B008P1EWIM|2.0|I just like it when I find an app that I love but is not free. It happens all the time and I just cant stand it anymore. I am better off watching it on T.V. for free even with the commercials! Because the creaters of this app ruined me by making it 99&cent;!
B004SUWR2C|4.0|HAVE GREAT FUN PLAYING IT, NICE COLORS<br /><br />WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A SAVE GAME FOR LATER, SOMETIMES GETS TOO LONG TO PLAY<br />AND WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE ANOTHER TIME
B008VBYN80|4.0|over all not bad only played for 15 mins little slow on reactions but will need real money to really enjoy it
B003L77GG0|5.0|On my Son's Wish List so I imagine that he liked it. He now has all but #8 and #9. Thanks
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app was just what I needed, a basic calculator at my fingertips. I love that I can access the history of my calculations.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn has written a page-turner!  A few years ago I read \\"Evil Genes' by Barbara Oakley.  This book discusses the neurobiology of personality disorders. Gillian Flynn provides an absorbing and thought provoking story of how a person with an undiagnosed personality disorder spins her web of deceit and evil.  Chilling!
B00637TV1I|5.0|I mean I actually paid for music, can't say I've done that in years. Says something.  Also the Jezabels are perfect.
B002K0WBYG|4.0|We first saw this when it came out in the theater and enjoyed it enough to add it to our dvd collection.  The movie is full of beautiful scenery in Alaska and equally full of akward moments and situations.  It has a fairly plausable plot, good acting (whe knew Sandra Bullock could be funny?), and it's about the right length.  If you're looking for something light at which you'll laugh occasionally, I think this may be a winner.
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is so similar to Fifty Shades of Grey. so if u loved 50 you will love this! The stories are very similar but I loved them both equally.
B004WCTLNY|4.0|I thought this movie was pretty interesting.  Is it a blockbuster hit with flawless writing and acting?  No.  But I was pretty entertained by it.  Plot is interesting, acting isn't bad, and there's just enough action to keep action junkies fairly interested.  It's a decent way to spend the time.
1455502758|5.0|I remember growing up there was a program called \\"scared straight\\".  The premise was simple, they took troubled youths and took them to prison to interact with some very hard criminals and this was supposed to make them straighten out.<br />In the same vain, Christopher Hitchens does the same thing in his last book, Mortality.  It chronicles his battle with throat cancer and how he keeps fighting until the end. I saw Hitchens at a book talk on one of his lecture tours and he was tough and bright guy, a true man's man.<br />For those who bitch about life, continually complain or even when you feel bad about yourself, these words will make you take a second look and feel blessed that you are healthy and in control of your body.  One statement that strikes a chord with me is that Hitchens discovered he did not have a body, he was his body. How even his ability to write was slowly being taken away from him and he not only did write to live but lived to write.<br />Dynamite comes in small packages and this book has quite a punch and will force you to pause and acknowledge your own mortality.  This should be required reading for all.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|I bought this movie at my wifes urging.  She told me about the concept (someone born old and getting younger over a lifetime and dying as a baby) and said, from the parts of the movie shes seen, she thought it was a wonderful movie.  I found it mind numbingly boring.  Somehow, they managed to turn a short story (as originally written) into a slow, plodding movie that drones on for about three hours.  I understand that it was up for a bizillion awards and so on. . . good for them.  I thought the second dvd with the \\"how they did stuff\\" was FAR more interesting than the movie.  I think most guys would feel the same way I do about it - a real cure for insomnia.  The wife LOVED it though.  By the way . . . I gave it 3 stars BECAUSE the wife loved it.  Had it been only MY opinion, it would have gotten less than one (if that were possible).
B000QCS8TW|5.0|A terrific series with complex characters that have outcomes that aren't just standard 'hero endings'.  Great diversity of lives from different perspectives.  Reading the series for the 2nd time.
B000LPS4BG|4.0|This movie is NOT for kids because of the language and graphic situations.  I have enjoyed this movie every time it's come on tv and finally sprung to buy it.  I think the acting is very good and the plot (having been an \\"observer\\" growing up out east) is probably pretty realistic (of course \\"jacked up\\" and embellished for the big screen). As in many other movies he's been in, I though Joe Pesci stole most of the scenes he's in but I'm a Joe Pesci fan too, so I may be a little prejudiced.  Personally, I like this movie but, again, the subject matter and language don't offend me as they may some.
B007SGM084|5.0|This book was a fun read.  I can not wait to see if they make this a movie.  Fifty is a must read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|These books are very addicting. Fastest I have ever read a book. Very funny, I laughed a lot. This book was the best of all three in my opinion.
B00846REIS|4.0|The book started off a little slow for me but ended up being a great read.  I would definitely recommend it.
B005LAIGZU|5.0|What can I say about a military action movie that uses active duty Navy Seals except the best movie I have ever seen. If you have questions about how the military executes certain aspects of there job this explains it all. From rescue missions to Recon work. The acting portrays what lives really are like for the special unit operators,\\"Navy Seals\\". I ordered this movie when it first came out then got a blue ray and I bought the movie again in blue ray and I am so glad I did it's even more amazing then the regular dvd  which was extreamely good in the first place.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|great app. it will keep me entertained for days. excellent brain worker. you will put it down to go to bed but then rush back for one more!
B008602KQI|5.0|What can I say about Hunger Games that everyone doesn't already know.<br />If I might have some insight it might be that this is a movie about being able to hold onto your morality while defending yourself against enemies that cannot be redeemed. If it was up to Katniss, no one would have died, but it was not possible. The circumstances allowed her to save only two, but not without risking her own life to do even that!<br />What an awesome movie!!
1439170916|1.0|The book is laden with heaps of unnecessary historical facts, poorly edited (as you will find yourself reading story about some patient then about another, then back).  It turns out that I am not the intended audience for the book, it doesn't seem to add value to general public, more for researchers.
B003KLGKAA|2.0|This review is for the first episode (\\"Voyage of the Damned\\") of season one.  It was absolutely THE WORST episode of Doctor Who ever.  I love Doctor Who.  I love David Tennant.  I hated this episode with a burning passion.  We went from one of the best written, most creative, and best acted episodes yet (the season 3, 3 part closer) to the absolute *worst.*  \\"Voyage of the Damned\\" was poorly written, dreadfully cliche, heavy handed, juvenile, hackneyed, and just overall crap.  Judging from the rest of the reviews raving about Seasons Four (incidently, why are all the reviews for this episode reviews of the *entire season*?), things promise to pick up, but if it's more of the same, I'm going to be very, very annoyed and sad.
034580404X|5.0|this trilogy was exciting,captivating,action packed,comical,and a love story all in one. This author has an extraordinary imagination. If this is her 1st try at writing i cant wait to see what she has next. I am very satisfied with my purchase.
0618001905|5.0|This is a stunning history of the Congo immortalized in Conrad's HEART OF DARKNESS.  Conrad once said that the conquest of the earth is not a pretty story.  True enough, as this unflinching portrait of the conquest of the Congo makes clear.  King Leopold was surely one of the great sociopaths of all time, cruel beyond measure, and utterly indifferent to human suffering.  Conrad's fictional Kurtz is saintly in comparison.
B002CAWNEM|1.0|Watered down 'Fatal Attraction' that Beyonce took the term 'overacting' to new heights, an ounce of a star goes to a fighting scene involving two of the movie's main characters which was the best thing about the whole movie, the rest of the movie was meh.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie portrays values such as love, friendship, childhood innocence, and imagination that can remind you of your youth.  Beautifully performed music draws you into the story and you can easily imagine flying to the ceiling with Peter Pan!  An all-around heartfelt movie that I would recommend to anyone with a hunger for adventure.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love the many varied sounds and ambiences this melody maker is capable of creating. I've found some to be my favorite melodies for my many various moods. I like to listen to the different melodies in the daytime as well as for sleep. I like the background melodies when I'm reading or doing other things.
B0089BSOPA|1.0|This is absolutely one of the worst sequels ever. Now I absolutely love Halloween. I was so hyped for the sequel and after I saw it I wanted my money back. Jamie Lee Curtis wearing a really bad wig. The acting is horrible. Curtis conviently can't scream for help until workers are out of ear shot, then she screams bloody murder. The story is even worse. Some nurse figures it all out. Donald Pleasance repeats the same lines over and over. Every kid in the movie wears the same Halloween mask as the killer. I didn't know the mask was so popular. I can pick any point in this movie and absolutely kill it. Of all the many Halloweens THIS IS THE WORST ONE, and that's say alot!!!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|Thank you very much.  Received it in a record time and it works wonderfully.
0525953728|5.0|I'm ordering this now after reading a bit of a copy my friend owns. From all the news surrounding the author I must advise anyone even partly interested in a much more truthful version of how Bin Laden was taken out should get the book now. The White House used their heavily modified version of the 'truth' and even went so far to make a few documentaries all as advertisement for the current president because it's his only high-point in his term. DOD is going after the author and the books might very well be recalled and burned. Getting me a hardback copy for safe keeping after I read the whole thing through a few times.
0985114606|2.0|Granted, Bared to You is much better written than 50 Shades, but that's where the differences end. Just like in 50 Shades Eva, like Ana, drools over Gideon's (Christian) Apolo-like good looks throughout the entirety of the book and basically does nothing else. Also, when Eva is not off running away somewhere, she's constantly hounding Gideon for sex at the most inopportune times--sure, I'm going to ask for sex after my BF has had a nightmare or after he attempts to rape me.<br /><br />At a certain point, all the sex in Bared to You just gets old and tiresome, and I found myself skipping through these parts to try to find some substance or a smidge of a plot line. As I did with 50 Shades, I will not be reading the other two books.

014241493X|3.0|Paper Tows is on the Junior year reading list for our local high school.  My 16 yr. old daughter started it and could not put it down. She read it in 2 days at the most. She LOVED it, raved about it, told my entire family to read it. I was intrigued as she was right about Lois Lowry's The Giver back in 7th grade.<br />The novel started out great, and I was hooked.  I had visions in my head of a later day Holden Caulfield, and I loved references to Moby Dick, Shakespeare and other connections to literacy from generation's past.  The author was great at grabbing my attention early on, taking us on a wild ride one night, just before high school graduation.  Margo and Q (Quentin) head out in the middle of the night to do nasty deeds to others, to seek revenge!  Nothing is done that can't be righted, no one is irrevocably harmed, but the mischief created had me howling out loud.  And then?  Margo disappears. I felt from the beginning that she was a troubled girl, disturbed to some degree. My daughter disagrees and thinks Margo just didn't want to live a phony life in a town filled with phony people.<br />THe next 1/4 of the book dragged on for me.  Took me weeks to get through, and I am normally a very quick reader who doesn't stop if a book is good.  I wanted to finish, so I could discuss the book with my daughter, to learn what makes her tick, that she would love it so much.  So i persevered.  And then the last 1/4 of the book was upon me and I GOT IT!  Q and his school chums set out on a wild trip in a minivan, which they deem their home, in search of Margo, who has left clues in mysterious ways and places.  They travel several thousand miles, nearly meet their demise when a cow or two are stopped in the middle of the road, but carry on with their hilarious adventure until the ending, which was though provoking.  Again, my lovely child and I differed on our interpretation of the ending. She is probably right. She is a deep reader, often sees things far below the surface.<br />I didn't love the book, can't rave about it, but I am not a teenager, so I am not the target audience.<br />The book is clever, a bit racy and does let anyone who ventures inside get a good grip on how kids think today, and how loyal they can be to those they love.  Good book, not great, but this is me speaking, not my daughter.ce.<br />I didn't love the book, can't rave about it, but I am not a teenager, so I am not the target audience.<br />The book is clever, a bit racy and does let anyone who ventures inside get a good grip on how kids think today, and how loyal they can be to those they love.

B0014BY72Q|4.0|While verry low budget this film shows a truley interesting future in witch you can actualy can have any thing you wish, sex drugs,and confortable living,no work you just get whatever you want. But with limited suplies in a perfect world you the only thing you can't have is your 31st birthday. A truley brilliant concept with intelegent plot and a point of view verry relivent today. the special effects are verry primitive,and a bit of a let down even by the standards of the time.
B003O86FMW|3.0|I loved books 1 and 2.  By the time I got to this final one, I was somewhat disappointed. The story  seemed to drag on forever, then in the end it wrapped up so quickly i felt bewildered.
B008XFAT7S|5.0|The Raid: Redemption is an action/martial-arts film that follows a SWAT team's raid on a crime lord's impenetrable apartment building. It has some side plots, as well, but I'd rather not spoil it. Although it's a bit simple, the real reason to watch this film is for the non-stop action. The action sequences consists of stylish shootouts, violent machete/knife battles, and lightning-fast martial arts that rivals films like Ip Man (and many other modern martial arts films.) There are also plenty of tense scenes where they have to hide from and dodge multiple thugs, as well. This gives the audience a lot of variety and keeps us at the edge of our seats. Iko Uwais, as Rama, was great and I look forward to seeing more of him. I also like the camera angles this film uses because they're very stylish (I enjoyed the slow-motion in this movie) and engaging. Also, the pacing was very fast and it was over before I knew it.<br /><br />Overall, The Raid: Redemption has a simple story, jaw-dropping action sequences, great acting, and great direction. I highly recommend this film, especially at the current $1.99 price (as of 9/8/12). Action fans will not be disappointed.<br /><br />The Raid: Redemption has extreme violence and blood. No sex or nudity.
0143119680|5.0|I have read this book twice.  The first time I was really impatient and was just interested in the plot - I admit, my attention span is not what it used to be.  However, now that the second book came out, I decided to reread this one and it was a completely different experience.  Since I remembered the plot, I was free to enjoy the wonderful writing and the developing relationship between Diana and Matthew.  I disagree with the reviewers who felt that Diana was depicted to be childlike and Matthew a control freak.  Anyone who has had their universe turned upside down would be fearful and needing help and support.  But Diana showed courage and spunk, and as this story develops, I'm confident that she will come into her own and that Matthew will exert his will only when faced with extreme danger. But considering how Diana dealt with Juliette (a very dangerous vampire), I'm sure she is not going to be a shrinking damsel in distress.  I can't wait for the second book to arrive and am confident it will be as wonderful as the this one.
1468179993|5.0|Have you read a book that you wished that you had written yourself? My colleague Jeremy Donovan has done just that.<br /><br />Jeremy is the author of \\"How to Deliver a TED Talk, Secrets of the World's Most Inspiring Presentations\\".  His book although unassuming in size is an insightful perspective from a well-respected speaker and speaker coach.<br /><br />As I read Jeremy's book I was impressed with the depth of knowledge that he has shared for anyone who not only wants to deliver a TED Talk but also for those who want to deliver any format of a compelling presentation.<br /><br />The strength of \\"How to Deliver a TED Talk\\" is in the examples. As Jeremy describes technique he gives examples from some of the most inspiring TED Talks.<br />With good introspection he picks up on subtle nuances that make the difference between a good talk and an excellent one.<br /><br />In one example Malcolm Gladwell's spaghetti sauce speech is used to guide the reader to use stories to illuminate presentations. Jeremy describes the difference between showing and telling (there is a big difference). This is how excellent presenters keep you captivated and others fall flat.<br /><br />Jeremy also uses Brene Brown's powerful and thought provoking presentation as an example of a strong conclusion.  Brown uses three transitional phrases to mark her conclusion. Jeremy identifies them and demonstrates the impact that these phrases have. He also teases apart her delivery method of using pauses for emphasis with her concluding words and highlights her use of questions to raise the level of tension.<br /><br />One of the best pieces of advice given is at the conclusion of Jeremy's book where he encourages speakers to get out and speak. To become a confident public speaker is in the doing not in the reading. Which is why if you want to give a TED talk or any other kind of presentation you should read Jeremy's book, use his insight to construct your foundation, and then get out there and practice.<br /><br />*I was given a copy of this book for the purpose of providing a book review.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|This is awesome. Not only do you get Pride and Prejudice on DVD, you also get a bluray disk and a voucher to redeem a digital copy of the movie. And at such a low price?! You bet! Now I can carry this movie with me anywhere I go and I couldn't be happier!
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Segundo libro que leo del autor, me ha gustado tanto como \\"La Sombra del Viento\\" y me ha dejado con ganas de  seguir leyendo la tercera entrega de la saga del \\"Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados\\", El final es un poco discutible, pero en si todo el libro, es una maravilla!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game it is cute but also fun and great for kids or anyone of any age. I know I love it
B006RUJST6|4.0|This book was an easy read from cover to cover and had a lot to offer that I think anyone can relate to in one way or another. Good character depth and real life situations make this a great story to immerse yourself in and enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I was not sure at first that I wanted to read this book. Now that I have it was very intriguing. I wasn't quite prepared for what I feel is a differnce of opinion with other people regarding the content of this book. You must make your own decision on how you feel about it once you  have read it.
B0019FWIEQ|5.0|Fast paced, fun movie with some twists.  Not too bloody with a bad guy with a good heart.  Highly recommend.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|This is a great time waster game! You have to think through the puzzles some are easy while others require some thought. it was free when I got it but it's worth $0.99.

B001GZ6QEC|5.0|When it comes to superhero movies, I'm not really much of a fan, most of them I find to light and fluffy, but Christopher Nolan's Batman series is totally different, because they are dark, very realistic while still retaining the fictional part obviously, and they aren't filled with stupid comedy like most superhero movies, the plots and dialog are as serious as you can get for superhero movies, lets face it, they aren't meant to be real obviously, but like I said, this series is as real as you can get for the genre.<br /><br />First off, lets start with the acting, because to me, that is the most important thing for me to enjoy a movie, and everybody here delivers excellent performances, of course starting with Christian Bale who of course plays Bruce Wayne/Batman, you can tell he really feels at home playing the character, he knows when to make the right facial expressions and when, also the way he talks, a very good actor anyways, but he really shines in this role, Heath Ledger as Batman's nemesis The Joker, and they could not have picked anybody better to portray him, you can tell like Christian Bale portraying Bruce Wayne that he really took care in making this character likeable (in a bad way) and that he was really into this story and character, his Joker is just menacing, and totally psychotic, I honestly believe that he earned the Academy Award for this, R.I.P., and Gary Oldman returns as Gordon, and if you read the comics, and look at Gary Oldman, he really does look like the character, and I've always liked the way Gary Oldman acts, he usually plays a bad guy, but in this series of course, he plays a good guy, and does a really good job, and Michael Caine plays the butler Alfred, and he really fits the role like he did in Batman Begins, perfect accent, and solid acting, Morgan Freeman of course returns as Lucious Fox, and not much needs to be said about Morgan Freeman, a phenominal actor, and I really like him in this role, it's made for him, and a special shoutout to Aaron Eckhart who plays Harvey Dent/Two-Face, and does a really good job, this was the first movie I'd seen him in, and he really brings life to these characters, and another special shoutout to Eric Roberts, who I always thought was an underrated actor anyways, he plays the mob family boss, and it really works well, just his appearence, and the way he talks, so whoever did the casting for this movie (as well as Batman Begins) does a great job.<br /><br />Now onto the story, now I saw this movie before I ever saw Batman Begins, so when I first saw it, I liked it, I just wasn't crazy about it since I never saw the first one, but then I bought them both recently, and watched Batman Begins first (which I loved) then I watched this, now that I understand where Bruce Wayne came from, amongst other things, I absolutely love this movie now, I guess I just really needed to see the first one, and the story in this one is great, with a few twists and turns, and it really keeps you interested, and just enough action to keep it going, not just action every 5 minutes like a lot of movies today.<br /><br />And I should do a special section on the special effects and set design, Christopher Nolan likes to stay away from a lot of CGI, and I think that's a good idea, so a lot of what you see here, is designed and built, and they did a great job, and you can really tell they took a lot of time is designing all this, from the wonderful shots of Gotham City, to the action sequences, it just looks great, and if you watch the movie on Blu-ray, they look even more stunning, this is a great movie to show off on blu-ray, the detail, the colors, the sets just come to life (looks good on DVD too though).<br /><br />So my final verdict, this movie nails 5/5, I still don't know which one I liked better Batman Begins or this one, I guess it's pretty close for me, now I will have to play the waiting game and wait for The Dark Knight Rises to come out on DVD and Blu-Ray, I don't go to theatres, so hopefully they will have it out on home video by Christmas, which I'm sure that's their plan, I can't wait!
0345529057|1.0|The books are low quality but what do you expect for $20.  However, book 4, A Feast For Crows jumps from page 174 to 831-894; pages 175-238 are completely missing from the book.  I don't care how cheap the books are, if there are pages missing, the books are worth absolutely nothing.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|this game isn't very good. too slow. hope there will be updates soon. it helps pass the time away while at work.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|The story grabbed my interest from the first page. I was able to have a mental picture of each character and the physical surroundings. It painted a vivid picture of the life and times in the South before the Civil War.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|Well, the story continues and more central charactors die.  I've invested dozens of hours in reading this saga and I guess I'll be a sucker and buy the next one too, hoping Martin finally finishes the tale.  But, I'm getting the feeling he'll die too before the plot is resolved.  Or maybe all of the known charactors will just be killed off.<br /><br />I had some technical glitches early on with the Kindle edition.  It didn't want to scroll properly until I hit upon a font size that worked OK.  Not sure what's up with that but some other reviewers had mentioned similar issues.  And, the maps are basically useless as they can't be expanded enough to show anything useful.<br /><br />The big advantage is that in hardcover, this lengthy book would weigh a ton carrying it around and is a breeze on my Kindle or tablet.<br /><br />I bought this for a week-long overseas business trip and it got me back and forth across the Atlantic, even though the myriad of new minor charactors is making my head spin.<br /><br />At this point, I'm wondering who would WANT to sit on the throne in Kings Landing?
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Useless book. Neither style, nor thoughts. Boring, extremely boring.I am so glad  I did not buy it but borrowed from the library. She wrote three of them,I think that one was too many.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I read the book first. It was a quick read bit one that once you put it down, you were anxious to read again. As I read it I pictured a Hallmark movie.  Having just finished the Fifty Shades series, it was welcomed and refreshing!  I saw the movie On Demand TV recently.  They changed some of the events and left things out.  You didn't see the reluctance in the son's approach to a stranger and the strong bound that developed.  There was no boat in the book, except for the event with Victor.  You didn't here about Victor.  He gave the boy something different in the movie then the book.  All in all, I would defintitely recommend this book.

I'd love to know how these girls make such an impression on these men by literaly faling at their feet......I read this book in August I can't wait for October. For the next book to come out. I've encouraged all my friends to read it and they're all impatiently awaiting the release.

B008L1PYQU|3.0|Got the cd on release day. Heard the skip in Flamming Youth it was a bit annoying as with the back cover being blue. But overall the sound is pretty good if you like beefier bass and drums. The extra set of \\"get up, get down\\" was pretty lame as long with the ace solo in Sweet Pain that sounds like it wasnt even recorded for that song. The extra awww in Beth is ok, i kind of wish they would of left everything original and just beef up the sound. With releases like the Kiss box set the booklet is best part of the set.<br /><br />Got the vinyl today after preordering it and amazon ran out. I hear no skip in Flaming Youth but the vinyl sounds damn good but wheres the bonus track of Sweet Pain with the original solo?<br /><br />Overall its good but i doubt this will replace my original version.
B008BM9L72|5.0|This is a must read for any woman, it opens your eyes, to all  kinds<br />of strange sexual kinkery!  Was concerned when my 18 year was reading it<br />but even she enjoyed the novel, it was very well written and shows how<br />what different taste we all have! How does the quote go \\" I wouldn't watch \\"porn\\" but this book<br />is porn and a really good read\\"
B00846REIS|3.0|It was an ok read but there seemed to be too much predictability.  There was no really intense story line.  Girl meets boy and they are physically attracted to one another.  There are best friends and ex's and all of that but the ending seems very predictable.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|awesome organizational app. I'm an analytical person but I want to write a full review.  trust the positive ratings of others in these reviews.

B005FISBTO|5.0|I have enjoyed all of the seasons of Dexter, and this one did not disappoint.  It moves quickly, and keeps you interested, right up to the final, surprise ending.  I would highly recommend this product, and can't wait for season seven.
1451627289|5.0|I am not a fan of horror stories nor am I necessarily a fan of Stephen King.  That is until now!  This book grabbed me from the very first chapter and continued to keep me wrapped up until the very last page.  It is now on my list of best books I've ever read.  The amazing thing about this book is how Stephen King describes the past, one of which I never had the pleasure of living in as I was born in 1971.  The descriptions were so detailed you could almost smell, taste, and feel yourself there.  I was also stricken, by how many of the lessons and consequences of time travel can translate into the decisions that we make in the here and now.  This book had me really philosophizing with myself and much food for thought.  Everything we do, even small things, effect the future of the world and it's inhabitants.  I am almost ready to just turn back to the beginning and start this one all over again.  I would skip many of the boring details in the middle, however.  There are parts, when he is going over every detail of the Oswald's going's on that bored me and I got fidgety, wanting to move on to the \\"good stuff\\"!  The effects of time travel as described by Stephen King were amazingly well thought out and imaginative, and the end was heartbreakingly sweet.  Not at all what I expected from the King!  Loved it loved it loved it!!
B0019IB0II|4.0|Very intelligent book.  Took more concentration than what I have been reading lately, good for my brain! Left me calm and thankful...................
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Purchased based on a very favourable review in 'The Australian', it completely lived up to the crit.  Apart from the interesting complexity of the story, including the multiple view points and differing time frames (don't be put off), the writing is very fine indeed.  I'd thoroughy recommend Gone Girl to any discerning reader.
B008JAGZDE|2.0|Good, if you like raunchy comedies, but not really my cuppa tea. Tons of sex and nudity that isn't necessary... but it's also the whole plot so there would be no plot development without it. Don't like those kinds of movies? Don't watch, you won't enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book was a page turner really hard to put down.a book for all women  will be reading the other two series
B008XG1X18|3.0|I'm so excited they finally made a pinterest app for kindle fire - the moblie app was not as streamlined or easy to view as the full nonlinear site. However they're still working out some issues with this- log on trouble, freezing up, etc.  Hope they resolve them and update this app soon, b/c I love it!
1599218011|2.0|I'm a huge fan of health and wellness books and products, so I was excited when a friend recommended the Crazy, Sexy, Diet.<br />Although I like the idea of the direct nutritional benefits through juicing vegetables (I purchased a high-end juicer), I feel like the diet itself is difficult to maintain as a working mom to two boys. I still juice one or two mornings a week, but I can't say that I've become a vegetarian.<br />Carr's writing style is particularly annoying. The attempt at coming across as your kick-ass cool girlfriend who's just telling it like it is gets old very quickly. It really seemed like she was pushing products  more than anything. In her chapter about beauty products she laments the use of chemical-laden perfumes, yet in another ( though it might have been an online interview) one of her fondest memories is of meeting Oprah and Oprah complimenting her on her perfume.<br />I think if you have nothing but time to devote to yourself, there's a lot to be gained from her point of view.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This whole series was great. I loved it, check out Hunger Games first!<br />Haven't read a book this quick in a long time!
0875847706|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. It was recommended to me by a fellow musician, since she was blown away by it. I read it and was also inspired. That was about 10 years ago. I continue to read once every year or so and have given the book as a gift often.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|There are no military secrets being disclosed, political statements.  There is nothing about SEAL tactics that you have not seen on the Military channel or in any of a dozen other books.<br /><br />There IS however the real story of the death of UBL, and one that contradicts the one told by politicians.<br /><br />90% of the proceeds go to charities for the families who lose special ops' solders in war.<br /><br />The author should be commended for letting America know the real unfiltered story.<br /><br />Many of us lost friends on 9-11, and I wish I had the opportunity to thank the Author for this book.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|I went into \\"The Lorax\\" with stated lowered expectations.  After all, it was going to be difficult to top Despicable Me.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.  I find my four boys (aged 8 to 2) humming or singing the tunes from \\"The Lorax\\" throughout the day.  As avid Amazon Instant Video users, \\"The Lorax\\" is playing on at least one AIV-enabled device (Kindle, Roku, iPad, Xbox, Vizio TV) at any time during the day.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend making \\"The Lorax\\" part of your video library as a go to movie when you need a distraction.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I see what everyone is saying. I can't put it down either. I enjoy it! Quite the thought provoking game.
B000E33W1C|5.0|Because of \\"A Fish Called Wanda\\" I collapsed into laughter whenever I saw anyone walking three dogs. Many years later I still note a dog walker of any gender or quantity and smile. Because of this movie, whenever I walk down an airport concourse and glance out to see a tarmac with equipment, I start to grin. Lord know what Homeland Security reads into this! There are scenes that I fear are etched into my psyche forever. An perfectly trivial apology brings an image of someone dangling out of a window. Sturdy french fries on a plate - well, let's not go there.<br />I was sure I had this, albeit VHS. I AM sure I have it. Somewhere. But a recent down day called for Chicken Soup for the Soul - and \\"A Fish...\\" absolutely fits. Alas!!! I couldn't find it!! It was like not having aspirin in the medicine cabinet. I must buy the DVD. I don't want to get caught without it again.
B008N1LL42|4.0|GOOD ACTION MOVIE , ENTERTAINING AND ENGAGING . NOTHING STELLAR ABOUT THE CAST OR THE PLOT , JUST GOOD MINDLESS ACTION
B008JGSM6G|5.0|my grandson introduced me to this game<br />its lots of fun and helps me relax<br />it is actually a kind of meditation
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|My 11yr old son downloaded this and we both Love it.  I Think I use it more than he does and he uses it alot to double check his homework.  It is one of the best apps we have downloaded on my Kindle Fire. LOVE IT. LOVE IT. LOVE IT.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I recomend this app to any one who is looking for something to do. I loved it!!!!!!It is really cool.
078322947X|5.0|This remarkable, albeit misnamed film, failed to get the critical praise it deserved upon its release in 1977 but more recently seems to have been granted proper status. Fans of this film are no doubt hoping for a better quality re-master with updated audio, especially given the astounding score by Tangerine Dream. Still, as long as this is the best version available, it is a must-have.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great.  User friendly.  only issue is sometimes the ads stay and have to exit program and reopen.  not a big deal though.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books and enjoyed each, the story got better with each book. Kind of made me wish the author could have continued with the series some how. There were a couple of things that I would have changed such as in the first book, Christian could have groomed her a bit more or something. I find it hard to believe that a virgin would want to be caught up in a BDSM lifestyle. Aside from that, it was not too risque for me, but then again I am almost 50. Many of my co-workers that are in their 20's and 30's found some of the propositions in the contract too harsh and could not imagine anything other than vanilla sex. I think it is just something you learn and experiment about more as you get older and therefore I didn't find it all that \\"out there\\" except for the above mentioned virgin concept.
B008MEM24S|5.0|this game is great! its challenging and fun. i like it more than where's my water! I definitely recommend this game to others.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Found the book interesting.  I expected a different outcome and was a bit annoyed it didn't end as I expected.  However, I guess that's what makes it unique. Very unique way of moving the plot along by using the two different voices.
B006LMMN8I|5.0|This CD just blew me away with each song it was like a new discovery of sound. Gregory Porter's voice is as smooth as milk chocolate and just as tasty.  From the time I heard \\"On my way to Harlem\\" on the radio I knew this guy was something special indeed. Of course I have my favorite tracks but I love the whole thing and that is rare today. An extraordinary talent who's timeless vocals will touch the young and old alike, who have loved jazz or just discovered it for the first time. Bravo, Mr. Porter, bravo!! Job well done!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Just as good as the first book.  I love the characters and you get a real look into Christen history with his mother and what he really is \\"likeS.\\"
B0086DBE62|3.0|I love Tarsem Singh. He has the most beautiful cinematography in all of his films. Somewhere this movie falls flat. I cant put my finger on it.
0140186409|5.0|Sure, this novel is beautifully written, but the propaganda aspect of the work gets in the way pretty quickly. Every aspect of capitalism is condemned as evil by Steinbeck and the characters in the book are depicted as one of three types of people: A) The Victims, B) The Helpless Tools, C) The Evil Capitalists.<br /><br />The victims, such as the Joads, are portrayed as helpless one-trick ponies who, despite having some wonderful skills that could have made them some money, can't seem to adjust to the changing times and are either too dumb or too nostalgic to strike out on their own. They spend the entire novel drifting toward some sort of idiotic fantasy world that they're warned off of time and time again. Do they listen to the warnings? No. They continue stubbornly, in a way that isn't really explained by Steinbeck. Why exactly is it that the Joads don't believe the various characters telling them not to continue on to California? Who knows? Apparently, Steinbeck doesn't because he offers no explanation for -- or even acknowledgement of -- this.<br /><br />The Helpless Tools are those who serve the monsters, the corporations, which have grown uncontrollable by the men who created them. The tools do the bidding of the monstrous companies and, though they empathize with the Victims, they're helpless to resist the will of the companies -- the companies who eat profits and die without them.<br /><br />Then we encounter the Evil Capitalists. These are the evil men who actually dare to make a living for themselves by making a profit. Oh, stop! What are you!? The Devil!!?!? Good, God, man. Steinbeck would have fit right in at any of the recent 'Occupy' rallies anywhere in the world. Were he alive today, I'm sure he'd be giving some magnificent speech at the Democratic National Convention -- and hosted by Hugo Chavez soon after.<br /><br />Despite all of this though -- if you're a writer, this book is mandatory reading. There is so much masterful technique to learn from this book that you're only doing yourself a disservice by not reading it. You're literally limiting your potential because if you have the education and experience to appreciate it, this book is a gold mine of advanced technique.<br /><br />Pinch your nose at the politics and read this if you're a writer -- or else I'm giving you an automatic 'C'! :)this book that you're only doing yourself a disservice by not reading it.

B008ASLK8A|3.0|THis one just fell flat for me. not as exciting as the 1st one. I did not have high expectations, but it's just feels different.
0679736646|5.0|PKD's brilliance is evident from the first sentence to the last in this wonderful novel. Once I got to around page 50, I just wanted the world to go away so I could finish this book without putting it down. There is so much to learn from this book if you're a writer -- from character description, to plot pacing, to dialogue. You could probably devote an entire college semester to this novel and still not probe all the issues it brings to the table.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this for any reader who wants something more than corny vampire love stories ... something more substantive than two cardboard characters playing boring S&M games.... Pick it up. You won't regret it. [Safe, if read as directed.]
B008JH5CVS|2.0|For some mindless entertainment, this movie fits the bill. Feels like a SyFi channel original. As for a cheap rental, also fits the bill
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The story line seems as if it would be too gory for me, but I was immediately drawn in! A quick read, and the two that follow are just as great! Highly reccomend!
B008602KQI|4.0|I loved the intensity and disequilibrium of the movie.  The contrast between the ultra staging and the brutality, between the independence of the dependence of the young adults, and between the conflicting feelings for two potential lovers contribute to the disorientation of this dystopia. The absence of resolution moves us to a sequel.
B005LAIHSG|4.0|Saw this at midnight and I can not wait for the dvd! I LOVED IT! I hate that the only reason people are hating is because of the whole scandal. The scandal had nothing to do with thd movie get over it people! Charlize was AMAZING! Kristen and Chris were also good but nothing compares to Charlize's acting in this film she practically stole the film. I thought this movie was great
B005H9B44A|2.0|I am surprised with the overwhelming number of good and very good reviews for this movie.<br /><br />I thought the script and acting were weak.<br /><br />I think its better than one star, but not by much.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pinterest and having it on the go is even better! I have to admit it sometimes can be glitchy.. but mostly it works amazingly and is easy to use!! :)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. I stayed up all night reading it and when I was done I noticed it was light outside. Worth reading for people of all ages.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Nothing could meet my requirements more.  My Kindle Fire fits this cover perfectly and the cover keeps it protected while I carry it or use it.<br />  But the best part is the beauty!  I have people stop me and inquirer about what I'm reading, thinking I have some valuable antique volume in my possession. Complete amazement when they realize it's a Kindle!  I love this cover...it just adds to the joy of owning a Kindle Fire.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|the numerous options allows you to create any number of melodies.<br />the ability to control sound element intensity I very unique
B005ZOCF5E|1.0|This book could easily be 50 or 100 pages shorter. Most of the action consists of moving from place to place following clues. The basic idea of a person not being able to send a simple messge is kind of hard to believe.
B000I3PA8Q|5.0|I used to watch the original series and have seen most of the movies. However, THIS one captures the characters the best. It has the same flavor as the series.<br />I especially enjoy the byplay between Kirk and Spock.....hilarious! \\"Well a double dumb ass on you!\\"
B003O86FMW|5.0|Could not put it down. Don't buy this without mocking jay too. You will want to gO straight into it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great characters and story line. This book takes hold of you and makes you feel like you are there right in the action.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book is a no nonsense no frills autobiography.  What set it apart is its 'that's just the job' conveyance of the life of a seal and his mates.<br /><br />I was struck most by how, even just after the mission to kill OBL, the author and his guys were pretty much of the attitude 'job done, what's next? When can I get some sleep?'<br /><br />And this attitude permeates the rest of the book as well and i really appreciate it. It's not dressed up. No pomp. Just we trained to a do a job, we did the job and then we will train for the next one.<br /><br />PS. Not sure what the pentagon is worried about. There's very little in here that puts anyone at risk. The author spends more time talking about his load outs (which I appreciated) than he did any technical specifics of the mission.  Enemies of the state will find nothing here.
0525953728|5.0|I bought this book from Amazon and waited anxiously for it to arrive.  I expected it to be good and I wasn't disappointed.  This book gives us a look into the lives of America's premier SEAL team.  It's not just about the raid but also what it takes to make it to the next level, Team Six.<br /><br />This book is an easy read but be warned.  It was nearly impossible for me to put down once I started.  I became so engrossed in reading it that I gave up a Saturday of watching college football to finish it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I just love this app! Not only does it audibly tell me the status of my devices battery power, it specifies the time left for all functions i.e., web searching; reading (Kindle Fire); talk time etc... Well worth the &quot;price&quot; (free) ! My hubby can't for his new device so he,  too can load this app!
B000FBFMFW|1.0|A waste of time.  I made it through Assassin's Apprentice, a bit leary of continuing because the main character seems to have no sense at all, other than the wit.  He's supposed to have great skilling powers, yet seems continually ignorant of how to use them.<br />It a shame because I think the author can write but is too into a masochistic need to have his character continually beaten and humiliated.  Then I come to the end of the book and it's like \\"it was all a dream\\" kind of ending.  Nothing mattered. All that time spent with Burrick, Chade, Verity, way more interesting than the main character, wasted.
034580404X|5.0|Wonderful books... Hope there is a movie to go with it. I have passed them on to several people to read also.
B002KFJWBG|3.0|The final Zombies album is important in rock history. You should hear it. However, the whole album, until the final song, is VERY dated stylistically. The tracks have a delightful, loopy, trippy energy, and shift beats and moods randomly within a track. But in the post-Spinal Tap era, it's hard not to chuckle, as most of them sound like Tap's \\"Listen To The Flower People\\", without the comedy. Then, at the last minute, comes TIME OF THE SEASON, which lands on the tail end of this record like a clean, snappy, well produced hook-fest. It seems to come from a different world than the rest of the album. You are finally reminded that Argent and Blunstone could write a thrilling, smashing pop song. Unfortunately, you have to wade through the rest of the album to get there.
0425263908|3.0|This was really good except it was TOO much like Fifty Shades. It was like she read that first and then wrote her book changing the characters. Will I read the next one? Of course, I'm hooked now!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|With love and kisses to Star Trek and Philip K. Dick, Scalzi delivers a great and challenging read with Redshirts.  It screwed with my mind and I loved it.<br /><br />For the people who say they read Old Man's War and don't get this book, you don't know Scalzi.  This follows more in the tradition of Agent to the Stars and Android's Dream.  It mixes crazy \\"what if\\" science fiction with a healthy dose of humor.  And, deep questions do surface, including what makes good TV writing, what does free will mean (and are you really happy if you have it), and the nature of love and fate.<br /><br />Scalzi deconstructs the some of the absurd cliches original Star Trek series.  Why is Kirk always safe on away missions, but the red shirted security guy always dies?  If the show were actually happening to real people, how would the rest of the crew react when they were picked for an away mission, knowing what happens to their colleagues?  Wouldn't they know their chances weren't good?  For fans of the genre, there are plenty of laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />Scalzi repeatedly tramples the fourth wall, and the metafictional implications abound.  The characters grapple with metaphysical questions like this a space opera, or a show about a space opera, or a book about a show about a space opera?  Who is the god of this machine?  Who are the real main characters, and who are bit players?  Is Jimmy Hanson a MacGuffin or a shadow of the puppeteer?<br /><br />When I read negative reviews of this book, I just can't help but sadly think that people haven't understood it.  Perhaps it is too complex and smart for the mass audience.  Or perhaps the audience doesn't appreciate the \\"reality\\" of the book being screwed with so much.  Maybe the audience really does just want a simple narrative, where the hero overcomes adversity and everyone lives happily ever after.  No deep thinking required.<br /><br />But for those that like to think and are willing to follow Scalzi down this black hole,Redshirts really delivers.  Take it lightly, and marvel in its absurdity and depth.  But hey, maybe I'm really a sock puppet for the author and am just writing this review to pump the book.  As Scalzi says in Red Shirts, \\"No, no I'm just f...ing with you.\\"
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I got two whole pages passed in a week.  wish game were little harder on it otherwise a very great game
0307887960|5.0|I had seen great results on a friend that went on the Duken diet, so I decided to look into it.  I have lost 20lbs in 4 weeks, it is easy to follow and I am not craving no nos any more. It is worth getting the cookbook also as there are lots of good receipes. You have to like meat.
0767812166|5.0|Loved Jeff Bridges in this gentle movie as I have loved him in anything he stars in.<br />Being a die hard science fiction fan the touch of 'out there' was charming.<br />Good cast, good action, good viewing.
B0079TQHDO|5.0|A very enthralling read. Couldn't wait to read next page. Jeffrey Archer always is a great read. Being able to take my Kindle everywhere I go makes it much easier to read a book on the go.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Great action and beautiful scenery. This movie was a very good compliment to the popular books. Looking forward to the next movies.
B008D28HYS|4.0|these puzzles are great.  they're like a combo of sudoku and minesweeper.  this is probably easier to use on a larger device than a smartphone, just so you don't keep accidentally hitting the wrong squares like I do :) .  it's also better when the numbers are on all 4 sides of the grid - that way you don't have to scroll as much when!
B005723JSQ|4.0|This book was a quick read. Circumstances kept changing, keeping you wondering what would happen next. Parts of the book made me laugh out loud - how could someone get into such a corner? Fun book, highly recommend it!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I saw a youtube review of this online, and for $3.99, gave it a try. I fell in love with the beats and her unique vocals. Its definitely one of my current favorites.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This was easy to set up and easier to follow along.  I like the graphics very much.  Enjoy playing this is a must have.
B004LROUNG|5.0|This book has a lot of funny seans and is very interesting.  Hope everyone enjoys this book as I have.  Give it a try.
B0054S6N04|1.0|I am a big fan of Nora Roberts and was advised that Linda Howard might be a good alternative. Not this selection. What sounds like a great story was a corny, juvenile farce of a mystery. There was not enough romance, mystery or thrill to make this anything more than a waste of time. I flipped through waiting for something to click. Nothing. The characters had potential to be interesting but ended up as cardboard characters that you find in every book. Do these writers have a template they use?? More time was spent discussing the lead characters interest in cars than actually developing the story. Also, where was all the \\"amusing' banter between the lead characters that I read about in the reviews? The dialogue received tons of eye rolling and page skimming from me. I really wanted the killer to get the lead characters first so I wouldn't have to read it anymore...and let's hope the ridiculous cat BooBoo (Really?) did not escape the carnage. I started reading romance and mystery novels at a young age. The problem is..I grew up and these books that certainly entertain hormonal teenagers and bored housewives no longer appeal. You would think the authors would grow along with their readers but they seem stuck in this pattern of typical work that we have all read a thousand times over. Done.
B005ZUR724|5.0|super great game. a little jumpy. sometimes but still a great game. I was really into wow but could not keep up with all the stuff you had to do. j really enjoy this game because is is a much scaled down version similar to wow. I am very pleased with the game. great job!!!
B007SXB498|5.0|The story and the dialog are simply outstanding. i love to read her writing and enjoy to read this books more then once. its a must book for any jane fan or just any romance lover.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I ordered this book knowing I had to read it. Its history that will be read and taught for years to come. I read it in one day and wasn't disappointed it was a page turner I couldn't put down.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Does what it says it does. fun to combine different sounds to customize your own sound. the timer feature is very helpful. ten minutes and I'm sleeping like a baby.
0061537969|4.0|Cute story that made you laughter and cry.  I enjoyed the book and could see so much meaning.  Great quick read
B00846REIS|4.0|Book was really well written. I still cant decide if I like this book or Fifty Shades of Grey Better.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|\\"Outliers\\" is a thought provoking book discussing the events and environments that came together to give certain people the opportunity to be big successes, ie, the Bill Gates and Beatles of the world.  It also discusses the reason why other people that should have been huge successes did not reach there potential.<br /><br />I enjoyed this book immensely.  I have often thought that many people I have known over the years could have been bigger successes had they either worked a little harder or had the right opportunities, this book gives the reasons why or why not. \\"Outliers\\" even gives some possible improvements that we as a society could do to give more people those golden opportunities.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I'm not a big book reader but never the less I'm enjoying every single moment of reading this book.<br />the plot is fascinating, the characters are interesting and the overall atmosphere that created is very special.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is good clean fun. It has a clean storyline. Can get adults to read as well for in depth of a story .Can captivate kids attention because of charchters personality. It is the best book in the series so far that I read.
0307593312|2.0|Oh my god, at last it's over.  Thank goodness.<br /><br />I've read a lot of Murakami, and as generous as I can be based on my previous experiences, this book is massively overwritten, and increasingly pointless as you progress through.<br /><br />Plotlines appear and disappear like magic (the unexplained end of the older girlfriend, walking out of the plot by Fuka-Eri (I would have walked out, too), etc, etc) and the end just kinda... happens.  There is no reason for anything, and the dream logic I normally take for granted in Murakami isn't even followed.<br /><br />A couple of interesting ideas do not make 900 pages of novel.
B001AH6ZWY|4.0|I liked the movie overall.  The one thing that I would like to discuss is the whole religion aspect.  I think this movie is more \\"about\\" religion vs science, than anything else.  Even extra-terrestrial contact and the ensuing politics comes a distant second.<br /><br />Carl Sagan was supposedly an agnostic so I think that he was personified by the main character (Dr. Ellie Arroway), who seemed to doubt a supreme being herself.  Watching his series COSMOS, Carl iterates over an over that our civilization would have advanced much more than it did -- if it wasn't for the fact that, at every turn in our history, scientific progress and critical thinking has been stalled, halted, or even set back centuries by religious dunderheads too comfortable in their religious worldview to accept new information.<br /><br />I wonder if he made the religious characters in this movie so unbearably annoying because he was, to a similar degree, personally annoyed with religion in the real, nonfiction world.  I'm not going to tell you my personal views or whether I agree or disagree with [what I perceive as] Carl's annoyance at religion... because this review is about my thoughts on Contact and it's author; not about me.<br /><br />This movie has a strong undertone -- A theme that tries to remain subtle, but shines through clearly whether it was intended to or not by the director:  This undertone is all about the battle between (1) sound scientific reasoning and logic (and 2) the single-minded agenda of science deniers that defend their own beliefs, even against facts themselves.<br /><br />The religious characters in this movie are depicted as naive and gullible characters that are too clouded in their own superstition to see reason.  I like this excerpt of dialog from the movie (little spoiler):<br /><br />~~~~<br />Palmer Joss: Our job was to select someone to speak for everybody. And I just couldn't in good conscience vote for a person who doesn't believe in God. Someone who honestlythinks the other ninety five percent of us suffer from some form of mass delusion.<br />Ellie Arroway: I told the truth up there. And Drumlin told you exactly what you wanted to hear.<br />~~~~<br /><br />Who is right or wrong?  I guess it depends on your own worldview.  When I was younger (years ago), I remember watching this movie and definitely agreeing with one of them; and now that I'm older I re-watched this same movie agree with the opposing character.  I liked the movie equally well when each viewing (separated by years of course), since the movie does a pretty good job of raising both sides arguments without sounding like it's definitively rooting for either.<br /><br />****** Now, this next part has a bit of a spoiler so don't read it if you don't want to ruin the movie ******<br /><br />In the end, the movie portrays a sense of balance -- that neither side is necessarily 100% right or 100% wrong when (1) the main religious figure (Palmer Joss), does in fact exhibit the redeeming quality of being open to the possibility that Ellie Arroway is telling the truth, and (2) the main secular figure (Ellie Arroway) ironically shows \\"faith\\" in that she truly believes (despite no empirical evidence) that her personal experiences were real and not a delusion; and she also bequests her opponents to have faith in her as well.<br /><br />Finally, there is just one big plot hole in my mind (also a spoiler):<br /><br />If nobody believed her, then why didn't someone else just go in the machine again and verify it?  Perhaps not using a WIRELESS camera this time...
B0041VV03A|5.0|For months I didn't watch this film because so many other people said it wasn't good. But finally, last night, I watched for myself and I was deeply enthralled and moved by this provocative and original science fiction story.  The \\"creature\\" was just amazing and boy what a story! Loved it!<br /><br />Sarah Polley and Adrien Brody gave fantastic performances, but of course the creature stole the movie (And they show you the creature in LIGHT; no dark hard to see scenes--you really get to see the creature really good!!!). I especially loved the sex scene between Brody and the creature.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is very much worth your time. It is an eye opening documentary that I suggest everyone I know to watch.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|amazing sound and being able to mix and create your own sounds is awesome. Will be using this nightly. Thanks for a GREAT free app.....
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Other than the repetitive descriptions , this was a great read. It grabbed me from the beginning, and I  couldn't put it down.

B008XG1X18|5.0|This app is so much fun to go on. I could sit on it all day ( which I do! ) and just pin things. If you like funny pix, DIY crafts, and everything else, this is ur app!!!
0345803485|1.0|All everyone talked about was the \\"Gray\\" series.  I was not impressed.  Overall I think the writing is poor and the story line goes entirely too long.<br />I just cannot understand why everyone is impressed with these books.  In my opinion the \\"Masters of the Shadowlands\\" series by Cherise Sinclair is so much better.  They are very well written and not so long that I want to fall asleep.  The characters are rich and full and are carried forward through all the books.  Try the \\"Masters\\".  I hope you love as I do.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|I am a huge Fiona A. fan, but I am so not convinced by this album.  It's like she fell in love with someone and HAD to include him in the production, and the result is good for his ego and bad for music. Heard that sort of thing before...
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|Easy to use just plug in the plate and set your mouse on it :) I use this every night along with my mobee keyboard charger
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a truly wonderful app full of resources to help us to effectively navigate through the WORD of our GOD. It is an excellent study companion. I highly recommend this app. 50 plus STARS*************************
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I read all three books. They are such great books. I hope the writer writes more books, or even in Christians version, like how this book ended.
B008KPIN9C|5.0|I've been a Two Gallants fan for a while now and this album is just good music.  You won't be disappointed.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Recommend this to anyone it is a must buy. It is a challenge which everyone likes. This is an amazing game
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Nice graphics and a relaxing soundtrack make a wonderful ambiance for these logic puzzles.  very nicely done.  I don't do a lot of games but this one is worth it.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|The beauty of this film is the distilling of raw emotions into their most basic elements.  It raises several good ethical and moral questions.  If you enjoy a good Drama that raises questions you've never considered before, you'll like this movie.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Graphic explicit sex ....would have preferred to learn more about Ana and Christian's relationship and background, but it was very entertaining.  I look forward to reading the next two \\"Fifty Shades\\" books.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is amazing.  It can word predict up to three different languages at the same time without having to manual switch.  So awesome.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It took me 2 days while doing other stuff to read this. It was wonderful! I couldn't put it down! I love mystical type tales like this and am fascinated with myths centered on time. Wonderful descriptive easy to read emotional tale. Just wonderful!!!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|The movie arrived on time and was in great conditions. I have not been able to watch the movie but as soon as I do I will update this review!
B005EHILV4|5.0|This unit works as advertised.  I used it with Sound Forge and Audacity. Just make sure the inputs and outputs are set correctly.<br /><br />Follow-up:  Just had a live recording section, I was at a friends house, this little guy did the job. I connected the output of his mixer to channel 2 of the 302USB, and connected my headphones, feeding the sound to my laptop, great sound.  Nice for  portable recording on the go. I use this little mixer, headphones and my laptop.
0307279189|5.0|Have been racing, and coaching for over 15 years of my life.  I find this book very well written - very easy to read, and the story is great! Most people might try to really search for some scientific reasons why Tarahumaras run so fast - but it's really just part of their life, and mostly how they approach it from the mental aspects - they enjoy it - that's all!!!  I think most of us forget after a while why we to certain things, and why we started them - especially physical activity. This books can make each of think why we do what we do!!!  In sport or at least individual sport (not familiar w/team sports) one has to really like it, and enjoy it - otherwise the journey is short lived. This books shows exactly this. It's same w/other great individual athletes. Especially in sports that the financial reward is really not that much.<br />The bottom line - reading this book can remind each of us the original reasons for our own physical activity, and maybe find more enjoyment in what we do.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|So relaxing. Perfect setup to play a few minutes before bed then turn it off. Great puzzle game. I would recommend to anyone looking for a puzzle game that will challenge you without pulling your hair out. Soothing soundtrack, as well.
B008XG1X18|5.0|this app is amazing! its easy to use and it is something I use all the time. when Im bored or looking for something specific I go straight to pinterest. its official- I'm addicted! buy this app! it is totally worth it
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|this game needs a serious update<br />it always glitches out!!!!!!!!!!!<br />I deleted it as soon as I got it<br />don't buy this app it is just a waist of your time
B007TMON8M|5.0|I love physics based games, this one is the best I have played! Wish it had more levels, but totally worth the price.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Awesome puzzles, cool music, love that they have hints when levels get frustrating trying to get perfect scores. Get this game!
B005ZUR724|5.0|like vanilla warcraft. fun and easy to use on kindle fire its very affordable too. I recommend it to anyone that loves WoW. plus its the best ammo for handhelds period.
0345803485|5.0|From start to finish I couldn't put this book down! I highly recommend the men try reading this!! I loved all three books loving book 3 best!! Keep in Mind you 100% must read all 3 books or missing the whole story!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Excellent game, very entertaining! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Enjoy the games,  not boring games. Fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun, fun.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's a cool came, plays well on my Asus Transformer (tf101 running ICS). Nice graphics, fun and pretty much a must have considering it's free.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this is an excellent app. I use it on my fire. it shows everything I want and is fast and efficient.
B00005NTJK|5.0|fantastic mix of midevial folk/hard rock.I guess i need more tull!!!hope to get more as soon as possible !also..can't wait for more crimson surround releases.
0062124293|5.0|What a brilliant woman!  I am not a Brit so some of the references and jokes go by me, but no matter.  This cheered me up immensely during a long trip to a dismal wedding.  Her advice is actually quite sound.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought it was well written. It had a different twist for a mystery. I did not like the ending.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is very well made. And three concept is perfect for mobile devices. You can work on a puzzle for a few seconds and make some headway or waste hours clearing out whole categories of them. If you like puzzles, this game needs to be on your device.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I hate this app so much if you were trying to make an original game make a game about wattles but just don't just make a terrible remake of minecraft and there are no CREEPERS witch is a bad thing.
B008D28HYS|4.0|CrossMe Color is every bit as well made as the original monochrome version. Unfortunately, having multiple colors makes the game more complicated to use while the puzzles are actually easier to solve. This makes the puzzles less satisfying than the original. I would definitely recommend starting there. However, when you use up all of those puzzles and are looking for more, which you will be because these games are so fun and addicting, come right back here. You'll find tons more puzzles with the same interface and the same degree of polish you'll have come to enjoy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well well well...I was trying to resist reading this trilogy as I knew I was gonna LOVE it....and if I don't say so....I was right!!!
B007TMON8M|3.0|This game is well made. If you enjoy physics puzzles, this is a solid choice. However there are a few areas that hold it back. It is very short. You'll likely finish it in only a couple sittings. The author endlessly pesters you with paragraph long popups to get more of his games, go to his Facebook site, and what seems like hundreds of other requests that all take you out of the game. The tutorial is also lacking. It tells you how to place beams, but gives you no intro on why. Still the base game is well put together and well worth your time.
B000001DU5|1.0|This item came on time and was packaged safely. My husband and I love listening to this music that reminds of our younger years.  The sound quality is good and there were no scratches on the disk.
B005IQZB14|5.0|After reading Wild, I want to go find a through~hiker and feed her/him. I want to thank my mother for living her 91 years. I want to unearth the journal I kept while biking across North America in 1987. I want to thank Cheryl Strayed for reminding me about the possibility of change, and the power of a story well told.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|I think this app is great. I would recommend buying this app tor 99 cents if you like puzzles and problem solving. If you don't like any of the following about the app that I mentioned, then don't buy it. In my opinion, I think the app is relaxing and fun.<br />  - petshopsky
B0048WQDIE|5.0|funniest book and movie ever made. I'vc never read a book more incredibly ironic, more incredibly true to form, more realistically typical of miltary life than this book. I've never seen a movie that ever complimented a book more than this one.
030758836X|4.0|A terrific read on many levels; surprising and fresh storyline, good character development, well written and engaging. After the first third you'll start shouting out loud at some of the characters; then things take an interesting twist and you'll start shouting at some other ones.  You will not love or even like these people, but you will not be indifferent to them. This book will (and has) irritate many people. I just read a bunch of the 1-star reviews and laughed; i think many people who said the ending was terrible meant that it mad them really, really mad - and that is not the same thing. Guaranteed to get your book group talking!! I loved it.  PS, also a great audiobook.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|can't get enough of it.  smooths to operate. have never had it hang up on me.  nice sound effects. highly recommend.
1936608898|5.0|This was book was written with such passion and reason.  They do a great job blending the science with real life practicality.  I really hope this can open up some eyes to how people can and should take control of their own health.
B008VBYN80|4.0|its ok but there needs to be more tasks and more energy and there needs to be morethings to buy
B008MEM24S|5.0|Fun for the entire family.  As much fun as Where's. My Water!! Thanks Disney! !! Would definitely recommend to friends.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|Witches, vampires... you'll find them here in Rebecca Hamilton's novel \\"The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey\\". When I started this book, I didn't know exactly what to expect. I didn't read any reviews prior to my reading and I was incredibly surprised by what it has to offer. Rebecca Hamilton is a talented writer. She knows how to draw her readers to her book, and she knows how to craft a story with depth.<br /><br />The book tells a story about a girl who is being treated differently just because she practice Wiccan. Trying to live a normal life isn't even an option when she's hearing voices and seeing things she couldn't understand. Not until she cast a spell that seemed to have gone wrong and met a mysterious, gorgeous man she can't help falling in love with. Complications, risks and consequences... Sophia has no choice but to deal with them now, for real.<br /><br />Amidst all the things that happened to Sophia, she remained strong. I think that's why I've grown to like her. She's witty, independent, and strong-willed. I easily connected with her and it felt like I've known her. Sophia has the qualities of a good protagonist and that made me appreciate this book even more. And I know, too, that everyone loves a gorgeous, hot male leading character. What can I say? Charles is definitely one type of a guy. He's funny and snarky and interesting to read about. It's been a while also since I've heard a vampire who can actually transform into animals. It used to fascinate me when I was little but as I grow up and read different versions of vampires and other-wordly creatures, this one ability of vampires were slowly forgotten or let's just say that vampires in books were created differently by different authors--they evolved. I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I find it fascinating to read something like that again.<br /><br />Seriously, this book surprised me in many ways. The plot, the setting, the characters, the writing itself.  It was eerie and dark, touching and romantic at the same time. The mysteries surrounding Sophia will keep you engrossed in the book. The twist and the revelation are something to look forward to. The time it was revealed, the way the story suddenly took a spin... It was beautiful. It was really good.<br /><br />It's a fast-paced book with an interesting plot and intriguing set of characters, beautifully written and surprisingly good. It will definitely appeal to those who love mysteries and paranormal story that has a bit of scare factor. Don't miss Sophia's Journey... it's worth the read.<br /><br />QUOTE: \\"I'm not going to turn away from the only person I've ever trusted to accept me. Not for anything. You belong to me.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down!  It was well written and kept me on the edge of my seat.  I don't want to give anything away, but there were many moments when my jaw hit the floor!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great app for killing time or just chilling. Definitely would recommend. Only drawback is ads between games but very understandable.
B007FH22VQ|4.0|This is the first Meshuggah album I have purchased. I had heard many of their older songs previously but could never really get into them. Then I heard \\"Do not look down\\" and \\"Demiurge\\" and they grew on me so I decided to buy the album. Overall I am very pleased with it, at parts it gets a little bland for my tastes but still a good listen. I can't really compare it to previous work, but it sounds good compared to their other songs which I have heard.
B004SIP9MY|5.0|I'll be honest to me the first Scream was the best in the series it all went down hill after this first movie.  No matter how many times I watch this movie it is still a great movie for horror fans of all ages.  I have never gotten tired of watching this movie and never grows old.  Plus the acting is done very well with great casting for the movie.  It will forever remain a classic horror movie in my viewpoint with great one liners like when the actor does the rules to surviving a horror movie.  So if you like the actors in this movie and a good but older horror movie then pick this movie up and enjoy some great kill scenes and gross out scenes by the master of horror Wes Craven.
B007TXN4TK|5.0|I can't wait to see how this translates over to a real piano.  I believe this could make all the ifference in really learning to love playing the piano.
B002WY65VU|4.0|Very funny movie just like Shawn of the dead.  Zombieland from start to finish you can help but laugh and at times get gross out by the zombies.  I thought the casting for the movie was done very well by getting Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson made a great team together.  So if your in the mood for a movie that combines elements of Superbad, Shawn of the dead and few other horror comedies then pick this movie up and enjoy an evening of laughs and gross out humor.
B004JY0KP8|4.0|actually i waited more bigger watch but it isn`t big enoughly for me. But the watch is very pretty :) the only negative property of the watch is that it should be more bigger...
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Guns and Roses Greatest Hits amazing collection though I didn't care for track 11 yesterdays and track 13 Since I don't have you.  I still give it 5 stars because you can't help but blast this music so loud your ears hurt afterwards.  Every time I have this cd on in my room or car I am making my car shake or my bedroom speakers just go boom boom boom.  I will forever enjoy the music this band put out during their music high.  Those who bad mouth this cd sure it doesn't have particular songs on it but to me it contains the best hits other then the two songs I mention above.  So in closing if you love your Guns and Roses music then pick this cd up and enjoy some great rock music over and over again.
B005HSG3U6|1.0|I never received this product after several attempts to try and resolve this issue. I got no follow up. It looked nice and feel it was all around waste of time and money. Very Disappointed.
B005PR44XC|5.0|What can I say except I love this book, who would have thought that a book about financial disaster could be so entertaining and informative...
B007L6VR12|3.0|Man to man, my favorite films are Mulholland Drive, Rushmore, The Royal Tenenbaums, and Excalibur.  For Cahiers cred I used to flash a more highbrow list, Tarkovsky, Kubrick, Malick etc. I could also cite Spirited Away, Apocalypse Now, and hundreds of films which gave me something. But the big four, in some kind of order, are the films which have forged my structure in the crucible of the multiplex.<br /><br />The year Mulholland Drive and Royal Tenenbaums came out, 2001, was a year of miracles. Since then I have dared to hope many times, mostly that Wes Anderson would pull out of his post-Tenenbaums tailspin and once more make the projector spit fire. But INLAND EMPIRE was the nearest to a fresh revelation.<br />Or maybe I got too old to understand the oracle's smoke blackened speech.<br /><br />Maybe Mr. Anderson's theme of failure no longer resonates the way it used to do. I'm certainly pocked with dents in which it could resound, such as unemployment, but, having met my strange standards in poetry and photography, become Wilder's dad, and sheltering in Maile's light, I don't identify quite as much with Wes' usual bereft man-child (Excalibur is also a story of failure).<br /><br />Finally making a film about children (instead of, as one critic observed, about the disappointed adults they become) should have loosed a serpent into Mr. Anderson's exquisitely manicured style. Despite initial appearances, maybe it did. Top critic consensus seems to be \\"Tweer than ever, I love it!\\" I found the trademarked deadpan Anderson dialogue in the mouths of those child actors (no doubt giving it their all) hard to buy. Kids have grave feelings, and sometimes speak gravely, but this wasn't making it for me. Didn't quite get belief in their characters. Mr. Anderson seemed to be keeping the whole story a dolly's length away. Relentless over-stylization breaking immersion.<br />I did think Mr and Mrs Bishop's separate bed dialogue was an excellent encapsulation of the Anderson ethos: \\"Quit feeling sorry for yourself.\\" \\"Why.\\" (That is the only reply that makes sense when you're riding a bummer.)<br />Some new homages, Pierrot le Fou (invoking the whole doomed lovers' society-abandoning nature idyll tradition of Badlands, Marie Baie Des Anges). Bande a part, with the Francoise Hardy dance on the beach.<br /><br />But despite all the antics I walked away thinking not of a romp, but feeling like I had lived through a perilous journey into the abyss of sex and death. That kid got stabbed in the back with scissors, (and Sam punched the wound repeatedly), Snoopy got killed by an arrow, the grown ups were gonna give Sam electroshock therapy, and I squirmed in terror of how far the sexualization of Suzy was going to go. Despite continually snapping back to comedy (sometimes in the same shot), I found Moonrise Kingdom intense.<br />I think a beautiful, hideous weed has sprouted in Mr. Anderson's thematic terrarium!: \\"Quit feeling sorry for yourself.\\" \\"Why.\\" (That is the only reply that makes sense when you're riding a bummer.)<br />Some new homages, Pierrot le Fou (invoking the whole doomed lovers' society-abandoning nature idyll tradition of Badlands, Marie Baie Des Anges).

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I like this game I find it relaxing and challenging all at the same time. Luckily more relaxing because the music lulls you into the relax mode instead of the challenge mode it takes you longer to realize your getting challenged(frustrated but in a good way)
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Don't invoke \\"Lawrence of Arabia.\\" You don't profit by the comparison, and it reminds us we could be watching a much better film.<br />Also, a Christian anthropologist, a robot, and a big albino do not weighty philosophical speculation make. 'Knowing our Creator' is just a veneer of blather on the carcass of a none too scary monster movie.<br />\\"2001\\" is an intelligent sci-fi film; sadly, Ridley Scott is no Stanley Kubrick.<br />In fact, if you see Ridley, tell him it feels like a long time since The Duellists (****).<br />Reproachfully,<br />A Paying Customer and Aliens Fan

0374203032|4.0|XXXXX<br /><br />\\"We live at a time when almost everything can be bought and sold.  Over the past three decades, markets--and market values--have come to govern our lives as never before.  We did not arrive at this condition through any deliberate choice.  It is almost as if it came upon us...<br /><br />Today, the logic of buying and selling no longer applies to material goods alone but increasingly governs the whole of life.  It is time to ask whether we want to live this way...<br /><br />We [also] need to ask whether there are some things money should not buy.  [In other words, what are the moral limits of markets?]\\"<br /><br />The above comes from the introduction of this very interesting book by Michael J. Sandel.  He is a Professor of Government at Harvard University.  Sandel is also an author.  His writings have been translated into 18 languages, and his lectures on Justice have been viewed, online and on T.V., throughout the world.<br /><br />In an economic or business transaction of any kind, both seller and buyer, it is claimed, get what they want.  But are there moral implications to some of these transactions?<br /><br />In this book, Sandel does a good job in providing us with certain market transactions, analysing them, and then detailing the moral implications of said transactions.<br /><br />This book is divided into parts.  Below I will give the name of the part and an example of sections in that part that typifies a particular market transaction:<br /><br />(1) Jumping the Queue.  Sections in this part include (i) hired line standers (ii) ticket scalpers<br /><br />(2) Incentives.  Example sections: (i) paying kids for good grades (ii) paying to kill an endangered species (iii) cash for (female) sterilization<br /><br />(3) How Markets Crowd Out Morals.  Example sections: (i) hiring friends (ii) auctioning college admissions<br /><br />(4) Markets in Life and Death.  Examples include (i) betting on death (ii) death bonds (iii) Internet death pools<br /><br />(5) Naming Rights.  Examples: (i) ads in books (ii) commercials in classrooms (iii) bathroom advertising.<br /><br />Within each of these parts is at least one section on some aspect of economics.  Examples of these sections include:<br /><br />(1)  Markets versus Queues<br />(2)  The economic approach to life<br />(3)  Coercion and corruption<br />(4)  Ethics and economics<br /><br />The best thing about this book, in my opinion, is that it makes you think.  Some seemingly innocent business transactions are not so innocent at all when you think about them.<br /><br />When it comes to moral matters such as the moral limits of markets, we have to remember that we have heads to use, and we need to use them, for our own good and others'.  Nobody else can do our thinking for us and those who presume to do so should be viewed with suspicion.  Morality should provide the conditions on which we may all live the best lives we can.<br /><br />Finally, there are two problems I had with this book:<br /><br />First, I said above that each part has \\"at least one section on some aspect of economics\\"  I would've liked to have had all these particular sections in a separate part of their own.  By putting these sections throughout the book, it made the book seem scattered.<br /><br />Second, the subtitle of this book is \\"the moral limits of markets.\\"  Yet, there is no definition of the word \\"moral\\" in this book.!!  As well, I think a small, general discussion of morality (which is, I admit, a huge topic) at perhaps the beginning would have been beneficial.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book provides a good analysis of the morality behind some economic transactions.  I leave you with this book's final paragraph:<br /><br />\\"And so, in the end, the question of markets is really a question about how we want to live together,  Do we want a society where everything is up for sale?  Or are there certain moral and civic goods that markets do not honour and money cannot buy?\\"<br /><br />(first published 2012;  introduction;  5 chapters; main narrative 205 pages;  notes;  acknowledgements;  index;  a note about the author)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXXr /><br />(first published 2012;  introduction;  5 chapters; main narrative 205 pages;  notes;  acknowledgements;  index;  a note about the author)<br /><br />&lt;&lt;Stephen PLETKO, London, Ontario, Canada>><br /><br />XXXXX
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|To me, season four is the last of the great NCIS seasons, until season Nine. Gibbs is in Mexico, Ziva is on the run after being framed by a former massad officer who everybody thought was dead. Tony is the team leader, and Mcgee is no longer the probie. Ziva calls Gibbs in mexico, and he agrees to come back to the states to help. The F.B.I gets involved. But in the end, Ziva proves that she's an Investigator first now, and gets the killer to talk. Which clears her, and allows Gibbs to go back to Mexico. But not for long, as Fornell asks Gibbs's help in solving a case, which he does. And decides to come back to NCIS for good, the stories in season four are outstanding. The Halloween story alone is worth watching, as a marine is attacked in his home. And his daughter is kidnapped, and all throughout the case, Ziva thinks that the Daughter's mother is the one who kidnapped her own daughter. But alas, in the end she is wrong.  Or the creepy episode, \\"Smoked\\". Where a body is found in a chimney, the body of a sadistic serial killer with a toe in his stomach, only come to find out his wife was the actual killer. As she buried the bodies in their yard, and the episode ends with Gibbs asking fornell how he thought the toe got in the guys stomach. There are two threads of stories throughout this season, one is Tony has a new girlfriend, and Gibbs has a Girlfriend Col. Hollis Mann. We also find out, that Mcgee is a fictional writer. We're introduced to Shariff, in two incredible episodes, where they stop the terrorist the first time, and Gibbs is almost killed the second time they meet. Also in this season, we eventually find out that Tony's girlfriend is his undercover assignment for Director Shepard. As she tries to get an international arms dealer  La Grenoulle, now Ducky had been mad at Gibbs for quitting, but eventually they become friends again. And Paula Cassidy and her team are killed in an explosion, in a really powerful episode, season four ends with Jeanne and Dinnozo getting in a limo, which is her father's, and there is La Grenoulle. Season four again, is the last of the great NCIS seasons.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Good plot.  Too much sex for me, the content of the story is enough to make the read interesting.  For those not objecting to the constant sexual content they will find this a good book.
0061692042|4.0|Ford writes beautifully - with a measured thoughtfulness that makes each word necessary and meaningful. And I could look at his face for a long time: high forehead (filled with intelligence); kind, ice-blue eyes; weathered planes (there's character there). But I digress. There are ample reviews to give any reader an idea of the story line, so I will stick to the impression that the novel left with me: that major and/or catastrophic events that occur in our lives may alter our life course, but we do not have to allow them to define our character or our future trajectory. Dell is a perfect example of this, in contrast to his sister.<br /><br />This is not a page-turner in the sense that you are eager to learn the outcome of the \\"action.\\" It would be a disservice to turn the pages too quickly. Each page should be absorbed for future mulling.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Awesome graphics, good sound track.  A little laborious and repetitive but very challenging and worth playing.  4 stars because it will get old after a week or so.
B0036EH3UC|5.0|Battlestar Galactica: The Complete 2004 Series<br />i got what i ordered.<br />the battlestar galactica 2004 series (a remake of the original 1974 series but much much better and original).<br />this series along with the caprica series is not for those who don't enjoy a seious real type entertainment. very adult in approach not for kids<br />excellent entertainment<br />somewhat unique
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Improved on first one in every way. Very good game, been waiting on it for awhile. Wish kindle fire would get games sooner.
B007B4T90K|5.0|Frequently I don't have time to watch shows I am following until long after the air date.  So frustrating when the DVR has only part of an episode because of schedule changes fortunately Amazon has any episode I am looking for with the right price, less than iTunes streams beautifully.
B003K16PFU|5.0|This autobiographical tome brings you into the chaos of the anti fascists opposition.  His unit gets sent to the front without guns and when they are issued they're antiquated and of different manufactures. As the story evolves the Soviet Communist emerge as the core of the opposition and immediately set about repressing their allies especially the Party of Marxist Unification (Partido Obrero de Unificación Marxista) of which Orwell was a member.  The P.O.U.M. was vilified in the communist press, many members were imprisoned amd executed as trotskyites.  Orwell managed to escape Spain with his wife.  The man lead a very adventures life.
B00846TTDG|4.0|It's cool, seeing all the different skills and talents the Navy Seals learn, the list is long, which goes to show why it is so hard to pass Navy Seal School and why Seals are not just anybody.  But I should imagine that the tactics demonstrated in this flick are Textbook tactics, can you say OPSEC?  As for plot/storyline, it does exist, but this movie is really geared towards showing off the Seals.
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|This app works best on rooted phones.  When you install the ROM, you have the option to hide it from the app tray, and the only way to uninstall is to flash.  Cerberus is a very powerful tool.  It has a lot of commands and if your phone ever gets stolen, you will know who has it in a hurry.
0525478817|5.0|This is the first book I've read by John Green but it won't be the last. Funny, touching, smart. It made me laugh and cry and then cry again. Bravo.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I wish I would hav saved up my crystals in the beginning, but I still love it a lot better talhan most games!!
B007TMON8M|1.0|this app is a joke. forget the fact that every level defies the laws of physics, but the last level is just pathetic. the way to correctly build a skyscraper is to build a solid foundation. however this app would have you build so that it essentially lacks a foundation and you're just shoring up the right side of the bldg from wind that only comes from one direction. by the end of the fourth storm the inner beams of my tower had snapped, but I suppose my &quot;skyscraper&quot; was still standing. the best is how much the tower sways in the wind as if any skyscraper would be designed to work that way with its occupants getting motion sickness like they were on a boat lol.<br /><br />to the app developer, I seriously hope you're not in any way a physicist, or even scientist for that matter. if you are, I highly suggest you go into a less skill intensive field for the sake of all of us.
B003W77SAS|5.0|The first time I heard music from the album Discovery, I was just 14. I was really impressed with the the disco beat and the lyrics, though simplistic, just felt right to a teen in the era of BMX bikes and hanging out at the mall. The album art was cool,too. I am in my late forties now and my son is 18. This album was also one of the first compact discs I had ever heard and it sounded so alive even after all these years. Listening to this album takes me back. It was good clean fun from E.L.O. and it will always be in my cd and mp3 collection.Did I say how cool the cover art was ?
B007URVZJ6|5.0|For anyone planning to self-publish on Kindle, this book is a must have. I wish it had been available when I first published on Kindle. I did everything myself in prepping my book, and it was sometimes frustrating.<br /><br />Most of the information on preparing your book for publication that is presented in BUILDING YOUR BOOK FOR KINDLE is availabe from the kindle self-publishing website, however, it is useful to find it so well organized in one place.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game because its exactly what I wanted, not anything else which is really nice. I recommend it
0061785652|2.0|I am not critical of the book, but am rather just stating that I do not enjoy the popular fast action movies with all the car chases and things blowing up constantly.  This book is an action movie in print.  No-one important ever gets killed and all major characters escape situations that make Seal Team Six look like amateurs.  If you like that, this is the book for you.  It was well sprinkled with interesting history questions, and I appreciated the section at the end that told the reader what was factual and what was fiction...very enlightening.  I think I would have liked it more if there was not such an overload of historical mysteries and it focused more tightly on a few and saved others for another book.
B004SQS9FA|5.0|At first, I was kind of afraid of this album. The secret: Don't listen to those 30 second previews. Although short, This album is as good as any of the original Radiohead albums, and it is very fresh and stands by itself. If anything, it is most like Kid A.
B004SBQGHS|3.0|I got this because it was free , It is a very fun game , the bad part is for some reason after closing the app , under manage apps. it shows it to be closed , so why is it using so much ram and running the battery down , if its closed .... what is going on in the background , Love the game hate that I had to uninstall it do to running the battery down and gussling Ram like a alcholic drink . Unsure what the programs doing in the back ground . And yes the problem stopped after unistall , and No it was not anything else causing it .
B004LSO6YI|5.0|The show was great, realistic. The sex scenes were good but not two graphic. The love story was spot on and realistic.
