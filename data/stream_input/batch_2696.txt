B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love the game and the graphics. Great for kids an adults. Not many games I like to play...but this one is a winner.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Well I loved the first and second books of this trilogy. But in this one Katniss's character wimps out.  She is even more moody and distant in this book than the first two.  So much so that I began to dislike her.  I believe the author was going for a more authentic feel for this character, with all the war zone experience Katniss has endured that she finally cracks.  But I do not like my heroine seeming so mentally weak.  However I do like how Peta's character evolved through the challenges he had to face and endure.  Overall, this book is a let down from the first two.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Great game you shoud get it, it is really fun it can not get any better than is is .
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was good<br />And very very very entertaining I loved the book it made me cry just kidding suck it
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This game is fun.....but the thing is, I have SO MANY problems with the game! I've had the game for awhile, so I have over 400 coins. And today, I went on the app and it said that I have 0 coins!?!?! I was so frustrated! And another problem is, is when I click on the app, it just goes to a black screen,so I have to delete the app all of the time just to play it! It does it A LOT! I'm also mad because my kindle fire hd can't get the cooler 'draw something 2'. PLEASE FIX THESE BUGS SO THE GAME CAN BE MORE ENJOYABLE!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This is a great free app.  Helps me sleep, and does not seem to bother my husband next to me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game. even a bit challenging at times love the idea and concept of the game. can't wait for new levels t come out
B0012QCZ54|5.0|this is a excellent dance movie to watch, the whole family enjoyed it and the kids watch watch it over and over because they like dancing to it.
B00C9PQ7I8|5.0|Mavis has such a resounding soulful voice and does great tribute to her songs. I highly recommend this CD for pure spiritual and uplifting music.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|this is a excellent movie for the family wo like dancig and listening to good musicals. this was added to are collection of excellent movies.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Was my choice to get the app I had to pay for after using the free one. This was too help developer to get creative and update apps like this one.Works good let you know when to charge.Ihave been using this for over several months
B004529NKC|5.0|this is a excellent dance movie to watch with family and the kids love dancing to it. this is why we added it to are movie collection.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I agree with other reviews that this was challenging, but not frustrating.  For children (age 7 or so) this would be a good challenge with a bit of help &amp; paper to jot down clues. There is a process for each room... see a box with a keyhole, but need code to open safe to get the key, and have to search for the combo to open the safe, and so on. I had fun and will wait patiently for more rooms.
B001NLKT60|5.0|This book was amazing in the way the story had many twists and turns.  I greatly enjoyed finding out more about Lisbeth Salander.
0307346617|5.0|Great book it's  amazing and I haven't even finished halfway. I'm a big fan of zombies and this book is everything I ask for in a book. Zombies, action and adventure that's everything I could ask for in a book. I applaud Max Brooks for putting this together so perfectly and the plot was perfect. I don't see any way in which you could change it just a great book
B002UWH8P6|4.0|Love the Stargate series!!! The original STARGATE movie was fantastic!!  Universe continued the fascination. Perhaps there will be more? STARGATE WARS
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I got this for my 17 yo daughter. She says it is ok. Addictive while she is playing it until she gets to what she called a &#34;rage quit&#34;. When you get to a place you get aggrivated and then just stop. She says anyone who plays games like this will understand.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it. its great for kids and adults. I cant wait to get further into the game and get more horses
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Just when I thought there's no way Cassandra C. can up The City of Bones, I was highly HIGHLY mistaken. City of Ashes was excellent! Picking right up where The City of Bones left off, I got to learn more about family ties, secrets, and powers. I don't want to give too much away, and I don't want this review to be a synopsis so I'll make this sweet and short. This second book, has a lot of action in it: a lot more fights, DEMONS EVERYWHERE, black blood, and new weapons-it's good. We get introduce to more of the downworlders, and their clans and life style which was fascinating! Some more vampires, werewolves, faeries, ect. Also, some more Magnus which I loved because I have never &#34;met&#34; such a flamboyant character.<br /><br />This book focuses a lot more on Jace-which hey, I'm not complaining! And I don't see how anyone can :P He is a great character-very layered and complex-and it's great to peel back those layers and see what he is really thinking. Now that he has learned the truth about his family ties, he has a lot of thinking to do about what he wants to do next. I felt really bad for him, but at the same time I know he will power through because he's awesome like that.<br /><br />The ending-AMAZING-cliff hanger. It left me wanting the next book right away, which isn't good because I am neglecting all my other books. I told myself that I would start reading the Mortal Instrument Series slowly because there are other books I want to read as well, but every time I find myself having a spare moment or two I only want to dive into Cassandra C's world.<br /><br />Warning: This series is an addiction.<br /><br />City of Glass so far is excellent, I can't wait to finish it and do a review<br /><br />-taken from my goodreads account
0440246318|5.0|Lee Child continues his great story line about Jack Reacher.  I couldn't turn the pages fast enough.  It's a book you can't put down until you've read it all.  I love the Reacher series and have read each one.  I've even got my husband hooked and he is now reading all the books in the series.  We will be anxiously waiting the next adventure.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I was a little weary about this series because I am usually not into fantasy type books. But I've heard so many praises about the MIT series, and also the TID series as well as Cassandra Claire as an author in general. What made me really want to give it a chance boils down to two reason:<br /><br />1. I appreciate the fact that Cassandra C. is always writing. She has five books in this series, and three more books in the shadowhunter world, and she is planning on writing a 6th MIT book coming out next year. If I do love this series, I know that I will not have to wait five years for a new book to come out by this author *ahem, Mrs. Meyer*<br /><br />2. I downloaded a sample on my kindle, and really liked it. I wasn't pulled in completely at first-but it was really just the beginning-but I couldn't put this book down and decided to buy it. Best decision ever.<br /><br />Now about the book...<br /><br />IT IS PHENOMENAL. Plain and simple. The shadowhunter world that Cassandra C. created is fantastic, and I love all the shadowhunters, vampires, werewolves, faeries, ect...each group with their distinctive personalities and physical appearances. It made the everyday mundane world seem so boring, and I find myself itching to crawl back into this world with Clary, Jace, and the rest of the crew.<br /><br />I LOVE JACE. He is such a standout character: sarcastic, self absorbed, bitter, overly confident; yet, at the same time-funny, sweet, brave, caring, and trustworthy. He is the perfect mix of male arrogant with a soft side that would make any girl fall under his spell. I couldn't stop laughing at what he would say, his words and actions are very unexpected.<br /><br />I also like Clary a lot-she's very brave and she can stand up to Jace's smart mouth and can handle a lot more than I could at sixteen. I really enjoy following her on this journey, and I am so stoked to be able to read five more MIT books. *heaven*<br /><br />This first book has lot of history, action, adventure, laughs, romance, and family ties. It really does feel like an escape from reality, with the characters and places being so real and vivid I feel as if the world gets conjured up in my mind every time I open the book. Cassandra C is excellent with detail, and every emotion the characters go through-I feel as if I can feel it.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read City of Glass knowing that this series will only get better as it progresses. Now if you will excuse me, I have to get back to NYC with the rest of the gang :P<br /><br />-from my GoodReads account
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is very fun and addictive...it has good graphics and easy to extras and freeups...it is good for all ages.
B009JBZH54|5.0|My boyfriend loves batman and movies, so the trilogy was a great present. He was so excited to have the box set of all three with the cool box to hold them all.

1936594293|5.0|One day while watching( not for the first time) one of the many Pride & Prejudice renditions on tv, I realized that sadly, I had never actually read the book. This was quickly rectified with an order to Amazon. Love it, one worth owning for sure.
B00BXUG0KU|5.0|This is a stellar music cd. It was released in 2013, so it is her very latest issue. Recorded on the Concord Jazz Label, it is clear, pure, and without fluff. Eliane does most of Chet Baker's songs that he recorded.  This cd is a tribute to Chet Baker.<br />I guarantee if you purchase this cd, you will fall in love again with Eliane Elias's voice; just a small hint of her Brazilian accent and a far cry from all her Bosa Nova music cds.
B000002OX7|5.0|This was the sound track for a film the Who never made, a must in your rock collection. Lot's of great songs and the brilliant drumming of Keith Moon.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|Mostly boring - too many curse words not necessary.  Would not read anymore books by this author. Book is stupid.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|I don't know if there was something wrong with the sound track but I could barely make out what was being said through most of the movies. Maybe it was because everyone was talking at the same time. There were several touching moments but all-and-all not worth renting.
006178480X|4.0|This is one story where I loved the story and the premise. The action was brisk and there were plenty of interesting characters. However, I was rather shocked at the downturn in quality of the writing. I've always cited James Rollins as one of the cleanest writers I've ever met and even though this one still had a lot of that, one major problem marred the story.<br /><br />The Eye Of God was an orgy of head-hopping. There, I said it. Though it was technically a third person point of view, Mr. Rollins held little regard for who drove what scene. A scene may have started with Gray or Painter, but as soon as another character entered the picture, he popped into their head. By the conclusion of that scene, it may or may not have ended in the head of the character who started it. This major problem dominated the entire story. The result was that I couldn't emotionally invest in ANY of the characters because I couldn't keep track of them and none of them were given a solid or consistent block of time to flesh anything out without being interrupted by someone else's thoughts.<br /><br />There was also a little too much use of the passive phrase \\"began to\\" which is another pet peeve. The only reason I noticed that issue was because the constant head-hopping had me on edge.<br /><br />This could've been one of the best stories I've read so far this year. However, I can't say that this time. Once again, loved the story, loved the premise, and loved the conjecture. I also loved the explanations at the end. They were a nice bonus.<br /><br />The story kept me glued to my seat just for the plot and premise alone. As for the characters, they simply moved the plot along and were there for the ride. I was glad to see all the favorites, Painter, Gray, Monk and Seichan, but their participation, though it drove the story was watered down by not being pure enough. I liked the addition of Duncan and the new girl (can't remember her name).<br /><br />Since I'm more attuned to writing flaws than the general reader, maybe I should say highly recommended because most readers probably wouldn't notice the head-hopping except that they may feel less emotionally connected to the story but don't know why (and can still enjoy it just fine). As for myself, I can only say recommended.ws than the general reader, maybe I should say highly recommended because most readers probably wouldn't notice the head-hopping except that they may feel less emotionally connected to the story but don't know why (and can still enjoy it just fine).

B003ELY7PG|5.0|Wonderful book! Extremely useful content and good real world examples. The book is very fast to read and it has really nice illustrations!
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I have always longed for a OneRepublic album. I always loved them on the radio -every song I've heard from them. But when the time would arise, I never would purchase one of their albums. Finally, when I saw the cool album art for this one I clicked into it and saw it was also on sale so I picked it up.<br /><br />I am in LOVE. Shame on me for not buying any of their other albums (which I will be doing soon). With a lot of music I just think &#34;Oh, well I'll hear the best ones on the radio so I don't need to buy the album&#34;. Well, there is not really a single song on this album that I would want to miss. Sure there's one or two that I don't like as much, but they are all great songs!<br /><br />I knew I had to pickup this album when I heard &#34;Life In Color&#34; and after hearing the whole song and the whole album it is officially my favorite song. All of the songs are very upbeat, some of them start out slow like &#34;Preacher&#34; and even &#34;Counting Stars&#34; but then that &#34;big band&#34; sound kicks in and you know you're listening to OneRepublic.<br /><br />The lead vocalist Ryan Tedder is amazing and struts his vocals singing songs like &#34;Can't Stop&#34; that are primarily in his upper register.<br /><br />I think part of their success is their love for music. All of the songs sound different, while still sounding like they belong on the same album. Most songs have a clear instrumental break where you just get to enjoy the music behind the song before Tedder comes back in again.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums and something I haven't stopped listening to since I got it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't give this show enough praise. I used to think Masterpiece Theater was only for the elderly and the British. This program proved me wrong.
B0047VSW30|5.0|Intellectually stimulatin,.profoundly thought provoking. Both the script  and quality of the cast, and their performances ,are first class,not to mention the impressive visualy appealingl beauty of the sets -and the &#34;eye candy &#34;of the actors.<br /><br />No car chases here(thank God),but enough action to balance out the more intellectual scenes.<br /><br />Superb historical piece without histrionincs!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this, the ability to carry several books in the phone you're already carrying is awesome. I would get this again even if I had to pay for it, but only a dollar.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|It's just hard enough without being impossible.  I needed the hints a few times but was able to figure most of the puzzles myself.  The only complaint is that it's too short.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This is like an old fashioned fairy tale...Refreshing, a little scary for the very youngest children but a explanation as to why the Wizard of Oz was like he was in the traditional movie
B000JIHP88|5.0|I love the remote control feature.  The music is very soothing.  I love the animals and how the leaves close slowly while the animals go round.  Very cute.  Would definitely recommend.
B00CHIMG6Y|4.0|Being a true story, it was remarkable and amazing as to its miraculous  outcome.  However, it was extremely sad right up to the end.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I seriously love this show! Who wouldn't? I feel as if I know each of these characters personally. Great cast, I am a bit shocked at some of the events that happened....wow!
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|I play a lot of Mahjongg games and this is ridiculous trying to even see the characters on the tiles. Then they make you see the times of all these 'players' which are not even believable. I think they are all made up. I don't like when the games have the playable tiles highlighted, that's like cheating.
B004P8A7J2|2.0|I only watched the first 20-30 minutes.  Thought the film tried to hard to be artsy and distracted from the movie.<br />In this case I might have enjoyed less visual art and more actual drama.  I am a big fan however of Ellen Burstyn.  She was good - as she usually is in most all films I have seen her in.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Never saw this series on television and found it was listed on Prime video offerings. We gave it a try and have thoroughly enjoyed it. Many of the actors are coasted very well as you grow to like, despise or sympathize with several of them. One of the few shows that appeals to several family members. Halfway through season 2 and looking forward to getting caught up.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is a very well done tv show.  It's consistency in storyline and in quality is very difficult to match, especially in TV.  It is such an oasis in a desert of worthless reality tv shows.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Just a Great overall game, very addicting and when you get some friends its just a huge blast to try to beat others!
B009PNQUXO|5.0|Don't listen to all that hate. I am a 14 year old and using a kindle and withoit wifi no regualar youtube. But the music shows up in your gallery. AWESOME!!!! download.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I found this to be a great series.  Loved the acting and the anticipation that went with it hoping they will finally get things sorted out.  Waiting for the next season!
0938045768|5.0|This book is a great resource for building lean muscle and strength the traditional way. I would definitely recommend it to those searching for a new and exciting way of packing it on
B009FZHYKU|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST SERIES I HAVE WATCHED.<br />I SUGGEST YOU BUY SEASON 1 & 2 AND START<br />AT THE BEGINNING SO YOU CAN UNDERSTAND<br />WHAT IS GOING ON.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|Must see! Very funny. Johnny Depp brings Rango to life in this film. The characters are a little odd, but that's what makes this a great movie.
B006LSZECO|3.0|At first I did have a little bit if a hard time getting into the book.  As it went on it got better and better, the twists made me wanting to keep reading, the ending however was horrible.  I think the reason I rated it only a 3 was purely because of the ending.  On the plus side, it did leave room for a sequel.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzle game. I can't wait for more . Sure to be interesting. Takes alot of thinking and attention to detail.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This was my first wireless headset I have had. Overall I really like these just for the fact that they are wireless. They took a little bit to setup and get working correctly with all the settings. The sound quality is nice and they feel great to wear for an extended period of time. Only reason I am 4 staring it is for the fact that I have to charge them and my wireless receiver gets interrupted for a second at times but its not a huge deal.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This game is pretty fun and addictive... at least at first.  There is only so far you can advance before the gameplay becomes repetitive, and before you need to spend real money in order to do anything new.  Also, once I reached level fourteen or so, I was bombarded with advertisements.  Sometimes they pop up in the middle of mini games.  Very intrusive.  Also, a few times I accidentally clicked on the ads, and they were for games that weren't even possible to play yet; go figure.  I'll probably lose interest pretty soon.
B006LSZECO|3.0|terrible ending !!.......still terrible as before !!....bad beginning and really bad end !.....the middle was ok.....what more is there to say ?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is better than temple run agent dash subway suffers. and I love dispicable me with minons and everything huge fan right here
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|its pretty rad. you play a thug doing thug stuff like run people over and say cuss words. like i said, pretty rad.
B001GCUNYO|5.0|Full of action and adventure good story line always with Liam never a slow part in the movie enjoy the movie.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Best book ever so amazing I love the twilight books stephenie meyer is such a good author I love it
B004XISI4A|5.0|Another page turner with twists and turns holding you to the moment. You read and read hoping for answers only to find the end is nowhere in sight. Cliffhangers in onions, snow, blind girls and beggars will have you surfing for more and praying George Martin gets on with the Winds of Winter. Thoroughly enjoyable.
B00B52F278|5.0|I LOVE THIS SHOW!!<br /><br />Since the end of Rome on HBO, this has been a bright spot. Not as good quality-wise, but it doesn't try to be. It's a moving comic book at times, and I mean that in a good way!<br /><br />I'm partial to the first season myself. Wish we'd have seen this same story play out with the original actor. RIP Andy.<br /><br />The new guy isn't bad. Just too American-looking. Andy W was more exotic-looking. But all in all, the new Spartacus is ok in my book!<br /><br />Couldn't wait to see this all come to an end this last season, and now I'm said it's gone. Reminds me of when the final Star Wars came out, where Annikin turned into Darth Vader. I knew all the stuff that had to happen by the end of the film story-wise, but couldn't wait to see how they did it.<br /><br />I miss Batiatus terribly. IMO Batiatus was THE BEST character on the show by far and was lost way too soon, although what choice did they have? Ashur was a great villain. Loved hating him. Season 1 Crixus was a thing of deadly beauty with an impeccable badass character. His stare was like a laser. Missed that guy for the rest of the series. Loved Agron. They should've kept his brother Duro, especially if the original Naevia was gonna leave. Never got into the new actress. Agron's boyfriend angle was a surprise, but it worked, too. Gannicus was just THE MAN. Could've been a Spartacus, if he cared enough. After Batiatus, none of the bad guys compared until Crassus & Caesar.<br /><br />Crassus was an excellently casted and acted character in the final season. Superb master villain performance. His kid was suitably hatable.  Julius Caesar is one of my all time heroes, so his portrayal at first concerned me, but I loved him quickly. Then THE scene with him and Little Crassus. HOW DISTURBING WAS THAT? And why to Caesar? To refer to the stupid rumors about that him his enemies constantly threw around, that he'd given up his...um, virginity, let's say...to a king for ships and support asa young man. Caesar's enemies loved that rumor cuz it made them feel better about Caesar doing their wives.<br /><br />Historical accuracy aside, I toally loved this show and have watched each season repeatedly. Can't recommend it highly enough.
B00D9DCS5K|4.0|Entertaining read but nothing really spectacular here. This part of the Promise story really just served as a setup for the conclusion in part 3. If you are a fan of the world of avatar then read all three parts but nothing too incredible here in part 2.
1401322786|5.0|Beautiful Beautiful Beautiful, a couple of hours after finishing I was still hearing the voices, running up the hill and walking in the sand.So many times I stopped in laughter at the poignant messages hidden throughtout a joyful story.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I Love this game it like temple run,subwaysufer in one!! It a minion competition for the minion of the year trophy!!!
B0015DROBO|4.0|This is not a light read or a beach book. This is a well organized and detailed (sometimes convoluted) story that you honestly do not know what is going to happen next. That's what I enjoyed the most. It did take me until I read about 25% of the book before it began linking story lines then I really couldn't put it down. Becoming familiar with Sweden and their culture took a but getting used to as well. I gave it 4/5 stars because although I enjoyed the story and the excellent character development I sometimes did not like the where the story took me. However, that is what made Girl With The Dragon Tattoo unpredictable. I am a financially conservative woman and a social libertarian. I could tell this book was written by an author with not the same views, but I felt he made good points overall and his Socialist views did not hinder the story. Actually I felt we may even agree on points.

B0017SWPXY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book from start to finish being a dog owner and lover i lived this book as i read it.  It put me through all the emotions of laughing, crying, sympathy, sadness, uplifting and caring.  Well written, i had a hard time putting it down, contained a tremendous sense of humor and as i tend to talk for my dog's looks and activities and as i enunciate my take on her thinking to everyone around i totally got this book.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Best of what is a very excellent series!!! The writing and acting are at a peak. The ending is devastating-a real cliffhanger. Exactly what you have come to expect from this show.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I don't like it. I gave it one star because it froze a lot in the very short time I had it and therefore, I have to shut down my Kindle so I deleted this app.
B003CHGV74|5.0|I liked it better than season one actually.  Can't wait for season three.  Crazy show, great writing, great acting, unique premise.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This book tells the story of two cancer kids who fall in love. Wile the book was extremely sad it told an important story of how people with cancer live out there lives. Wile we may feel bad for them them we should not, they are only people who were unfortunate enough to be sick. Hazel grase (our main character) falls for Augustus waters but because of there illnesses can not have a normal relationship. There journey is truly amazing and I would recommend this book to someone who wants a closer look into the life of someone with cancer or any other life altering illness.

B00CH87HF4|5.0|The 4th installment of the Dungeon Hunter has reached a new high. It adds a difficult plot line, yet has enough ways to continue without having to purchase things with real money. I am looking forward to the next chapter in Gamelofts series.<br />  -Quuzigader

B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|Stargate is a great family friendly Sci-Fi series which thankfully was done before the current trend of including gratuitous perverted soft porn in every episode (like Defiance).
B005F02SWS|5.0|This is one of the most happy/sad books ever written.  I would like to recommend it to any and every one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you like animals I would recommend this game. I think the game is so good that it should cost $2.99 and I'm not lying. This is the best game ever. It has grooming and feeding, championship s, and lots more I just think that if your thinking about getting a game I would definitely recommend this game.
0062200909|5.0|If you like the world of Tolkien, this book will show you many details of objects and characters. It was very worthwhile.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This was a great adventure game to take on vacation. It kept me entertained at a pace that was perfect.  A plus that the puzzles were easy without instructions, just took a little clever thinking.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|Most people think of Dracula as horror fiction. But the novel has so much more to it.<br /><br />I first read the book when I was 14 and didn't understand the sexual content (subtle prose). However, I did understand human suffering and sacrifice and the beauty of this book is that the characters are all willing to fight Dracula and sacrifice themselves in the process. Stoker managed to convey this without pomp and ceremony but in a endearing manner that allows you to feel connected to characters emotions.<br /><br />Vampires have changed into sexy beings that sparkle. Dracula only has a touch of that glamour - it's proportionate. The forbidden power. The yield to evil. The seduction to darkness - it's manifested in a sophisticated manner with depth. When Dracula is defeated - one feels empathy for him. I don't want to reveal too much but one feels Dracula, the man (rather than the monster) has won. It's my favourite part - that feeling of redemption - finding peace.
1402270275|5.0|Kiss of Steel completely blew me away. I picked up this book on a whim at my local library, and I was pleasantly surprised. I've been wanting a Steampunk read for awhile, and this looked like the perfect way to get my fix. McMaster has created an intriguing and captivating world with sympathetic and well-developed characters. The plot, while not overly mysterious, has quite a bit of action and a lot of suspense (a lot of which is sexual tension). Anyone who is looking for a good Steampunk Romance should give this book a try.<br /><br />Honoria is a strong, yet vulnerable, leading character. Sometimes she irritated me with her stubbornness, but overall, I really liked her. I could understand why she behaved the way she did, though, and McMaster didn't overdo the defensiveness. Since the novel was told from a third-person omniscient perspective, I also got to know Blade very well. I absolutely adored him. He's a complex and intriguing love interest, and his loyalty is admirable. The POV even touched on the secondary characters some, which fleshed them out and helped me get to know them better. My personal favorites are Barrons and Lena. I'd also like to know more about Charlie, so I hope we see more of him in the sequels.<br /><br />The world-building is fantastic, and I could clearly picture this version of London while reading the book As I said, the plot isn't overly mysterious. It's obvious who the bad guy is from the start, but there are still some surprises. There is a lot of suspense and tension throughout the novel, which kept me reading and engaged. The romance is touching and very steamy. The pacing is perfect, and the ending tied up Blade and Honoria's story very well. I can't wait to see what McMaster has in store for this group of characters next. I think the next novel is focused on Will (who is also extremely complicated) and Lena. I am checking Heart of Iron (the sequel) out from the library this week!<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend this novel to anyone who is looking for a good, steamy, and unique Steampunk Romance story. You won't be disappointed.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found it a little hard to keep up with all the characters who are woven into the story. I am a fan of Khaled Hosseini's work, but I liked the other two better.

B00003CXFV|5.0|Awesome,Love It ! watch it over and over added to my collection of classic movies,Julia Roberts is as always awesome
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is written as if you're watching a movie, occasionally glancing forward to catch a glimpse of what will come, but mostly progressing through events leading up to the anticipated conclusion. Also, quite an education in the legal system from the inside. I'm only 70% through and can't put it down!  You can't second-guess the outcome.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Lots of fun for myself and my 2 year old granddaughter. She loves to yell wake up to the sleeping monkey! The graphics are great!

B006Y5EDRG|4.0|Katharine McPhee could've won American Idol but she was destined to do something else in life.  She is an actress with a golden voice.  This talent opens opportunities that not everyone can handle.  A show like smash was definitely written around her and she deserves it.<br /><br />I can't wait for season two.  There is enough drama in the last season that kept me watching.  My family loves it and I surely enjoy watching the show.
0486278077|4.0|This was an interesting book. It's the first work of Wilde's that I've read, and the first classic I've finished in a long time, probably since high school. I am glad that I read it. There was a part in the middle that I was really bored with, but other than that, it was an interesting read. I enjoyed Dorian Gray as a character, as well as Lord Henry. I thought they were both pretty likable, even though they said and did some not so likable things :) I actually really liked the ending too - as weird as that may seem because of how it unfolds! It wasn't what I really expected, but it fits so perfectly, and that's why I think I enjoyed it so much!<br /><br />pagesofcomfort.blogspot.com

I called the Videon folks and they were very helpful in walking me through the process and problem solving as we went.  The app works well for my needs.  Easy to use which is a bottom line requirement for me.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Another masterly Le Carre work. I would have titled it &#34;An Uncomfortable Truth&#34;. Le Carre's brilliant characters and plots  sat more comfortably when the enemy was without: The treachery of the enemy within might appeal to the American fondness for conspiracies.

B005OKTPKC|5.0|I loved this book - it had great characters and a great story. Usual John Grisham gold. Best book I've read in ages
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I am interested ing in playing the game, but I am having a problem.  The instructions don't seem adequate to me.  I believe I am finding the hidden items, but nothing happens.  Has anyone else had a problem with the game Can You Escape?<br /><br />P.S. After going to a link, I now get the idea of what to do. Quite challenging for this old lady, but I like it and will have to give it 4 stars!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing. The graphics are breathtaking and the audio really sets the mood for the game. This game challenged me. I wish it was longer though, it only took me a day to finish but it's probably a good thing that it wasn't that long because I was so into it that I couldn't put my kindle down. It's hard to find the words to describe such amazingness. You need to get this game. Just do it. You will not regret it. I promise
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Read it.  You won't be sorry.<br /><br />This book gives us clearly defined characters and their intertwined struggles with relationships.  It gives us hope for the hopeless.  Love for the unloved. Conversations without words.  I will never look at a flower the same way as I did before reading this book.
B00B2166BS|5.0|The USB charger included with the Nexus 10 takes FOREVER to charge the tablet and it's located in an awkward position. This cable charges the tablet quickly and attaches and detaches with ease. It's a must have for Nexus 10 owners.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I loved The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. This book was almost as good as the others.  The reason why I didn't rate it with 5 stars is because I think he jumped from character to character to much.  It upset the flow of the book.  I would have preferred to have the characters get tied back together.  I will still read everything Khaled Hosseini writes in the future.
B002HK9IDQ|5.0|Shared this marvelous musical with my granddaughter and she loved it.  Wonderful summer memory--we were singing the songs for days.

B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Nalini Singh's books speak for themselves. This is one author who never disappoints, you'd want to read everything she will ever write. The language is flawless, the stories flow seamlessly one after the other, and the author is always able to portray the depth of emotion shown by the characters. Heart of Obsidian is very highly recommended.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I enjoy the story line,  hate the ending,  Will be interested in what the next season brings. When will the next season be available?
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|this is pretty cool,you get to change scenes and tiles as well. Have great fun and exciting. If you want variety this is the game for you.
0765315246|4.0|When you read the cover, it mentions Heinlein as an inspiration to the author...and after reading the first few pages you understand why.  Not the deepest book regarding &#34;military scifi&#34; but if you are looking for the tech, go read Webber or Steakley...but the feelings of being a recruit, a small part of the machine that is the military, the role you as an individual play and to the best of your ability, just to keep your buddies alive, that is captured and expressed very well.
B0095MVOMC|5.0|really cool makes me think of the hidden objects games i used to play years ago. I think you will enjoy looking for these numbers game its pretty ingenious.
1476715904|5.0|Slammed is one of the most immediately readable books I've read in a long, long time -- if not ever. It's a book that's unbelievably easy to pick up, start reading, and get drawn into right away.<br /><br />Layken (whose name does seem a bit crazy but it works in - and because of - the story) and Will have both experienced a lot more at their respective ages than most. It isn't done for drah-ma! and it doesn't turn them into melodramatic characters. It does shape them, yes, as it would anyone who went through those things and makes them unique characters.<br /><br />Once or twice (and only for a moment) Layken and Will's relationship, along with everything happening  to them feels almost expected or like things I've read/seen before. It didn't detract, at all, from the story or my enjoyment of it, however.<br /><br />The novel didn't follow the story line that I expected -- except for one rather large turn that seemed obvious much sooner than the character saw it -- and I loved that. That the story wasn't just Layken and Will but Layken's family and Will's and Layken's friends and the different interactions among them made for such a great read. Of course, scenes between the two characters were brilliant but it was when there were other characters around -- either with the two of them or just one of them -- that we really learned so much more about them.<br /><br />I will say that, as this was from Layken's point-of-view, she was much easier to connect with and felt like a much more relatable character. I definitely liked Will a lot, but there seemed to be a bit of a distance from his character. (Not that he was distant, just not as well connected as Layken, main character wise.) The next novel in the series is from his point-of-view, though, so I'm looking forward to finding more of a connection with him there.

B00AIQP9DE|3.0|overall...fun and addictive.  however...i had to start over twice because my game was lost...and it was the same spot 3/4 of the way through. must be a glitch.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|I bought it for my 2.5 year old, who LOVES to dress up. The drawback is that I had to put her dresses on place and that is a cleaning time. This toy is great: she can dress up the girls on the pictures. The stickers are great quality and reusable, meaning that you can switch costumes for the girls many times. Some stickers are too sticky, so you have to sit next to your child and help to unpeel them. That is not the case with this toy, my daughter can play by herself<br /><br />Great toy to take with you to the restaurants: lightweight (you just take 2 piece of paper) and entertaining for a long time, so You parents, can also enjoy the evening too.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Easy to use for normal a nd everyday use as well as school work.  Very convient to have at the touch of your fingers
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book was really good and surprisingly deep. The whole thing felt real to me. Sure some of the coincidences were a little far fetched, but what book isn't like that. I wish poetry had really been like that in school. If it had, I might have actually enjoyed that unit instead of the old, highly metaphorical stuff we had to read.<br /><br />The twist toward the beginning threw me off, but it didn't make the book super awkward or anything, so it was okay. I'm looking forward to reading the next book and reading more of Layken and Will's story.

B001FB4VXU|5.0|Purchased this set for my son, who at the time had never seen the show. As he was stationed in Afghanistan, I thought this would bring him some laughter in such a dismal situation, and it did. &#34;The Big Bang Theory&#34; is one of the funniest shows in history, hands down.
B003TY3F06|5.0|Well written, great cast, superb performances and can be watched and enjoyed the same way over the years.  It's impossible for me to find anything about this film I really did not enjoy, a modern Bonnie and Clyde type of story but to be honest these two love birds are much more relatable.<br />The film was written by Quentin Tarantino which may or may not turn you off this film, but please let me tell you this is one of his many gems, additionally he does not act in the film.  This film was directed by Tony Scott the director of such great films as \\"Top Gun\\" and man oh man he did an amazing job with this work of art.  There are two cameos of many that stand out in this picture and are so brilliant.  The first is made by Christopher Walken, the character is only in one scene of the film along side Dennis Hopper and it's probably one of the highest quoted and most brilliantly filmed scenes in the film.  The second cameo that stands out to me in this film is made by Brad Pitt, his character is so minimal yet so memorable in his few scenes in the film you are sure to get a kick out of it.  If you are not a Christian Slater fan this film will definitely give you a much higher opinion of the actor, his performance in this film is flawless the only thing that was a little strange to me is his characters transition in the first 20 minutes of the film but then again had I gone through what he goes through in that time maybe my personality would shift a little too.  Patricia Arquette really knocked this one out of the park, even though I'm not really a fan of most of her films she really shows her chops with this wonderful character, I even really loved her short voice over in the beginning and ending of the film just an amazing job.  I feel like if I keep talking about the cast I will be writing this review forever but needless to say check out the imdb.com page for the picture and all of the actors listed just hit every mark and were on top of their game.<br />This film is on the violent end of the spectrum so that may change your opinion of the film depending on where your opinion stands on that type of thing, but honestly this movie is well worth it, great love story, memorable characters, excellent writing, acting, directing and cinematography.  The score to this film is incredibly catchy and I loved it as well, so many bit parts by amazing actors Gary Oldman and Samuel L. Jackson to name a few.  This movie sits on my must watch list and I gladly will and have sat and watched this film with first time viewers time and time again.  Buy it digitally, buy on physical media carry it around on USB no matter how you slice it, definitely one for the collection.on the violent end of the spectrum so that may change your opinion of the film depending on where your opinion stands on that type of thing, but honestly this movie is well worth it, great love story, memorable characters, excellent writing, acting, directing and cinematography.

B00AB55BS0|5.0|Now I know what all the hype was about.  What a great series!!! I like that all three versions of this were available with the pack.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|I Love what the writers, director, and actors have done with these characters! How they have taken the old fairy tail and given them all great backgrounds. and all the actors develop their characters well.<br /><br />This is a family tv show... though the little ones may be a little scared of Rumple/Mr. Gold... but violence is kept to a minimum so it is safe for older children.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I flew through Season 1 of this series and now I'm part way through Season 2.  I like that this pack comes with the Blu-ray, DVD and Digital copies.  Well worth the money.  I'd like to buy Season 3, but I won't until it comes like this.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I enjoyed the book but there wasn't really anything in there that I had not read from other NDE writers.  Too much of the book was indexes and appendixes...I would have liked more description of the journey.

B00C81AVNU|5.0|Loved everything about the CD, can't stop playing it. It has become my favorite. I saw it on Broadway and plan to go again and now I will sing along. Cyndi Lauper's music is great. And Billy Porter and Sand Stark are outstanding!
B0084AZXKK|5.0|I have not finished the book.  Book is the same as I remember but with a lot more details.  Holds my interest and am enjoying reading it on my Kindle fire HD.  Like the way the Kindle keeps my last page read.
076781326X|1.0|This was only 1/2 of the original musical! I don't know how they got away with it but only about 2 songs are featured! I was so disappointed. I should have sent it back but missed the window. This was a huge rip-off. I bought two copies--and wanted to review one to see if it was appropriate as a gift for a nephew--glad I did because the story started in the middle to end of the actual story. Quite disappointing.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I got the book the day it came out but was not able to start it til Saturday. I finished last-night and I must say I was hoping for an ending. There are so many tosses and turns that i actually became confused in a few spots and had to re-read them.<br />I hate how Eva seems so indecisive especially after everything Gideon has done for her.<br />I hate Brett for always trying to get so close and Eva not really putting her foot done. SMACK HIM OR KNEE HIM IN THE NUTS WOMAN!<br />I used to love Cary's story and hope things would change for the better for him, especially with Trey. Did not see what happens in this story coming.<br />Gideon's part in this story I think was the only one I actually liked. Ya I hate Cornie popping up like, everywhere, but he seemed more proud and more open then Eva was.<br />I cant believe there is going to be a book 4 when we were told book 3 would be it. Its upsetting because I was already on pins and needles in this book trying to deal with understanding why all this drama all of a sudden popped up and now I'll have to read through more drama.....not interested in reading consistent drama. Its a mood killer.<br />I really don't know what happened to hurt this story....feels like it really went off the beaten path of the first 2 books.

061891868X|5.0|I am already a fan of Lee Smolin, having enjoyed his &#34;Three Roads to Quantum gravity&#34;. On a recent visit to the Pacific Northwest, where I displaced my grandson from his bedroom, I found a copy in his library and began poking around in it.  I ended up reading all the chapters of the book in almost random order—I was more interested in the chapters toward the end, so I read them first. Then I took home my grandson's copy and sent him a new copy from Amazon.<br /><br />Smolin's expectations of his readers are that they are interested in the state of the science of physics today, are willing to take on a philosophical or esthetic perspective, and know enough about the &#34;standard model&#34; to wonder where we go from there. If that describes you, then here is a great read. Smolin has an engaging style—much of my reading was at bedtime, and it took discipline to put the book down. On the other hand, he sometimes leads you into a quandary from which you have to put the book down, and ponder for hours or days.<br /><br />And by the way, although Smolin has his own philosophical and esthetic position, he is not dogmatic about it, and leaves the door open for new perspectives beyond any that he has laid out.<br /><br />If this review intrigues you, then read &#34;The Trouble With Physics&#34;
0062238868|5.0|This give you the grounds eye view of how it really happened.<br />Great little side stories about day to day fighting in Iraq that the Gov. will never admit to.

B007TUAHVQ|5.0|My son loves this kit! Whar else can I say? Mega bloks makes cool stuff. We have never been disapointed with any of their kits.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|Is a good enough game, but the daily quests/challenges, start for me mid morning and only give me 12 hours to do. Or the time changes on them half way through the day and I think I have 24 hrs then, and it's gone by night. I also worked all weekend to get the special blue ray and should have gotten it and it didn't give it to me. Also the daily quest said to grow 3 rare seeds, and I had to grow 8 for the weekend challenge and it only marked 1 of them. Major bugs that need to be fixed.
1423136802|5.0|it was amazing .. i like percy jackson stories<br />the stories, the series And the characters are also one of the best part of the story
B00AEUU4LQ|5.0|This book was a fascinating look at the recent history of Afghanistan and the way some the people of that country coped with the tribulations of terrible times.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Eben Alexander's book goes a long way to evolving faith and shifting the traditional narrow patriarchal conservative views of heaven and God. If the reader is willing to proceed with the author on his journey and set aside their doubts and fears, reading this book  could literally change one's life.
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I don't know what they were thinking casting Tom Cruise as Jack reacher. He is completely unconvincing, and misses the entire point of the character. For fans of the Lee Child books, stay away.
B00BHBBSZ2|1.0|I really should've known. I didn't like this app at all because u cannot type on it. It only lets you handwrite. Which is why this app is called 'handwrite'. But,  if u wish to handwrite and not type, then this is the perfect app for u!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game Is fun it is like subway surfer but more fun than I ever had with subway surfer and temple run because it is cool and fun.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's fun but it needs more things to go with it like battles against other people not just on Facebook the Eiffel towers go perfect right now.

B004WGGQPQ|2.0|If the tools can be made thinner I haven't found out how. Everything being the same width is boring. The paint doesn't look as good ad the Icon.
B006N0YWGY|3.0|It's a fun game for some time, then it becomes a some kinf of repeting, all ways then same. My two cents!
B00CFITJKW|1.0|DONT BE FOOLED LIKE I WAS. This was a COMPLETE waste of money. When you're looking at the photos, it doesn't seem like such a bad game... until you play it. The plane looks nothing like a plane, horrible graphics and render distance, the cockpit view looks nothing like the real thing or like it does in the photos. Shall I mention the engine sound is just a warped grinding sound. They talk about physics in the description, I don't know where they are but it has absolutely NO earthly physics. Also, NASA is mentioned in the description; the creator of this game needs to apologize to NASA for even mentioning them. If anyone from NASA played this game they'd laugh. I was a little skeptical when I saw that the creator had no idea how to use proper grammar. I guess I should have trusted my guts on this one. (Note to Creator: You should probably stick to paper and glue). If you want a REAL simulator, try RORTOS F-18 Landing Simulator. Its free and a whole hell of a lot better than this piece of junk.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|If you like sudoku this is a great game to play. It has several options of sudoko to play in different ways and different challenges
B003MX6QPU|3.0|500 days of a lukewarm summer. The key to successful romance is desire. So many times when it works, you learn that the leads are engaged in an off-screen romance. But, Zooey and Joseph were obviously never so inclined. The story was doomed from the start when the narrator, announces it is not a love story.  Joseph's character never makes much sense and Zooey's is a mystery from beginning to end. Though it tries to be cute and funny, it's a downer!
B00DAXXO98|5.0|It gives you an insight into what can & probably does go on in Washington.  Couldn't wait for next episode.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Entertainment, but not fluff. Get some history along with the eye candy in the beautiful sets and wardrobe. Keeps me guessing what will happen next and a perspective of the views of our ancestors.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I like fighting deadbeats  especially lizards mostly and the free radicals  the lizard is hard to beat  the carpet that give health and getting lizard health is hard
B003JYOFIW|5.0|Takes me back to the 80's when I was in high school, more great music from the best band I have heard.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I think this game did everything great in every way I even spent the money on it and I love it!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|and was even more impressed by the books. I highly recommend the books to anyone who likes this genre and liked the series.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Like most superhero dramas the events are totally implausible but if you suspend disbelief you find the characters are interesting and the action fun.  In real life, vigilantism is unethical and unacceptable.  In this fantasy world he is helping society by bringing down the bad guys.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Nanny McPhee was a great family film that everyone in my house enjoyed, including my husband who is very picky!
B007REV4YI|3.0|Resent having to pay for a DVD and then be subjected to endless &#34;previews&#34;  - probably one of the last purchases I will make, better to get advertisement free downloads or watch on Netflix.  Dave Cory
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|my kindle fire is taking me a bit to get used to the touchiness but I am having a good time with this game :)
B003XDZLTG|5.0|I really enjoy my Shayna Crocs. They are lightweight and comfortable and can be worn with pants or casual skirts and dresses. They're also great for the pool because water doesn't hurt them. The only problem was that, although I am a solid size 7, I had to exchange them for a 6 because the 7 was too long. I don't know if others have had that experience. I had previously ordered Crocs boots, and those ran true to size.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|This movie really started out great and ended up a little flat.  Django is a freed slave and begins work with a German bounty hunter, who is the best character.  They eventually head to Candie Land, a plantation where Django's wife is being held.  This is where the movie trails downward.  Leonardo DiCaprio is Candie, and he turns in a good performance, but there's a lot of repetitive dialogue.
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|Works wonderfully. Great color, great reds even below 90 feet. Just be careful to protect it from scratches when in the boat.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Gideon and Eva's story is so entrancing.  This was the best book yet.  Cant wait for the next installment of their saga.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|The vibe of this album reminds me of a Dave Matthews or O.A.R. kinda record which I really like. I've yet to find a song that's even remotely bad.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This series never fails to deliver action and suspense! The characters are all believable and the scenarios thought provoking in the extreme!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. it was hard at some parts but in the beginning very easy. it was for sure a logic game and will have any one thinking.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|Should be required reading. Good old fashioned fun. No wonder it is a classic. Tom Sawyer is every boys dream character.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Perfectly executed show. See why Henry Cavill, Jonathan Rhys Meyers and Natalie Dormer are such fast rising stars.<br />Loved it.
B00AQCMK32|5.0|I LOVE THIS APP!!! even though this game is $2.50, it's totally worth it!!! You get to create your own games and sell them, but not on the real app store. you can fire people and hire them, and even get reviews!!! It is also REALLY addictive! This guy comes over and you can buy things from him, and them use them, and a woman guides you so you can get the hang of it! Listen to the five star reviews!<br />  &lt;3 Good Luck! &lt;3
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its way fun and cute! Way entertaining gotta love the minions! It is challenging but not too difficult! The whole family loves it!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Love this book. Her humor and writing kept me reading and laughing. Easy, fun read and she really spoke to the working woman, no matter what age!  Highly recommend!
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|The plot was not very well thought out and the characters were poorly developed.  Decent action scenes but this series should have ended a couple movies ago.
014241722X|5.0|I have read other books by John Grisham so I decided to buy this one when I saw it on a search.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|I have enjoyed watching Tom Selleck playing different roles. The series of Jesse Stone has become one of my favorites to watch. The writing and directing of this series is one of the best I have seen in a long time. Tom's performance is outstanding! His character is a no nonsense kind of a guy and I find that very refreshing. I like people who stand for what they know to be true and right and they don't let anyone turn them from that no matter if it is fortune or fame.
014242613X|5.0|I have read other books by John Grisham so I decided to buy this one when I saw it on a search.

B0091REZMW|5.0|I honestly love this game because I LOVE solving mysteries and I also really like that you also get a hidden picture game at the same time.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Phantom has been one of my longtime favorites.  I've been fortunate to have enjoyed it in New York, Phoenix, Germany and Australia.<br />There aren't enough superlatives in my vocabulary to describe this anniversary version.<br />If you enjoy Phantom, I believe that you will enjoy this.
B00CV5ZPA2|1.0|I used to really like this guy as a producer and MC. But now, I just don't know anymore. His lyrics transformed from inspiring and thoughtful to lewd and, if I may say so, just quite tasteless. If you listen to this album before checking the long list of high end producers on it, you might conclude that the production was done by a group of college boys who found their dad's old synthesizer. I know Kanye's material has been slowly sinking, but I just don't see any redeeming features about this album.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is an entertaining game.  Each level is challenging but not unsolvable. It keeps me interested.<br />It is lots of fun.
0670026557|5.0|I was given a 65% giver by the survey. I hit giver doormat issues earlier & have been proactively discovering strategies to overcome. I already formed some of the stuff such as matching a taker.<br />This book helped me by reducing the time I need for categorizing all the issues i faced earlier & systematically suggesting solutions so I don't have to think through everything on my own - which could have been lengthy.<br />I recommend this book to all givers, especially giver doormats.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Full of fun and suspense, it's always a great read. As a teacher, i love reading about innovative problem-solving Problem solvers unite!!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Despicable Me is a fun heart warming movie for the whole family. The minions are annoying and cute at the same time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have finally found a game that I truly enjoy. Please create more levels! I am addicted and would love to play more!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Reading some other reviews I could not reconcile the raves with the movie I saw.  I think Daniel Craig has done a great job with the role, but it seemed to me the filmmakers couldn't decide what decade they were in.  We've all seen the myriad reboots or film treatments of TV series in which the original star has a cameo - with the many, many references to Bond's past I kept waiting for the old M, Moneypenny, and Q to pop in.  Javier Bardem reels back and forth from the arrogance of Goldfinger to the innapropriate laughter of Walken to the ineptitude of Kotto.  M is wounded, walks a mile in the dark, jumps to her feet for a final confrontation - And then suddenly (watch the movie).  The plot has some problems as well: Let's go hide where no one can find us, except let's let them find us, and make sure that although our organization knows where we are they do nothing to support us.  Oh, and let's not take along anything that can be construed as a WEAPON, for heaven's sake, so we can honor Macguyver while we honor Bond's past.  All those complaints aside, Craig is a terrific Bond in attitude, and does a fair job dealing with his own limitations even though the script keeps hitting us over the head with that theme.  You almost expect passersby in the Tube to ask Bond if he's up to the challenge.  Judi Dench has forever been the M with facets - a strong presence, an M who understands consequences and gray areas, and who ultimately is loyal and responsible.  Naomie Harris was gorgeous if a little mouthy for a junior agent, but left little time for Berenice Marlohe who's character could have been fleshed out more (although Bond did, of course).  And Bardem, and Ralph Fiennes, fine actors who are given little to work with in the script.  Fiennes is a bureaucrat who proves himself in action, and the outstanding introduction of Bardem's Silva falls apart later.  All in all, I'll place this bond in the Top Ten for plot and villain, Top Five for action sequences, but in the second division for the humor and ladies.
B000JQV68A|2.0|Did not keep my attention, I could not follow with the verbage and there was not anything in there about the flapper or jazz age, had to put it down after reading half of it.  The Great Gatsby was the best though.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Best Game App I've Seen. Graphics Rock, Fun unique game Play, Lots Of Levels And Challenges. Great For All Ages. Worth Every Cent Even If The Price goes Up. Enjoy!!
B004XNGKBS|4.0|I've only owned my Kindle about a week but soon after I also purchased a stylus and started using this software.  I use it to take math notes so that I can tag my notes and find them again quickly later. I really like this app but my frustration is that there are some minor issues that end up causing some big usability issues.  As a handwriting app it does a great job of picking up my writing quickly and lets me immediately see whether I wrote something correctly.  I tried a lot of other apps that didn't do this well, so it's not a given on the Kindle.  Note that as my page of notes grows longer, the app slowly becomes less and less responsive.  Unfortunately I think this is a limitation of the Kindle hardware and not really the fault of the app, but it is a little annoying.  I generally have to break my notes up into multiple files.<br /><br />Possibly my biggest frustration is that the color selector for my current tool is buried under several sub-menus.  This means while writing quickly, I have to stop and access the tool menu, then the color menu, then select my color, then go back up twice.  This isn't usually possible in a hurry and I usually end up taking notes in all black.  I realize this isn't that big of a deal, but sometimes a little color on a big page of notes really helps you identify things, especially keywords and important sections. I feel like there is room in other parts of the screen such that a color selector could be added almost anywhere to let you quickly change your current tool's color, without any submenus.<br /><br />Although email export works great, I had a lot of issues when trying to print the exported PDFs.  There is a setting for export width, but it doesn't work well when the entire document is exported a single image and the width gets cropped.  This means for a document that might be 4 pages long, it will instead print 1 page and either scale all the writing down to become unreadable, or it will clip the image when it reaches the bottom of the pages.  I wish that the PDF export (and I tried the image exports too) put linefeeds (^L in postscript) in to split longer documents onto multiple pages so they can be printed easily.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Picks up writing quickly (unless page gets long)<br />-Good folder setup that allows nested folders. Makes organization really easy!<br />-Email export is fantastic.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Export settings lets you set &#34;Width of export&#34;, but lacks any sort of visual indicator as to where that line actually is.  This<br />-Tagging doesn't work well and often comes up with a blank entry for no reason.<br />-Search doesn't seem to search everything I would expect it to (e.g. tags).  This might be user error on my part, though.<br />-Changing the color of your tool is buried under several sub-menus.<br /><br />Overall, this app is better than nearly all the other handwriting apps I've tried.  But, some of the issues I have with it really make me feel like the app's potential is limited until they fix them or a better app comes along.  For now it's worth the few bucks to increase my productivity.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is very addictive, and even bettered them pc version.  It's definitely worth the money in my opinion, maybe a little much but fire three dollars it's fine.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Love the book could not put it down  I recommend it to all my friends and family and I can't wait for it to be a movie
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is fantastic for both kiddos and adults. Defiantly one that will be watched over and over again. A great buy!
B007W8S2MG|4.0|The series with it's cult following enters the Golden era with the this entry.  The game is perfectly suited to the portable platform with its non-typical layout.  With focus on building relationships outside dungeons, you get to know each character.  Those relationships build into statistics for your characters Personas.<br /><br />While this game is not perfect, it does pull you into its world to unravel the mysteries of the Midnight Channel.  The music score is a mixed bag, but fits the overall theme of the title.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about this title, I would recommend grabbing it for $20.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I am also in the military and have the most respect for all special operations units. Seal Team Six puts everything on the line time and time again. This book is a page turn er that won't let you down.
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|This book was recommended to me by a friend. I started reading it and had a little difficulty getting into it at first. It is VERY well written (great imagery and vocabulary) but it took me about a third of the book to really get engrossed. Once I was that far, I was totally hooked! I was reading daily on my 40-minute commute and I couldn't wait to get on the train and pick it up again.<br /><br />It's not a &#34;feel good&#34; book but certainly a fascinating one -- very intelligently written, with some unexpected turns. I highly recommend! (4 stars instead of 5 because of the slow start)
B003GDFQX4|5.0|This was my second reading of this book. I believe I had missed some details on the first round. Though I knew it, I felt a tingling sensation when Jackal's name is discovered and the way he stays ahead of Lebel, Claude Lebel is a great character.<br /><br />Forsyth is a master storyteller and this is a wonderful story
B0061PEAUY|2.0|As I stated in my last review I purchased two of these REICH'S books thinking that they were Bones Tv series. Only the last few chaptes ,in my opinion,were captivating. HOPEFULLY I can find the TV series books.
B0013V33DG|5.0|I saw this in the Live in HD broadcast and loved it so much...even though I have not enjoyed this particular opera in the past.  Such great performances.
B008JFUOVI|1.0|I greatly enjoyed the first film, the second I thought was more repetitive, but the third I saw in the theater and I almost walked out. I never walk out of films, but I didn't laugh once, I wasn't entertained, and I would have shut it off if I was at home watching it. It doesn't even feel like it's part of the same series.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I would like to give it 3 1/2 stars. Parts were really good and other parts a little slow. However, overall enjoyable read. Well developed characters and really like this author, knows how to keep your interest.  Mostly I just loved his other two books.  His other two were two of my favorite books I've ever read.  So , in comparison it was not as exciting as I was expecting.
B004PGO25O|5.0|If you are working on a project but find yourself struggling to move forward with any consistency - I, a stranger on the internet, implore you to read this book.<br /><br />I was delightfully surprised by this book. I'm working on several projects at the moment, and finding this by accident was very auspicious. This is something I'll have in my library for the rest of my life.<br /><br />Every word in this book is important - not a single letter is wasted. It is filled with wonderful, but practical advice that is broad enough to apply to most any discipline, but specific enough to get to the emotional heart of the issue.<br /><br />It often just boils down to awareness and choice. Make the right one, and pick up this book. It shouldn't take you more than a few hours to read it the first time, and I guarantee you'll find some nuggets in here that will stay with you for years to come.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|this movie is extraordinary. it is about regrets forgiveness and the changes that we experience with aging. it doesnt dwell too much on any one thought and has a nice pace. it shows how we all still grow and change with the turning of time and yet how we sometimes can and cannot let go of life events. highly recommend for everyone...especially the fantastic music.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|My Grandaughter downloaded this, with my permission.  After opening it I found it didn't do much without investing some money in it.  She didn't get to play it because she went home.  I will write another evaluation after she plays it.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great flick!  Lots of drama and graphic gunfights peppered with intelligent humor!  I would recommend it highly.  Jamie Foxx was brilliant!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I have not been able to set the correct time so it is a little frustating to me.  Maby when I get that figured out I will be able to evaluate it better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My wife and I love this program. We were hooked from day one and continue to look forward to the next show.
B00CH26TL8|5.0|I really like to play.  I havn't got very far this time but when I played on facebook I was a laittle slow too.  Definately reccomedn for fast intertainment
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Kudos to the writer and actors! We are very much enjoying this program and are looking forward to season 4 being available on DVD.
0553801473|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and can't wait to read the next one.<br />I have never considered myself much of a reader but I highly recommend A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin.
B00CBSYDSE|5.0|Was recommended by Amazon, and had to buy after getting the sampler. Was about to recommend to a friend, and noticed she had already put it in her Top 10 Albums of 2013. Well deserved.
074322454X|5.0|I loved it. Exactly what I expected, having seen the movie...it provoked my interest to by Parachute Infantry by David Webster...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Fun game and pretty easy to play. There's plenty of fun things to do and you don't  have to spend real world money.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is total fun!! Great way to pass time when your bored..love the puzzles and everything its pretty cool ha :)
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I saw this documentary/story film on the plane and absolutely loved it.  What a fascinating story about<br />a true talent that never really was successful in this country yet impacted a whole generation in South Africa<br />during their difficult times.  He helped give a voice to a generation that gave them the courage to speak out<br />against injustice...AND HE NEVER KNEW IT.  Even though he was obviously cheated out of royalties he never<br />seemed to be bitter and continued to live his life and content himself with hard manual labor and teaching<br />his children to value themselves.  The story about the search for him and his discovery and validation as<br />a great songwriter.  He is a more poetic Dylan.  It is a true feel good movie.<br />I have been playing his two CD's non-stop and have shown Searching for Sugar Man to several people.<br />Everyone has really liked it.<br />Lynda M
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Frankly I felt it was boring,it jumped back and forth,and I never understood why he had been in a mental facility
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|After reading a good portion of the reviews for this book, I was extremely hesitant to purchase it.  So many poor reviews.  A couple of my friends read it and said they loved it, so I decided to bite the bullet and get it.  I am sooooooo glad I did!  I am not sure where these poor reviews came from....I loved this book!!!! I am one of those readers that has a hard time stopping reading once I have started and have gotten hooked......needless to say, I was up until 2am reading this!  A couple parts made me go \\"hmmmmmm\\", and then there were the parts that made me go \\"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\\"........with the way this story ended, I am not sure where the story will go in the next book, but no matter what, I will purchase it!  No hesitating this time!!
B008VVT51U|5.0|Enjoyed watching this movie again. Good themes of redemption for those who are of a certain age. And some very funny dialogue.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Well this is one show you pretty much had better watch from the start to understand it all.  Don't miss a episode, because if you do, then you won't be able to follow along. I missed much of the televised episodes because of conflicts with other shows that I thought were better.  Having the opportunity to watch back to back episodes without commercial made it for me. The show rocks and the acting is great. Good edge of your seat stuff, wondering what was going to happen next.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It does what I needed it to do and couldn't beat the price!  I don't know what else needs saying.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Do not like the looks of this one, the last one told you the basic things you wanted to know.  The radar map was better.
B003IWRE3I|1.0|I cannot think of one good thing to say about this movie.  I only watched a short while and left the room.  This is not fit for anyone to watch...and especially children!
B006FE83UE|5.0|I have always loved this film, can't believe it is in it's 50th year. Would highly recommend film, perfect addition to my collection.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its a really fun game it keeps me occupied I can play it for hours people say ot stops working on the kindle fire and yea it did but keep it cuz it will start working again mine did and its great!!!!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|A little violent, expecially at the end with the Reevers but otherwise good si-fi, a little romantic tension , of course, Nathan Fillion, who is &#34;hot&#34; & good supporting case, well-rounded, etc. Good fun.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|A real good book it's a good page turner suspenseful lot of action and its just cool like that<br />.
B002C949KE|5.0|Dan Ariely is a fantastic writer with the ability to infuse humor and accessibility into a subject that is already fascinating, but can appeal to anyone, whether in business or life.  I would highly recommend to anyone with an interest in human behavior - why we make the everyday decisions we do.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|...unless you like tragic tales of suicidal quadriplegics with nothing significant to be learned from them, which I don't.  While the main characters are likable there is really nothing inspired about them, or about this novel.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Though the book caught my attention I didn't like it much. Found the plot to be very twisted. Very different style of writing. I'd recommend to give it a pass.
B00D6BU8GG|5.0|Just what you would expect from a Bruce Willis movie- nice and mindless, full of action, totally entertaining- I'd recommend it
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This book, like all the others, is exceptional in the character development and story. I read it in four days and could not wait to purchase the next book. The historical documentation is evidence that Gabaldon does her homework.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|A much more interesting version of temple run. I really liked the graphics. It's a good time pass. I recommend this game.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|When I play games I don't want to have to pay in order to continue to play that just gets to expensive.  I just want to play for fun.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so cool. I almost didn't want to play it. But then when I got to playing it, I got so addicted and didn't want to stop because it kept me interested. I love how you can enter your horse in competitions and then win XP and rewards so you can do more competitions.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I couldn't get the hang of what I was suppose to do in order to play the game I would rather play for enjoyment.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I wanted to read this book because I liked  this author's way of writng in his two previous books; however, I found this book to be a little disjointed. Just as I'm getting used to the characters in one chapter, that whole story ends and another begins.(almost like a collection of short stories with a vague family theme running through them) It was enjoyable, but not as much as his other two.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I just watched this series and I wish I could watch Season 4! I liked how it showed the difference between staff and homeowners.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Come one I mean who doesn't love minecraft!  IF U DONT UR LAME!!! GET MINECRAFT OR U SHALL DIE!!!<br />fyi I recommend this app!
B003ZMF26W|5.0|I love this mouse, I use it for gaming and casual use. Definitely recommended if you like this style mouse.
B008WALV94|5.0|Ive loved Belinda since I first heard of her a few years ago and she just seems to get better and better ABSOLUTELY LOVE Litost and I love you (te quiero)
B0064X7FVE|1.0|it was aa good app untill last month. there is to many things to do with it its confusing. itvwont let me see  the 36 hour forcast. please no not get!!!
1416575464|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter after she closed on her first home, and she really found it quite helpful, with great decorating tips.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Good challenging (yet simple) time waster. Very enjoyable. Great and smooth graphics. I would recommend it. Thanks for making it :-)
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I bought this for my brother for christmas and he really enjoyed this and you couldnt beat the price. cheaper then everywhere else i tried
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Even though the stylus itself was pricey I think it worth the money since you get three very different styluses and they all work very well together.
B00D2K40WY|4.0|My daughter plays this salon game alot. If you have tried others they tend to be alot alike but my daughter switches back and forth all the time between them
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It's certainly an easy read but it's good for any age (preteen to adult)! The main character is a strong female character amidst a very sad and controlled world. It's full of action and drama. Plus it has a lot more to it than the movie has! Highly recommended.
B002ZG980U|4.0|I bought this for my brother for christmas and he really enjoyed this and you couldnt beat the price. cheaper then everywhere else i tried
B007N85POS|5.0|My grandson really enjoys this game, it's one of his favorite.<br />It has helped him with decision making skills and he has<br />built up his skills with this one.
B001OQCV6A|4.0|I bought this for my brother for christmas and he really enjoyed this and you couldnt beat the price. cheaper then everywhere else i tried
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This is a cute game and my grandson enjoys it.<br />Per him, he likes it not loves it, but he plays it often.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Probably the last in the series we will see for some time, this book focuses on Danaerys, Arya, Jon Snow, and the Iron Borne, while touching on a few of the other characters. If you've read the others you don't really have a choice; you must continue and it does not disappoint other than in the fact there is so much more to wrap up and the timing between new books is lengthy.
B007KQ6XYY|4.0|Really enjoyed by grandson he likes cutting the candy and he<br />likes it a lot, but doesn't love it or so he says.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|You are drawn in and care about the characters.  Victoria is a richly developed. All at once, flawed yet loveable.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|While the action is good and the fight scene between Jessica Biel and Kate Beckinsale will live in my mind forever I just did not enjoy this movie. I found myself missing the original version and the campy acting by Arnold Schwarzenegger.
B00AQ71FLK|2.0|When I first saw this game I thought that there would be a main story to it but it's really just a bunch of fighting with other people but if there was a main story I would probably give it five stars I suggest you don't get it unless you like to just battle others
1419705849|5.0|I choose this rating because i have read it almost 2 times and i thought i would rate i love it
1594204217|5.0|The author researches his topics in depth and then adds stories to make them so readable - I have loved all of his books.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is really fun and it is really fun... it's a great game for cities...I've tried others but loved this one it's really realistic
B003FFEX8C|4.0|This is just a fun movie. I recommend it as brain candy. Halle Berry is cool as the heroine. Sharon Stone is her bitchest best.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Survival craft is a great game it is like mind craft but in a cheaper version. I think if  you want to play mind craft then get this game. I've this game!!!!!!!
B0014BY72Q|1.0|This movie (had to be a tax writeoff) was mentioned in the new Dan Brown book.<br /><br />He had also mentiioned \\"a little romance\\" staring Diane Lane and<br />we decided to watch that film.  We watched \\"A Little Romance\\" and<br />it was a really nice fun movie that we both enjoyed.<br /><br />Since we enjoyed that film we decided rent Logan's Run.  Big<br />mistake because it was too bad to actually watch.  Save your money.
B00785P2QC|5.0|the game is just amazing and i recommend it to everyone it is very addictive and adventurous with so much stuff to do!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Yeah, they were alright, not quite as good a read as the &#34;Girl with the Dragon Tattoo&#34; , but pretty good !!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This is a entertaining and challenging game. I am a adult and enjoy puzzles and matching games but this is fun entertainment. I would give it a five but I do not like the fact that you can't jump down, only up.  If they would fix that,I would surely give it a five.
B00B7ERH04|3.0|This app is a must have app BUT only if you have internet access while using this app. I recommend the Nexus 7 app if you want to take videos and pictures when there is no internet access. I love how you can zoom in and out and pick a landscape. You can't do that with a Nexus 7 camera. I rated this 3 stars because I usually go over to my grandparents house and want to take videos of me doing cartwheels. But there is no internet there, so I can't use it. It's worthless. But I can take pictures on it and be able to zoom in and out. I like it, except of the video camera. On the Nexus 7 camera all you can do is take the video. You can't zoom in and out. But you do not need internet access. This app can not be over 3 stars for me! :(
B00CLF80O0|5.0|This live double CD has everything a fan could want, classic Snake and new Snake. The energy of the band comes pounding through the speakers and never lets up. This is one of the best live albums in many years. If you can't make it to a live Whitesnake concert, this is a fantastic substitute. So, put out your hand and enjoy the bite!
B00881VLCE|5.0|This game is fun and it has a ton of choices for puzzles. It's a good way to pass time.
B000T433L0|4.0|This movie was a great one. A true De niro Classic. It just gives insight to how this one man who really doesn't have a lot of education or social skills sees the world and at the end of the day it leaves you guessing who the real hero is in society sometimes.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I chose to rate this book with 5 stars. The reason is that it is by far my favorite beginning to any fantasy series I have ever had the pleasure of reading. And, believe me, I have read almost every fantasy series out there. The Kingkiller Chronicle, in my opinion, tops that of even J.R.R. Tolkien 's Middle Earth, and the Seven Kingdoms and beyond of George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series. There is not a thing I dislike about this book, and I recommend it to everyone, fantasy lovers or not. Once you read it, even before the story really begins, you will be hooked. I am about to read the 2nd book in the series, The Wise Man's Fear, yet again as I have with The Name of the Wind countless times. I cannot wait for book 3 to come out which I believe will be titled, The Doors of Stone, to come out tentatively set to be sometime in 2014 I believe.
B001N3OJEG|4.0|This movie is filled with great actors. But Russell Crowe is my favorite in this. Don't want to five away anything. But if you like a movie where enemies become allies in the sake of justice and if you enjoy great acting this is a must see.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Each character is drawn well in the storylines and the acting is superb.  I want to know what happens to these people.
B000I186FW|5.0|I love Natalie Portman and in this film she's fantastic.  You almost forget that she is not actually an English actress. The plot is great and it makes you question yourself about democracy and revolution. Great film!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|well acted - great storyline.  Enjoy the characters and how they interact in each segment.  Plots - &#34;law&#34; cases are believable.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|No instructions and it was not easy to figure out.  I think this game would be much better if you knew what you were doing.
B00881VLCE|4.0|great jigsaw puzzle game but not enough free options. keep checking for more pictures. enjoyed this app and will keep playing. hope you enjoy.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|So, Norman Reedus is a bad-ass. I wish I could have helped write the script to change Rick's interaction with the governor. Anyway, the whole series is obviously incredible. So, season 3 is not too much different.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I loved the book. They are both made for each other. Cant wait for the next book. when does it come out?
B009XIXVU6|5.0|There is so much heart and soul in Hosseini's books. This one did not disappoint me! I felt a part of the script and became enthralled with all the characters! Hosseini has a gift, a wonderful gift.
B008Y7IP0S|3.0|Great classic! Good morals and a great view of the US from back then. Pat Morita is sorely missed! Companies should revisit this movie to discuss bullying issues
B00A429YF6|5.0|Felt it to be a classic from the first time we ever saw it.  My wife and I have added this DVD version to our treasured collection of classics.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl and I have experienced some of the same things. Her book made me feel not so alone on my personal mistakes. Thank you for sharing your journey.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Excellent book on why prisons for nonviolent offenders are a waste of people's lives.  Wow!  Prison officials, prosecutors, and judges take notice, you have been exposed!<br /><br />Furious is how I'd describe my feelings for the lack of care these prisoners received.  Yes, they committed crimes, but most (not necessarily the author) were in situations that pushed them into it.  Lack of resources, love, and support cajole people into badness.  Support, care, and guidance get them out of it.  As for the power hungry prison workers, how horrible you are!  I'd be embarrassed to say i work for an establishment such as this.<br /><br />Great resources at the end of the book for those actually helping offenders and their families.  We need to stop this warehousing and reform the legal system, and these organizations are the place to start.<br /><br />It's a ten, but I was left wondering what happened to Pops and the many other women who were released with no resources.  I'm calling for a follow-up book!
B00DAXYNEI|5.0|House of cards is outstanding, Kevin Spacey character is so believable and shows how Washington really operates. I can't wait for season 2.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|lots of game choices; don't have to play the same game all the time.  I like it and enjoy it
B005J039G8|5.0|I am posting this for my star rating only.<br />Make no mistake, I really enjoy this.<br />I don't feel like taking the time to write something meaningful.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|i love this game! it is so addictive. but im stuck on level four and i keep braking the drivers neck!  lol
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I can't find a nice forecast where I can see the chance of rain over the next few days without going to each day one by one.  The old app was easy to use. This version has too much clutter.  I wish I could go back to the old one.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love this game and its so adicting but in survival mode you cant get al your stuff back when you die!
B00CF34B2I|1.0|this blows It never danloeds ive tried like 16. times I'm so tiers of it it tots socks do not buy it
B000EXZI1O|5.0|This is great music. This is one of my favorite team of people  four brother that made great music together.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The ending in the book is incredible.  Wish they would have used it in the movie.  Sets up the sequel perfectly.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This games fun but the bad news<br />Is that  they second time I played it froze.<br />The next morning I put it back on and it is still frozen.<br />You can get the app but be prepared
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|One of the most influential books of my life. Thrilling, sobering, and bold. See the rest of the books I love at [...]
B00DMM3WVM|4.0|The whole point of this game is to run into an ever increasing horde of zombies. You can either dodge them or kill them to get by but  you never stop running and never run away from them.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A Melbourne professor in genetics embarks on finding the perfect companion.<br />A fitness guru and as pedantic as it is possible to be, Don Tillman compiles a questionnaire. But when Rosie turns up, not nearly matching the criterion, the story takes on a new and intriguing twist. She works in a city bar but is also studying for a PhD, something she does not flaunt  Don helps Rosie track down her real father by deviously collecting DNA samples from likely candidates.<br />Rosie is undoubtedly attractive. And as a predictable relationship ensues one of them will need to adapt. How it turns out is something we can all learn from.<br /> Great bedtime reading resulting in very late light dimming for several days.  I will be looking out for more Graeme Simsion titles.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I liked the first temple run. Temple run 2 is pretty much the same with just a little difference in environment, characters and power ups.
B005LAIIKI|4.0|I liked it fairly well and suggested it to some friends to watch. There are a few things you can learn from watching the movie.
B00D41H2PS|1.0|NOT WORTH 1.29!!!!!!  I finished the game in half an hour.  No hidden objects. Just point and click. Very disappointed. I expected more. Decent graphics. But no thought process needed. JUST A BORING GAME.  Also no instructions. They give you one letter then toss you into the game.  If you are looking for ANY challenge....don't waste your money.  I never leave reviews....that is how disappointed I am.  ONE star ONLY. And that's for the semi decent graphics.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Another version of the game that helps you fulfill a need of an Angry Bird game on your electronic device.  Just like the game online....
B0064X7FVE|1.0|New version is just awful. Been using app for years and the new version has me looking for a different weather app!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|My wife and I can know access Facebook with our Kindles and leaves the home computer free for the kids homework and other stuff.
B004BLDD9Y|4.0|1 out of 6 failed within 6 months though!!! I hope the others last a bit longer. They still are a bit expensive .
B009VSW15Y|4.0|Great free app...turns my kindle into a great camera option.  Only draw back is that it is tricky to see exactly what you are taking photo of without some sort of view finder.
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|The best vampire show out. It makes me happy and kind of turns me on at the same Time. The characters are realistic.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Your usual version of Solitaire....all computers and electronic devices should have a copy of this game.  Add it to your list of games.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Within 2 episodes of season 1, I was hooked on Revenge! The storyline continues to make twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your eat. Can't wait for the next season!!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Our friends showed us this game, now we are all challenging each other...very fun stuff for the adults and kids
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I like this game becouse I love the movie a lot get it if you like the movie. But ago soar not like the movie ;)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Much like some of the other games I downloaded, our friends and family have been challenging each other....new twist to game night.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This started off rather simple, but I loved the challenge after only a few levels. make more! I'm hooked!<br />id highly recommend this app to all logic puzzle lovers!
B000HL2J0G|4.0|Enjoying watching these again -- watched when we were teenagers, and wondering if MacGyver's survival tricks would work. As an adult, we now know they do.  Another reason we should all have paid more attention to physics and chemistry while in school!  Not academy award acting, but great fun!
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Pretty good game. Short but challenging. Had to get my son to help me out at the end of room 8
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Engaging plot-  lots of drama! You really feel for each character's individual hardships. I can honestly say one of my favorites.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like all the humor and that it's geared for middle school students. I enjoy reading these books,  and I hope there are more coming
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Don't buy CD's very often, but don't always like what's on the radio in the car. Great listening for summer cruising!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was really good and was easy to get wrapped up in.  It also cause you to rethink the possibilities in your relationship ;)
B001LM1456|5.0|I will admit to being fairly new to the world of Marvel comics--I grew up on the DC TAS series primarily and a few other scattered DC series.  As such, I really cannot compare this Hulk to other Hulks, the old Hulks, or anything like that.  This is the review of one used to superhero stories, just not this one.<br /><br />I had no interest in the Hulk until I watched the Avengers.  I very much loved Dr. Banner so I wanted to watch his movie that led up to the Avengers.  Personally, I was very impressed.  It is an old plot line and not just to the Hulk (as the other reviewers are assuring me).  All superhero plot lines are old.  They are all variations on a theme, well a few themes.  Themes which we love to hear and watch and read and enjoy seeing reworked into ways which surprise us and make the stories new again.  Admittedly, the Hulk was fairly predictable as a whole, maybe a bit more so than normal.  But what would a fairly decent person do if he could turn into a green rage monster?--hide, try to control it, stay away from people he loved, etc.  Everything else followed.  We all knew that much of the plot coming into the movie and knew the movie was going to be about that.  You don't even need a trailer to know that.  Some of the details were predictable too.  How these details occurred, the people involved in the details, their struggles, etc. is what made the movie amazing.  It was simple, but it was a beauty to watch (allegorically--there are plenty of ugly looking things in that movie to go around :P ).  I thought the simplicity of it was part of what made it so great.  (And it was not an action movie with no depth, but a lot of explosions--it was not that sort of simple, rest assured.)<br /><br />I would say that if you need a movie to thoroughly surprise you, then you probably won't like this film.  If you want to enjoy a solid superhero story and do not have the aforementioned prerequisite, you will probably love it.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was really good and was easy to get wrapped up in.  It also cause you to rethink the possibilities in your relationship ;)
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I use this everynight i prefer the antique clock . And waking up to a song of my choosing allways makes the day easier to deal with. Having the temperature and weather is great as well. I highly recomend it
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Just as described. The sound is great and it works perfect. Have gotten it wet but not under water, just some rain and everything is fine. Love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|- The app runs really well ! The graphics are great . I love the missions &nd daily challenges . The updates work fine , too . There are a few minor gitches &nd there are ads , but you ' 'll get used to them . It ' s a great download . Pure awesome . Five stars.
B00CLZ48FA|2.0|The HD stream of this looks fantastic.  No issues there at all.  Looks crisp & clean in HD.<br /><br />The main issue is the movie itself and its lackluster story, characters and over-stretched length.  The plot begins charming enough, but quickly spirals into Oz's encounters with the hot witches and a kinda creepy looking doll.  The movie clocks in well over 2 hours which is much too long for kids and adults will get bored.  The ending looks pretty neat & provides nice visuals.<br /><br />If I saw the movie in 3D, I might have been more entertained, but without it's just long and boring.  PASS!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Few bugs and a vehicle that was added in a update in the Google play store. This needs to be updated
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really enjoy playing All-in-One Mahjong. It gives you many choices of styles and forms to play the game. Enjoy playing it on my Kindle.
B005ZUR724|1.0|Update the kindle app with all the rest of the Android devices. Leaving kindle users out during a new content launch is irritating.
B002QBS9KE|5.0|These products are exactly as described. They fit my headset and arrived promptly. They are identical to the eartips that originally came with my headset.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I knew it was going to be on my xbox but not on my kindle fire! I'm a big fan of magic I play it with my friends all the time.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is very addictive but when you get to level 10 it's over what's up with that??? I loved it but want more levels
B002VHI8J0|4.0|book is easier to understand than the movie.  Book tells the stories sequentially with only small links that must be watched out for.
B008NCSZQ8|1.0|So 2-1/2 hours of my life was wasted on this movie.  Good thing I didn't pay for it because it was free with Amazon Prime.  Just a bunch of characters mashed together into a disjointed movie.  Hardly a plot line to be found.  The only enjoyable part was seeing Scarlet Johannsen in her tight suit.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Wonderful love story. Was not expecting that ending but like the saying goes \\"everything happens for a reason.\\" LOVED IT :)
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|This is one of my favorite Die Hard movies yet, it has all the action that a normal Die Hard fan would expect. When you rent or buy the movie you know that there will be a ridiculous amount of action, thats why you watch it! It might be a little different from the other Die Hard movies but thats more exciting and unpredictable.
1608199096|5.0|This is a spectacular book with dreamy photos, great info for anyone interested in having an authentic (rather than a touristy) experience in Venice and really evocative and delicious looking recipes. Only problem for Americans is that the ingredients are in grams, etc. as the book is from England. Sure it's not too hard to figure out the equivalents, but both would have been helpful. Lots of the recipes are assembled rather than cooked, so many can be easily figured out. The binding is unique and the paper is beautiful. It's really worth the money if the subject is up your alley.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Argo is a good movie with roots in actual events.  However it is not something I would come back to and watch repeatedly.  Definitely see it once.  Good renter but not a keeper.
B00005MNP8|4.0|Blondie is/was a group, but Debbie Harry was something else again.  I've read that she never quite understood why people would refer to her as \\"iconic,\\" which may be something akin to someone like Cher announcing to the world that she's not a \\"Cher fan.\\"  It's not false modesty exactly, but if you're in on the joke and in on the image-making, you can't help but shrug some of it of. Leastwise if you have a modicum of intelligence and a bit of sense of humor--which Deborah Harry most certainly does (as does Cher, by the way).    In the mid-70s, I was aware of Blondie and mildly curious about the band, but I'll admit that I didn't pay all THAT much attention to them.  They were a New York thing back then, I thought, and--quite against all expectations--I was quite far away from all that.  I mean, the Velvet Underground had no bigger fan than me, and in their wake, I got pretty caught up in the New York Dolls.  And in a different, but no less New York vein, there was my true musical love, Laura Nyro.  Then suddently, I kind of lost interest in all things Gotham-ic right around the time things started exploding around the CBGB scene.  My timing was never all that good.    But then they started playing \\"Heart of Glass\\" on the radio, and boy, was that aever a revelation.  Just about the perfect song, I thought.  If this was \\"disco,\\" well, I was all for it.  Cool--and emotive at the same time.  I had no idea if it had anything at all to do with the Werner Herzog movie of the same name, but even if it didn't, the fact that it shared a title with a film so daring and so avant-garde (this was the one with the hypnotized actors, you'll recall) was icing on the arthouse cake.    So much has been said about Mike Chapman's production--and he even gets to do the liner notes on the CD release, which are very revealing of group dynamics and tensions.  If it was really Chapman's production that helped to break the band, then we gotta give credit where credit is due.  BUT here's the thing, couldn't the vocals have been brought out a LITTLE more?  This is one case where you DON'T want the lyrics buried.  They're clever--well, more than that; there's a casual poetics going on there that you want to hear. Debbie's vocals (while not dynamic) are effective readings of same when you can HEAR them.    Yeah, I know, I know. The Stones have intriguing lyrics too, but muddy vocals are just about de rigueur for them.  I dunno why, but it's different for Blondie, OK?    Blondie is/was a group, but Debbie Harry was, after all, the Blonde. And if she hadn't existed, someone would've had to invent her.  (Well, actually, someone DID--Debbie herself.)  But as sheeny a surface as it was, it wasn't all surface. She brought out another side to the tough-but-sensitive angle that Janis Joplin had embodied in a different (SF hippie) setting.  But she had the coolness--and flair for abstraction--of Grace Slick or even Nico.    Debbie's often cited as something of a precursor to Madonna, which is not totally unfair.  They both wanted to be Marilyn Monroe in their different ways.  But even if the adopted Debbie WASN'T Marilyn's biological daughter (as she fantasized as a girl) and even though she affected an urban coolness and sophistication, she still projected more of an authentic 50s vulnerability than Madonna could muster in the 80s (and likely wouldn't have wanted to).  Ultra-cool--but also kinda likeable when you got down to it.    And Blondie was/is a group.  And a good one at that.  In popular mythology, Debbie remains the figurehead, Chris Stein her Svengali and Clem, Jimmy and Gary the doubtlessly talented and capable back-seat contributors waiting in the wings for some due credit and willing to look both exquisitely cool AND kinda geeky on the album cover.  Somehow that all seems to make them the quintessential band for the year 1978.    And they haven't aged badly at all.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|If you like simple entertainment this game is great.  The game is free and if you don't like it then you can delete it without losing anything but your time.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|This is really a good all around Hero movie. It's hard to go wrong with Robert Downey Junior. The adventures jumped right out of comic books onto the big screen and you won't be disappointed.
0439023521|5.0|This book is definitely a page turner. I read it all in two sittings and hope to finish books two and three by the weekend.<br /><br />The characters in the books were so well done. I loved that Katniss was flawed, not portrayed as a perfect, brave warrior. It made her impossible not to empathise with.<br /><br />The story moved along at a good pace without ever seeming to slow down or lose it's way and summed up niceky at the end while still leaving the hints about the next book. (My pet hate as a reader is a book which doesn't tie up loose ends so you need to buy the next book, not an issue here).<br /><br />It definitely made you think a bit more about how lucky we are in what we have, and leave you with the eerie thought that this could really happen. Vampires, space travel, mermaids, they're all easy to keep just as fantasy. But keeping the masses cintrolled after a way, could, happen. It hit a nerve. Fantastic story though!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Still getting used to this format. So far,the means of navigation is very intuitive. Getting the weather information couldn't be easier!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love that all the movies are in one box.  Everything is great quality!  Exactly what I was looking for!!  Awesome!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I personally had to seek help multiple times and was very difficult. I'd got really annoyed at times and after trying certain things. They didn't work. After I watched a video for help. it showed what I did. that didn't work. I went back did it again. and it worked. but I give this a high recommendation.
145210655X|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Father's Day.  He absolutely loved it!!  It is one of the cutest things I have ever seen.  He loves to sit and read it to our son!  So cute!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This season got me more hooked! This season is better than the first, I couldnt stop watching it. I can't wait for season 3!
B001OG3VOQ|4.0|great sound!!!! brings back memories I wish I would have bought the explicit version... sounds pretty good but I do suggest power amp app
B00BPJ5Z96|4.0|The 40th anniversary edition of Enter the Dragon on Blu-ray was definitely worth the purchase.<br /><br />You get some really cool content like three new documentaries, each running from 10 to 30 minutes in length, plus all of the old features from the earlier release are still included. All in all, you're getting a lot of video separate from the main feature itself, which is great. I think, also, as far as I can tell, they've touched up the image quality of the film. It looks a lot crisper on my television at least.<br /><br />I'm really digging the new packaging and all the goodies that came in the slip case. Especially the lenticular print image of Bruce Lee with the nunchaku. It's a really cool addition.<br /><br />Definitely buy this if you're a fan. Even if you're not the biggest fan of Bruce and you don't already own this film on blu-ray, it's a really good deal considering all that you get. I guess it could have been a little cheaper, hence the 4 star rating.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Pillars of the Earth was such a monumental effort and filled with human characters. World Without End is a wonderful extension of that world. In some ways it may seem too similar, but it is still a very worthwhile read.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I haven't yet finished the book.  It's a great book, but written through the eyes of a 5 year old child.  HIs perspective on his world and life inside 'Room' which he loves, but his mother desperately wants to escape.
B002ZG974M|4.0|This movie gives a unigue insight in both differences and similarities in childraising in four very different cultures. A must-see for both parents and pedagogues for whom the questions of &#34;how&#34; and &#34;why&#34; are an unavoidable part of everyday life with infants.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I loved this book.  It held me captive -- I couldn't wait to read more every day.  I love books that take me to unknown, mystical places.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was such a good story! Had me hooked from the beginning. The characters were witty and realistic. Definitely would recommend!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Sylvia Day you have rocked my world on books number 1,2,3 and i'm gonna die waiting for number 4 i loved them all......
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This book was great! I couldn't put it down..  but then the author went and did something right near the end that I just didn't like. For the rest of the book, right up until the very last paragraph I was hoping she would fix it for me but no.. sadly...  So I have to deduct a star for that. Still would recommend it as a good read, because for some perhaps it wouldn't be as disappointing. (Don't want to mention details as I don't want to spoil anything)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is amazing I spend hours training and feeding and grooming my horse.I love this game and defenitly recommend it for everyone!
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|Left me wanting it to end. Unfortunately this story was not compelling...except for my desire for the story to end. My husband and I almost stopped watching, but by the time we both &#34;surrendered&#34; to the fact that we were not enjoying the movie, we figured we had too much invested not to see how it ended. Wasn't worth the wait.
B000FCK65W|5.0|Character development was incredible.. Absolutely wonderful book.. Highest recommendations..<br />The author makes you feel like you are living in the early 1900s in NY.. Must read!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|My family read the books first & after seeing the movie I truly think they did a fantastic job adapting it for the screen.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great puzzler that keeps  that keeps you using  your grey matter! I would recommend trying it kid you haven't already.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|If you grew up in the Computer Age like I did, this book is an amazing insight into the stuff you didn't see on the outside.  Isaacson makes it easy to go back to the days of Viet Nam, Flower Power, and the hippie movement of San Francisco and see how this age of technology was growing up in its midst. I never realized how radical were the views that Jobs held during this time and how that spurred him to become the business man he was.  He was loved; he was hated; often by the same people at different times.  But there is no denying that he was extremely influential. He may not have enamored himself to those that made his visions come true, but he had a way of motivating people to do the impossible.  The message this book left me with.... You have to be a bit crazy to have the gumption to change the world!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was especially happy to see this series even thought it ended sadly.<br />it was well done and as it was recommended to me, I am happy to recommend it to others.<br />it is a well done series.
1574216988|5.0|Love it! It's fun and it's a great instructional guide to inspire you into practicing. I became hooked when I saw it done on YouTube but needed to see it at a slower pace. The instuctions are simple and they show you finished samples which helps ignite the desire to do some on your own. It looks cool when it's finished plus it's fun. More important, it's not hard to do.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Great historical fiction.  Very hard to put down once you've started.<br /> This would make a great movie.<br />Or even a continued series
1846071224|1.0|Book in very bad condition, could not use it, just threw it in the garbage because to much trouble to send back because of low cost. Wasted purchase :-((
B002BBJ52U|3.0|This is one of those romantic comedies my wife and I pull out about once a year and enjoy.  How ca you go wrong with 5 beautiful women and the craziness of dating in the 21st century.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|I received this book free for an honest review. Simon Okill has managed a new take on vampires. There are so many twists and turns that at first I was a little confused. However, the more I read the more it made sense.<br /><br />Count Lucien is an excellent depraved villain, with his two sidekicks Jacques and Claudette. Delicate Rose/Eternal is your main character who is running from Lucien. Then throw in a mental institute with your basic evil nurse and orderly, and a Doctor who thinks he is doing good. Then add a bunch of famous people who play minor rolls and you have a wonderful cast of characters.<br /><br />Delicate Rose/Eternal has so many vile things happen to her no wonder she went amnesic. The sexual depravity, the death of friends, and the blood loss.<br /><br />I cannot wait to read more by Simon Okill.
B001NKI60W|5.0|As long as you re not looking for a deep plot or high moral ground, then movie is the best!<br />The actors are obviously having fun and the music is fun.  In all, this is one of the best good times a movie can offer.<br />Also, if you grew up with the music from Abba, then it's all the sweeter.
B000SE0OYA|5.0|I bought this as my printer is displaying a message to replace drum unit soon.  After checking the  manual, noticed that changing this will be required in another few thousand pages of printing.  Haven't installed yet, but for the reasonable Amazon price, worth having it around for use when required.
B00AIBZJS4|5.0|This is another world spectacle. The best of the best, including the film director. My 4 years grand daughter loves and watch it every day!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Reminded me of Alice and Wonderland a little bit. Glad we waited to rent it through Amazon and not paid to see it in the movies.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Watched the series, now reading the books because I couldn't get enough. Nice work George Martin! This is my first time reading a kindle book so I have nothing to compare it to but it loads to the correct page on every device I have be it phone, iPad or laptop. I always use the asoiaf westeros wiki on these devices to help me read and understand. So easy and fun!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this app so much because I can rescue animals and dinosaurs. I like all the ways they have created this app. Notice: Be aware that Wonder Zoo can start over! But if you shut down your device for 20 or 30 minutes it will be the same as you last played on it. Do not start anything if it starts over if you want to start where you were before. :)
B000Y0Q5NM|5.0|one of the few series that have role models such as Teal'c, Dr. Jackson and the remainder of the cast.
B00CP2Z5TC|4.0|Vampire Weekend proves that they can do more than write a catchy pop song.  There's a few radio-friendly tracks, but otherwise it's a more mature effort.  &#34;Diane Young&#34; gets me dancing, whereas &#34;Hannah Hunt&#34; and other tracks keep me still and thoughtful.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This writer made it real. He wove it in such a way that no one could say it was not someone's real experience. You get to know the characters and you begin 'pulling' for one or more of them. Most are lives of good people, but you soon learn who the evil ones are and you 'get involved' in the story, whether you want to or not.  I read a lot, but this book held my interest so much that I had to follow it up with all the other books written by Hugh Howey, and am anxiously waiting for his next book to come out! I've never written a review before.  I hope someone gets that I am telling the truth.
B00C061I3K|5.0|I don't know if I would call it disco, electronic, pop, or funk music - it's an odd combination of all and it works.  Despite the fact that some tracks drag past the 5 minute mark or use fillers of odd noises and synth loops, Daft Punk manages to make every beat catchy.  It's hard to top &#34;Get Lucky&#34;, but tracks like &#34;Doing It Right&#34; have grown on me after multiple listens.
B003F48E4W|5.0|This is by far one of my all time top five favorite movies. It's always been since I've seen it and I think always will be. The Twilight generation has been cheated. These are real vampires.
B000FBJHZS|2.0|This is an early work by Dan Brown, so absolutely unbelievable with a plot not worthy of a 2nd grader's attempt at story telling.
B007FIY3VW|3.0|Did not download my excel document so that I could change it on my kindle too. Please tell me if I need to download differently.
B00AQTY3XA|5.0|If you like movies bases on true events this one is for you. It has excitement and drama with a touch of romance. Watch it and you will like it
B00BD05PEW|4.0|very nice figurine, movable jaw, However, overpriced! I expected something larger for the money I paid. The pose is great though
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Slenderman chapter 1: Alone is one of the best, if not THE best slender games on the market! Best played with headphones, and in the dark! Just the chilling atmosphere and the creepy sounds, and the way Slander whispers things to you while your back is turned makes this game amazing! And now with the new Farm level posing much more challenging! This is the best $1 you will ever spend if you're looking for a scare! I recommend it to all!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Entertaining. My 7 year old enjoyed it but maybe a little intense for young children.  I thought it was well done tying into the Wizard of Oz.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|Used splitter with a 50' cord to a second, works great for my needs. As well as any powered amplifier splitter, without having to plug it in.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game has no ads that I have seen and I don't see where it wants you to buy anything. Good fun without any annoyances!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a great game and I love it even though I just got it! The only thing I would Change is when u get done running u should be able to press run again or something not have to tap on menu wait about ten seconds then press play! But otherwise I LOVE the game!
B0021L8V0M|5.0|I really love this movie! I bought it because I love it so much! Lots of great action and it was really cheap :)
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|i just loved this book it was the first  book i read written by her and will now buy more by this author
0553062182|5.0|I bought this book on a recommendation and even though I haven't finished it, it has been an absolute God-send! I have learned so many things about myself and it has helped me immensly! Even if you don't fit the description of a highly sensitive person, you most likely know someone who does and reading this book will give you a better insight about them.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Works like a cable should and has lasted so far. Haven't had any issues with it so I'm happy :)
B00CF34B2I|5.0|It's a great game well worth the money. Whether you're new to the game or a long term fan this app is great for you. With several different game modes and an extensive story this seems like one of the best apps I have seen in a long time. And despite what people may say you don't need to buy the decks to do well strategy is still well alive.
0143145150|5.0|My dad and I had to read this book for our class and we drive a lot so it was great to listen to in the car. The reader does a great job and made me actually enjoy this book!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I am glad I read this book. I will recommend it to all my friends. It had a very good ending.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|This book starts out great keeps you entertained and engaged. Really different perspective on some things but towards the end gets rather slow and dry. Overall good book and I would recommend it.
B00BB3UYS8|4.0|Interesting concepts, made me think, but not so much that I couldn't enjoy the book.  Love the mystical tied with reality.
B007SGM084|5.0|funny, scary, romance, and more the story line was great the people was great I just love everything about this book and all the other ones but is there going to be another one.
B000HKW7E0|3.0|Started seeing thinking it would be a clean Christmas movie. Unnecessary erotic scenes and crude comedy. Not suitable for kids. Had to FFwd couple of scenes.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Four stars instead of five only because of what I am hearing about the update. I love this app but I have been hearing that the update was bad! I have not updated mine yet so I think I will wait a while to see if it gets better.
0321356683|5.0|I thought I was a very good Java Progammer with several years experience... this book taught me some excellent tips that I didn't even think about but now seem obvious.<br /><br />This book is not for a true Beginner programmer, but it is for all levels above that from Advanced Beginner to Expert. I think this book is more useful than Gang of 4 or RefactoringBook, at least for Java programmers. Must Read.
B008YRVW0I|5.0|I really like this game a lot.  It keeps you coming back to play the game a lot and with other people.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|very cute game for little girls. also, kind of fun for adults as well. will continue to play for a while.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|Its a good book to read and it totally turn  you on even more to RHCP. I recommend  it to anyone who likes bibliographies
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Very fun game kept me busy when I wasn't doing evening work I like hidden object mystery games very interesting.
B008518MOW|5.0|We bought this after we got a new TV. We didn't think we would like the 3D as much as we do. The movie is a funny and fast-paced. If you liked the other MIB's, you'll love this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very fun app that challenges your mind with puzzles that increase in difficulty. Don't give up if you're stuck, the answer is usually in front of your face.
0060557818|4.0|This book is a fun read. Nothing that I fell in love with but definitely kept me interested and got a few chuckles.<br /><br />Years ago before Richard moved to London he was told by an old woman that his story would begin with a Door. Shrugging it off as the mumblings of a crazy woman Richard moves to London, gets a great job, a controlling but successful fianc&eacute; and forgets all about the strange woman's message until he helps a young woman one day on the streets. She tells him her name is Door and from there Richard's life gets very bizarre.<br /><br />It starts when no one seems to be able to see him and seem to have forgotten that he exists. It gets even more strange when he meets a homeless man who takes him to meet the Sewer People under London. Richard learns that in this dark undercity rats are prophets, darkness actually can kill, and nothing he knew before he met Door was ever as it really seemed.<br /><br />Overall there were characters who needed more developing (particularly Door) but still the book was fun to read. The overall tone of the book is pretty dark but Gaiman weaves in traces of humor (think Christopher Moore style). It doesn't make me want to reread it like a truly wonderful book does but it does make me want to read more of Gaiman's work.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|My 3 year old grandchild loved it and it was the hit of his birthday party with everyone.  Well made
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|this is a fun little game -perfect for casual gamers. the graphics are wonderful, the challenges are fairly easy to this point, and all is working well on my kindle fire

B001ANSSDC|5.0|The story was a little far fetched but so well written and heart rending.  Something everyone should read and think about.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Great reading  for  anyone.  Enjoyed the suspenseful and delightful ending. Provided a good insight of an ordinary,simple Irish life.  Very heartwarming.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The best game ever. Only way to describe it. The best game ever I tell you!!! GET THIS GAME!!! :)
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE - Big fan of Evil Dead, Army Of Darkness. For what it is, this was a very good movie. I really enjoyed this movie to it's fullest. I never buy DVDs and its very rare for me to buy a Blu-Ray. But this movie was so good its worthy to buy on Blu-Ray.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Interesting show that broke the mold on musical comedy on Television.  Enjoyed the singing and glad that singers with some talent were chosen.
B0050R0XEG|5.0|My husband is a big LEGOs fanatic. He really likes this. It sits on display for everyone to see. I would recommend this to anyone.
B009AP2G26|3.0|The cast with the new additions (due to graduation) has a lack of chemistry that was evident in seasons 1-3.  The show is alright, but lack a stand-out personality.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Let's face it- I'm a Downton Abbey addict! Season 1 was on netflix, but I had to buy season 2 and 3. I can't wait for Season 4!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Very nice graphics for kindle fire, challenging game and fun. Not too many interruptions with ads which makes that much more fun! I would certainly recommend.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I don't like how she used the (see you next Tuesday word). I want a love story not needless sex because they never talk about there relationship. This was just a waste of money!! For me
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Love the game besides that it don't let me login my facebook half of the time<br />Besides that I love the game
B000065V42|5.0|We have seen this movie and have seen the behind the scenes production of the movie at Walt Disney World.  It is a movie the whole family can enjoy.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Great experience BAM BAM BOOSH! Great game great graphics accurate history it is so good I recommend to anyone who likes to shoot stuff
B0000VCZKM|5.0|For families looking for good entertainment, this is a movie that is hard to beat.  I don't like for my kids to watch some of the movies that I consider trashy.  This one is fine.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|I love spy/thriller/whodunits, and to add comedy was the best!  Can't wait for Red 2 to come to the theater!
6305428050|5.0|This is one of my favorite childhood movies. I've watched it a thousand times. I just love it. Buy it!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I thought this was a great book.  I have friends who did not enjoy it as much.  They thought it needed more &#34;Jesus&#34;.  And I do see that point, however, I thought it was very thought provoking.  I like the deeper, less fluffy read so great for me.  I believe God may communicate slightly different with each person because we are all completely different in our thinking and skills.  I think this is why you get different experiences for NDE stories.  If you want a light hearted, encouragement type NDE, maybe not so much this one. If you want a thought provoking, learn something book, then yes to this one!
B000FC1HQY|5.0|I started this book on a Friday evening and simply could not put it down...I  read all weekend ...enjoying every page I turned. My favorite TV shows come on Sunday night...I had to ditch them to finish this terrific book.
B00BGIC4I6|3.0|This movie had some very memorable moments that reminded me of growing up in my home.  The issues between Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann are very real.  There were probably a few too many issues that became more and more extreme, but the overall message was there.  The one main issue with this film was it's length.  The movie seemed to drag on and on.  Comedies need to be 2 hours or less, this was pushing the 3 hour mark it seemed.
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|This movie was okay.  It has an interesting premise in what happened to Hansel and Gretel after they escaped from the witch.  Lots of action, lots of gore.  The acting was okay.  I just don't think they spent enough time actually developing the story.
B00DHNAQ2Y|5.0|I did not hate anything about this movie. I believe from a horror hater stand point of this film I thought that this horror film stud above all others because of its well developed plot and its unpredictability. Though I know it was done by the same producers and what not so I did know what to expect but still it freaked me out for the fact one of them being was the plot. I mean the plot had two demons, one mentally and the second physically. So yes at least one of them is for sure a real demon from the other, so I've seen otherwise.
B008JFUR10|3.0|When i first heard that one of the greatest directors in the film industry Guillermo del Toro was going to be making a Giant robot Vs. Giant monster movie i got super excited, mainly because many people believed it was going to be a live action version of Neon Genesis Evangelion which is news that every Evangelion fan has been waiting to hear for years, and with Guillermo del Toro's capabilities it sounded like a dream come true. Unfortunately Pacific Rim wasn't going to be an Evagelion film, however del Toro is a big fan of anime and Evangelion did have a strong influence on the script and the style of this film, so much so that i can't understand why del Toro or the studio didn't just go ahead and make an Evangelion film instead, maybe that fault lies with Gainax, the production company that owns Evangelion, back in 2011 Gainax was sued by A.D. Vision, who claimed Gainax's refusal to accept an option payment for the perpetual live-action rights to Evangelion was a breach of contact and had resulted in losing an opportunity to produce the film with a major studio, so i'm gonna guess that might be one reason we've ended up with Pacific Rim.<br /><br />So here's my first problem with this movie, you have an incredibly talented director who has a gift at creating complex and realistic characters that you really connect with as the story unfolds, at least that is the case with his previous films, Pacific Rim however is full of actors that are trying to be live action parody's of characters from Evangelion and various other anime shows and it just comes off as weird, what works fine in an anime doesn't always translate over to live action very well, at times it feels like i'm watching a parody sketch on Saturday Night Live, especially when the two bumbling oaf scientists come walking in completely hamming up any seriousness this story about a world being wreaked by giant alien monsters had built up from the beginning, I'm fully aware this was done intentionally, but this feels way below what del Toro is capable of.<br /><br />My next problem is the lack of detail in the science of The Drift and how they figure out if two people are compatible. This is really one of the dumbest parts of the movie, in order to determine if two people are Drift compatible they have everyone fight each other with sticks, how is that supposed to determine if your brain is capable of connecting safely with another persons brain exactly?<br /><br />Now for my last problem. In pacific Rim there doesn't seem to be a real reason as to why our only way of defeating the kaiju is by building giant robots, we see at the start of the film jets and other modern day weaponry taking down some of the first ones that came through the Rift just fine. Of course over time the Kaiju get tougher, but they can still be killed with more effective modern day weapons, heck drop some nukes on them, i know it won't work on the Rift, but a low yield nuke would kill the Kaiju just nicely. Instead we're forced to use slow, bulky, and week armored giant robots to dish out some hand to hand combat (and in one scene) only remembering that they have a sword they could be using only after they've been nearly torn to pieces. Evangelion didn't have this problem, the monsters in Eva had a form of force field that no modern day weapon could penetrate, so we created the Evangelion units, a machine that could generate an anti force field granting us the opportunity to get close enough to strike a killing blow to the heart of the monster.<br /><br />In the end i still liked this movie, i also love Ron Perlman's cameo despite the fact that his character seems almost forced into the film with no real purpose. Guillermo del Toro set out to make a Giant Robot VS. Giant Monsters movie in the style of an anime and even though the movie has some considerable flaws he has somewhat succeed, most people will ether not notice the problems with this film or will simply ignore them which is fine, as for myself, i have to say i respect what Guillermo del Toro tried to do, but it just didn't fully work for me, Pacific Rim has the right look, it just lacks the intelligence and sophistication of his other films. One last thing, when the movie ends don't stop watching, wait till after the credits for a funny extra scene.
B0058Z4NR8|5.0|Well written, holds your interest and makes you think while reading.  What parts of failure are we embracing?  Are we moving in the right direction as a country?  What other variables predict the outcome for a nation?  These and many more questions will challange you while you read this great political work

B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was expecting a more gripping story, but was left a bit flat by this one.  Not one of Khaled Hosseini's better efforts.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|This ap works great.  Just set the time and go about your business.  It will sound the alarm it's time.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game keeps my grandkids busy.  They beg to play it on my Kindle Fire whenever I visit them.  I've watched, and it really does seem fun.
B00BNGFGIQ|1.0|Force close.  One star. Can not even give a good review positive or negative because it won't even open. Fix and I will review.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. I hope they come out with more floors soon. One thing I didn't like is that if you close out of it and don't come back within a certain time, you have to start that floor over. Otherwise great! My 3 year old likes helping find everything!
B00ACBN9CI|4.0|This game has it all from high speed to fun weapons,and air to air combat. The most fun for a free tank of jet fuel. I love free games and this is one to have.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome! Easy to play and figure out. It is also very addicting, I play it every chance I get
B0049GYXDG|5.0|This is a great set at a great price. It arrived timely and i've watched it several times. Yes! Thats correct, I a 50+ man and I watched it several times to bring back some memories of long ago. Gotta go as i'm late....
B00CF34B2I|3.0|Good game but the constant pestering to rate this app is annoying.  I paid good money and such a nuisance is forcing me to give three stars instead of five
B003B02PF4|5.0|I originally read this in hardback. I read it a second time before I dominated it, with some ot,her books to the local library. Since getting a Kindle Fire and then a Fire HD I have read it twice more. The story reads like a travel log of places I would like to visit. It is a first rate story of suspense and personal redemption.
B000NGTJTY|5.0|Worth the rental. I had not seen this movie in awhile and forgot how good it was. Most movies with a a lot of big actors struggles to find itself but it works in this movie. Not for the faint of heart: Heavy language and the violence is bloody.
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Love this to send to the kids at camp. Waterproof, to play at the pool and beach. They clip on to a plastic ring that makes it easy to just throw it in your beach bag.  Always a huge hit with the kids,
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Incredible movie from start to finish.<br />Would recommend to anyone looking for a very adult animated movie, but with a lot of heart.<br /><br />Both heart warming and disturbing, in a word perfect.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I really LOVE Mahjong and have played it for many years. This is a good starter Mahjong for the beginners, but ALSO an old love and time passer for others.<br />The graphics and controls on this game have been flawless, and trust me, I have been playing it A LOT!!! LOL!!!<br />What I think is great about this app is also that you get to pick between 3 different sets of tiles to use, select one of several stunningly beautiful backgrounds, and choose your layout you want to use. This app gives you many layouts to choose from such as the shape of a turtle, a smiley face, a crab, crowns, a helicopter, a dog, etc., and THAT'S NOT EVEN THE FIRST PAGE OF LAYOUTS!!!!<br />For just 99&cent;, for all you get, is just awesome!!! Try it out, I think everyone should enjoy it......and it's only 99&cent;!!!!!!!<br />By the way, this company also puts out an &quot;All In One Solataire&quot; app that is just off the charts great for the price!!!!! There are like 10 or more different types of Solataire within the app and it gives you a &quot;how to&quot; play with each different one. And if you still need help, they have a link to YouTube for each type of Solataire, that shows you how to play them. But the games are fairly easy and the written directions have been very helpful. It was also just 99&cent; when I bought it. I think it still is as of this posting.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I've read many accounts from our wars and warriors throughout the years.  True stories of daring selflessness and endurance.  All of our service men and women deserve our respect our hearts and our actions in assisting them as they come home from war.  But this book touched me in a more personal way. Eric told Adam Brown's whole story. The good the bad, all of it.  In so doing Adam became more real, more one of us, yet different, more....He was a true modern day American hero, a Christian warrior, a husband father and friend.  He was a role model.  A shining example of a man fighting evil in his own life and on the battlefield...and winning those battles.  And he loved his maker.  God bless his family that has given so much.  This book changed me.  My faith is stronger and I try harder to appreciate every single freedom that Adam Brown and so many others have given their all for.
B0042RUMJG|5.0|Even if you only &#34;like&#34; Sting and don't &#34;love&#34; him, you'll love this performance.  The Blu-Ray recording of it is excellent!
0500516766|5.0|We bought this as a gift for our son who LOVES to take everything apart!  He loved it and has it out in the open for everyone to peruse
B004222UC8|5.0|Man it would have been crazy if Ray would have stayed in Sabbath. He sounded geat on this album. Ray never got his due as one of the great's and that is truly a shame.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I got this for my bug out bag, but the other day when I noticed that my paring knife was dull, I pulled it out and sharpened the paring knife as well as all my other knives.  This worked great, and easy.  It seems sturdy, and I feel better having it in my bag.
B008BRC7BE|5.0|This is just some cool stuff to listen to. A bit of everything,Sabbath,Purple,Dio. If you like any of these then it's worth listening to.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game...lots of fun...lots of problem solving...love it...can't wait for more rooms<br />My daughter loved this....better than the other doors game
B002VHI8J0|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this book over the years but never had an opportunity to read it. After listening to a BBC podcast with David Mitchell, I downloaded a sample to my kindle. The quality of writing alone was enough for me to make my decision to purchase the entire work once I'd completed the first chapter.<br /><br />The complexity of Cloud Atlas reminds me a little of Iain Pears works; the reader has many stories to follow, and connecting them together is challenging, but immensely rewarding.<br /><br />I confess, as a slow reader, there are many parts of the various stories that I probably didn't connect, having forgotten things from earlier chapters as I progressed through the timeline. My next project is to watch the movie - maybe it will put things into place. Then, in about a year, I'll read it again, hopefully connecting more the second time around.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I found it hard to keep track of the characters, who they were and to whom they were related and which generation.  The whole cultural thing is still interesting, but I don't think this book is as good as his first or even second story.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It kept me interested right up until the end. I recommend this book to everyone.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Such a great series I can see myself reading this again and again. Definitely a must own for many people who enjoyed the movie.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It kept me interested right up until the end. I recommend this book to everyone.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This story about misfits-- a man and a woman alienated from society as children and trying to find some meaning and happiness as adults was very good. It provided a stark, realistic portrait of what life was like in an Irish orphanage. Your heart breaks for the poor mistreated unloved children. The twist at the end that wards off impending events was quite well done. I definitely would recommend this book.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it was an amazing mix of wisdom, courage and perseverance all woven into a beautiful story.<br />Would highly recommend this book to anyone.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This was a super fun game!!!! I have an affinity for these types of games and this one topped them all. There were a few times I was very frustrated because I simply could not figure it out.... I'll admit I cheated a little.... I didn't feel dumb though because the solution was not as simple as some of the others. I cannot wait for more levels. It was over too quickly.
B003QS9WIE|4.0|Subtitles available in the DVD version, but no Closed Captioning in the Instant Video version :( Why not?<br /><br />That apart, I've seen this movie numerous times and while the suspense about the story was obviously only present the first time, I've always picked up a little bit more every time, which makes it a fun watch.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|it has amazing new features buy it I totally love it, it also has amazing features like zipelines mines and one big monkey
B00APYKXFS|1.0|this game is too crazy. it's really hard to play for long because enemies come from under your finger as you are playing and kill you quickly.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this show from friends and co-workers, however, wasn't able to watch it as I didn't have the channel subscription at home. I stumbled upon one of the episodes on my way to South America from US and even then this show was one of my last choices to watch after I'd exhausted all the other options (which included a Non-English movie and some other documentary).<br />Just one exposure and all I'd been thinking about during the rest of the trip was about this show and how can I get my hands on it. I finally saw that the 1st Season was being offered on Amazon and with my Prime membership, it would be free......can't get any better than this!!<br />We finished the first season in 3 days and are taking a quick break so that we don't finish with the 2nd too soon. I can't recommend this show enough!!!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I loved the movie, good action, gritty and more realistic bond.  You get the sense in this film that bond is showing his age, keeping up with the young ones running about, but youth and strength can't make up for age and treachery, like only Bond can.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a fun and cute game. Despicable Me: Minion Rush is one of my favorite games to play. I would defiantly recommend this game to anyone any age.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good humorous action, good for laughs and fun.  This is for the 12 word minimum oh my gosh what is this I don't even
B00BCK1A5G|5.0|This is another great book in this series. I feel like I know the characters personnaly. Loved this book.Great read.
B0040QYROK|5.0|Since I saw Queen: Radio Ga Ga´s video, I was intrigued about this movie.<br /><br />I really enjoy this movie and is incredible that almost has 100 years old and I have spent nearly 15 years to watch it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is my favorite game on my tablet, and I have some cool games. This game is very good for when you are bored.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun diversion for an afternoon....took only a couple hours to beat but it was engaging and enjoyable!! I would recommend a download :)
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Lots of fun, easy to use! Great game @ a terrific price.Can`t wait to try all the different games included
1250007208|5.0|When I first picked up Cinder, I didn't expect to like it -- just another Cinderella story. I was immediately drawn into the action. I liked Cinder because the story was well plotted and unique. I liked the extensions of the Cinderella story into science fiction/ fantasy.  I wanted to know more about Cinder and couldn't wait to read the second book in the series -- I immediately downloaded it on my Kindle Fire as soon as I finished the first book. I recommend it to all lovers of fantasy science fiction. Get ready to want more of this story.
B008C20TDG|4.0|It's a great book that makes you rethink your eating habits. I haven't been strictly following the plan but I've still lost a few pounds!
B00DBSZJRM|4.0|Action packed. Great fight scenes. If you're looking for a true movie escape this is it. It was fun. Not a cinematic masterpiece  but a lot of fun
B000O77QD8|5.0|A typically Eastwood approach. He takes a highly unusual point of view to reveal the lesser known aspects of a very well known subject matter, in this case the flag raising photograph of the battle of Iwo Jima. Of the six men, three were killed in action a few days later. This is not a film meant to show bravery, though there is plenty of it. It is a cynical film to show how the American war propaganda machine manipulated the three survivors of the flag raising to ... raise money for war bonds. We learn how the flag itself was a coveted object of contention among politicians and military leaders. And how in the end those who were less interested in the iconic photograph were the people in it. They were there to do a job, and being in a photograph was not part of it.<br /><br />Pretty amazing CGI. For example, technicians artificially reproduce the Pacific theather as a background for the rugged terrain in Iceland where the film was actually shot! You can see it's not real, but it's pretty close to look real.<br /><br />Watch this film together with \\"Letters from Iwo Jima\\", also by Clint Eastwood, that tells the story of the battle from a Japanese point of view.
B000T12J8Q|3.0|Great movie saw it many yrs ago & when the tv show (same name) came on, i saw Madeline Stowe was the star, ironic !!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|great  fun for all ages.  couldn't put it down. soundtrack was very cute too. bad choice to look at it just before bed...lol.
B008RYN44U|5.0|Great group - and it gets no radio play - proves how stupid and biased the pop world is.  Best group out there
B0000DYKET|4.0|I've been wearing these sandals for about a week and overall I am very happy with them.  I had read that some find they run small and purchased a larger size than normal.  In my case I bought the correct size and I think I made the right choice, although they do fit snugly.  My thinking is that over time they will break in a little bit and not feel as snug.  As they loosen up, it should be easy to get a snug fit by pulling the drawstring/laces a bit tighter.  If you were intent on wearing socks with these, then I would recommend a bigger size, but without socks I would think they would be too big, at least in my case.<br /><br />One reason people may suggest the bigger size is due to how hot these can get.  Unlike open toe sandals, these don't provide the same level of ventilation and as such, on warmer days, your feet can get hot.  I imagine that getting a slightly bigger size would provide a little extra area for air flow.<br /><br />I had hoped that these would be my \\"go to\\" summer shoe but given that they do tend to make my feet hotter than normal sandals, I may have to restrict wearing these to spring, fall and cooler summer days and nights.  I feel like I can do almost anything in these without fear of injury and with ample support.  However they just aren't really sandals in my book, either in look or feel.  So one star off as a sandal but the overall experience with these has been overwhelmingly positive, so far.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Bipolar is not something that can be cured by just dancing and meeting someone that understands you. The actors were awesome, love this movie! I thought at first the movie was very authentic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Interesting period story. Actors and Actress are very compelling. Love the dress and manners of that era. The scenery is lovely.<br />Can't hardly wait for season 4!!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is an easy, fun app, but don't open it unless you have some time because it is seriously addicting.
B0058O84G0|3.0|Historically interesting, entertaining yarn, but characters a bit thin, and tend to be a bit repetitive of each other. Sequel set up all to obviously by characters all conveniently finding their matches and spawning Book 2's cast.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|Yes you can do this with the tab without paying for the app but hey this makes doing the work alot easier.  I have had great luck so far.  I even tried the vidio and it worked ok not the best but with only one lense makes it hard to focus in.  But for the few pennies give it a try it is worth makeing your life easier.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|Not only are the graphics good, but the game play is smooth and fun!<br />Just got it today and I'm still playing!
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Well written and produced action movie without too much gory details shown.  Tom Selleck's acting is great, as always. \
1439102813|5.0|A friend loaned me this book for my recent trip. It's a very quick read...I read in cover to cover in just under 4 hours on the plane. It was easy to get lured into the book...you can't help but feel for Alice & her family. It does discuss diagnosis, treatment, testing, and genetics, but in an easy to understand context. Loved it! Highly recommend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Was reading the series with my 11 year old daughter.  I was hooked and passed her up and could not put them down.  Loved the characters and the action involved.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Pretty good way to beat boredom<br />I love jigsaw puzzles, so this is a pretty good program for me.<br />Very easy for my kids, too.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was hooked on this series.  Could not put it down.  Read with my 11 year old daughter.  Fell in love with the characters and the action!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|thanks for restaurant story team lava I like bakery story to it is also awesome basicly they are the same thing so yeah love this game
1451695195|4.0|Because of his education and knowledge of the workings of the brain, etc., it lends a special view of this subject. It is an easy read and for those of us who feel this a real possibility, a ray of hope.  For those who ponder this subject, it  offers beautiful idea of what we might expect if we earn our way to this point.<br />It is an easy read for the summer and really any time after.  I would recommend it to all kindred spirits.
B005GIS1WA|4.0|Cute movie with some good music and funny moments. I enjoyed watching it with my kids and grandchildren and would probably watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game that everyone should play because the graffics aren't bad and the people would be berserk.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|I loved this series when it started reruns during the 70's, I wouldn't miss any of them.  I remember they came on Saturday afternoons.  I was ecstatic when the VCR was invented, and I could watch Star Trek whenever I wanted after taping.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|we all know someone with more or less of asperger's traits: here's hope for a happy ending!<br />I always enjoy the use of literary irony
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Leaves me wanting more. Great story! Can't wait for the movie to be born...very real and yet makes your imagination be used.
0399255370|3.0|I was excited to buy a new book illustrated by Oliver Jeffers, but I didn't find the illustrations to be impressive. He was trying to draw like a kid, so the illustrations look like any number of other books where adults try to draw like kids in an adolescent, naive style. I didn't feel like I was looking at an Oliver Jeffers book. Also, I found the concept/writing to be repetitive (SPOILER ALERT: all the crayons write snarky comments to Duncan complaining about how they are used). Overall, I was expecting to be wowed, but I wasn't.
B002BJGYUS|5.0|I am so happy this series has come out on DVD.  I'm enjoying watching them again, I'm currently on season 2 - and looking forward to getting all the seasons to add to my collection.  High quality DVD versions of one of my all time favorite series.
0920668372|4.0|I mostly side with the people who like this book, though I understand the criticisms. I wasn't so much troubled by what other reviewers call the \\"creepiness\\" of the book so much as the unimpressiveness of the illustrations. While I thought the story was touching, I think Munsch's sillier books are better.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|This series never disappoints.  Wow!  The acting is superb, the plot devilishly good.  If there are not at least two or three Emmys awarded to it this year, I won't believe it!  Dexter is the best!!  (The only other series that compares in quality is the Sopranos.)  I'll keep buying each season as long as they keep producing them.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Just read this book while travelling in the Middle east. Somehow I felt more connected to the story, having read it on this side of the world. A beautiful and emotional tale woven perfectly.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game really surprised me. Not only is it beautifully designed, but the gameplay itself is very enjoyable. This is not just another platformer!<br />I hate platformers, and I love this game!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|This is a beautifully sad and hopeful story that reaches down into several levels of human consciousness and reminds us that, although we are different in some obvious ways, we are the same in most of the important but often hidden ways.  For those of us in the west, it makes us remember that humanity (and cruelty) are not the sole realms of any culture, government, faith tradition, or class. It is also a deep condemnation of authoritarianism and violence, and suggests that true strength and dignity is achieved through human relationships, not money or power.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved it!! better for high school aged teens. But overall it was put together Buckley and the movie does no justice compared to the book
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I have an LG Spectrum and it works fine on it. This is the first generation Spectrum. I eventually ended up uninstalling it. I felt it was redundant even though it was better than the standard battery Icon.
B001782N4A|5.0|Gave this as a gift. The receiver loved it and would recommend it to Star Wars Fans. Nice looking on his desk.
B000HL2J0G|3.0|It is basically alright but it is old. You could not get the thrill out of the episode as those years.
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|This is an ADORABLE COMEDY! This movie sneaks up on you. By that I mean that you don't realize how good it is because it quietly keeps you engrossed...without car chases and graphic murders! You can read detailed story summaries in every review, so I'll just give you the short version. Steve Martin, Jack Black and Owen Wilson all compete in the world of &#34;Birding&#34;....to see who can see the most varieties of birds in a given year. It is on a &#34;honor system!&#34; Who would even think that something like that could exist in today's society, but in this honorable hobby it does. These three comedians all tone down their sometimes slap-stick form of comedy and use subtlety to their advantage. You find yourself begin to be caught up in the competition of seeing the next seagull or barn owl. Rashida Jones brings her brand of cheery beauty into the picture when she captures Jack Black's heart in a tiny little town in Alaska where it is practically mandatory for &#34;birders&#34; to go at a certain time of year to see a wide variety of birds. She has a boyfriend when she meets him to add to the tension... This is a fun romp, and I am sure you will like it. I recommend this movie.
B000I9YWDO|4.0|Started working in a sunless office straight out of college, and my coworkers had jokes and references to the characters and events in Office Space that I did not understand.<br /><br />Office Space is equal parts funny and witty - Highly recommend it.
B00936A0RU|5.0|WOW, this movie is SO ENGROSSING that you won't want to miss a minute.  These are Academy Award performances, writing and directing.  If you've seen Tom Hardy in \\"This Means War\\", you may not recognize him in \\"Lawless\\" as he so completely disappears into his role as \\"Forrest\\".  This story revolves around a family of three brothers making hootch in their illegal still during Prohibition.  They are in a county where this is common and draws the attention of the government who tries to shut them all down.  The action is fast-paced and amazingly well-done.  Jessica Chastain is perfect as \\"Maggie\\", the woman who comes to work at their bar/gas station.  The attraction between Maggie and Forrest is quiet, intense and played with subtlety.  If somewhat graphic violence doesn't bother you, I'd say this is one of the best movies in years.  I highly recommend \\"Lawless\\"!
B008VBYN80|4.0|This is a good game and fun to play. I just wish it was easier to get diamonds without buying them so I could have more heroes.
0739344269|5.0|Stephen Hawking never disappoints me.  It is wonderful that he is still able to express himself so well, considering the handicap he deals with hourly.
B004P4S4NM|5.0|I love her.  Have the cd for the car but needed her on the kindle for travel.  buy it for yourself
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Sorry I have no feedback as I had given this as a gift and had to return it because he had gotten two for Christmas
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It has taken me a while to write this review because I needed time to think about what exactly to write. I had read several reviews on this book before I read it and I was very weary about reading it BECAUSE of those reviews.<br /><br />This was, BY FAR, my favorite of the Crossfire series so far. Most, if not all of the unanswered questions from BTY and RIY were answered in this book. I know many people felt the ending was too rushed but hey, the ending did NOT come out of nowhere, it took 3 books to get there!! There were also MORE than enough NEW issues for the other 2 books Sylvia has planned and I can't wait to read them!!!<br /><br />****<br /><br />stand alone or series... book 3 of 5 *recommend reading the other books first<br /><br />would I recommend it ... YES<br /><br />did it give me a book hangover... YES<br /><br />would I read it again ... YES
B002J2PB10|3.0|great car chases and strong female characters!  maybe a bit too much dialogue and perhaps overkill on \\"character development\\". the lengthy breakfast dialogue seems out of place and kind of severs the flow of the film.  great film for classic beastly cars and female empowerment. a hard film for my short attention span. i prefer minimalism?
B007N8RULO|5.0|I play this game all the time.  One of my favorites.  I will keep this one on my kindle for a long time.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|It is very entertaining when you're BORED or just PLAYING. It gives you something to do and I think you will enjoy it. ; )
B008KE3960|4.0|After I read the instructions to my 4 year old grandson he likes playing this game.  He remembers what he needs to do pretty well so I am not constantly rereading stuff for him
B003YL4L0W|5.0|She has to be one of my favourite authors. I love how she can take any issue that's making headlines and make you think and put it into a whole new light! This book defiantly opens a can of worms!
0201633612|5.0|If you are developer and want to have one book on the shelf, this would be it. It describes major design patterns for easy understanding.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|It's book was amazing! Very Interesting, heartbreaking, and real. This book grabbed me from the first page! It's defiantly a box of tissues kind of book!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You will absolutely love this game, it has new &amp; ongoing things that don't make it boring. The minions are too cute &amp; have more &amp; more options. This game is really fun &amp; has and has everything you want. Stop reading this and download it!!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|i love every song. I knew what was in the album before I purchased it. the cd was in perfect condition. The case and everything was like new.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|One of the games once you start its just one more board then I will quit games....course that was six hours ago lol. Very entertaining! Wish it had a tutorial,but can figure it out thru game play (hence six hours +). It was the free app today and had no glitches whatsoever all day. Kept it on my kindle will not delete til I beat it and it looks like its gonna be awhile. 100% keeper
B001F0VHEM|4.0|this was brand new. I had to unwrap it from the plastic and everything! there are a few songs I do not care about so Im skipping through every once in a while. but to the costumer's concern, buy it from here. it is all brand new
B009G78EE2|4.0|I was introduced to Macklemore by a friend. While I am an Npr fan and a country music fan. I love this cd.<br />He speaks form the heart and is using his talent to speak about topics important to all.<br />These songs pump me up and get me moving
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I don't read directions generally but I wad able to get the hang of it pretty quickly. Fun just wussy I was looking for
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The flick tells the Jack and the beanstalk tale in a fun way. I enjoyed the good acting and the giants looked pretty amazing. Definitely worth renting.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|I really enjoyed the first one and went through it very quickly.  Then I found this one and although the first one was free and this one wasn't, I gladly paid.  The only thing that stopped me from giving it 5 stars ... the lack of instructions.  Not sure why I'm rubbing dirt off pictures.  But enjoy the challenge.
B000ZNRBK4|5.0|After buying third party lens hoods......They're all crap. I would only buy this hood by Nikon. It works like it's supposed to and actually stays on the lens. Also comes off and on easily. Cheaper ain't better.
B0083V2WBS|2.0|My brother liked this CD so I purchased it.<br /><br />Laurie's &#34;blues&#34; singing voice sounds too phony, too contrived to me.<br />Also I find very little variety of music on the CD -- it all sounds too much alike.<br /><br />I recommend that you try to listen to some samples before purchasing.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|More fun and challenging than I anticipated. The graphics are cute and the sound effects are pleasant. I was happy I got this app
B0072OFM28|5.0|no complaints from me. the shipping was timely and nothing was cracked. I sat and watch the entire series without a break, can't watch for the next one.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Love this book and the entire series! Must read! If you love any type of supernatural or fantasy books, these are definitely for you!
0553805371|5.0|Steven Hawkins is a teacher, and this book demonstrates his ability to teach complex astrophysics in simple terms that averages non-physicists can understand. I'd say this is a great book! I loved it.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|I didn't read the book, so for me the movie had to stand on its own as I had nothing else to reference what was going on in the story, or what everything meant- assuming that the book did a better job. The movie did not tie together the purpose. I could not gather why each story had to be told, and while there were minor connections made to different characters in a few of the stories, the movie ultimately played like a lot of random stories with no overarching lesson to be had. The stories themselves were ok, somewhat entertaining, but since they were all told parallel to each other, I felt like there needed to be some better way to connect them.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|Interesting concept, but unfortunately not unheard of today. How do abusers get away with it? How do victims explain it? Especially if the child they bear comes from a vicious relationship. Sad, sweet, kind, unthinkable. Great book.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Since I downloaded this I have been playing it constantly. It's my new favorite game. The only thing I would suggest is a short tutorial. But it's fairly simple to pick up.
0425263924|5.0|So, to be honest, I can rarely resist a 5-star rating, but this book deserves it! Entwined with You by Sylvia Day is a fast-paced, quick read that had me giggling and smiling like a school girl (which is what I'm doing right now just thinking about it). This book fills in some gaps in the relationship between Gideon and Eva and becomes a lot, lot more intense, which definitely creates excitement. I re-fell in love with Gideon and am happy to say that Eva is definitely more confident and intelligent in this book. I read the entire book in a day, just like the first two, because I could not put it down. I was sitting forward, leaning to the side, unable to hold still, and smiling at the book like it was the funniest things, when in reality, I was just so captured by it (eeeep). However, this is definitely a pleasure reading book, and not one that is the best writing or detail out there (but, it still has better writing than the 50 trilogy by E.L. James). Take it for what it is, and enjoy the crap out of it. ONE LAST THING: the end of the book left me hanging... Captivated By You is coming...hopefully soon!
B008XG1X18|4.0|Pinterest like it but dont love it that much. But its a free app so you cant judge that  . Its different than facebook. but almost the same as twitter, but except your pin things not tweet things
B009LHWEKW|5.0|Best season yet! Can't wait for season nine. Worth the fifty dollars. Get it! I just hate writing these! Bye!
B008EKMB82|5.0|My first time reading works by Ruth Ozeki--I'll read more now that I've read this gem.  (nothing else to add)
B006LEHOL2|3.0|O'Connor has some classic songs; this is a newer selection and her voice and songs are interesting and worth the listen.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Jose's vocals and guitar work are exceptional as usual and the cast of supporting characters are superb.  I loved the arrangements. The only problem, not long enough!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Nearly flawless superhero movie!  What happens when Thor meets Hulk or Iron Man meets Thor?  Epic battles!  And the fight between the Avengers and the invading aliens was well thought out and executed brillantly!  Can't wait til Avengers 2!
B000JQUMPI|5.0|...it was a excellent book to read through with my excellent father. i liked it very , very , very, VERY much!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|it keeps me update of my favorite shows cause I love the gossip that is be on my tv shows
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Love it.  This keyboard has the best prediction of any android keyboard I've ever used.  It's been wonderful. Get it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so amazing. I was so attached to the story lime that it affected my daily life! Anyone who does not join this bandwagon is missing out.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Very well paced, didn't feel like there were any lulls in the book. Can't wait for the next installment.  Read it.
B00BESM14U|1.0|This film is a piece of crud. The PG13 rating must have been purchased by the film makers and producers.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Spoiled by his previous efforts I found &#34;A Wanted Man&#34; a bit disappointing. My feelings are he dropped the ball on the conclusion. Not up to the usual Lee Child standards.
1401917186|5.0|This book explained a lot about why some people are so different and how they are actually following their path as Earth Angels.  Yeah!!!!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great show!  Each episode kept me on the edge of my seat.  Great performers and great plots.  I'm craving for more!!!  I spend the entire day watching the seasons because they are so fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this to family and friends that like a good scifi series.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Going to buy another one for my girlfriend so she'll answer her phone.  She loves the case and how it protects the earpiece.  I love the charging, protection and convenience of always have a charged headset.
B00425S1H8|1.0|I bought this USB-to-serial adapter for a specific use and it did not function at all in that use. Unhappy!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Excellent product. Works perfectly. I can now rely on my device being totally charged. I highly recommend this product to my friends.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Percy Jackson was really brave. What I liked the most were the battles I'm writing this because it said 7 more words required hxhsnsbhshxbdhhjs
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A nice version of the escape the room / floor games. I would recommend this to all. Challenging enough to make it interesting, very few rooms are no brainers.
B00CL68NOG|2.0|Bad acting and a waste of time.  Rogen is not good actor .  Barbara Streisand should stick to singing.  Watching this one is a real guilt trip.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|While I did see some variation from the Castle characters and their inspired Nikki Heat characters, I didn't think it was a bad thing. The characters were just that--inspired by Castle's new friends at the NYPD. Still, it was very easy for me to follow along and picture the Castle team. My husband and I can't get enough Castle, and I really enjoyed this book to fill in the gap between episodes. If you're a Castle fan, I highly recommend it.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I really enjoyed it but it can be challenging to the point of getting stuck. I wish you could get in game hints, like where to look next or something. Probably part of the problem of getting stuck is that even if you know where to look for something, or how to get an object, the game won t always do it even though you click and click :/ even still, I hope they release more levels soon!
B00C70FG2S|4.0|To really enjoy this one the speakers need to be good ones and if reading the lyrics while listening really makes you appreciate the album more. Well done and artistic.  Their best since Character.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|The game by itself is absolutely funny, the sounds, the minioms and even the &quot;villians&quot; make it good to play and laugh while you are playing, but some times it get freeze and you have to wait until the tablet ends its battery charge in order to use it again.
B00BX3KZAS|3.0|Not as good as HCDR but better than the last two.  A few real gems on this one. 3.5 stars
B00BTV62KG|5.0|John Scofield,former guitarist with Miles Davis,has emerged as one of the most eclectic and prolific musicians of the past thirty years or so. As a solo artist, he maintains a consistently released body of work that...sadly I have greatly under- explored. First heard him on his 1998 album [[ASIN:B0000069NM A Go Go]] which..of course belonged to my father. On this album Scofield is teamed with rhythm guitarist Avi Bortnick,who also provides samples,bassist Andy Hess,drummers Adam Deitch and Louis Cato as well as non other than organist John Medeski,a veteran of the jam band funk/rock revival of the 90's in Medeski,Martin & Wood,also on Wurlitzer and Mellotron. So this is an album where what I heard about it,especially it being a decade in the making follow up of sorts,peaked my interest so...this is my very first purchase of a new John Scofield album. I have absolutely no regrets.<br /><br />  \\"Camelus\\",\\"Cracked Ice\\",\\"Scotown\\" and the wonderfully melodic closer \\"Just Don't Want To Be Lonely\\" are wonderfully living and funky grooves-with Bortnicks perfect JB styled guitar complimenting Scofield's trademark soloing that's of course so deeply rooted in the blues. \\"Boogie Stupid\\" takes the tempo even faster on another terrific funk number. \\"Endless Summer\\" on the other hand is probably my favorite here. The grooves the musicians get are extremely tight and grooving at times,others colorfully flamboyant. The use of heavily sampled electronics/synthesizers make this a rather unique blend of like band jazz/funk with modern day dance/electronic. Very innovative. Scofield takes time to melodically and rhythmically reference others on \\"Dub Dub\\",a reggae number build around a melodic refrain from \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" and \\"Curtis Knew\\",built rhythmically and melodically on \\"Move On Up\\",of course.<br /><br />  \\"Al Green Song\\" is another wonderful number here-borrowing a little from many of Al's songs as well as providing an improvised jazz flavor to a near perfect replication of the 70's HI rhythm section. \\"Snake Dance\\" and \\"Torero\\" are the most harmonically,melodically and rhythmically complex pieces here. The melodies are very strong though,and play in and out of the rhythmic funkiness of the songs with surprising regularity. For some reason a lot of reviews here,nothing personal intended, seem to be a little afraid to call this album what it is: a funk album. I honestly don't hearing anything \\"rock\\" about it. Scofield and the other musicians' playing is far too clean for rock. Its definitely jazzy. But this album makes no bones about the fact that everything is being built from the rhythm up. And when you do that, no matter what genre of music your playing,the result if going to be funk of the highest order. Which is what one will find here.of the 70's HI rhythm section. \\"Snake Dance\\" and \\"Torero\\" are the most harmonically,melodically and rhythmically complex pieces here.

B008YRVW0I|1.0|It downloaded on my tablet, but was not compatible, So  I could not use it.<br />So had to uninstall it.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I love this game! I am addicted to it. It is a fast past timed puzzle but you are only playing against yourself (in one part of it) so you can go fast or slow down and enjoy the moment.  LOL
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|This is a fun and entertainment game, the only thing I would like to see is the game can store in the SD card instead on the phone. If this can move to SD card, it will get another or two stars.
B006LSZECO|4.0|How no idea what to expect from this book.  It was chosen for my book club.  One of the liveliest conversations we ever had.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Saw the movie first - the book is far superior because of the scope and variety of accounts. Easy to read while multiple interruptions were occuring which is how I usually  read.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Great last section. A little Dickens Great Expectations component with a twist.  I re-read the last chapter. Wanted it to go on longer.
B002KV74ZG|5.0|Why do I love Keanu so much? Did it start with the Matrix movies?...NO! It was &#34;SPEED&#34; and the way he delivered his line in response to the question &#34;What's going to stop this elevator?&#34; (or words to that effect) and he replies &#34;the basement.&#34; While the tone is often deadpan, it's still a tone I can't seem to get enough of.  Or maybe it was &#34;MY PRIVATE IDAHO&#34; as a very convincing hustler. I just never seem to get enough of him, his dark good looks...sigh!
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|touching look at aging friends and mending life's bad choices.  Love comes again a second time,  Using the precious time you have left.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed the book it was a easy fast read. It kept my interest from start to finish. Two day read.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|Gameplay seems easy to route terrain and take out orders.  Controls are located in easy areas of screen.  Only negative comment is it takes a while to get use to walk/run and turning your view, at the same time.  Otherwise so far so good.
B007R41E8O|4.0|i was pleasantly surprised to at how much longer this game was compared to others that i have purchased. i always play on expert to make the game last longer. i was tired of going through three games in one day this one last me a couple
B0012HF5NC|5.0|This is the perfect summer movie, with a lot of great moments in it. Whenever it comes on TV, I let it run.
B004YW4L5K|5.0|A student of mine recommended this book to me a couple of years ago, but for a variety of reasons I didn't get around to reading it until I came across a reference to it recently and thought I'd give it a try. It's been a while since I've enjoyed a novel as much. I cannot recommend this story highly enough. The interplay of characters combined with an incisive exploration of the meaning of the American experience makes for a thoroughly satisfying read.
0425263924|5.0|cant wait until the next one comes out  :)  so sad its over i couldnt put it down and im not really a reader
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|it keeps me stimulated. i am always trying to complete level after level. i am looking forward to reaching the end.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|This game is fun and very addicting. This game will definitely have you playing hours on end and can make a tedious day very exciting. The graphics or pictures are beautiful. There are 3 different game modes you can choose from. I only wish that the game itself was a little more challenging.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The first day i got them they were really tight on my head, but after a bit of wearing them either I got used to it or they loosened up enough to be plenty comfortable.  Before I installed the software from Logitech I was dismayed not to have any way of knowing how much battery life I had left so I installed it.  Now I can pull it up and see that I've got 4 hours or whatever left.  The battery is supposed to last about 10 hours on one full charge, though I seem to get around 7 hours on a charge. Not a big deal, my last ones were corded and since you can still use them while it's charging I don't mind it at all.  All in all a nice set .. it's been about 4 days. If anything changes I'll be back to update.
B005EHQGTS|3.0|It works as advertised but wants to be online to sign into it's servers before you can connect to your own. I don't like that one bit. You have to pay to be able to connect to your PC's offline for an anytime access pack (I think that's what it's called) which is incredibly annoying. I understand they need to make their money but I can use a different app for free without those requirements so I uninstalled and went with something else.
B000N4SHOE|3.0|100% chick flick that I bought as a present for my mom. If you like Renee Zellweger and the horde of British movies that seemed to come out in the 1990s then you'll enjoy this one too. If you really like Zellweger and would like to see her do a better acting job, check out a drama she made early in her career, \\"A Price Above Rubies.\\" It's not for everyone and has a serious theme about jewish life, but it's better than \\"Miss Potter\\".
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|Packed well, and arrived on time for Father's Day. Product greatly exceeded my expectations. And I could make an awesome gift!!!!
B000F8O35U|5.0|Bought if for my granddaughter.  I'm getting her started on the Disney classics.  This is a good one to start with.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is a really fun game I let my 2yr.old play with .y Kindle And he<br />Is very scratcHed he downloaded this gAme and I've been playing it every since<br />And I can't stop for minutes at a time...wish me luck backing away from this fun kid game
B004UFEJVW|3.0|Love the movie! But this specific one I ordered was very glitchy, it jammed within the first 20 minutes, but continued normally for the rest of the movie.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I REALLY LOVE THIS APP...IT PRETTY ACCURATE ON THE WEATHER AND IT'S A FAST AND EASY WAY TO SEE THE WEATHER RIGHT AT THE END OF MY FINGER TIPS.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome!!! I love the despicable movies! my friends and I are obsessed with the minons, so this is a good game for me! :)
B001ANSSDC|4.0|A lovely read about strange love, and not so perfect family life.<br />A good novel which I could easily recommend to others.
B004UID2LC|5.0|free music download. so you can listen to music with out wifi. Pandora needs wifi. but FREEdi Youtube Downloader does not.
B007G92QGO|3.0|Exciting story and I especially enjoyed the end. However, I couldn't associate how a mother can be so distant from a child, even as a he was a young child.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is awesome and I love it you should definately play this game it is very good if you are a horse lover
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book love how the words help you see the pictures in your head!!<br />You should read this book you will love it!!
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|Not bad if you're seeking mindless diversion otherwise skip this one. Arnold is beginning to show his age but then, aren't we all?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Great game!!!!! I didn't expect much from this game only downloaded it because my son begged me to. Now I'm hooked!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|Easy to use with all the main editing tools you need. This is a little beauty of an app. Can't recommend it enough.
B002SSUQFG|3.0|Arrived on time, looks good strap ok and I gave it about 100 swings to get it wound well so it would not stop during the night. I have worn this watch about six days and it is about -15 seconds per day. I know a watchmaker and I will have it regulated to achieve closer accuracy. I have a number of Seiko automatic watches but they rarely are regulated carefully before leaving the factory. I also have a Citizen Bm8180-03e that I bought from another vendor over four years ago. It never stops if properly charged when taken out of the box and is very accurate, about 1 second positive per week because it is quartz. It has a better rating on your web site. Conclusion; If you want accuracy try a quartz watch, but if you like mechanical watches and can regulate them or have someone do it this is a good starter watch.<br />July 19, 2013<br />I had the Seiko snk809 regulated to about 2-5 seconds positive per day and the Citizen BM8180-03e has run about 1 second per week positive for the over 4 years I have had it which is the big difference between quartz and mechanical watches.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|By far, one of the best series I've ever watched.  Not to be missed.  Start with Season 1, Episode 1, and you won't be able to stop watching.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Excellent series.  Each of the characters was complex and interesting -- and surprising!  This series is easily of the same quality as 'The Sopranos,'
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Love this flash. Definitely works great, as do all Nikon products. I use it mostly for photos where I cannot highlight faces enough.
0060254920|5.0|We read this so often we have it memorized.  We inserted our child's name instead of \\"Max\\"--and it's best with sound effects (Arrr!  Roar!) and eye rolling with terrible claws:  my babies, toddlers, and kids laughed and laughed.  Hard to say what's best about this book:  the pictures or the lyrical language or the story or the message:  unconditional love. \\"And it was still hot!\\" is the all-time greatest line in all of children's literature.  RIP Mr. Sendak!
B00992CF6W|4.0|I really like this app. but please make it free! it is crazy that its 7$!! Maybe as a limited offer for 1 day it could be free.  lots more downloads will be made. including me. so 7$--- no.  free--- YES
0439023521|3.0|The main character has almost no personality or thought beyond the acquisition of food. This makes for a very dull character to read about (although there are moments of what I'm sure are unintentional humor). As 'starving' people in the real world usually have a bit more on their minds than food, this is not a sign of where she comes from but rather just a sign that she is a really shallow human being.<br /><br />The main thing that bothered me was that the characters never need to relieve themselves. Although I don't want graphic depictions of the act, it is a key point in that it creates vulnerability while being hunted and is also an important method of tracking (since the main character is a hunter, she would know this in the real world). I've used 'business' sighting while hiking to aid me in avoiding certain creatures that I'd rather not bump into. The absence of this touch of reality made it hard for me to consider the book well thought out and well researched.<br /><br />Overall, it was an ok read for a young adult book. I borrowed the book from the library and will likely borrow the next one in the series with the hope that the character evolves a bit.
B002S43V3Y|4.0|This cult classic has maintained its charm over the decades by illuminating society's delusions in a quirky story with a darker side. If you liked The Graduate, you'll find similar entertainment here.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A quick game for a fun break!<br />A great game for taking a rest from other hectic work.<br />Bonus: it's free!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|While quirky, Ford reaffirms why no other actor should be Indiana. Put together - the late 50's setting, the Cold War, Aliens, Rock n Roll - a lot is going on & this fourth installment felt more in line with Last Crusade. The humor is similar. CGI could've definitely been tuned down a notch. All of that doesn't much matter. Spielberg and Lucas could make indiana Jones feel like a b-movie and people would still pay the ticket.
B003V1WST6|5.0|I love this book so much that when it went on sale I had to buy it!<br />The tales of Angela Clark are very funny and highly entertaining.<br />Lindsey Kelk knows how to bring the laughs with the I Heart Series.
B003NTSBUG|4.0|Got around to watching this after previously falling asleep the two times I planned on watching. The story had some weak spots, but dicaprio and scorcese are the reasons to watch it in the first place.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|We like our Kindle for reading, games and software.  IT is has proven reliable and valuable.  We wished the batter lasted longer it's about half the time of an iPad but non-the less we like it very much and wold buy an upgrade in the future.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Liked this game a lot kept me completely engrossed. As good as a mystery novel. It's worth every penny. Can't wait for the next part
B00957T6X6|5.0|There are quibblers saying that the kindle version doesn't separate the books conveniently.<br />The version I bought has a contents page that allows you tap a link to jump to any book.<br />Within the book you can jump to any chapter from the table of contents. What's the problem?<br /><br />I get 5 books (over 1000 pages each) fitting in my pocket,<br />how can anyone say that's not convenient?<br />For that matter, where does anyone get off saying it's &#34;expensive&#34;?<br />You're paying less than a dollar for every hundred pages of top-shelf fantasy.<br /><br />The one gripe that I'd say is legitimate, is that the blurb makes it sound<br />like this is a completed series of 5 books. The series is 7 books<br />and the other 2 have yet to be written.<br /><br />The writing is excellent, and stays consistently good throughout.<br />Loads of detail but never boring. I find myself tearing through the books at warp speed.<br />Most of the time, if I enjoy a book this much, I end up reading everything too fast<br />and then feel sad that it's over too quickly.<br />Thankfully that won't be a problem with over 4000 pages of excellent writing ahead of you.<br /><br />If you picked this up because of the TV series... you're in for a treat.<br />It's like getting &#34;the director's cut&#34; of the storyline, with all these extra deleted scenes restored,<br />and you can see where certain complex area of the plot were condensed to save time.<br /><br />If you never owned the books, or read them long ago and want to reread them,<br />this set is exactly what you're looking for.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|I think that computer animation is over done. The acting is sub-par and the plot is boring. Don't waste your money on this  one.
B00BKBCF38|5.0|This is a great follow up to Opus Eponymous.  The first album contained songs that I could not get out of my head, and the second record is no different.  Stand out tracks are Ghuleh/Zombie Queen and Monstrance Clock.  The only problem I have with Ghost are the lyrics, I'm really not a fan of satanic lyrics/blasphemy but I have to give them respect musically.  I just don't take them too serious.  I could be wrong though...update 3/10/2014  this is a five star record.  After meeting Papa and seeing the band live, my total opinion has changed, these tracks are even better live.
B004E9T0HW|4.0|John Scalzi is an excellent story teller, I just miss some of the deph in the story and the caracters that were present in the first books.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I loved this game years ago when I played it with my kids. It was so much fun to play the game as a family.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I watched all of the three seasons, and waited a month for season three to be on prome. I loved this series up until the last 2 minutes of the last show. Super bad ending!
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game waz so addicting I couldn't put it down. I had 2 keep going and waz sad wen it waz done. My brother even wanted 2 play it and he tries 2 avoid doing things I do. It waz cool b/c u hav 2 think outside the box and make up ur own inventions. And waz different b/c most games give u wat u need, and not let u do it yourself
B000088SYA|5.0|I totally enjoyed this blast from the past! This is a great cd to play while on a road trip.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I'm a Despicable Me junkie lol! I love the home screen that displays your minion where you can interact with it (I.e. poke his eye or tummy making him laugh or get angry)  Much like Temple Run and absolutely adorable, you can change your minion's clothing as well! Totally recommending to friends.
B000002GVO|5.0|I can still remember when I first heard their song &#34;Hotel California&#34;. The song as well as the album was mesmerizing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its great for those who love horses and would like to experience the joy and hard work that goes into owning one.
B00BY8DIT2|2.0|I am a huge Beth Hart fan, but I did not care for this CD. It is all covers of old songs from artists such as Etta James. Not my Beth
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great minecraft game for people that are on a road trip or someone that is somewhere that a computer can't go.The updates are incredible!! It's only limited a bit but they can't put the PC version into the PE version it's absolutely amazing this app is worth the 7 dollars!!
0439023521|5.0|Gripping adventure.  Could happen on our planet if we don't pay attention to resources.  Gave the set to my grandson.  Would like to see the movies.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a great read for anyone who liked the movie or just wants to read a unusual but very engaging love story. It is not your normal love story, it is filled with unique circumstances which makes this book unlike other plain love story. The characters will make you laugh and cry because of the authors excellent job of making them believable. Disappointed at the fact that there wasn't more Tiffany in the book like there was in the movie. Also Pats dad really wasn't as animated as he was in the film. Overall i enjoyed this book and the warm feeling you get inside while reading this novel.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Interesting, believable, suspensful, disappointing ending.  Do we really box ourselves into impossible situations and live them out?  Maybe a lesson for us.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book I think five stars the movie is ten stars maybe even  20 book ten I've been told to read it many times
B009SJ3H8Q|5.0|This show is amazing.  Whoever comes up with this stuff is some kind of sick puppy.  Watch it and decide for yourself.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is my favorite show on tv. Can't wait till season 4! Cast is awesome, and it is a very well written show.  I suggest you watch!
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|I watched the movie twice within two days and was amazed how beautiful it turned out to be. I was immediately drawn to the scenes at the beginning and the narrator (the boy himself) introduced people, names and the tiger in a very funny way... Well, if you haven't watched it, definitely give it a try. It's a movie shows great courages of a human being and tremendous dedications of the film makers. Well done!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie was a different approach to a well worn topic. I really enjoyed the humor and my husband even got sucked into the crazy, but funny storyline. The only thing that made me not love it was the cheesiness of the end. But rarely am I impressed by present-day movie endings, as they all fall into a realm of some predictability.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Diggin this game! Started playing a while back. Never had any problems. Give it a shot u might just like it!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surf is a awsome game i love it its the best game in tha wprld its better than temple run
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This was an excellent pick for the Amazon free app. Though I don't have a great deal of time to play games, I always enjoy a well-made, quality game when I do. I highly recommend this.
B00475AYJQ|4.0|I got into this series by looking up the 25 best fantasy series books, and I have not been disappointed. Kvothe is a complex and interesting charcater, and certainly more flawed than many of your heroes. This is a very good read!
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|... Has brightened this readers life immeasurably. The characters, like beloved family members, bring joy, sadness, tears and emotional camaraderie to a life we Americans can only wonder about. Well, Mr. Hosseinii has lifted the curtain and exposed the drama, simplicity honor and integrity of Afghanistan morals and mores. The writers style is fluid and often times poetic. A great read!
B005X7HAAS|4.0|This is a yakuza movie, hardly the first of its kind. Also, I think this could be great for some people while it could look like random and often extreme violence to others. There isn't much storytelling to it- of course, the betrayal and downfall of outlaw families but not a dedicated plot like many other 'good' movies.<br /><br />However, I think that adds up to this movie's reality. I think Kitano wanted to portray the lives of outlaws true to its reality rather than make a beautified version of it. There's no romance, there's no salvation for anyone, just endless strife for money, killing, vendetta, and getting thrown off the game.<br />Also, in Japan, there's a nostalgia for a thing called 'Ninkyo'... something like honor and trust even between outlaws, but in this movie, the person who stands for it, Otomo, is ultimately killed(or seems like it). It isn't that well portrayed in this movie(although it is shown much better in the sequel, Outrage Beyond), but I could say the likes of Kato and Ishihara stand for the rather 'dishonorable' kind.<br /><br />So, if you have/or want some understanding of such background, this movie could be interesting to you.<br />If not... and you like stories with an intricate plot, this may be just random brutal violence, and may be disappointing to you. You may still want to hang on for Outrage Beyond, because as Kitano himself had said, the sequel to this movie is more oriented for entertainment, and has a relatively... well, 'poetic justice' should I say, type of story.
B004LL1HM4|4.0|I really liked this follow-up album.  The first track in particular is spot on.  There are many other good tracks too, but the first one hit the right chords with me.  I found there were fewer catchy tunes that stuck with me though than what their first album offered.  Of course, that is my personal opinion and doesn't apply to everybody.  I enjoyed the even-numbered tracks the best after the 1st one.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is fun if you love horses but you can't own one.Its great accept the fact you can buy so many things and every time you do something a commercial pops up.Other then that its a great game.
B0094K1K42|4.0|I liked the movie. It was entertaining and fun to watch Charlize's charector grow up and learn what she needed to to become a better person.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|Michael Connelly did not disappoint.  Great book and love reading the adventures of the great Mickey Haller.  Would definitely recommend.
B004DMNT2W|3.0|it was tough getting my jvc camera to fit inside, the band inside holds the camera also prevents putting camera in.
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This is the best wifi file explorer I ever seen. It connected almost instaneously once you open the apps. No need to mess with ftp setting.  Simply fast and easy. Highly recommended.
B007STXHTM|5.0|This thing is much better than the standard underwater GoPro case.  Perfect picture underwater.  It does hide a little of the function screen on the front.  Easy to change the doors, I have a LCD backpack on my Hero 2, works like a charm.  I've had this to 130' with no issues at all. Its a little pricey, but if you want a good shot at spearing a big fish, you need to check this out.
B007MDB71O|5.0|This ranks in the top 10% of Disney movies ever made in my opinion.  It was originally planned to be a trilogy but because of the disappointment at the box office, the next two were cancelled.  If you have not seen this movie yet, you should, you will not be disappointed.  I don't understand why it did not do well at the box office.  If you have seen it and would like Disney to continue to make the trilogy, do a Google search for John Carter sequel and you will find at the top of the search a website with links to petitions.
B001HZK8FO|4.0|Excellent movie. The package is very good. With many accessories that highlight the collectible version. The film quality is very good.
B008OOYALE|1.0|POOR  The game was not easy for my fourth grader except for when it came to charging account.  Good I was sitting next to her.  The game is hardly begun (20 minutes, mostly guessing what to do) when they start asking for Real US$ to repeat hatching eggs in what little you have learned. She didn't know the money was for real, couldn't work out the coins-gold-money-points in 30 minutes. HISSSSSsssss!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Dumb book.  Only finished reading it because I'm too cheap to waste the money I paid for it.  Entirely predictable, repetitive, and cumbersome.  Garbage.
1781162646|5.0|Great Seller great buy
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I just started playing this game. my grandson saw me playing it and just loves it also. I usually get tired of the games pretty fast,but this one has me hooked!  And was lucky enough to get it free.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The updated program is head and shoulders above anything else on the market. Love it,  keep it up amd keep improving<br />T
B001GCUO16|5.0|Wolverine's and Sabertooth's origins. This shows Wolverine as child name James, his first kill, after the killing He brother will his brother,, their life together, their break up. Also the Blob, Gambit and Deadpool. Are in this movie. Wolverine is also known as Logan in this movie.
B007Z8ZKS2|3.0|This was a really nice story which had me feeling sad & happy all at once very good read & would recommend it to anyone who likes a good cry!
B009X011UQ|4.0|It is exactly what I wanted at a reasonable price.  I like the color and the protection and security it provides.
B009GI8J1O|5.0|I love David Mitchell`s books and have read all 5 of them.  This is much better than the film though I really enjoyed it.  The books structure is different and emphasizes the connected themes a little better.  The characters carry elements of human oppression, love and Destiny in a fascinating diversity of plot and character development - highly recommended.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|My girls love it! They can make her over and do it again over and over! Would recommend to ant young girl.
142311339X|5.0|I'm in my twenties and I still thought this book, which was geared toward younger readers, was very well done. The humor is cheesy at times, but I found myself busting out in random fits of laughter all the same. It is extremely easy to read, and the plot just glides by without a lot of &#34;wait, what?&#34; moments to hinder your enjoyment. The characters may seem cliche at times, but the mythology behind this fantastic opening of the Percy Jackson companion series certainly isn't. You can see many of the plot twists coming, kind of like a &#34;bridge may ice in winter&#34; sign, but you still won't be bored with this book. It is longer than the original series installments, which gives me hope for a longer-length fun ride within future books. In fact, I've picked up the second book already and am a few chapters into it too. Extremely well done, Mr. Riordan. Keep up the phenomenal work.<br /><br />The only bad thing I have to say about this series is the parenting standards are extremely bad, which bothers me a lot. However, the gods were never known to be nice beings, much less parents. I suppose I'm really glad they aren't parents in real life is all I'm saying.<br /><br />Overall: Great kickoff book! Perfect for younger readers, but don't let that stop you &#34;old folk&#34; from cracking it open. I'd recommend it for preteens and early teens easy, but it's pretty flexible. Warning: this is a just-have-fun-with-it kind of book, so if you're not willing to have fun, don't read it and go grab yourself some autobiographies on your way home.
B003V4AK8E|4.0|If you are like me and switching over from XBOX to a PS III this is a must.  Years of XBOX play builds up a muscle memory that is hard to shake.  The triggers (left and right are not the best but on the whole it make the transition much smoother.  The grips are very nice add on.  I would recommend this product.
0545265355|5.0|Book 1<br />This is a wonderful book with an excellent plot and quite a lot of energy! Be prepared for blood, comedy, excitement, and a female lead who isn't caught up with just her romantic future. Katniss Everdeen doesn't even seem to understand love in fact, but that does not mean she is without suitors. I find romance to be an interesting piece of this story, but not the center stage emotion in the plot line.<br /><br />The fundamental player in this story is justice and equality of opportunity. You will follow a very intense story line that twists and pulls you through the convoluted world of Panem. You will feel revulsion at first, but then you may find yourself given over to the disgusting exhilaration of the Games, not wholly unlike the main character. It is very addictive to watch as 24 tributes go through the arena and fight to the death for their own survival and for their districts, although the latter isn't always the foremost thought on their mind when someone wants to skewer them with a spear, sword, or arrow. I will warn you that this is the first in a trilogy and you will want to read them all in quick succession, so prepare accordingly. I would suggest buying a box set of all three if you haven't already.<br /><br />Overall: This story is good, fun, and addicting. The heroine is an easy-to-relate-to kind of person who thinks clearly and rationally and it isn't all about love with this girl (thank you, Mrs. Collins). I would wholeheartedly recommend this and the other two books to just about anybody over the age of 12, and that limit is just because of the fighting and overwhelming emotion of it all. Very good book!<br /><br />Book 2<br />Amazing is one of the only words I can find to describe this book. It was a fantastic follow up to the first story. Excellent plot and characterization, just like the first book. You connect with Collin's characters and their mentality. I found myself sharing Katniss' emotions the entire book long. I was not just observing her life from her viewpoint; I was LIVING her life with her.<br /><br />Collins has such an amazing writing style, even when her descriptions and scenarios get choppy, which they only do occasionally, you can't simply stop reading. It was hard to put the book down. Sometimes I would have to force myself to take a break, but I couldn't stop thinking about what might happen so I would just settle back in and keep going along. This book did have a distinct feel as well. It was different from the first one in many ways, all of which was good. The involvement of subtle politics and subterfuge really caught my interest and had me glued to each development, hungry for more with each flip of the page. Most second books in a trilogy have see through plots and little to no character development, but this book was different. I can see why this series is so popular.<br /><br />Overall: This book is very intense, funny, sad, and awesome. I would recommend it for older young adult readers (that sounded awkward) above 12 unless they handle fighting and death really well.<br /><br />Book 3<br />Mrs. Collins, I loved the first two books in this series, but you lose a star on this one. I don't blame you, dear. It's that whole thing about how 'It's me not you,' ya know? Anyway, I liked the ending and I agree with your reasoning on who Katniss ends up with romantically, which mirrored my own opinions from the very first book.<br /><br />The best way I can describe how this book made me feel would be a bundle of raw nerves twitching and writhing about in bed after finishing it at 4AM. I knew to expect deaths, I even knew to expect a lot of them. I had myself prepared, or so I thought...then they started dropping like flies. All of them dead, gone, no more. I felt like Katniss did; like I had stood by and made way for the characters' deaths somehow. I felt I enabled their deaths by reading the book, and I had to stop many times while reading and convince myself it was a book. Iwas, once again, living Katniss' life with her, killing or making way for others being killed, struggling with the feelings she had for the two love interests, and being overwhelmed with these sensations. I almost got in my closet when she did each time. I even had nightmares last night; saw things that weren't there. It was one of the most personal experiences a young adult book has ever managed to give me, and I am still wondering how I feel about that. One particular character's death stung me in a way I was sure it never could, but nevertheless, I was destroyed with Katniss when that character died. Even the ending held mixed feelings for me. I absolutely agree with who Katniss ended up with, but I almost felt angry at the other guy. Like he hurt her on purpose, and enjoyed it...but that's just a feeling I had.<br /><br />Basically, I just can't give this book 5 stars. I want to and I know it deserves them, but I just...can't. It was an amazing ride though, and I loved it. The ending felt so bittersweet, my chest was aching. I want to see more of Katniss. I never want to leave her side. I actually envy that guy she ends up with. You did exactly what you set out to do in that first book, Mrs. Collins. You made Katniss desirable.<br /><br />Overall: Great book. Excellent finish to a series. Beautiful plot and characters, which may sound odd describing some of these individuals, but differences make us unique, right? I would recommend this book and this series to anyone above 12 years of age. Bravo, Mrs. Collins. Bravo.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this. Very challenging and addicting. My grandkids love helping me find clues. Highly recommend for all ages  and it is free!<br />  Love this!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is easily the best keyboard out right now. They've done everything right. Proud to say I've been using them since they first came out. They continue to impress me and surprise me. I don't ever usually pay for an app. But this would be an exception
B00992CF6W|3.0|It's just not as fun without caves and that there's no potions or enchantment table I really think that the next update that the souls add that and update this a little faster 6$ is a lot to pay for the game but where's everything that makes it fun
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|The Little ones love this game! Very entertaining,  got this as part of the free app of the day. Just Fab!!
B000021Y77|5.0|Bought this for a big school paper so I could watch it over and over. Shipping was very fast and came when expected. Works great on my computer.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cool app. fun to take care of horses . competing with the horse is stupid cause you cant advance. you don't seem to make money very fast either.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|i have bought many apps, this is the first one that warrants a positive review.  my kids and i love eating the swimmers! !
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I really enjoyed the book...great story! I've read all of his books & I highly would recommend all of them!!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Cute.  Very fun.  Action is smooth.<br /><br />The goal for each level is to collect gems. You aim the chimp to jump through the forest in search of the gems. You accumulate points as bananas as you travel.<br /><br />Simple to use. Levels do get progressively more difficult.<br /><br />Sound is silly and fun.,  I turn off the sound for most games - but the excitement of the little chimp is infectious.<br /><br />A very nice time waster.<br /><br />Used on a Samsung Galaxy S4
1568363931|5.0|Great way to see new ways to pack a lunch.  And there are a lot of new dishes that<br />I can make.  Bento is great on a trip, or just to bring for friends.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|very much improved upon from the last game.  the sealed campaign is a nice addition to the game.  I also purchased this on steam as well.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love this movie it keep you on your toes and he was so mean in the beginning and to watch her fall in love with him was really neat
B0067RQYNW|4.0|I like this app so far. Just downloaded a couple days ago and was able to complete my work with ease and with little tutorial for word document. Automatically downloads from your email if you choose. No additional steps required. Would recommend to others.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|I'll tel you my Dads description, because he's more of a Sabbath fan than i am mostly because he's my Dad and older than me and has been a fan since they first appeared on the scene. Any way he says it like their first album. For me i was expecting heart pounding stuff like war pigs and paranoid but its still freaking awesome. Also the drummer from rage dose a good job his words.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Good games for both myself and my 5 year old. Although it would be nice if all the games were easily unlocked.
B00004RYXY|5.0|had seen this performance in Macon Ga last month, and this DVD was almost as good!  It's a way to keep my memory of the performance forever!  love Cirque du DSoleil
B0012HQKZE|4.0|the movie was very good, the bear was a genius . and it was dilivered on time and we really enjoyed the movie, thank you, always nice to work with a honest seller.
0743455967|5.0|A great book for anyone even thinking about writing. It's more than a manual. Mr. King takes the reader for a tour of his own writing journey. Inspiring!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it is cute. I think there should be more games like this one.  The horses are very realistic. cute.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I love angry birds...my 7 yr old grandson got me hooked on angry birds 2 years ago and I love having this on my kindle.
B00C0W08XK|5.0|I too have been doing the game on paper. This is so much easier. I really enjoy it. I also like that you can choose your difficulty level. I will be playing alot more now that I don't have to find a pencil. Thanks for the great game.
0385737955|5.0|This book kept my attention from the first page to the last. I read it in one night and went as soon as the bookstore opened in the morning to pick up the next two.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you love subway surfers or temple run,  then this is the game for you, its fun, hilarious, and mind taking.  you will be hooked on this game for days!
0679805273|5.0|I have been using this as the go too graduation gift for folks I know for years.  I love this book and what it says.  I continue to use it as the starter gift and add to it depending on the person.  I think Dr. Seuss says it all in such a great supportive way.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|It's a fun game. Great graphics. Challenging levels. I have played it for only one day, and I am afraid I may already be addicted to it.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was by far the worst of the three books. It was obvious and unsatisfying. I don't think a fairy tale ending was needed, but that was a bad way to end the series.
B0002VFXFE|3.0|I used more than half a tube just to complete one peltier assembly for a thermodynamics project. Goes no where as far as expected.<br />Does transfer heat well.
034552554X|5.0|I loved this book. It really made me think how lucky I was to have loving family. I like to see different perspective on life and this book really gave me a lot to think about. It is going to be my pick for my book club!!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love the minions, this game is a good time waster. Lots of fun, and very entertaining. Highly recommend trying this game out.
1451695195|5.0|I recommended this to my book club and the group went for it.  We had a great discussion and I would highly recommend it.
B00CDV6WDS|3.0|ometimes i am not wsure the game is responding-also not sure if i am playing it right. needs more instructions
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|Still ok, but it's starting to feel like a &#34;telenovela.&#34;I saw the whole accident thing coming, which means it's just getting to predictable. I hope Season 4 is not going to be a dissapointment
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great version! Easy for all....new or experienced. Challenging no glitches  a lot of fun. Awesome version. Thank you. Have fun
B0011U1K16|5.0|This album works for any time of the day, 365 days out of the year. Once you finished listening you will find yourself humming some of the songs. True mastery from a master! I've got to have Kaya now!
B00CI5ET7K|5.0|Read a lot of the other reviews on this album before I bought it, all I can say is is still Joe and he has never failed to inspire and entertain me in the past and he still hasn't let me down with this album.
B00AFU2AZS|5.0|A true classic album. My only problem with this album is that it isn't long enough. I am left wanting more.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|The first and second books were fairly well written. This third volume was a disappointment. Seemd to be unfocussed and pointless, almost amaturish in its writing. Has to be read to find out what happens but definitely not on my recommended list.
B00456H5LC|4.0|I picked this one up late and found that I already knew some of the songs. Mars is the real deal, a true talent! This is the way Pop Music is supposed to sound!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is so much fun and very hard not to put the game down. Can't wait to see the fun that I will be having with my grandson.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|In a short book, Gaiman manages to convey a complete alternate universe and explores various issues of identity, worth and lost innocence. Although seems to be marketed with a YA cast, it's a book for all ages.
B0000549B0|5.0|great family movie  digit redone watch it on HD tv like being in the movies not cursing or nudity classic not like the trash they make now
1594136238|5.0|I am very pleased with this purchase - which is paperback and large print.  I am devouring it, and have about 100 pages to go!
B001HM1PFO|5.0|If you love rock and roll. If you like like double features like the old day If like to watch a movie and not think it out during the movie then THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW is for you if you never seen it or live under a rock get it you like
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie, you must see it. It is fantastic. Although it is rather gory and graphic, it doesn't take away from the movie. It's a Tarantino movie, so what do you expect ;)
B00005LOUP|5.0|This is one of my favorite Christmas movies that I watch every year and needed to replace a VHS by DVD copy.  Love it!
B000I9W08I|5.0|I can watch this movie over and over and over. If you love musicals, this is a classic and if you are a Barbra Streisand fan, well, I know you have already seen this movie. Love it!
B009WO7NQO|3.0|I guess I am just not one to keep games for very long.  This was ok and lots of people love the Angry Birds games but I find myself getting bored with it after a bit.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app helped me learn how great 3d care games are! This game also made me love horses and carding for them.I know love the idea of owning and training a horse. I just hope she is as easy to take care of as in the game.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|shows current weather all the time at your location, shows radar and forecast. my phone shows local temperature all the time. love it.
0446572985|5.0|Once again, David Baldacci has shown what talent he has as an author.  I have read many of his books and have thoroughly enjoyed them all.  This one was no different.  Keeps you turning the pages as fast as you can throughout the whole book waitng to see what possibly could be around the corner for those involved.  The ending wasn't the end I expected but after mulling it over, it was the perfect ending.  I highly recommend this book.  I have also just bought his next book, &#34;the Hit&#34; and I can't wait to get started on it!<br /><br />Irishgirl11
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Graphics incredible, puzzles challenging yet not impossible, and a sense of achievement every time you solve a little piece and then go onto the next section.  That is The Room.  Wow!  The hints were good when needed but didn't give it all away.  And sometimes the hints came across as very obvious to me - that's what makes this game so good because it appeals to many levels of ability.  Highly recommend and cannot wait for The Room Two.  The makers of this App have got themselves a winner here.  I hope they go onto produce many more because you truly do have a brilliant imagination that you have visualized superbly.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I haven't used it a lot, but I do like to see what kind of weather is coming, and to see what is happening in the rest of the couintry.
B00AEFZ6V4|5.0|I got it on time and in perfect condition. I really couldn't have asked for more. It's one of my favorites and I'd recommend it to any one.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|What a cute idea!  I'm not sure I will keep the melodies on for an extended time, but it's fun to have it on for awhile.  Music is always good.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|i would give this movie 5 stars because of the plot behind it. i will have to watch it again to understand it 5 stars anyway. i hear there is going to be a part 2 the young lady that played the main character was a great actress. but once again to understand i will watch again.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I watched the original movies with the English subtitles.  The books are outstanding and give so much detail you miss in the movies.  I would recommend them to everyone.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|Great interface but lacks of at least the headlines to be available offline. Excellent graphic design and speed. And<br />The app tins well in any device.
B0092S4WLY|1.0|Same as I wrote for your other app it STINKS!!!!!!! I wouldn't waists time on this unless your really really. really really really etc. bored
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|its great at first it takes a while to load but I wait one minute and it loaded its just like subway suffers.  best thing is its perfect for my grandkid
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|A co-worker recommended Angry Birds. I love the game and the sounds that it makes! (LOL) Several of the levels have been challenging, but I'm giving them my all! Thanks a lot for providing this free app!!!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|loved it. not as much as theature of the absurd. but. much .&oslash;better than dragon wheel. great grafics and good story.
B004JRVQX0|3.0|It stinks that we have to buy hardware to prove we aren't software pirates. If the software company wants us to have these keys, they should be provided with the software they are meant to protect.
1594487154|5.0|He articulates his concept and point well.  It is very well written and is relevant to anyone who works with people.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|The app is quite interesting since I can view a lot of content on my Kindle Fire with just a tap. However, I can't view my web magazines on the app. I wonder if this is a feature.
0007444397|5.0|So I had this book and (my mom says I lost it but I wouldn't lose anything with Niall in it) someone stole it so I was really happy to get a hard cover version of it. And it came the day before I left for camp which was three days ahead of when it was supposed to be here! So happy
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|This app looked really fun but once I got it it takes for ever to load. And once I want replay it takes forever to load. Plus my friend had to download it 5 times. PLEASE IMPROVE!!!
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|Solid logic and interesting discussion. I was a non-believer already but after reading Dawkins i wonder how anyone can be a believer.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun an challeging game.  My daughter and I have had hours of fun playing. I love playing this game.
B008M7JODC|4.0|Kind of like a New Generation X-Files, the show is really good and seems to take some genuine science fiction and science fact and weaves a nice story around which keeps me coming back.  Looking forward to cruising through the rest of the seasons.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love it and I'm 12 lol everyone in my family loves it even my parents it makes them laugh after a hard day's work :)
B00821OX98|5.0|Very captivating and addicting. Glad it's free in my amazon prime. Will wait for season 3 to be free as well
B00BESJYAY|3.0|I was hoping to see more action and perhaps more adventure...if fell short of my expectations...some scenes were left with someting else missing.
B0018RC7QE|3.0|Nothing memorable here other than the absence of cell phones. Two marriages shattered with little going for the shambles of both families.
B009XWD02G|1.0|This doesn't even make sense.. I go to listen to the songs that come up, and all I hear is a fart sound..
B005K17RU0|3.0|That's my only quibble with this site. Uploads each time as opposed to the weather channel which sadly changed its own format to oblivion.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This Is A Review From A Long Time Fan Of Scribblenauts.<br />played and still play on the 3ds, now I found it on the kindle fire!:) It Is Well Worth The. 99&cent; You Have To Pay.<br />No Adds Whatsoever. Just Completely Awesome! My Son Also Loved It:)
0062255657|4.0|This book was very well written, and the story was imaginative.  I really enjoyed it.  If you like Neil Gaiman's other works, you will probably like this book as well.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|hands down awesome. but i hate this 17 word requirement cause i got nothing more to say. hands down best
0761169253|3.0|This book is kind of inspiring. It challenges the way we think about creativity and it encourages people to embrace inspiration where ever they can find it.<br /><br />Still it's very thin and it doesn't leave any food for thought.<br /><br />So my verdict is: Short and fun read. But don't expect it to leave anything behind.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|this is a very useful app. I have found it to be better then most of the other battery apps.
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|First, let me clear the air about something. This movie, while children are certainly justified to watch it, is more of a nod towards the Brony community itself, not the child demographic. That's why it was a little more heavy in terms of plot, character development, etc...<br />I, for one, absolutely loved it. I may appear to be biased because I am, in fact, a brony. However, my cousin is the one who gave me a ride; she has never watched ANYTHING with MLP on it, yet she even enjoyed the film.<br /><br />This film is certainly child friendly because it has a great message and exemplifies the power of friendship! However, it is more for the brony community itself.<br /><br />The film has many hilarious antics that you would see your pony pals doing back in Equestria, as well as the same warmth and heart put into it as the television program. I say watch it BEFORE you judge it!<br /><br />PS: Also, (this is reference to that other reviewer) it wasn't a demon. It might have looked kind of like that, but it wasn't. It was simply the corruptness of disharmony that cause the transformation.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I like the book but was a little annoyed when I learned they added two more books when this was supposed to be a trilogy. I hate the letter/explanation the author gave. Dear reader Eva and Gideion aren't done yet the author. And it doesn't say when the next book is coming out Lame
B0090EHVMC|5.0|The Lorax  was a fun and entertaining movie that our whole family enjoyed. Downloaded it for a camping trip and my 6 and 7 year old wanted to watch it twice!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What I liked about this was that it's not too much like temple run but it's<br />Just enough to be a great game
B009GEFXLC|5.0|In my opinion the best season so far.  Nathan and Stana have some of the best chemistry of any tv couple in recent years. I am hoping for many more seasons of Castle.
B0092SQ5EG|4.0|Fun to see behind the scenes that rock star life isn't all glamour and glitz. She is a hardworking and talented gal. Enjoyable movie.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|My son loves movies with animals, so this was a no-brainer. Good story and fun to watch with my son.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|My family loves the Avengers/Marvel movies and this is a great addition. My family would watch this again and again.
B0026Q8EWW|5.0|Great movie--just saw it for first time couple weeks ago and couldn't hit pause.  Would have never thought DaVito and Damon could put together such a great act. Just goes to prove, it doesn't have to be action packed to be good!!
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|Entertaining read, easy to empathise and go on the journey with Jaycee. A terrible waste of early life but also inspiring.
B0002OXVDW|5.0|This was a birthday gift for a former Las Vegas dancer who has a great jazz voice. She is very happy with the entire set.  Good price and fast delivery.
1476733953|4.0|I have rarely been swayed by the hype behind a book, but I must admit, I picked up Wool purely based on its hype.  First and foremost, while nothing can really live up to its own hype, this book comes pretty close.  The dystopian genre has been done to death, and I thought nothing new could really add anything of value to what has been told by the classics: Brave New World, We, Fahrenheit 451 ect. I'm glad to say that on a purely conceptual basis, Wool deserves to be up there with anything put forth by Bradbury, Huxley and Zamyatin. For some reason, what I found so randomly enticing was how this world reminded me of one of my favorite movies: 12 Monkeys. Almost as if it were a continuation of that story where instead of following a time-jumping Bruce Willis, we would actually get a view the future after a virus wiped out the humans from the surface of the world...<br /><br />The world of the Silo is immensely clever, everything from the structural design, the departmentalization, the flow, or rather the censorship of information, even the population control has been worked out to seamlessly support the world-view that Howey constructs.  What makes it even better, this world is described in a crisp, straightforward writing style that allows the reader to visualize the gritty reality of the Silo while at the same time relate to the characters, which despite living constantly underground, share the basic human values with which everyone can identify.  The first three parts of Wool are astoundingly good, so good that I expected a letdown, and indeed I got it.  The part titled the Unraveling really starts to do just that, the story no longer takes an exploratory view of events, but becomes focused on character development, which sorry to say is not Howey's strong point. The less we known of the characters the better they fit in the story, probably because what is not told by the author, we fill in the gaps ourselves and thus add to the sense of mystery about certain people, such as Bernard and Lukas. However as the story progresses there is no saving grace for Juliette, who was so interesting and mysterious in the first few parts of the book, only to become an autistic/anti-social/OCD action-heroine who is just so chockfull of mechanical wisdom which somehow applies to the world at large.  Details upon details focusing on Juliette's actions needlessly stretch the last two parts of this book to a point where my overall interest waned, and a few times, I just had to put the book down. For example, the asphyxiation theme was overdone: after all how much breathing air is inside a cleaning suit? or how can one breathe the air trapped in grease bubbles for over 12 levels?  The conclusion to this story did not do justice to the realistic theme that permeated most of the book. To me it felt like the ending was made for Hollywood, thus only 4 stars.le, such as Bernard and Lukas.

B00DJFIMW6|4.0|have a hard time playing game on phone because screen is small and you have swipe ur finger. but it. works better on my fire.  I wish it was tilt screen like temple run though
0142419303|5.0|It's done very well and the illustrations from Quentin Blake are lovely.<br /><br />Remember though that because it's a pop up book it's not going to contain the entire story. Square Candies that Look Round for example is missing.<br /><br />Our daughter, an avid Charlie Chocolate Factory fan noted paragraphs and chapters were missing. She was ok after I explained it but just wanted to let others know if their children are particular like mine.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Puny god! Haha. I love the Hulk in this movie. A must see for all superhero fans. Go watch it now. You'll thank me later.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love it so much I wish I could play it all day every day<br />it is so so awesome
B008EQIEWS|5.0|It was a great movie. A perfect ending to an ages old story. The CGI effects were flawless and in the same line as the Lord of the Ring series. I would definitely suggest this film to anyone who enjoys both Greek mythology and a great adventure.
0679805273|5.0|What's not to love about Dr. Seuss?  A classic story that your kids will love as much as you!  Great graduation gift!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Amazing no problems works all the time. Almost no adds. I suggest this game to almost anyone. Very cool and the graphics great
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is amazing even if my kindle fire is off it continues to run and make money. It's free and the full game. But be careful what you or your child taps because it's easy for you to accidentally buy a currency exchange and all. Besides that I greatly appreciate and recommend this game!!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits will have you hooked from the first episode.  Each episode has its own twists, but they also build a broader story throughout the entire show.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book by Gillian Flynn!  True page turner as the reader is on pins and needles waiting for the next twist!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Keys are large &amp; easy to use. Does just what you would expect from a calculator.  You can't beat the price.  I would definitely recommend it.

0307387178|5.0|great quality
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I think it's good because I can watch things that are on tv on my kindle. I can also watch web series too. Best weather app ever.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|no clue since it does not load. had to force close several times over. boo hiss boo boo hiss hiss
B008AIGWVA|4.0|Well he talks. Once I reviewed talking Garfield free, is was terrible, that review is my most helpful yet. This review is the exact opposite of talking Garfield. It is excellent. The review of talking Garfield is called &ldquo;why freeze?&ldquo; But still get talking ben.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I know some didn't like this book as well as the rest and it was slow in some places. That I said I truly liked this one just as much as the others. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys reading! I don't typically care for books set in the early 1900's but this one has had me from the beginning. If you've read the others buy this book!! If you haven't read the others start at the beginning this is NOT a book to read on its own. You won't be sorry!!
B005ZUR724|5.0|Order and Chaos Online is a very good game but kinda glitchy it's a great mmorpg. Amazon plz update this game so people that play using Kindle Fire will actually get to play :)<br /><br />EDIT: the game is great it's a good mmorpg something different to try out but the thing is I noticed lots of hacking no synching anymore but some quests get glitched and dun work at all they have no support page tho all in all very good I love it<br />5 STARS
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I loved the show because there is a different dynamic going on between Sherlock and Watson since Watson is a &#34;she&#34;. I also really liked Sherlock's personality in it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|It very laggy and poor at loading to complicated i don't recommend it. It freezes my device every time i try to open it and i have to restart my device. SUCKS!!!!!!!!
B0055PMJMW|3.0|A real page-turner.  Harry Bosch is very credible; human, vulnerable...yet very tenacious.  The LAPD is depicted in all it's glory.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Awesome and super Great brain teaser, but not enough levels when your hooked. The multi-room levels are the bomb diggity:-)
B000IZ4R1U|2.0|An 'old' movie (ca. 2001): explosions, shooting, wobbling prosthetics (you'll see what I mean if you watch it).<br />I would have loved this when I was 12 or 13.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Admittedly, I started with the TV show first, and have come to the books later. If you are in the same situation, I highly recommend reading the books which will add to your enjoyment of this complex and engaging story. This Kindle version is helpful as you can keep track of the many characters by using the x-ray feature. Also, for those intimidated by the bulk of the print books' trim, the Kindle version is lessintimidating. :)
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|This is a really fun movie -- well worth watching. Not perfects, but really pretty fun! You should watch it.
B008220DGE|5.0|He is Jack Kerouac, he is the younger brother in Mice and Men.  He is at once Us in our most urgent and disconsolate moment, our worst in the drunken and disembodied moment, and our most ardently self sufficient and American free spirit.  Freddie Quell is the post war search for the self,  the sensate, lost, and irreducible man of the flesh.  And in this story, he is diametrically opposed to the Master, the genius, the hope and glory and promulgation of culture and Greco-Roman philosophical fulfillment, a pinnacle of humanity, and ultimately, a fraud.<br /><br />For the rest of my review, and my blog, see: [...]
B00BYISQTO|4.0|Never heard of this great band until Alt Nation on Sirius played 'Don't Swallow the Cap' - I've been hooked ever since. Vocals are seductive and lyrics beautiful. Other favorites on this cd are 'Graceless' and 'I Need my Girl' - hauting!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|My son introduced me to this game, now I find myself playing it whenever I have a free moment.  Very enjoyable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun awesome cool and really amazing and way fun to play and i promes you will be satisfide i would  like  to play it everyday
B00633W614|5.0|To truly appreciate what transpires in this volume of the trilogy one must read its predecessor , Only Time Will Tell.  Harry and Giles continue through life on their separate paths only to find themselves at varying crossroads filled with joy and disaster. Once again, I found it a page turner and couldn't wait until I could find time in the day to follow their various and winding exploits.  All of the supporting characters once again played a significant role while changing and growing in their own ways.  Mr. Archer once again showed his genius as a master weaver of history and the human condition of his fictional cast.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great book that can take you back to your adolescense when everything felt odd and out of place. The way the story is told makes it really easy to read and relate with the main character. I really loved it and will keep it on my list of recommendations.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I Mix sounds to create a rainy night. Rain on roof and thunder. Set timer and I am off to slumber land. This app I use every day! Love it!.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I usually don&#34;t read these types of stories but my sister suggested this book. The story caught my interest and it is a good read even if the story is peculiar!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|This app seems great, but would be even better if it would load. People are probably gonna dis for saying this, but I would not recommend it. One of the permissions is letting gameloft control and delete all your internal storage. All your music,books,and apps like facebook and other personal stuff are just a click away for them to see. 2 clicks away to delete. I seen my cousin play it on his tablet and it looked really cool, just not for kindle fire.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Usually a book this long has unnecessary material to fill space; not Wool Omnibus Edition. My interest was held through the well thought out, interesting saga. The characters became my friends to grieve or to celebrate. This is a great read.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This is one of the most accurate courtroom drama shows in a field of shows that frequently distort the law and behavior of the players in the legal system for &#34;drama.&#34;
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|I've always been a huge fan of Boz Scaggs this CD is amazing. I'm looking forward to his next CD.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|this game is fun but when you fight vector it lags out .but you should get. it is really fun so make sure you get it today .(:
0446581356|5.0|This book has been very helpful as I explore the world of make up. I love all the helpful tips!
B00CW6DAKC|1.0|I would have loved to play the game, but it would not open. I would go to open it and it would go back to screen I was on.
B005NF2UE6|4.0|The boys really let loose on metal.  They moved from Alternative to almost metal on this one and it works.  Not my ultimate favorite..but yeah, I had to have it in my collection.
B004EPZ00C|4.0|this movie gets funnier the further you get into it-the end will have you gut laughing! great family movie too
B00006JSS8|5.0|This is a must have on your mp3.  Includes some tunes from his childhood that are interesting.  Absolutely the best of his best all packed into this cd.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|This tale of struggling on through hardships (very exciting, fast-paced and suspenseful hardships) and sticking true to your friends and your noble cause is inspiring. The characters are so real and loveable that you can't help but cheer along as they take on the forces of evil and succeed against all odds! This is a truly epic tale, and it doesn't hurt that it's set in the stunning scenery of NZ, either.
B006R1T40I|5.0|I think this is some of her best work. Great collaborative pieces with BLUES Rock on the first track that is so good you want to hit repeat over and over!  Thoughtful lyrics-breakup songs from her own relationship woes really come through.  And of course the guitar licks you would expect from Ms. Raitt totally hit the mark.  Because of this output, I'm going to see her again as soon as she circles back to Phoenix.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This live tv didn't have any channels i would watch. It Was terrible! Nothing I'm going to watch! Deleted from my kindle
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|It did start off slow as others stated.  My Husband and I even took a break to come back to it the next day - we were falling asleep.  We came back to it to finish it and so happy that we did!  It was awesome!  We went from going on a long drawn out buggy ride beginning to a bullet train ending.  I won't give it away, but another reviewer did add (and we agree), you need the slow beginning to lay the foundation for the story.  Pay attention to the details, the facial expressions of the main female character and others.  It will all make sense and be worth it at the end.
030789701X|5.0|Is it was a very in-depth strategy guide. Yes I would recommend it to somebody and I got it for a very good price
0812416317|5.0|It must be 30 plus years ago I saw the movie and although memories fade those still within me were brought back vividly to life when I finally 'found time' to read John Steinbeck's beautiful book and comprehended there IS probably a Mouse in every man that wishes to remain unchanged and free to roam as nature intended.us to be.
B0091REZMW|4.0|fun so far.  it is  like highlights for adults .  I have just started. but it seems fun! cant wait do play more.
0670023329|5.0|Shin Dong-huyh's Escape from Camp 14 is without a doubt the most painful - incredible heart wrenching book I have ever read in my life and I urge that IF YOU HAVE A SOUL to purchase and read it at the earliest opportunity and appreciate how fortunate neither you or I live in North Korea.
B005QYKD4I|5.0|I love transformers for the visuail effects and for the story. I grew up watching this so i enjoyed it very much.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Excellent plotline and just the right amount of legal procedure and jargon for those who appreciate courtroom and personal drama combined.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|App is great on my HTC Rezound. Never skips on the sounds and has a wide variety to choose from.
B007B17XW4|5.0|Grandson loved it - put it together in a couple of hours - family enjoyed watching it demonstrated - lego did it again
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This app does just what it claims. The UI is a little gimmicky, but the sounds are quite good, and I like bring able to control volume on the sounds individually. The concentration sound seems to really work, believe it or not.
B00005YW4H|5.0|Listening to Norah Jones is like going from a gloomy, cloudy day to beautiful sunshine.  Her voice is smoothe and convincing.  Love the whole CD!
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is really cute but addictive. I totally lost track of time while playing. My six year old son will enjoy this if I ever stop playing long enough to let him try it!
0517053616|3.0|I love this collection.  It was just what I wanted; a beautiful, unabridged, collection of Shakespeare's works to use in my library.  There was a problem though, when I arrived home in a rainstorm the box was sitting on my front doorstep soaking wet.  I hurriedly unwrapped the book and dried the wet pages.  In the end the book was not damaged.  The seller was not Amazon but a company working through amazon.  If the book had only been wrapped in a plastic bag it might have been protected.  Better quality control would have been nice.
1781162646|3.0|On the heels of a breakup, college student Devin Jones takes a summer job at an amusement park, an amusement park haunted by the ghost of a woman murdered on one of the rides. But what does that have to do with a woman and her dying child that Devin meets walking on a beach?<br /><br />Stephen King throws the Hard Case line another bone with Joyland. Much like The Colorado Kid, it will undoubtedly draw much needed attention to the line despite not being like the other books.<br /><br />Joyland is the story of Devin Jones trying to get his shit together after being dumped by his girlfriend. What better way to do that than to slave away at a carnival for 12 hours a day? Once Devin learns of the murder, he starts investigating. Well, the investigation is incidental. Mostly he works at the carnival, saving a couple lives along the way and meeting a kid with muscular dystrophy that he takes a liking to, as well as his foxy young mother.<br /><br />Stephen King's writing is firing on all cylinders in this one and it's a relief that he wrote a story that's less than 800 pages for once. There are some anachronisms but they didn't yank me out of the story. I thought I knew who the killer was but King managed to pull the rug out from under me just before the big reveal.<br /><br />I liked Devin a lot. He felt like an authentic 21 year old to me, something that a lot of writers can't seem to do. He was also pretty relatable. I think I had an early onset of the 21's and it lasted until I was about 24.<br /><br />A quick side note: I like that King named a traveling circus after Manly Wade Wellman. I wonder how many people caught that reference.<br /><br />The only gripe I have with this book is that it doesn't feel like a Hard Case. However, since it will let Hard Case keep the lights on for quite a while with the money it brings in, I'll let Uncle Steve off with a warning this time. Three stars.
B000002LAC|5.0|The album \\" Trio\\" is a delight to hear. It is so well done by the best if the best.  I highly recommend this album as an easy listening pure country, bluegrass collection.
0062280228|4.0|While in his home town for a funeral, a middle aged man drives to the site of his parents' former home and visits visits the farm at the end of the road, where he remembers some curious events from when he was seven...<br /><br />First off, I'll get the gripes out of the way. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is marketed as Gaiman's first adult novel since Anansi Boys. It feels a lot more like a young adult novel, more akin to the Graveyard Book or Coraline than American Gods. Secondly, it's only 175 pages long. In and of itself, that's fine, but with a whopping 25.99 price tag, it's kind of a gouge.<br /><br />Gripes aside, The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a pretty cool book. Gaiman does a masterful job at portraying the nameless lead character, a seven year old boy who befriends at odd eleven-year old girl named Lettie, who may or may not be as old as the universe, and her mother and grand mother. Maiden, mother, and crone remember the Old Country, which sank, or the really Old Country, which blew up.<br /><br />The Ocean at the End of the Lane, like a lot of Neil Gaimain work, deals with dreams, the effect of belief on reality, and forgotten things, like things that every kid knows and every adult has forgotten.<br /><br />There's not a lot I can say without giving away the best bits. Gaiman has a way of making his young adult books way scarier than his adult ones and this one falls into that category. Urusula and the hunger birds were both pretty creepy, as was what happened with the boy's foot.<br /><br />That's about all I can say. The Ocean at the End of the Lane is a really quick read but full of interesting ideas and great moments. Four out of five. I may elevate it to a five on a reread.
0679805273|5.0|Oh, the Places you'll Go is a wonderful graduation gift for all ages.  I've given one to each niece and nephew over the years.  They all treasure the book.
B000QELMF2|5.0|I originally got this to make a fairy garden at the beginning of summer- fits right into what I had in mind.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Dr. Alexander gives a great account of his near death experience from the personal and medical points of view. He is very thorough, never boring and keeps the pace going.  You want to get to the end to get to the 'twist'. He provides medical and personal arguments for the existence of near death experiences.  I'll be reading the book again and lending to friends.
B0090SI4LU|4.0|I dragged my feet for a long time to watch this movie, despite or because of the fact I have loved and reread the book twice in the past. It's such a refreshing story to me, it has romance but also such and interesting world and take on an alien invasion where well...the aliens are peaceful and live almost the ideal human utopia. I wish the movie had expounded a bit more on the race of Souls ~ I loved Wanderer's job in the new world being a teacher and her knowledge and experiences in all the other world's she had lived. Her time in the cave and relationships she developed with everyone were also just a glimpse of what the books had.<br /><br />A lot of things were glossed over and condensed, losing much of richness and character development as well as some of the emotion. I would most likely give it a 3.5 but at the same time, I enjoyed it. A short movie of course will be condensed from such a large book and I really liked what they did with the setting and environment. It definitely brought the book back to life for me and it gives me a chance to share it with others who would probably never read the book. I liked most of the actors, especially Jeb and her brother, Jamie. Melanie/Wanda was good though sometimes came across younger than I felt she should have. Some of the romance felt rushed or cheesy but I expected that. I also expected Melanie's inner dialogue. Wanda never actually spoke to Melanie out loud in the books but then, in a movie that would be confusing at who's thoughts were speaking so I can't complain too much about it.<br /><br />I think the movie captured the main feelings of the story. It has a slow pacing too it ~ this is not your action sci-fi movie but more a character drama and some romance in a very unusual survival futuristic setting. I would recommend watching it, but will never replace the book.
0061978078|5.0|I was not impressed by the first book in this series in the least. I almost regretted taking the time to read it. The only reason I read the sequel was because I got it as a gift.<br /><br />But BOY am I glad I did read it!!!  This book is incredible in all the ways I was expecting from the first. It's packed with REAL action (not just Lena being all scared sitting in a corner like the last book). It was hard for me to put this book down to sleep at night.<br /><br />The book goes back and forth between her initial escape into the Wilds, and her future life, where she lives in New York City. It was a really different take on storytelling, without being super-cliche like most other books that try something like it. The two stories blend beautifully together, side-by-side.<br /><br />Lena has become a much more real character, more developed and relatable. Granted, she's still super-weird about Alex, which *still* makes me roll my eyes. But I can understand her grief and other complicated emotions. One other annoying thing she does is constantly point out the differences of the \\"old Lena\\" and the \\"new Lena.\\" It was okay at first, but it got old fast, the more she repeated it. (There are definitely stark differences between the two, so I'm not sure why the author found it necessary to constantly bring it up.)<br /><br />A few parts of the storyline are rather predictable. But it wasn't nearly as bad as the first book. The predictability of some of the situations is balanced by the raw feeling of just not knowing what was going to happen next. You could predict up to a point... And then just run out of ideas. It was exciting and brilliant in a way the first book wasn't.<br /><br />(Also, let me clarify that yes, she is saying that Bram and Hunter are gay. She never actually comes out and explains it.)<br /><br />One major flaw: except for Lena and Jullian, you never see any real character development or even descriptions of the other Homesteaders. There's a little bit of detail that goes into it, but then it's almost as if the author expects you to fill in the blanks on your own. It means less time wasted in pointless descriptions, but it also means we are much less connected to these characters than we should be.<br /><br />All in all, I was greatly impressed by this story. It had me at the edge of my seat the whole time, after I started off think I wouldn't finish it. If you, like me, read the first book and were not at all impressed, please give this one a chance! It will definitely be worth your time, I promise.f detail that goes into it, but then it's almost as if the author expects you to fill in the blanks on your own.

B00D6BQPMM|4.0|I read the book, which I thought was excellent, and they did a good job representing it.  I like the bits of comedy laced throughout.  Overall, a good story and a well done movie.  Who doesn't love a good zombie movie?!
B003UYUQZW|5.0|The stunts in this movie remind me of Douglas Fairbanks Jr.  Story moves along and you have a genuine hero to root for, not just the lesser of two questionable people.  Lessons about loyalty and honor without being preachy.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|this is one if I could just play for fun all day. it would be on this game.  enjoy it.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|They took elements from several of the John Carter of Mars series and put together this movie.  ERB purists may have a problem with that, but overall, they kept the spirit of the books.  Moves along.  I loved the flying machines and other special effects.<br />Favorite lines:<br />  Carter: I thought you said 'leave a Thark his head and one hand and he may yet conquer.&#34;<br />  Tars Tarkas:  You annoy me.

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I have been reluctant to buy any Mahjong games because I am not thrilled with the timer.  However, even though this is timed, it doesn't stop at a certain point.  You finish the game and the timer lets you know how long it took you to complete it.  I can live with that.  My score is not great, but I am playing for fun and that is what this game provides for me.  There are numerous formats to select from - pyramid, two towers, cat, smile, butterfly, spider, fortress, turtle, etc. - and different backgrounds which makes the game interesting.  I think it will be awhile before I get tired of playing it and thank the developers for a wonderful job.
159463176X|3.0|Hosseini said that he started writing the story of a man pulling a girl in a cart, with a boy following them (it's now Chapter 2), adding:<br /><br />\\"I started to become aware of other voices, other characters demanding for their stories to be told. So I kept pursuing these different characters because they were all connected to that first story--I followed the ripples in that first story. I like to think of it as voices gradually building into a choir until they become like one voice.\\"<br /><br />This choir-like effect, Hosseini hoped, would unify the book as a whole, creating:<br /><br />\\"one sweeping story, that when you add all the parts together, you get one story.\\"<br /><br />Although Hosseini writes very intensely, in a prose which often assumes the cadence of verse, I do not think he has succeeded in what he set out to do. His choir is just too big! There's too many stories, too many characters, and no unifying vision or plot or overriding aim to pull them all together.<br /><br />If you loved his earlier novels you may want to try this one too, but I think you may end up disappointed, as I was.<br /><br />I hate to give only three stars to a talented writer, who writes about important subjects and can teach us things about them, but I felt the reading experience I got out of this book didn't warrant any more.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Not a bad game.  Simply shoot monkey to collect bananas and gems.  Good time waster.  Graphics and sound are good, so far no in app purchase and no facebook garbage.  Too many apps these days force facebook on you, so this is refreshing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! The really cool part is that it changes country's, witch that right there gives it more detail. That's what I love an this game. And that's why I gave it ALL five stars!:)
B001DM1VXE|1.0|The &#34;black and white&#34; approach is good but too much relying on the main character to give you the sense that his mind is unraveling. This is done with an assumption that you would understand his facial and erratic behavior. I did not finish the movie as I had more important things to do.

1401233791|3.0|Its a big book and you get it at a discount.  The artwork is really not all that good (sorry if you're a fan of the artists), but having *spoiler* the three stooges in there just kills it for me.  Very juvenile.  I mean when Jim Lee draws himself in the crowd in Hush that's one thing, but the stooges?  C'mon.<br /><br />They also reference Bane taking out Killer Croc, and I read this from the start to where they talk about that, and its not in there.  Haven't finished it yet, but wondering if Bat-Man gets his back broke in this volume as the cover shows.<br /><br />Some cool stories already, and if the artwork had been better, minus the Stooges I'd have given in a 4.<br /><br />Paper quality isn't all that great, but have to expect that due to the cost.  Color could be better as well.  Better than the pulp paper used for Great Stories Ever Told about the Joker.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|Completely stereotypical characters. Could guess the plot almost immediately. Even if I was wrong, couldn't stand to watch more than a few minutes of the initial busy, noisy scene. Perhaps some would like it, but it's just not my kind of film.
1451683405|3.0|Sam Harris has written an interesting and important book providing a strong argument that free will is an illusion. Harris almost defines free will out of existence by insisting there is no freedom in any choice unless the chooser is conscious of all influences determining it--an impossible task in practice since humans are \\"neuronal weather patterns\\" in his words. This is in essence a vast expansion and refinement of the classical notion of conditioned reflex. Harris insists all choices are determined by the unconscious from the gigantic congeries of neuronal patterns in the history of the mind, but one might ask how well established this determinism can be if we are unable to map out the precise sequence of those previous mental events in even one particular case?<br /><br />The criticism I would make is not that Harris's argument is wrong, but that he does not adequately describe the situation--with the result that his emphasis is misplaced. The human mind is constructed to learn, and far from being an absolutely rigid automaton, it responds to the most delicate alterations in its environment. It is the exquisite sensitivity of the mind to the smallest external stimuli that provides the illusion of free will, if indeed it is an illusion.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|Very funny movie with a very talented cast. I loved everything about this movie including the creative opening and ending credits.<br />A very funny take on John Hughes films and the Scarlet Letter (which pokes fun at the Demi Moore-Gary Oldman version) that also covers peer pressure, bullying and teenage angst with sarcasm and wit. Patricia Clarkson and Stanley Tucci have some of the funniest lines in my opinion and this shows Amanda Bynes (her final film re IMDB) as a stereotypical religious fanatic. And for Twilight/Burlesque fans Cam Gigandet! Add Lisa Kudrow, Thomas Hayden Church and Malcolm McDowell (isn't he in everything?) and the up and coming young cast with clever writing and this is a very entertaining movie. Didn't everyone dream of doing a fantastically choreographed musical number in front of the whole school?

B0089OBLDO|5.0|I bought this as a means to use my PS3's Dualshock 3 controller on my Xbox 360.  I have small hands and I find the 360 controller too cumbersome sometimes.  I also like how the Dualshocks R1 and L1 buttons are similar to mouse buttons, making it easy for me to burst fire in FPS games.  However after trying it out, I found that in certain 360 games, the trigger configuration cannot be swapped; i.e. RT to RB, or in the Dualshock's case, R1 to R2. Which means I can't use R1 as a trigger when playing on the 360. Oh well.<br />However, the adapter functions well. So far, I'm not suffering any input lag at all. Great product, I would recommend getting this. Just be warned that depending on the game, the triggers cannot be swapped.<br />The turbo functions well, good for a few laughs in multiplayer. However Sixaxis functions will not work (Duh) when using a 360 controller on ps3.

B008220D7S|1.0|I completely wasted my money on this Blu-Ray. As someone who just turned 40 with young kids, I was hoping for some laughs and material I could relate with. I saw none of that. I can probably count maybe laughing about 2 times through the whole movie. Every single 'plot' from the Dads to the music business to girl stealing at the store was boring and pretty much pointless. Don't even bother; it's 2 hours of your life you won't get back.
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|What an impressive movie to watch in 3D.  In fact, I can't watch & enjoy this movie the same way with out the 3D effects.  You can buy the blu-ray copy from disney rewards for 5 bucks if you really want it. If you have a Smart TV or device, you can put the digital copy on Amazon, Itunes or media player.  There's really no need to buy the extra disc, it's just a keep sakes.  Great movie & definitely goes along with the original.
B00A9V2JSG|3.0|Wow, what can I say about Delirium? It can be a wild ride at times then boring a few pages later. I was hesitant to read this book, and after completing it I understand my reservations. But I went into it with high expectations since it tends to receive good reviews. It will be very difficult to write a review without spoilers but I will do just that. I refuse to ruin someone's reading experience with spoilers.<br /><br />Delirium is written in first person from Lena Haloway Tiddle's point of view, in present tense which gives it a sense of urgency. It's easy for the reader to sympathize with Lena and the heart breaking events she's endured in her lifetime. She is just a summer away from 'the procedure', a form of brain surgery that takes away our baser emotions, including desire and love. Lena is looking forward to this surgery, has been since she was a young child. She wants to forget the pain of her mother's suicide and the shame it brought the family. Everyone receives the procedure when they turn eighteen, it's what keeps society working, or so they're all told. It's a society that makes me nauseated just thinking about it. Downright scary to have a lobotomy at eighteen to make a docile, numb society.<br /><br />We follow Lena through her last summer before her treatment, watching as she becomes aware that maybe things aren't as perfect as she's been spoon fed her whole life. On an escapade of rebellion, she falls in love with Alex. Lena's world turns upside down when she is unable to reconcile her feelings for Alex with the fundamental principles that guide her society.<br /><br />There were times when I was mired in endless descriptions, slogging through until I was forced to skim or stop reading. Though I have to admit, I'm not overly fond of paragraph after paragraph of description. I prefer things leaner, more dialogue and less setting. Several times I considered stopping for good, but the characters kept drawing me back. The pacing just kept losing me. I read this book over the course of two days, and I will admit I couldn't stop thinking about it last night when I stopped and went to bed. The society and the characters circled in my mind like vultures, ripping away at my sanity.<br /><br />This book made me laugh and cry, but ultimately left me unsatisfied. The book ends with a bang, in fact I was shocked it was actually over. I wasn't left with that feel-good glow I get after finishing an enjoyable book. While it did pull on some intense emotions, I was left feeling flat. That said, I have a feeling the plot and characters will haunt me for a few days. My eyes are watering and my throat is burning right now thinking about it. Is that what makes a novel good? This pulling on our emotions, the inability to let go once the book is finished? Perhaps. Am I happy I read it? No. I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />I would only recommend this book to those who enjoy a darker read, one that pulls on our emotions and leaves us raw. Go into this one with your eyes open. Ultimately it'll make you cherish the freedom we have. Live free or die indeed.<br /><br />You can also find this review at [...]read this book over the course of two days, and I will admit I couldn't stop thinking about it last night when I stopped and went to bed.

It definitely made me cry, but was so inspiring and funny along the way that I was able to easily wipe away my tears and laugh with the characters.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Super Great game but where does it say the cost of the buildings when you are given them as a reward?

B00005JKHP|1.0|I grew up watching the Star Trek Original Series or just Star Trek as it was called in the 70's.  I saw all the movies in the theater and watched all of the Star Trek franchise shows on broadcast television.  I own all of DS9, Enterprise, and Voyager on video.  I own Wrath of Khan and The Journey Home.  The movie that started it all is beyone boring and confusing.  I cannot beleive that the franchise ever got off the ground with this as the first movie.  My family and I all fell asleep during the movie and I personnaly felt ripped off that I bought the DVD.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie to anyone Star Trek fan or not.  I would tell them to watch The Wrath of Khan first.

B0090SI4LU|4.0|I read the book before watching this movie, but let me tell you that the only reason I read the book was because I was intrigued by the movie trailer. As always, the book was better, however, I did enjoy the movie.<br /><br />I'm not sure what you'd think of the movie if you've never read the book; I could understand the reviews that say it's a slow movie, but reading the book made me appreciate what they were trying to accomplish. In fact, in my opinion they really had to \\"fast-forward\\" a lot of parts and developments in the movie that the author really expanded on in the book.<br /><br />So, overall, I enjoyed the movie, but I recommend reading the book first.

While there was wear and tear to the box they came in and some slight wear and tear to the books, nothing major-- just shows how well loved these books were. Recommend!
B0045HCIZY|4.0|I had viewed this film nine years ago when it came out and enjoyed the ongoing saga so it was good to view it a 2nd time before viewing Before Midnight.
0316228532|4.0|This wasn't a terrible book, but it was hard for me to read at times and to get through. Obviously, I'm a huge Rowling fan, and I always zoomed through her other novels. This one however, took a bit of time. Overall, I enjoyed this novel. If you are looking for something like her Harry Potter series, this book is not like it at all- it is much different.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|A fun game for all ages. You just can't stop playing. I would recommend this to anyone. I hope to see more versions and levels one day.
B0050X1OQ6|5.0|I bought this RAM stick back in May and immediately installed it into my [[ASIN:B007JLE84C Synology DiskStation 4-Bay (Diskless) Network Attached Storage DS412+ (Black)]]. I didn't perform any benchmarks before upgrading but my NAS now feels more responsive overall.  It's running on four [[ASIN:B008JJLW4M WD Red 3 TB NAS Hard Drive: 3.5 Inch, SATA III, 64 MB Cache - WD30EFRX]] installed in a Hybrid-RAID configuration, running DSM 4.2.<br /><br />It's my opinion, that most of the apps currently put out for this model Synology NAS likely won't push the 1GB memory envelope. Although, if you install 3rd party apps (like I have) having the extra memory space to work with is comforting.<br />This Kingston memory has been rock solid performer with zero downtime since I installed it. If you aren't afraid of voiding your warranty on your Synology NAS, then I highly recommend getting this upgrade.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So much like subway surfers but way better because it's despicable me theme with vector and the traffics are amazing I I just can't explain why it's so good
B0053R1QXU|4.0|I have watched this movie before,  and find it to be a very interesting and thrilling movie. Since I find Alaska<br />an interesting place, this movie will give you a sense of being there,  and how untamed it really is there!
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I've bought this product to a friend has told me it is excellent and is happy and me too :)
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Whenever possible, I buy my 3D movies in sets that include a 2D Blu-ray, a standard DVD and either a digital or ultraviolet copy. I like the 2D Blu-ray for my guests who have trouble viewing 3D. I like the standard DVDs to loan to my adult children as neither owns a Blu-ray player. I couldn't care less about the digital or ultraviolet copies as I use neither. The 3D release of this movie only comes with a digital copy. I can still play it in 2D, should I choose to, but I have no standard copy to loan to my kids.<br />I buy my movies on the day of their release to get a discount price, but neither Target nor WalMart received any copies in 3D. The 2D versions appeared to be available in several different configurations, including one with a slightly 3D-looking slip cover but wasn't 3D.<br />As for the movie, I liked it. I thought the storyline was good and nicely explained the origin of Oz as he first appears in the original &#34;Wizard of Oz&#34;. Franco's acting came across as a bit stiff, but it's tough standing in a big green room and interacting with &#34;nothing&#34;.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I was skeptical about this book, the same way I'm often skeptical about books that are hyped. This book though...wow. Just wow. It's well written, the poetry is great, the characters are well developed, the story behind it is amazing - there just aren't enough good things I can say about this book. It brought me to tears. I let one of my younger friends read it and she fell in love with it too...and she's 14. It's just a great read. I would jump into it...NOW!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I love this CD...can't wait to see what this group brings next! They are a talented bunch of musicians and I have this one on replay.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I really enjoyed watching this movIe. It's a 5  star. Every part of it is captivating and the story line is powerful.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|I hate to say it but I really wanted to see Anna Kendricks in something light and funny and this is it. I';m surprised at her voice, I wasn't aware that she could sing. Overall, this was a great movie. Mothers, please be advised this movie is not for children. The language and sexual conversations are not appropriate for children under 13.
B00B8WXEXO|5.0|This band is the best band I have heard in 25 years. They rock. There is not a bad song on this album.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is so cute and keeps me entertained for many hours and keeps my mind young and active. Great to keep me occupied during my long commute.
B008CX2A2I|5.0|Got it , plugged it in and Bluetooth capabilities started to work immediately; this is the reason I bought it for.  No complaints, but praises for doing what it supposed to do.  Price was a bit high, but for what it does, I am happy.  You truly get what you pay for!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|With the second part of the series I expected something different - a new man, a protagonist who has grown more confident and a more mature writing style. Instead, it's more of the same. Similar scenes that repeat themselves, repetitive vocabulary (i.e. &#34;geeze,&#34; &#34;holy ****,&#34; &#34;come undone/fall apart&#34;...) and the same characters with the same problems as before. The only difference is the addition of some non-sexual plot twists which, I hate to say it, are quite junior. Mostly I had trouble connecting with the main character and her incessant insecurities and overreactions and the insistence that the setting is in the USA when the style of speech, vocabulary and formality are clearly British.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I always thought that this was only for androids so when I saw it in the Appstore.I instantly looked at the reviews and got it!!!!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I have heard people talking about this show so I decided to try it.  Great storyline, great acting, and I absolutely love the music.  It is about gangs so it is not for those easily offended.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I totally love this game. It is like totally awesome man. I am the best at this game. Nobody can touch me. If you think you got what it takes, then challenge me and, we will soon see if you have what it takes to beat me. I love this game, it is totally awesome. Call me a bird brain if you want.
B003I55BIA|5.0|If I could use one word to describe this book, the word would be inspiring. Perfect Chemistry was an emotional rollercoaster that had me hooked from the start. I laughed, I cried, and I even contemplated  throwing my kindle at the wall at one point. It was a truly inspiring and heart-wrenching love story that challenged convention and obliterated stereotypes.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is highly addictive, and is a lot like temple run, and subway surfers. You have to try this game
B004KPX4W2|2.0|love Helen but this dialogue and script are just not worthy of her talent.  Its just too &#34;same ol,  same ol&#34; scenes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's great I love it so much my horse loves apple's and carrots my bro always wants to play it
B001UTW7QU|5.0|What a fun ride. Talk about things that make you go hmmm.<br />I love the Doctor Bishop character. The built in humor shows that<br />the writers don't take themselves too seriously. Sit back and enjoy ,but you do have to pay attention.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|very habit forming and more difficult than the PC version.  Loads of fun.  Well worth the minimal cost when compared to other games.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great, great series. I really can't stand that Matthew will not be returning. He was such a huge part of the show for me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have been waiting what seems like forever for this book. And it was definitely worth it. All I can say is I even get excited to see Gideon's name written on the page. And you will be pleasantly surprised at the end. Wahoo! It is a must read. So just do it! Now!!!!!
B0090SI4LU|1.0|Let me start off by saying that I have read this book, multiple times, and it is one of my favorites. (I am also not a Stephenie Meyer's cultist. I read this book after completing the Twilight saga and could not believe it was the same author) This \\"movie\\" is one of the absolute WORST book to movie adaptions EVER. Book to movie adaptions are usually different, I get that, but this...this was horrendous. The second the photo was released of Melanie, Jared and Ian, I had a terrible feeling in my gut, and who would have guessed...it was right. This pile of garbage didn't follow the book, at all. There were very few things that they actually got right. The entire time I subjected myself to this garbage, I was pounding my head against the back of the couch. Not only that, the movie gives you next to no information that is vital to the story, I watched this with a friend who has yet to read the book, and it made no sense to her until about the very end, and even then I had to explain enough to her, so that it would actually make some sense. Never has the quote, \\"Don't judge a book by it's movie,\\" been more appropriate. Anyone who actually enjoyed this movie has obviously been brainwashed by Hollywood. If you've read the book, and enjoyed it, avoid this movie at all costs. Not only will it be two hours of your life gone that you cannot get back, but you're going to be pretty angry about it. Absolute garbage. Thanks for nothing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|I particularly enjoyed the fantastic transformations as I rotated a key, placed the required item at its<br />Designated location  &amp; the graphics were wonderful. I want more!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I enjoyed this book it was a little different to what I usually read. Would recommend as a romantic type read.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Interactive game with challenge and fun. Hints are very helpful any place you get most. I have played BFG for many years and still play games on my laptop. You will not be sorry if you decide to buy the full version.
B004T5R2HQ|3.0|I used this app frquently for snapping photos of whiteboards with my old phone and it worked great. I just switched to the Galaxy S4 and it doesnt work for me anymore.
B008JJM88Q|3.0|I love playing around with Akinator online. It's a great concept; no matter how many times he guesses the most obscure characters I can think of, I still continue to try to stump him.<br /><br />Anyway, my problem with this particular incarnation is that with my HTC Droid DNA, the text is not aligned properly within the word bubbles and it's difficult to read. It's still possible, just inconvenient and it takes away from the overall experience.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|It's been a rough year for me, my wife and I have been going through tough times. We fight in front of little Sandra, and we would take it back if we could. Even after countless hours of intense counseling we would return home and fight. That's when I found this game. Not only does my wife love this game, but it's brought intimacy back into our relationship. Sandra has even been happier than ever. Thank you, Scribblenauts Remix! You saved my family, and the game is really fun, I recommend it!
