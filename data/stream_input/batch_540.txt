B0009I7NNA|4.0|Some incredible musicianship from all the band members. I especially like the drumming, very clean and precise. The singer sounds like he's straining a bit from time to time, but thats most likely due to vocal cord surgery. Give it a listen, can't hurt at all, much better then alot of the crud on the radio nowadays, at least these guys have some skill.
B000AMWIVM|1.0|When the acting is so hideous that you want EVERYONE to die, it's really hard to find a movie appealing. If you really want a scare, watch Black Christmas. The writers should be ashamed of this trash.
B00097DXZS|1.0|This review isn't commenting on Santana's new music, but on the CD, specifically the copy protection. I won't be buying \\"All That I Am\\" as long as it is in copy protected form that prevents me from listening to a CD that I PURCHASE on any device that I want to listen to it. I looked at this disc in a store, and the list of copy protection compatibility restrictions reads like warnings for a prescription drug. Among other things, you can only rip the disc on a PC to WMA format with rights management using Windows Media Player, and apparently cannot rip it to MP3 format.    I have been a huge Santana fan since the very beginning. I have seen the group live twice, and I have owned at least 10 of the albums over the years. But, sorry Carlos, I won't be buying this one as long as it is in this restricted form.    I strongly urge anyone considering purchase of this disc to read the detailed article at [...] regarding malicious software this disc installs on your PC.
B00005R1N3|5.0|This is the scariest movie I've ever seen. Awesome. Nothing more needs to be said.
B00008G9JM|3.0|THIS IS A VERY NICE ALBUM WITH SOME GREAT PARTS TO IT.  I KNOCK IT DOWN A STAR FOR \\"THE STORY OF THE HARE WHO LOST HIS SPECTACLES\\".    This is Jethro Tull's sixth album.  It came right after Thick As A Brick.  It is right around 45 minutes long.      There have been many issues of this album on CD.  They have had varying sound quality.  None of them was poor, but some have very good sound quality.  The remastered version contains an enhanced feature: the video of the Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles that was originally on the 25th anniversary VHS tape.    Like Thick As A Brick, A Passion Play is one long piece (over 44 minutes long).  There are 16 parts to the work, but there are no gaps or any silence between parts.  On the original LP, there was a change in the density of the grooves so you could figure out where to drop the needle if you wanted to play a certain section.      Most versions of the CD have the two LP sides broken out as two tracks.  Although the version I have just has it as one long track.  The Gold version of the CD has each of the 16 parts indexed so you can jump to the different parts.  I prefer being able to access the tracks, especially to skip through The Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectactles.    ENOUGH OF THE LOGISTICS.  HOW IS THE MUSIC?    This is a totally different sound for Jethro Tull.  It is a little more jazz oriented, kind of hard rock jazz.  There is heavy emphasis on saxophones and synthesizers.  It sounded even better when they played it live.    There are some great passages of both songs and music.  These are interspersed with sections that are OK, but are there mainly to keep the story going.  I have just listened to some epic songs from Transatlantic (one of the new generation of progressive rock bands) and they don't come close to the quality of A Passion Play.    The only real downside is the Story of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles.  This is a stupid, pointless talking section that totally disrupts the flowof the music.  It is right in the middle of the best part of the album.      What's worse is that there is no easy way to skip through the Hare story, unless you have the gold version of the CD.  On my copy, with just one long track, you have to sit there with your finger on the fast forward button.  On most CD's it comes at the end of the first track and continues to the beginning of the second track.  If it were at the end of the first track, you could at least hit the skip button.    When I saw them on the War Child tour, they started into The Story Of the Hare Who Lost His Spectacles, and then said they were only kidding.  That got the biggest cheer of the night.
B000AYQJJ2|2.0|...but it just seems to me that $$$$ is the driving force behind baby boomer, but particularly Beatles, reissues.  This has never been released on video, to my knowledge, so it is an event.  And it's nice to get the bonus stuff.  But I think the pricetag is out of line, priced too high just because they know they can get it.   <br /> <br />It just seems a shameless ripoff (kinda like gas prices).  I mean, these guys all donated their time, played for no pay, to benefit a country in need.  This kind of greedy, self-serving pricing seems at horrible odds with the original intent of the concert itself.  People say this was the Live Aid template.  The Live Aid DVD came out last March, a 4 DVD set that is priced at half of what this set is.   <br /> <br />Something's terribly wrong here.
B000009EAD|5.0|i remember it well, i was siting at my computer listening to an online radio station on a certain internet search engine, when suddenly a powerful metal tune begins to play on the station. at first i thought perhaps it was metallica doing another cover or something. i looked and saw that it wasnt metallica, no my friends it was a better band with even more talent. yes iced earth...the music, the experience, they changed the way i listen to metal. the first track of this album is powerful and gives you but a taste of what is to come. strong vocals backed by even stronger guitar work make iced earth a band that all should listen to. they offer such wide range of style and professionalism with their music that you cant help but listen to every track and soak up all of their metal goodness. and of course, because it is iced earth, they give you the fans a great instrumental to enjoy and listen to over and over again. each beat and tune better than the first. these guys never fail to amamze me. so i say this now, if you havent bought your copy yet, then get off of your butt and get it. something wicked this way comes is the best and i give it a 10 out of 10...thank you and good night
0307276902|5.0|I loved this book! Frey is honest with himself and how many people do you know can do that? I think the book is of the truth, and that is what makes it so great. I have never been addicted to drugs or alcohol or any other things, and I am so thankful for that. It must be a hard thing to deal with, and really, you must hold on. The advice that I give my friends, is, it will hurt like hell, and you will believe that it will never end, but time will heal everything, clich as it is, it's true.
B00097DXZS|5.0|From the first track to the last \\"All That I Am\\" is a smoking CD. I have been playing this album over and over, and even had the people in my office tapping their feet and nodding their heads. My favorite track is track 8-\\"Twisted\\"- Featuring Anthony Hamliton, who provides such a soulful sound. Track 4  has Mary J. Blige and Big Boi from Outkast making a guess spot. What seems at first a strange duet between Sean Paul and Joss Stone on track 10, actually works very well. Another great surprise is Bo Bice on track 11, Bo Bice said that he was very glad that he did not win American Idol, because he felt he would have mnore control over his sound and type of music he wanted to put out, well if this track is a hint of things to come I would say he made the right choice. This review would be incomplete if I did not talk about Carlos Santana's great and flowing guitar work. As his past two duet cds he is always solid and fluid, powerful when he wants it to be and gentle when it has to be. Be sure to pick this CD up!!!!
B0000508U6|5.0|Sometimes, you can't avoid writing those clone-ish 5 star reviews you see endlessly on every page with such impressive music. Parachutes is an exception, and is a unique album. The music melodic, it is light and it takes time to get used to. But once you discover the magic of Coldplay, you will discover the meaning of poignant and effective music.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti made instant success after its release, and ultimately brought Led Zeppelin's career to its zenith point. <br /> <br />There are so many songs of so many styles; the first cd kicks off with some grungy rock with unbeatable riffs played by the master himself, Jimmy page, and is balanced off with disc 2's softer accoustic melodies. The melodies may be repetitive to some people, but are nonetheless very catchy. One of led Zeppelin's talents and reasons for success is their ability to mix different styles of music and provide variety into rock and roll. Physical Graffiti is the best the band can offer. Kicking off with the heavier Custard Pie on disc one, hitting middle eastern styled rock tunes with Kashmir, to the more melodically blissful and softer \\"Down by the Seaside\\", and ending with one more deep rock tune, Sick Again, Physical Graffiti displays Led Zeppelin's musical abilities with plenty of tracks to enjoy with. <br /> <br />Highly reccommended for all rock bands, a definet must buy for Zeppelin fans.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|While the Christmas music on this album is certainly representative of Diana Krall's considerable talent and masterful interpretations, I just can't get past the cover image.  <br /> <br />Come on, Diana: It's a CHRISTMAS album! What's with the legs spread, high heels, head thrown back? Hey, if this album was called, \\"Love After Midnight\\" or \\"Exotic Standards\\" or \\"I Just Did Four Guys and I'm Exhausted,\\" believe me, I'd be all over it. But it's a CHRISTMAS album. I've seen you perform, and the discrepency between your real personality and what's portrayed on your albums is pretty striking. I know you're not that full of yourself, and I know you're mostly about the music. Hey... give us a wink or a sexy smile here or there, but leave it at that. <br /> <br />I'm a huge Diana fan, and I'm well aware that most of her criticisms (even from her peers) come from those who believe a serious jazz talent can't have the combination of skills AND good looks. How wrong. To me, though, it seems like Diana's PR people are focusing on the latter. Worse, they're trying WAY too hard. It's hard to figure out how her music is complemented by these cheesy covers. <br /> <br />Please start over. Go back to classic, understated and refined--the sexy diva aspects of Diana Krall will come naturally.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Well, I've had a listen, and its all the same stuff, all over again. <br />Does he not do anything new? Does he not have enough in him to be self supporting? Does he have to rely on bringing other poeple in?  <br />We've done this, been there, ready to move on!!! So move on!!! Give me something new to listen to Mr Santana. Please. <br />The CD? Not that good. Expand your horizons. Change your guitar sound. Bring in fresh sound, not this old rehashed stuff with just new voices.
B000AL730O|5.0|I don't know if its yet the right time to place a review on that item. Like \\"Eyes wide shut\\" its going to take some time for people to understand what they came upon. Paul is just Paul. He can't help it being one of the best musicians around. All these years, after the Beatles split up, some people are just trying to convince themselves (and the world) that there's still good music to be made. And there is. But the best they can do is write a couple (up to ten - at the most) songs to be remembered. Paul is every musician's either dream or nightmare. He is as good as the best of them (and maybe better). If you don't feel like buying or listening to the record don't. Its not for you. But it may so happen that ten years from now you'll be \\"discovering\\" it.
B00070DK1E|4.0|This is the most controversial album Jethro Tull has ever put out before or since and it's all due the the Grammy commitee.  1988's winner of the \\"Best Hard Rock or Heavy Metal\\" Grammy is neither.  However it is an exellent album.   <br />One of it's main strengths is the guitar work of Martin Barre.  My favorite is his solo on \\"Budapest\\" because he demonstrates that one doesn't have to crank the amps up to 11 to have a kick bottom guitar solo.  Ian Anderson says that \\"Budapest\\" is the song that he is most proud of, as it has a little bit of everything in it.   <br />This album also has the song \\"Farm on the Freeway\\" which is today a concert favorite amongst the fans.   <br />What's unfortunate about this album is Ian's voice is merely a shadow of what it once was due to throat problems a few years back.  I wish Martin Barre's guitar had been mixed a little higher in the song \\"Steel Monkey\\", and I really wish this package had included the original 20 minute version of \\"Budapest.\\"   <br />Overall though, a terrific album and worth the money.  Come to think of it, the flute can be heavy and it is made of metal so perhaps what the Grammy committee meant when they gave Tull the award.
0446577383|5.0|In our nation's capital, a motley band of four men, highly intelligent and decidedly un-mainstream, hold regular meetings of what they affectionately call The Camel Club. They have no clubhouse, no regular agenda, and no real organization. Their discussions range far and wide, most politically focused, all well-considered and thoroughly provocative. \\"[America] needs to recognize that there are many ways to be free. I fear that we still see the only way to resolve things is our way.\\" <br /> <br />One night, they watch in silent horror as a pair of men dump a body and pump a bullet into it. Believing that their word would be given little credence, the quartet avoids going to the authorities, opting instead to track down the gunmen themselves. But the trail they follow leads them to a whole lot more than a mere homicide. <br /> <br />Oliver Stone, the de facto head of the Club, leads a simple life as cemetery caretaker and government protester. Oliver is a man who shed his name decades ago in favor of one whose most famous holder espouses views this Oliver aligns himself with. An official permit gives him the right to a tent space across from the White House, where he can champion his causes on placards. Oliver is an observer. He knows much of the comings and goings of the leaders of the greatest nation in the free world. But what he is seeing now is disturbing him more than ever. <br /> <br />Fortunately, Oliver has an unlikely ally in Secret Service Agent Alex Ford. While the Secret Service turns a blind eye to the import of this murder and a couple of other seemingly unconnected deaths, Alex jumps in with both eyes wide open. Joining forces with the Camel Club takes a while to work out, but once he does, a bold plan is smoothly choreographed. If they don't work to stop who's behind this plot, they know the consequences could be cataclysmic. <br /> <br />Consider this: if you believed that the world was heading in a direction that could bring about humanity's complete destruction, what would you do? A good place to begin would seem to lie with the President of the United States, arguably the most powerful person on Earth. <br /> <br />One man believes so passionately in the need for immediate radical change that he sets in motion a plot against President Brennan. But this isn't just the same trite assassination plot. Much more is involved. Much, much more. So, are the reasons behind the plot altruistic, personal or something more devious? As the story unfolds, betrayal at some very high levels is uncovered and heroes are found in some surprising areas. <br /> <br />The members of the Camel Club will charm you as much as they will challenge your opinions. \\"...what happens when you have a country that was artificially created by a colonial power, jamming three distinct and incompatible groups into one boundary. A one-size-fits-all democracy is not an effective foreign policy when you're dealing with such different cultures.\\" Or, \\"Did you really think you would waltz in and save the Iraqis and everything would be peaceful? ...One cannot bomb people into a democracy. That comes from the ground up, not the sky down.\\" <br /> <br />In the midst of the characters' debates about right and wrong, Agent Ford fights to save his job, his new love, and ultimately his life, just as Oliver Stone and the Camel Club fight to puzzle out the answer to what happened to President Brennan. <br /> <br />With an utterly relentless pace, David Baldacci maps out a course with more twists and turns than a good autocross circuit. This is one scary book. <br /> <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kate Ayers
B00070DK14|3.0|Broadsword and the Beast was a return to the more traditional Tull sound after 1980's controversial A album.  It's also the only Jethro Tull album not produced by Ian Anderson.  Peter Vetesse on keyboards and Gerry Conway on drums made their Tull debuts with this album. <br />There are a lot of great ideas on this album but they're skewered by over production. There is rarely any spacing between the notes, instead there is a constant synthesiser pulse running through nearly every song.  It's especially bad in the song \\"Seal Driver\\", a song that also has one of Martin Barre's best guitar solos. <br />Gerry Conway's drumming is awful on this album.  Anyone who has listened to his work with Fairport Convention knows what an exellent drummer he really is.  However on this album he is reduced to being a human drum machine.  The song \\"Broadsword\\" is perhaps the worst with Gerry doing a hollywood American Indian riff throughout the song. <br />This album has some good moments, as all Tull albums do, but it isn't one of their best albums.  Sweet talk someone into buying it for you, or use a gift certificate.

B000AADYUI|5.0|It is hard to know whether someone unfamiliar with this album and hearing it for the first time in 2005 will get it or not.   <br />George Bush, though, is doing a fairly nice job of standing in for Dick Nixon and creating a similar air of general dissatisfaction.  \\"America hates her crazies\\" is about as true today as it was in 1970. The timing of this rerelease might be quite telling!  The difference now, though, is that starships have gone from science fiction to reality.  Hmmmm... <br /> <br />This is my fifth copy of this album and the music never seems to age.  This is as unique a recording as was made in the era and is not typical of anything else by the Airplane/Starship.  This is Paul Kantner's science fiction and musical masterpiece about hijacking a starship and leaving Earth behind to create and populate a new civilization.  As a listener, it is possible to be transported by this music.   <br /> <br />In 1970 I had to listen to this album at least every day.  Listening now, it takes me back then to those times when idealism instead of irony was the order of the day.  It seems in many ways almost quaint, unless you can suspend enough disbelief to let the music lift you to a place where you can imagine a chance to begin again. <br /> <br />\\"Where do we go from here?  Chaos or community?\\"  Still seems like a valid question, doesn't it?

B000AP04MO|5.0|It's hard to say who was more beautiful in this film, the always lovely Audrey Hepburn or the incredibly adorable Albert Finney. This story of a marriage that begins when the lovers first meet, allows the viewer to be privy to both points of view. As the film floats back and forth in time, we witness Joanna and Mark change from free spirits hitchhiking through Europe with little money, to a sophisticated well-to-do couple whose marriage is in trouble. The scenery is spectacular as well as the music, but it's the slices of life and realistic dialogue that tugs at your heart one minute and makes you laugh the next. <br />Look out for Jacqueline Bissette in one of her first performances as a young woman trying to woo Albert Finney in the opening scenes.

0316666343|4.0|Rarely have I encountered a book that so forcefully confronts its reader.  Having eight children of my own, the thought of dealing with the brutal assault and murder of a daughter is not only well beyond my experience it takes my assumptions regarding life and puts them to the test.  Therein lies the power of the book.  \\"Lovely Bones\\" immediately takes you where you never wanted to go, yet you are at once a captive; unable to leave the narrative until it resolves.  Think of the THX tone--the book starts, by analogy, with a swirl of noise and sound that resolves into a very powerful chord.  Rather like the adolescent infatuations described therein, the story somehow sneaks past emotional defenses and immediately engages you so strongly that you cannot put it down.  Why?<br /><br />For one, any reader can find a character with which they have shared experiences.  The author crafts emotional conflicts with which it is distressingly easy to identify--the characterizations are probably the strength of the book.  And, there is the relentless plot--what relationships will survive, how will the characters deal with their terrible loss; loss of life, loss of mother, loss of wife, loss of career, loss of friends, the book is a litany of loss.<br /><br />Sure, there are some flaws in the book--it loses a star for a completely unnecessary scene near the end that could have been much more powerful if it had simply been a repeat of the kiss that was talked about.  Perhaps a more confident novelist would not need to portray intercourse as the ultimate pinnacle of all human experience.  The murder casts its shadow to be sure; however, the author takes a disturbingly dark tone with respect to every interpersonal relationship in the book--not even in heaven can any character in the book have complete confidence in the people with whom they are surrounded.  And Ms. Sebold's heaven is a bleak and selfish place with promises of a better that are hinted at but never realized.  But, once the book is finished, we realize that we have been taken for a ride by a gifted observer of humanity who demonstrates that we often waste time seeking the positives that are really all around us.nished, we realize that we have been taken for a ride by a gifted observer of humanity who demonstrates that we often waste time seeking the positives that are really all around us.
B00000AFDW|1.0|I was a huge Kiss fan, \\"was\\" being the operative word.  This album is bad in so many ways.  \\"Within\\" is the only song worth listening to, and you'll probably enjoy it more if you pretend it's someone other than Kiss.  We've heard the truth about Kiss over the last few years.  They lie to their fans and take every last cent they can get out of them.  The fact that there was no-one else doing what they did in the 70s makes them unique, but not great.  After all, every snowflake is unique, but it's still just a snowflake.
0446577383|5.0|With the Camel Club, David Baldacci once again takes us along for an exciting ride that delivers the goods until the final page.  In Camel Club, we join Oliver Stone (not the director) and four of his friends as they take on some of Washington's most powerful people in this frighteningly realistic story. <br /> <br />Stone and his pals, who are the Camel Club, are witness to a murder during one of their meetings, but this was no ordinary murder.  This murder set into motion one of the most daring terrorist attacks ever to hit US soil.  One of Stones Secret Service buddies is investigating the case, and unknowingly gets pulled in to a situation that could end his life.   <br /> <br />There are twists and turns that will keep you glued to the pages as Baldacci keeps the pace moving and gives you an ending that you will not soon forget.  <br /> <br />One of the more interesting parts of this book is that the scenario is something that could, with enough work by terrorists, happen and the consequences would be devastating.  While there is defiantly a political twist to this book and Baldacci's political views show through, one cannot help but enjoy this great read!!!  I strongly recommend this to all readers!
B000AADYYO|5.0|It takes time to understand the depth and breadth of Opeth's music. Going to an Opeth's concert to see their expertise, their passion for the music and the sheer power of their music will probably help those who are still skeptical. As for people who thinks that Ghost Reveries is not as good as earlier albums, I just simply say that you have to let the band progress and be a bit unpredictable. After all, that's what they have always been. If they keep churning out My Arms Your Hearse 1,2,3 like some bands out there, it will be waste of their talents and creativity. <br />With that in mind, i think it deserves all 5 stars

I can't stand music snobs. Get a life. What is proof of this to me is that everyone is panning the fact that Santana has worked with Bo Bice - egad -how awful- isn't that the worst - so shocking.  Bo actually is a dam% good singer.  No one can open their minds (and ears) to hear that?  The rest of the CD is fine. It's pop music.  It's meant to appeal to the masses, and in fact it deserves five stars for accomplishing that.
B00005QDW5|3.0|I used to like this band alot i listen to dark side of the moon a million times it seems years ago. I also bought this, and the wall. The only good songs on this are the ones that classic rock radio plays a millon times and the syd barret stuff. The syd stuff especailly see emily play is cute and quite enjoyable. Pink floyds songs are way to long and take forever untill someone starts to sing. If i want to listen to instrmentals i would put on one of my bach cds. The other thing i do not like much about floyd is there lead singers waters and gilmor there voices are quite dull. People keep saying that Radiohead sounds alot like this band i agree some what but atleast they do not do long songs and there singer has the better singing voice. Pink floyd fans are so loyal they but all there cds even if they are crap. If floyd release a cd of themselves farting the cd's would be snatch up quickly. I think most of there fans are high when they listen to there music.
B00025ETIW|3.0|warped tour 2005 (Randals Island) the lead singer asked the fans to back up from the stage so he could see them all giving him the middle finger. <br /> <br />The show was just watchable at best but i just don't feel comfortable admitting that i own this album.  If someone asked me whats the deal with this band, I'd say \\"They're not okay, there not okaaaayyyy\\". <br /> <br />If you're a fifteen year old girl, or a gender confused teenage boy I'd give you a serious recommendation for this album, otherwise, take your studded belt, john deer hat, and psudo logo tee-shirt and buy a better album.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Has anyone notice that this cover looks alot like william hung\\"s cd cover. Of course it is not the same colors and all but santana is cherring and has his hand up in the air like that hung cover and there is people in the background. At This point Willam Hung is the more original artist. If that is not a bag on Santana then i do not know what is. The other thing i notice is that clive has people on this cd that have upcoming cds coming out or are on his label. And speaking of american idol why is Bo brice on this that is really lame, he while as well have gotten clay aiken. I cant believe this is the same guy who played with Hendrix, the Who, and joplin at woodstock after hearing this those artist are probaly rolling over in there grave.
B000AOENJA|3.0|I have to admit it takes a couple of listens to appreciate David Gray's new disc probably because his introspective style can be easily dismissed as monotonous and rather tedious. It would have been difficult to top the intoxicating hook of \\"Babylon\\" from his 1999 \\"White Ladder\\" album, and frankly he doesn't try on this new recording. That's not to say this disc doesn't have its share of pleasures, as his rueful maturity and polished craftsmanship are on full display here. Gray partners here with producer Marius de Vries, who brings a more sonic feel to the arrangements. While De Vries has impressive credentials (he produced Madonna's \\"Ray of Light\\" and was Baz Luhrmann's musical director for \\"Moulin Rouge\\"), I am on the fence as to whether this is a fruitful collaboration with the more acoustically inclined Gray.<br /><br />To my ears, Gray excels when the arrangements are on the spare side, for example, the quiet, plaintive \\"From Here You Can Almost See the Sea\\" and the nice, loping quality of \\"The One I Love\\". The opening track \\"Alibi\\" is a majestic ballad, but things go a bit awry with \\"Nos Da Cariad\\", which picks up the pace a bit with an almost Steely Dan vibe. It has an insistent, minor-key piano line that gradually moves into a chorus that features Gray all but screaming over a beautiful backing vocal. The song initially has a lovely feel that unfortunately degenerates into bombast. The same can be said for the title track, a dirge with a swelling orchestra and some odd machinery-sounding effects to simulate the out-of-body feeling one has when facing an unexpected tragedy. It's another exercise in embellishing a relatively static song with lush ornamentation.<br /><br />The most pretentious offenders though are the somber non-love song \\"Ain't No Love\\", which bridges a long introduction replete with sound effects to an almost spoken, sing-songy verse, and the epic-length \\"Now and Always\\" that has an annoying harmonica line meant to impersonate, I believe, a foghorn. The peppiest song on the disc is \\"Hospital Food\\", although the lyrics seem to be about a man going stir crazy during a hospital stay. Fortunately, the closing track finds Gray back in typical form with a downbeat piano ballad, \\"Disappearing World\\".<br /><br />The DualDisc features the entire album in enhanced stereo with or without lyrics, the latter showing pointless pictures of glaciers. There is also a rather lightweight, twenty-minute documentary that features Gray and percussionist Clune most prominently, including a funny visit to the local bakery to get their daily pastries. I would not call this recording a misfire, as Gray displays enough heart and grown-up sensibilities to carry the entire venture through, but a few more uptempo songs and a less indulgent producer probably could have helped significantly.piest song on the disc is \\"Hospital Food\\", although the lyrics seem to be about a man going stir crazy during a hospital stay.

B00097DX3U|5.0|The first thing I want to make known is that this CD along with the first Audioslave CD have converted me from a hip-hop fan to an Audioslave fan. I guess I've been depriving myself of good music all these years. There isn't a single weak track on this album and hearing it brought out my curiousity in it's best form. Because of it, I went out and bought a couple Rage CD's and a Soundgarden one as well. I love it; great music. Ranks right up there with Jay-Z. They're amazing in concert as well. I suggest everybody buy this CD and save up some money for the concert as well.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|When the Firefly TV series aired in 2002 I was an instant fan. When it was cancelled I was crushed. In the first few episodes the writing, directing, acting, music... everything was more professional and polished than shows on the air for many years. The characters were oustanding and the world created for them was so vast that the story possibilities were nearly endless.<br /><br />Amazon.com became my favorite place to buy the DVD box set when it became available (ASIN B0000AQS0F). I bought several sets for myself (intending to loan them to friends that missed the show on TV) and several more for gifts. So many of my friends watched and instantly fell in love with the show! If you haven't seen it, buy it here on Amazon, and add Serenity to your order.<br /><br />Why? Because the TV series had a grand story arc that was cut short by its cancellation. An incredibly compelling mystery was set up and we were denied its resolution. Then Executive Producer Joss Whedon worked with Universal to bring Firefly to the big screen in the form of Serenity. This major motion picture offers the perfect resolution to one of the main mysteries explored by the series and at the same time stands alone as a fantastic science fiction movie.<br /><br />So few filmmakers make something that packs so much action, humor, suspense and drama into 2 hours. It feels like the entire 2nd season of the TV show was packed into this one film. I saw Serenity 5 times in the theater and look forward to seeing it many more on DVD!<br /><br />So go ahead, click to buy! You won't regret it, and the friends and family members you loan it to (or buy it for) will love it!

B000002H6C|5.0|Epic. This is the line of demarcation... The toe in the dirt scrawling out the line bewteen fans of the old-school thrash Metallica and their more pop-conscious fans of the new. It's also my favorite Metallica CD, I find it to be their most consistently BADASS. Epic riffs, sprawling density; the songs are allowed to take up as much time and aural texture as is needed (\\"...And Justice For All\\" and \\"To Live Is To Die,\\" both clock in at just under 10 minutes).<br /><br />This one: Exceptionally well-paced, a tad thinly recorded, brutal sonic delivery. Killer legendary tracks. Thematically unified, this would be Metallica's most socially-driven release as most, if not all, of the tracks seem to deal (in some way) with ostracism, petty-tribal-hates, the plight of those passed-over, those forgotten, those stepped on or kicked out of the way... James's vitriol is unleashed in full! No sleepers, no skippers.<br /><br />Something I don't see noted in here much: the drums! Lars really pounds the living soul out of himself on this one. There's more variety and interesting bass-drum fill work on this one than previous (and following) releases. It almost sounds like a different drummer at times. Early Metallica skin-work always comes off as a tad marginal... That's probably because I don't know anything about drums beyond digging double-bass-kicks. This one brings them aplenty.<br /><br />...From the melodic building electric drone of the first track \\"Blackened,\\" (which infectiously sets the tone for the what is to come), to the take-no-prisoners thrash mayhem of \\"Dyers Eve,\\" a blistering and acerbic closer.<br /><br />Some high points: The parts in \\"Eye Of The Beholder\\" When James starts howling \\"Independence, Liberty! FREEEEEDOM!\\" he comes off like a metal Braveheart, Plus it has one of all-time fave screechy \\"wong-wong--wong-WONG-WAAAAAHHH!!!!! blast-off\\" solos.<br /><br />The chorus of \\"...And Justice...\\" is just killer. \\"Justice is rrraped, justice is DONE!\\" Recalling, \\"Master of Puppets\\" with its \\"pulling your strings, justice is done,\\" line... Loss of Power/Control being an oft-recurrent major theme in the Metallica corpus.<br /><br />I'm not gonna gush on and on about how slick the transistions are in \\"One,\\" from the softer melodic poignance to all out thrash-insanity, seeing as how everybody knows the tune in question. But it does never seem to get old, at least to these ears.<br /><br />The instrumental \\"To Live is to Die,\\" is better than prior instrumental tracks (yes, there I said it- someone had to); the snakey blues-metal solo is sick, and then there's the dynamic shifting in the song...<br /><br />Love the \\"Oh-EEE-OH,\\" chorus opening off \\"Frayed Ends of Sanity,\\" that could've sounded kitschy and dumb but the guys pull it off making it the only time anyone has referenced \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" in an ominous manner.<br /><br />Nitpicking: As many other reviewers have noted- You can't hear the bass. As in: at all. It's just not there. These tunes are bassless accusations, mwah-hah-hah... Given how awful James, Lars and Kirk treated Jason for something like the first 4 years he was with them; maybe this is but one more sign of that... Still, as I think Jason is an interesting metal bassman (a rare breed) I wish there were more low-end theory on this classic... Maybe when it gets the remaster in however many years, they'll crank up the BOOM... Which remindeth me, O my brothers- completely off the topic at hand: AVOID AT ALL COSTS THE NEW MEGADETH REMASTERS; the vocals are unbelievably bad. I know, I listened. I suffered so that you don't have to: we all know Mustaine was never an able crooner to begin with (not that his chosen mode of expression demands that) but... wow. They're just plain awful, the new vox. You want to tell yourslef, \\"Hey it ain't that bad, but that tiny part of your soul that knows spit from spinola just keeps nudging you saying, \\"Dude... Umm... Dude... Just turn  it off.\\"<br /><br />Back to Metallica: This one catches some flak from most fans I think, despite the fact that those who dig on this one dig the holy hell out of it.<br /><br />Oh... This is perhaps the best weight-lifting CD ever. The tracks ably segue into each other so well... Great for maintaining consistent anger and power output for multiple sets of squats and deadlifts.Back to Metallica: This one catches some flak from most fans I think, despite the fact that those who dig on this one dig the holy hell out of it.  <br /> <br />Oh...

B00005QDW5|5.0|Let's be honest here.  Pink Floyd is one of the greatest bands of our time.  Can you think of any other band (that retained majority of the same members) who went on to produce GREAT music in three distinctly different decades?  There is the Syd Barret-era Floyd which is high on psychedelic appeal (pun intended?  who knows?)  There is the David Gilmour-era floyd which soars into another galaxy with the great album Darkside of the Moon (among many others of course.)  Finally there was the Roger Waters-era floyd which was, if nothing else, great in its own unique way--but still Floydian in style.  Now, how do you fit all of these \\"eras\\" onto just one \\"greatest hits\\" album?  Well it would be easy, but just filling two discs full of PF's music wouldn't be fitting for this band.  No, we needed something unique, something crazy, something greater than the sum of the music contained therein--well, let's not get too gimmicky here.  It still has to be tasteful and elegant.  In that vein, then, Echoes delivers.  It delivers BIG.  The songs mesh together into a cornucopia of ingenuity, originality and inspiration.  Everything flows together and it's almost like listening to the music again for the first time.  Floyd's music, although it spanned some 30 years, still remains uniquely Floyd.  All songs work and flow together.  That is why this album is so great.  It's not just another \\"greatest hits\\" album, it is a completely \\"new\\" album for music fans the world over.
B0000AKY7R|5.0|If ever there was a case to not 'Judge a book by its Cover', it'd be this album.  A dubious looking photograph of 'Carlos Santana' & 'John McLaughlin'.  Two of the most recognised and accomplished guitarist that the Jazz-rock field (McLaughlin), and Latin-rock (Santana), seemingly looking like something out of a bad clothes catalogue brochure.  I myself admit, that I saw this album in my second-hand music store for months, with the cover being enough to (wrongly) convince me that this was some ill-conceived 'Vanity' project for both artists, and where the music would be one long ego trip for both musicians involved.  But if you are prepared to look past the initially off-putting cover, you'll actually discover (like I did), an album that remarkably isn't mentioned more widely when referring to either artists work.  Maybe this is possibly because it's more likely considered an album of music, that merely takes the existing work of 'John Coltrane' & 'Pharoah Sanders', and reinterprets them, into stunning Jazz-Rock, Fusion & Latin rock tracks, rather than an original body of work.<br /><br />John Coltrane's legendary signature track \\"A Love Supreme\\" is cast within an elaborate and fiery burst of sophisticated Jazz-rock improvisations, that remain dynamic and wonderfully capture the energy of John original work, and although hearing the work, reinterpreted via the use of guitars is at first intitally disorientating, repeated listens reveal a understanding and complete respect for the original work and yet somehow manages to offer something new, in that the influence of jazz-influenced improvisation runs strong through, but that it's matched with precision elements of studious rock compostion, that only guitarist's (or indeed musicians), of this calibre could so wonderfully balance.  and more importantly neither musician, dominates the music with their contributions, and instead draw on that level of studied passionate spirituality, that made up such a large part of Coltrane's later work, and when the vocal chants of \\"A Love Supreme\\" begin to waft into view, it all begins to feel like a fantastically explored progressive sound, that you can't help but feel, that John himself would have thoroughly approved of.<br /><br />\\"Naima\\" is another of Coltrane's pieces that has been transposed from Jazz, to fit with in the freewheeling Blues/Latin-rock, and Fusion template here, but whereas the previous track was far more intense and confident, with it approach and excellently mixed up the spiritual with the confident and exuberant to startling effect, \\"Naima\\" is but complete contrast a much softer and more inward looking track that, has an emphasis on the use of slide guitar to relay the more organic and subdued nature of the track, and the hushed instrumentation is indicative of the contrasting and ultimately pastoral nature of the Coltrane original.  And such is the delicate lushness of this track, that you'll feel a sense of disappointment that it's very brief 3 minute running time leaves you wanting more.<br /><br />\\"The Life Divine\\" sees McLaughlin take on more of the arrangement and compositional duties here, as this is a sound that seems more akin to his remarkable first couple of albums with \\"The Mahavishnu Orchestra\\", and so the sound is one of the complex and electronic innovations of the guitar Jazz-fusion, that they became famous for, it certainly a energetic and invigorating piece that has that sublime improvisational fusion that served McLaughlin well, in his time as a \\"Miles Davis\\" sideman on his \\"Bitches Brew\\" and \\"Jack Johnson\\" sessions. With the heavily rhythm-orientated progressive rock, and freeform Jazz arrangements running strongly throughout the track.  This track will undoubtedly appeal most to those that enjoyed the shimmering funkiness, and moody electric ethereal rhythms, and slightly aggressive tones and textures of his Jazz-rock work.<br /><br />\\"Let Us Go into the House of the Lord\\" is a song that I was performed by 'Pharoah Sanders' (although I don't believe his is the composer), and at a lengthy 15 minutes, it's by far the longest track on the album, and undeniably one of the greatest compostions, and oddly it this track feels as though Carlos Santana has had more of a hand in this track, and it feels in parts closer to the ethnic and almost bluesy approach, that probably has more in common with the summery psychedelic and the playful and confident Latin-rock/Afro-Cuban, by which Santana became synonymous with.  And it here that this track feels more like a Santana production because it has that feel of multiple influences: Rock, Jazz, Salsa, & Blues, all subtly texturing the sound, and making for gripping performance, especially when the two guitarist begin to start weaving some sublime guitar interplay, between the both of them.  Cerebral in tone and loaded with some excellent percussion, it can at times be a very melodic and lush sounding track, and at other times remarkably technical and movingly poigiant.<br /><br />This is one of those albums, that I can imagine, when it was released over 30 years ago, divided fans of both artists fanbase, as it was a wasn't quite what the fans back then were expecting from both artists (an album of mostly Jazz classics reinterpreted into Jazz Fusion??).  And for those fans nowdays, that probably only know Santana through his recent albums, that feature a multitude of vocalists / Collaborators, this will undoubtedly leave most listeners scratching their heads in bemusement.  But for those that are familiar with the original tracks that these versions are taken from, or indeed welcome (and indeed Love) the whole Jazz-Fusion / Jazz-Rock genre, this is a truly stunning album, that actually sounds a lot more relevant in this times of musical multi-genres, and is arguably a one-off stunning pairing of arguably two of the rock genres finest statesmen, but more importantly an amazing jam session by two exceptionally gifted guitarists, who made a unique album of intense, passionate and beautifully realised musical explorations that sound even better now, than it did back then.as performed by 'Pharoah Sanders' (although I don't believe his is the composer), and at a lengthy 15 minutes, it's by far the longest track on the album, and undeniably one of the greatest compostions, and oddly it this track feels as though Carlos Santana has had more of a hand in this track, and it feels in parts closer to the ethnic and almost bluesy approach, that probably has more in common with the summery psychedelic and the playful and confident Latin-rock/Afro-Cuban, by which Santana became synonymous with.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I was so happy when Joss got the backing to make Serenity. Firefly had such potential, but FOX killed it so young after doing all they could to much it up like showing the episodes out of order. The characters, the social strata of the 'Verse and all make for such great storytelling.<br /><br />I saw Serenity in the threatres 5 times. I haven't seen a movie that many times in the theatre since the Empire Strikes Back. And Serenity is better than Empire. Every time I watched it I saw something new. I will probably wear out the DVD when I get it. Might need to order two, and give it to all my friends for Christmas.

B00005JM1F|2.0|I watched this on DVD yesterday and wasn't impressed. The plot is taken from movies such as Animal House and Revenge of the Nerds: Misfits overcome adversity to prevail. The comedy is funny, but not that funny. The most intriguing character is Vince Vaughn's: the party boy and instigator of all the craziness who is carrying around his son the whole time being a dad. Other than that, a lot of the movie is a let down. What's the point of that one fat guy doing the vault with the scrawny guy spotting him? He does the vault successfully with no squashing the little guy. Big whoop. That pretty much summarizes the movie. Lots of build up with no payoff.
0060755598|3.0|This book actually has alot of good points and advice for starting a business. But it could be about half of the length it is. The author makes a point, and then gives several metaphores in a row trying to drive the point home. Sometimes making it tedious to listen to, even on a drive home when I have nothing better to do.  <br /> <br />Later in the book, he tries to touch home by talking about 'your spirit.' That just made me want to turn it off. But I kept on. <br /> <br />If you can get through all of that, there are alot of good ideas here.

B0002Y69NG|5.0|I love Matrix. It's full of clever s/fx and plot and action. Really brilliant content! I am reviewing the movies in order:<br /><br />THE MATRIX:<br /><br />Story: Neo, a man confused by today, \\"Follows the white rabbit\\" and is led into a ship called the Nebachadnezzar. He meets Morpheus, falls in love with Trinity and helps fight \\"Agents\\" to win the battle between human and machines.<br /><br />Thoughts: Really clever. I loved it a lot. It was cool, the fight in the lobby near the end.<br /><br />THE MATRIX RELOADED:<br /><br />Story: Neo has not been able to sleep after having a terrible vision of Trinity dying. He discovers the Agents are back, and so he and the other 2 people must fight them to win the battle.<br /><br />Thoughts: I've seen way better than this. Not much plot, and there is only beginning, end, and not much of a middle. the only part I liked was the Car Chase.<br /><br />THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS:<br /><br />Story: Neo awakes from his coma that he ended up in in \\"Revolutions\\" and He discovers that he is not really, \\"the one\\" who can fight the machines and save humans. He is led into a fight with Agent smith, and must save the humans so that they can live freely and in peace.<br /><br />Thoughts: Really excellent! I thought it improved a lot. Not as good as the 1st, but really beautiful. Plus, I (kinda) went \\"Neo! come back!\\" at the end.<br /><br />I suggest you watch the whole series. If you havent seen it, you don't know what you're missing!
B00000K3D4|3.0|While I am in no way a huge fan, I do like the works of Jim Henson.  The Muppets are hilarious, and I have fond memories of Fraggle Rock.  I had always meant to see this movie, but I could never get around to it.  In addition to what I'd always heard as fantastic effects and puppetry, it has Jennifer Connelly in it (so beautiful, even at 16).  My roommate has it, so I finally sat down and watched it.  He had constantly praised it, so I was expecting a great, quirky, imaginitive film that would be good for an hour and a half of escapism.  Well, it is quirky. <br />Connelly plays Sarah, a 16-year-old girl who is happier playing with her toys and pretending to be a princess than be around kids her own age.  She is very smart, but somewhat socially stunted (or at least that's the impression I got).  When her parents ask her to babysit her little brother Toby (Toby Froud), she goes off the deep end, complaining how it will take up too much of her time.  She wishes that the goblins will come and take him away, absolving her of responisbility.  When the wish comes true, she pleads with the goblin king Jareth (David Bowie) to get him back.  He agrees to return Toby to her if she can navigate his enormous labyrinth in less than 13 hours. <br />Soon, Sarah is off exploring a fantasy world populated by goblins, talking worms, and a whole manner of bizarre creatures.  Like the tagline says, nothing is what it seems and anything is possible.  Anything goes in the labyrinth.  Think Alice in Wonderland mixed with the muppets, and hopped up on LSD.  Yeah, it's that strange.  Some things work very well.  Others don't.  There's a scene where Sarah encounters these creatures that can remove their own heads, and while it looks marginally cool, it in no way advances the plot.  Also, there is a plot point that references a scene from Snow White (you'll know it when you see it), and she is able to recover from the event without explanation.  Finally, the ending is the biggest cop-out I'veever seen.  It was pointless and did not fit at all with the rest of the movie. <br />Labyrinth is visually stunning.  The puppets, the sets, and the costumes are all great.  The choreography is wonderful, especially since most of the \\"actors\\" are puppets.  Sadly, the story just isn't there.  There was so much potential; there are many movies that can appeal to both kids and adults, and while this should have been going for both audiences, it really only applies to kids.  Kids, for the most part, will love this (unless they're easily scared), while adults will marvel at the look at the film but will roll their eyes at many of the plot points and dialogue.
0743539478|3.0|This review refers to the audio CD.<br /><br />Dan Brown has quite an imagination, having his characters make unexpected reactions to otherwise predictable events.  However, one must ignore a lot of details in order to enjoy the adventures his characters get into.<br /><br />How long can a woman in an insulated flight suit go without a bathroom break or food -- or makeup and a change of underwear for that matter?  How gullible does a presidential briefer have to be to submit to unplanned, unexplained assignments that are akin to kidnapping?  How naive is the top campaign aide to a senator when she confesses to not knowing about a bill that the president vetoed numerous times?  What kind of analyst would take evidence at face value based on hearsay and about a half hour of research?  What kind of scientists could, as a team, be swept up in a barrage of facts to the point that they ignore their own science?<br /><br />As with his block buster work, The DaVinci Code, Brown forces us to go back to the encyclopedia and look up a lot of things to separate fact from fiction in science, history and current events.<br /><br />Old folks like I get confused when we can't tell fact from fiction.  Nevertheless, it is an entertaining book if the reader (or listener in this case) doesn't keep saying \\"I didn't know that\\", or \\"Did that really happen?\\".<br /><br />It's also easy to keep up with the narration when distracted by driving or conversation, because there are a lot of details that the reader can do without and still enjoy the story.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|This cd is boring. Now before I get abused, let me just say I am a lifelong Rod Stewart fan and I also have the 3 previous Songbook cd's by him. With each progressing one, they get worse and worse. The quality of the songs seem to get diluted. On this one, all the songs are starting to sound the same. The first one was the best one in my opinion, and had the prettiest melodies. It seems he is now just pumping these out so fast, without as much care into the song selection. The novelty has worn off on this , and I hope this is the last one. Get back to making a rockin' cd before it's too late Rod.
B000000OSG|5.0|The consensus among most critics and the general public is that both \\"Use Your Illusion\\" albums contain a lot of filler. It has often been said that a single album, with the best of both volumes, would have been better than two separate albums. Although this is the general consensus among Joe Public, the hard-core Guns N' Roses fans know better.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Illusion albums have very little filler. It would also be hard to have a single album with songs from each disc, as each Illusion album is its own entity. The Illusion set is not a single album with two separate discs. Both volumes are albums in their own right, with a different tone, vibe, and feeling. The colors on the album covers represent the atmosphere of the albums. \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" is brighter, more up-beat, glossier. \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" is more reflective, and overall darker.<br /><br />Between both volumes, there is over two and a half hours of music. Both volumes need to be nursed and savored. The listener needs time to let it all sink in. Some of these songs are fast paced rockers in the vein of \\"Appetite For Destruction.\\" Other songs are longer, up to ten minutes in length, with intricate solos and complex arrangements, in short, art-rock.<br /><br />With an album like \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" under their belt, any follow-up would be criticized. But much had changed for GN'R since they hit it big. They were now multi-millionaires and no longer living in poverty in cheap apartments in L.A. Also, the lineup of the band had changed. Drummer Steven Adler was fired, and replaced by Matt Sorum. Sorum's drumming was slicker, more technically proficient. Also added to the lineup was keyboardist Dizzy Reed. The new GN'R was more polished, less rough-around-the-edges than they had been in the days of AFD.<br /><br />GN'R branched out artistically for their follow-up, and naturally received a lot of criticism. Common complaints are--the band went soft, too much filler, to arty, etc.<br /><br />To address these criticisms: (1) The band did not go soft. There are ballads, but there are also a lot of rockers. A lot of the singles were the ballads, so someone unfamiliar with these albums might conclude that the band went soft by listening to the radio/MTV and conclude that these songs (Don't Cry, November Rain) represent the album, when in fact, they do not. (2) As for there being too much filler, that is a matter of opinion. I happen to think that each song ranges from very good-to classic. A lot of GN'R's very best songs are buried in the set. Because there is so much music, a lot of the songs remain unknown to the general public and are therefore considered \\"filler.\\" (3)A lot of these songs are art-rock. They are often long in length and are not instantly assessable-and are therefore dismissed. A lot of these songs are quite intricate and take time to fully appreciate.<br /><br />Compared to the first volume, \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" has a darker feel and tone. It is somewhat more reflective and melancholy. I tend to look at the first volume as \\"the Izzy album,\\" and the second volume as \\"the Axl album.\\" I do this because Izzy's signature Stones/Faces influence is more prevalent on volume I, and Axl's artistic muscle is stretched more on the second volume, although there is an overlap and each made great contributions to the other.<br /><br />Sorum and bassist Duff McKagan provide a killer rhythm section. Slash's playing, of course, goes without saying, is absolutely incredible. Each song has at least one or two screeching, ear-crunching, kick-ass, yet melodic solos. And Axl Rose shows why he is one of the most memorable, charismatic figures in rock. Songs like \\"Locomotive\\" and \\"Estranged,\\" demonstrate that Guns N' Roses most underrated, creative work in on \\"Use Your Illusion II.\\"<br /><br />\\"Use Your Illusion II\\" opens with the majestic \\"Civil War,\\" which demonstrates a thoughtful and world consciences Rose. The Stradlin penned and sung \\"14 Years\\"shows a real Stones/Faces signature. Rose and Stradlin's duet in the chorus works very nicely. The nostalgic mid-tempo \\"Yesterdays\\" shows a more sensitive, reflective side to the band. The light piano in the intro and outro adds the perfect touch. A cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Knokin' on Heaven's Door\\" is good, if perhaps a little bombastic. Although the band has received a lot of criticism for the punk inspired McKagan penned \\"Get in the Ring,\\" it's actually a really cool song. Yes it is totally juvenile, but its defiance, its take-no-prisoners, refusal to surrender, makes it a triumph. Rose's \\"Shotgun Blues,\\" which is akin to Appetite's \\"Out to Get Me,\\" is a good, underrated rocker that keeps up the pace. The album takes a 180 degree turn for the Rose's mid-tempo, piano-flavored \\"Breakdown.\\" With its screeching solos, sensitive delivery, and meandering piano, this song is a little off-center, but it works. Generally unknown to the general public, \\"Breakdown\\" is a favorite among hard-core gunners.<br /><br />A lot of Guns N' Roses best songs are found on the second half of \\"Use Your Illusion II.\\" Unfortunately, because of the album's length, they just sort of got buried. Stradlin's middle-east-esque \\"Pretty Tied Up\\" is sadistic and raunchy. With its infectious hook and killer solo, it's surprising that this song isn't better known.<br /><br />Slash and Rose's \\"Locomotive\\" is easily one of the crown jewels on the \\"Use Your Illusion\\" set. \\"Locomotive has a Zeppelin-like groove and riff. Rose sings the verse in three different voices, and the chorus features all voices overlapping, layer after layer, creating an almost hypnotic effect. All the while Slash's solos punctuate here there and everywhere. As the song progresses, it builds and builds and builds until it is about ready to explode, and then it takes a 180 degree turn and goes into a subdued, limbo-like state space. Over piano and light guitar, the words \\"love's so strange\\" are repeated over and over like a mantra. Almost ten minutes in length, with intricate solos and overlaying vocals, it's easy to see why the general public, with its attention span of a fruit fly, has overlooked this masterpiece. Among GN'R fans, however, it remains a fan favorite. In a perfect world \\"Locomotive\\" would be regarded as one of the greatest rock songs of-all-time.<br /><br />McKagan shows his sensitive side for his balled \\"So Fine,\\" which he sings. The off-beat, awkwardness of this song makes it all the more authentic and appealing. Rose's \\"Estranged\\" is generally regarded by hard-core Axl Rose/Guns N' Roses fans to be his magnum opus. An ode to unrequited love, this is Rose's most creative, emotional song. Rose's low-key piano solo is (in this fans opinion) his finest hour. Rose's delivery when he asks \\"why must they drift away and die?\\" is both moving and heart-wrenching. \\"Estranged\\" also features some of Slash's best guitar work. Over ten minutes in length, and quite intricate in nature, this song may have been too sophisticated for the general public to truly appreciate. The pounding \\"You Could Be Mine\\" is one of Guns most intense, hard-hitting songs and should please fans of \\"AFD\\" era GN'R. \\"Don't Cry alt. lyrics\\" is an improvement over the original, with more reflective, mature lyrics. The album takes a complete left turn for \\"My World.\\" While most fans hate the industrial sludge of this song, I happen to think it's really cool. This bizarre, eerie closing number leaves a lasting impression.<br /><br />I bought \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" when I was 13 years old, and now, at 26, it remains one of my most favorite albums of all-time. If you are looking for an AFD part two, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for instant gratification, go buy a Blink 182 album. If you want a masterpiece that has songs that are instantly addictive as well as songs that take time to appreciate, buy \\"Use Your Illusion II.\\"duet in the chorus works very nicely.

B00004T9UF|1.0|Is everybody on drugs or something?  Eminem is the whiniest, most untalented moron ever to get signed to a record label.  It's like Vannila Ice except all you losers are calling him a genius. An angry eleven year old could write lyrics just as consistently awful and his voice is perhaps the worst voice commercialy available. <br />Ostensibly all our societies problems could be blamed on poor parenting and stupid male aggression; things which Eminem celebrates and makes money off of.  You guys think this is genius?  You think acting like a tough guy makes you one? <br />It makes you a waste.  To yourself and everybody.  Every year there are over two hundred thousand girls between the ages of five and eleven in the United States alone that are being sold as sex slaves to perverts and degenerates and instead of doing anything about this you guys are paying twenty dollars an album to this violent sociopath who degrades women and has no respect for anyone. <br />Eminem hates people.  All people.  It's as simple as that. If he can't use you in some way he has no need for you. <br />If you think hating people is cool then you are missing the point of life.  Wake up from this garbage.  Oh, and as for the music?  Awful beats.  Awful rythms.  Even rap shouldn't be as hamfisted as this.  Get a life.
0307276902|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book but had one major problem with it.  I do not believe the \\"dentist episode.\\"  It reminded me of NAZI Germany and we do live in the United States.
B000AL730O|4.0|First impressions were a little sad, I thought Paul had lost it, not a lot of silliness here, and sentiment that a first hearing sounded a bit pathetic, deep introspection that seems just just not McCartney, but damn it, I can recall most songs, and some melodies just won't leave me alone, even though I didn't think the songs were that good. Maybe they are and I just don't know it yet.
B00082IJ08|2.0|Ok I have to change this review because so far 0 out of 9 people are saying that it was helpful.  You know why? Because they're all huge Gorillaz fans, and they go through and click \\"no\\" on any review that they don't like.  Sorry guys, this album is NOT THAT GREAT.  I know you all love it and think it's wonderful, but the main point I was trying to get across is that people who like the \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" song will not NECESSARILY like this entire CD.  The first half of it is totally different from the single.  There are about 3 good songs on this album if you ask me.  The rest of it is just experimental music that is really hard to get into.  Sorry.  Stop clicking \\"no\\" on my review just because you like this band... you're supposed to vote based on whether you think it's a HELPFUL review, not whether or not you agree with what I'm saying.  To those of you who AREN'T ALREADY huge Gorillaz fans, I'm sorry, this CD is not very good.  It's not catchy and up-tempo like the hit single, it's slow and dramatic, experimental, and NOTHING like Pink Floyd like some people said, and it is NOT the best album of the year.  There is very little rapping at all on this CD.  I just wanted everyone to KNOW that, so go ahead, hate on my reviews some more and say that this wasn't helpful, but people need to know what they're paying for.  It's an average CD, I couldn't listen to it more than twice. I gave it a chance, but it was a waste of my time.
B00097DXZS|5.0|This album is great. There is not even one \\"filler\\" track. Its a solid listen all the way through. The third in the trilogy, and certainly a charm.
B00005BJ9W|5.0|This album brings back so many wonderful memories every time I put it in my terminal that I can't even begin to relay the significance it bore on my generation, but I'll try.  Yes, time has been kind to John Taylor and, no, I still haven't gotten over my crush on him.  For the record, looks aside, he is a great bass player.<br /><br />What isn't to love about this classic new wave pop album?  Five good looking guys doing their best to pay tribute to Roxy Music's Bryan Ferry and his Avalon opus with their own Bowie tinted sound and their fashion savvy--well, except for guitarist Andy Taylor who never really quite fit the band and later proved it by producing for twee pop metal bands like Giant and recording bad solo albums like Thunder. There's also the fact that I like my vinyl version of Rio somewhat better than this remastered cd edition for reasons other reviewers have already explained.<br /><br />What makes this album great? Let's face it; it's not the teeny envelope sized videos on the enhanced portion of the disc:<br /><br />\\"Rio\\":  The title track is not about the girl in the video or the one on the cover done by the late Patrick Nagel, which has been nicely misconstrued since the album came out.  It's a loving tribute to America, and I love it all the more having recently found that out!  Killer sax solo, and--let's face it--a great lyric in \\"cherry ice cream smile, I suppose that's very nice.\\"<br /><br />\\"My Own Way\\":  Simply a great rock dance song, and Simon Le Bon's vocals totally kick holy anus here.<br /><br />\\"Lonely in Your Nightmare\\":  What girl doesn't want to hear such sweetness as this from her significant other?  No wonder we all got so gooey over Simon Le Bon when we thought John was too busy with Renee' Simonsen!<br /><br />\\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\":  I know this is an 80's classic, you know it, and it's still getting heavy airplay.  Too bad it's not the version we got on vinyl 2 1/2 decades ago with the long intro and the girl's groans are more subdued too.  That version can be found on the first singles box set--a quite disappointing buy, but some things about it make it a semi-worthy purchase.<br /><br />\\"Hold Back the Rain\\":  \\"Hungry Like the Wolf\\" part 2.<br /><br />\\"New Religion\\":  It took me a long time to like this song, and I'm still not sure I do.<br /><br />Okay, this is where the rest of the album justifies my 5 star rating:<br /><br />\\"Last Chance on the Stairway\\":  This is my favorite Duran Duran song of all time and, if someone tells you differently, they're an imposter.  This is simply one of the finest songs of the 80's--new wave, rock, pop, or otherwise, and the magic comes through particularly in Andy Taylor's wonderful guitar solo.  Everything about this song is tight and well-structured, but it's Simon's lyrics and phrasing on the final verse that closes the deal for me:<br /><br />\\"Wonder why, what makes me rise so high<br /><br />Maybe it's something they put in your purfume or the look in your eyes<br /><br />It could be the atmosphere sinking<br /><br />I don't even know what you're thinking<br /><br />I don't even know what you're drinking, but it keeps this heaven alive\\"<br /><br />Now how romantic is that?<br /><br />\\"Save a Prayer\\":  More beautiful romanticism from Simon, but Nick Rhodes' keyboards are definitely so much of what make this song a classic as well.  I try not to think of the video shot in Sri Lanka, but it is such a heavenly clip that I can't help imagining it.  This is really a gorgeous and quirky new wave song on its own.<br /><br />\\"The Chauffeur\\":  Wonderful, dark Hitchcock-like song about a troubled couple in a limousine.<br /><br />Yes, this disc has its imperfections, but the last three tracks alone warrant my rating.  It's nostalgic for someone my age, not so much for those who thought these guys wouldn't last, and the sell-out reunion tour of the original lineup gives me enough joy to not to have to say I told you so.roans are more subdued too.

B00097DXZS|1.0|I would advise not getting this CD for that reason - send a message. When I spend money on a CD I want to listen to it when and where I want to without having to download a bunch of software to my computer. I bought this CD today and I am returning it tomorrow.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I'll admit it right up front: I'm a Firefly/Serenity geek.  I've seen the movie nine times in the theater (by far the most for me, any film, any genre).  I've never developed such a deep connection with any other entertainment franchise with the possible exceptions of \\"The Lord Of the Rings\\" -- the books, mainly, though the movies were great too -- the \\"Narnia\\" series, and \\"Watership Down\\". <br /> <br />So what is it about this fictional world that draws me in so?  Has senility kicked in and I'm experiencing my second childhood?  Maybe, but I think I still have a bit of critical judgement left. <br /> <br />I think the real reason is that this is science fiction done right.  It's not about bumpy-headed alien monsters or supernatural forces.  It's about people, ordinary people like you and me who find themselves caught up in events outside their control.  It's about holding things together when every force in the 'verse is trying to rip them apart. <br /> <br />Technically, this film is beautiful, with just enough SFX to tell the story without having the effects become the story.  The one really heavy CGI sequence is a head-spinning thrill ride, but it's not what the movie is about.   <br /> <br />\\"Serenity\\" is far more fast-paced than the Firefly series was, and that's a mixed blessing.  The serial television format allows for more deliberate pacing and character development, which is compressed in the movie.  One side effect is that \\"Serenity\\" holds up well to multiple viewings, as you catch the nuances that might have flown past too quickly on the first pass.  On the upside, the fast pacing means this film is action packed.  There are more twists and turns in its first nine minutes than most movies give you in their entire running length. <br /> <br />Even so, \\"Serenity\\" takes enough time to show you the lighter side of these characters.  There are a lot of laughs here, including a few really big ones.  Some of them come just when the tension seems to be nearly unbearable.  That's a sign of gifted writing. <br /> <br />Though it's never rubbed in your face, the movie also carries a timely political message, demonstrating how evil may result from the best of intentions. <br /> <br />It's no surprise that Firefly has more female fans than many other SF tales.  If I may be permitted a gross generalization, women tend to be more empathetic and relationship oriented than men.  \\"Serenity\\" has what women, and men who are in touch with that attribute, are looking for: people you care about, trying to hang on to their humanity at the raggedy edge. <br />
0307276902|1.0|I find it an insult to the American literary community that as soon as the big \\"O\\" attaches her seal of approval to a work it instantly soars to the top of everyone's bestseller list. Are we that lost that we wait until a talk show host informs us what is quality literature? Please tell me it isn't so!! Let us all be a reading Rosa Parks and \\"sit\\" at home and not \\"stand up\\" to flock to the end of the Literary Lemmings Line.
B000B0WODA|5.0|So much for sophomore slump, it doesn't exist with FF.  This is such a fun, rockin' CD.  Gets off to a great start, really danceable music throughout with some exceptions.  Some of the slower softer ones have beautiful, wistful melodies, like \\"Eleanor\\" and \\"Fade Together.\\"  The piano is particularly wistful with it's waltz-time tempo, reminiscent of the turn of the last century.  My favorites songs on the album are \\"Eleanor Put Your Boots On\\" and \\"What You Meant.\\"  \\"Outsiders\\" has a great little guitar too.  Great 2nd album!

B00003CXAE|5.0|Quite a shoo in for the greatest musical ever made, \\"Grease\\" is simply fantastic. It has indeed stood the test of times, and is one of the few films the 1970s' that has been embraced by younger crowds. With its wonderful cast and classic songs, \\"Grease\\" is a classic.<br /><br />John Travolta is fantastic as Danny Zuko, the leader of the Greasers, the cool guys of Rydell High. Over the summer, he hooks up with Sandy, a plain jain who wins Zuko's heart..for now. Faith, however has other plans. It turns out that Sandy has enrolled at Rydell High. There, Sandy is looking forward to seeing Danny again. However, she is turned off by his school personality. She is also hated by the Pink Ladies, led by tough girl Rizzo (Stockard Channing). However, Danny soon realizes that he has feelings for Sandy, and tries to impress her. Sandy finally gives him a second chance. For a while, the two seem to be going great. But things soon go wrong, and the two break up.<br /><br />Things wrap up pretty predictably, but overall the film is fantastic.<br /><br />Everything about this film is nearly flawless. I'm at a loss for words. This is a movie you must see.

B000AP04L0|5.0|I have to tell you, \\"Office Space\\" is not only one of THE greatest comedies of all time, but the movie itself remains relevant to this day and age, maybe even moreso than when it first came out in 1999...perhaps it was ahead-of-it's time???  That happens.<br /><br />Anyhoo, anyone who sees this comedy will be able to relate, ESPECIALLY if they have ever worked in a dead-end office job...sure, some of it goes over the top, but it's done in such an original and witty way, that it only adds to it's hilariousness, with memorable characters like poor Milton, LOL!!!  None of this ever gets old, and the movie has an overabundance of quotable lines...the essential ingredients of a cult classic, just as I like it.  The US version of the show \\"The Office\\" WISHES it could be as grand as \\"Office Space\\"...<br /><br />Now, this reissue (\\"with flair\\") is perfectly timed, with a wealth of even more good stuff, hilarious packaging, the works....now, if you go to BestBuy and get their exclusive special edition...this is really cool...it comes in a funny mini cardboard file cabinet (you have to see it to believe it), filled with useful and meaningful stuff...besides the nicely packaged DVD (in the file cabinet slipcase), you get a magnet photoholder, red pen + pencil set (with the movie logo on both), a mousepad designed like the uniforms at \\"Chotchkies\\" (overload of pins aka \\"flair\\"), a notepad with the \\"Initech\\" logo as a header, a coffee mug (with the boss and fave quote on it), and and AND?????  Your very own RED STAPLER (with \\"Office Space\\" printed on top), woohoo!!!!  Milton'd be jealous...and you don't have to annoy him or go down to his desert island to get one, YES!!!<br /><br />All in all, just getting this DVD itself is just a must-buy, with all the extras and classic movie (people will be quoting this and watching it regularly in 20 years, guaranteed), but getting this file cabinet is too good for words...meaningful to the movie AND useful (unlike the useless \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of \\"The Big Lebowski\\", which you're better off with just the reissued DVD itself...save the cash)!!!!Edition\\" of \\"The Big Lebowski\\", which you're better off with just the reissued DVD itself...save the cash)!!!!
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Slipknot is my favorite band, and they always will be. For those of you who say they are trash and a worthless excuse for Metal, you are sorely mistaken.    This album captures all of the elements that Slipknot produces in their concerts, with the exception of the visuals and them of course. Tracks like The Nameless, The Heretic Anthem, and The Blister Exists, really show the intensity they have. Ive never seen any other live album sound so good and get such good ratings (With the exception of the Slayer ones, but who wouldnt give Slayer good ratings right?). Bottom line is: If you like good music, and you want to hear, I mean TRULY HEAR, what Slipknot sounds like live then you need to pick this up FAST!

B00000DHR0|5.0|I must confess to being dismayed, at times, when a great artist like Celine Dion has released a 16 song Holiday Collection for Christmas that is the absolute best produced CD ever - and its worth in commerce is less than a hot dog at the ball park. This is a Masterpiece. One you can hand down to your kids, or grandkids - right, a classic. And it never goes out of style because it is a classic! \\"O Holy Night\\" (sung as a duet with the fabulous Andrea Bocelli) is so heartrending along with the magnificent \\"I'm Your Angel\\" (sung as a duet with the great R. Kelly) truly reminds us all of what Christmas is all about. Worth 10 times the prices here....
0792841344|5.0|Today, it is probably hard to describe how brilliant \\"Phantasm\\" seemed in its year of release:  quite simply, there was nothing else like it in the American cinema.  \\"Phantasm\\" is literally a dream put on film; the fact that Don Coscarelli figured out how to put a dream on film so convincingly is part of its brilliance.  It was made for about 20 cents with a cast of unknowns (many of whom became genre stars), and spawned three sequels, but none of the sequels can touch the original.  Michael Baldwin (a terrific kid actor who subsequently disappeared) plays the proverbial youngster who realizes that some seriously weird stuff is going on, where the older, \\"smarter\\" ones don't.  By the time he has convinced his older brother, the menacing \\"Tall Man\\" (\\"Angus Scrimm,\\" real name Lawrence Guy) is on the offensive.  There's more...much more...to it than this, and it is pretty futile trying to synopsize it.  You just have to see it.  This disk is particularly enjoyable because it features so much behind-the-scenes information from the filmmakers.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|that i will purchase new and on the day of its release.  by far the most underrated movie of the last decade.  period.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|\\"Finding Neverland\\" is a fictionalized account of the relationship between Scottish playwright James Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies family that inspired Barrie to write the classic children's story \\"Peter Pan\\". The film was written by David Magee, based on a portion of Allan Knee's play \\"The Man Who Wrote Peter Pan\\" and directed by Marc Forster of \\"Monster's Ball\\" fame.<br /><br />In London, 1904, James Barrie (Johnny Depp) is a playwright in need of fresh ideas. Walking his dog in the park one day, he meets a young widow, Sylvia Llewelyn Davies (Kate Winslet), and her four sons, George, Jack, Peter, and Michael. The boy's playfulness and earnestness fire James' imagination, and he makes regular trips to the park to spend time with them. This unusual relationship with the boys and their mother raises a few eyebrows, including those of James' wife, Mary (Radha Mitchell), and Sylvia's socially conscious mother, Mme. du Maurier (Julie Christie). But James is quite fond of Sylvia and her sons, and the boys become a sort of muse. Peter (Freddie Highmore), a thoughtful, melancholy child still grieving the loss of his father, lends his name to \\"Peter Pan\\", as James writes the fanciful play about \\"the irrepressible spirit of youth\\".<br /><br />\\"Finding Neverland\\", although fictionalized, is an interesting exploration of the creative process: How James Barrie's own childhood and those of the Llewelyn Davies children were translated into art -into a play whose popularity seems endless. This is a \\"period\\" film, but not really conventional. Gemma Jackson's production design and Roberto Schaefer's cinematography are striking from the film's first minutes. \\"Finding Neverland\\" is part period drama, part tear-jerker, and part children's fantasy. The fantasy sequences are spare and skillfully blended into the film to avoid being overbearing or incongruous. The cast is impressive. Johnny Depp conveys the perfect blend of maturity and playfulness necessary to make us charmed, instead of bewildered, by James Barrie's carrying on with the children. Barrie's rapport with those kids is palpable. Julie Christie's role as Sylvia's uptight mother is small but crucial and wonderfully articulated. Dustin Hoffman is the skeptical, sensible theatrical producer, who thankfully has a sense of humor. \\"Finding Neverland\\" injects humor in just the right places, so it never becomes leaden, even when the drama turns serious.<br /><br />This is a beautiful film to look at, and its oscillations between playful and serious, reality and fantasy, prevent the story from ever stagnating. An embellished story about the creation of \\"Peter Pan\\" won't appeal to everyone, but I can't imagine anyone doing it better than \\"Finding Neverland\\". And I never could stand \\"Peter Pan\\", so that's not a qualification to enjoy this movie.<br /><br />The DVD (Miramax 2005 release): Bonus features include 3 mini-documentaries, 3 deleted scenes with optional commentary, outtakes (5 minutes), and an audio commentary. \\"The Magic of Finding Neverland\\" (15 minutes) is a general \\"making-of\\" piece featuring interviews with cast, producers, and director Marc Forster. This includes some discussion of various versions of \\"Peter Pan\\" and the actor's careers. \\"Creating Neverland\\" (3 minutes) is about the film's visual effects. \\"On the Red Carpet\\" (2 minutes) features interviews with cast, producers, and even Hilary Clinton, on the red carpet at the film's various premieres. The audio commentary by director Marc Forster, producer Richard Gladstein, and writer David Magee is the most worthwhile of the bonus features. It's not scripted, but the commentary is full of information. The three men discuss everything that comes to mind for each scene, and in doing so manage to cover many facets of the film and its history. They talk about filming, cast, locations, technical stuff, and writer David Magee compares the events depicted in the film to Allan Knee's play, his script, and the real story of James Barrie and the Llewelyn Davies family.

B000BEZPQE|5.0|Normally when you have 8 guys with instruments on stage it's called ska.  These guys are probably cooler than any ska band, but I don't discriminate on the basis of musical genres.  Good music comes in all forms.  Metal?  Macabre?  This one just happens to involve a lot of sideshow masks and whatnot.  Their music is still awesome, moving. <br /> <br />I must confess as many shows as I've seen, I still think these guys put on a cool relaxing show.  Few slowdowns, little dead air, no dead songs.  All this creates unnecessary tension.  Their shows are 1 big release.  An hour goes by in no time. I hate seeing one hit wannabes.  These guys are 20+ hit train wreck. Puts Ozzy, Slayer, Kiss, Cooper, etc. to shame.  <br /> <br />In the end they're just 9 humbly polite guys from Iowa trying to make beautiful music to keep their families happy.  Kind of like Eminem, but relevant and fun.  And the fans are always way cool in looking out for each other...
B0009W5K0Y|3.0|I caught the end of Paramore's set when they played at the Fox Theater in Detroit. I only heard a few songs, but it was enough for me to buy their cd. The lead singer has a very compelling, strong voice. The song \\"My Heart\\" is particuarly attention-grabbing; in fact it's the reason I bought the cd. Unfortunately it loses a little bit of its immediacy when not played live.  <br /> <br />I was very surprised to discover that the band is rather young. I would have guess them to be older, judging from the mature sound of the lead vocalist.  <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this cd to anyone looking for a new band to listen to.
B0009K7QZ8|1.0|I'm disappointed that The OC S2 wasn't as good as the first.  <br /> <br />Firstly, Josh Schwartz is going to have a hell bad time trying to think up more dramatic ideas for this drama series, because the thing is, he already used all of it for S2!  <br /> <br />Season 2 was just this ordinary TV Show with DRAMA DRAMA DRAMA! every 5 seconds...which doesn't pull us into the show much since the whole season goes past without looking into the problems \\"The Fantastic Four\\" faces.  <br /> <br />It's like, \\"OH MY GOD what'll happen to Alex and Marissa?\\" and by the time you're trying to figure it all out, Alex departs so immediately (and she decides that ALL in the last 10 minutes of an episode, I'll tell you) and we'll never remember who she was. Buh-bye Miss Kelly! <br /> <br />In Season 1, there was the chemistry...the good acting...and some drama which seemed, very realistic. Season 2 is just a scrabbled mush of sloppy drama episodes. Not only is that bad...but it puts off almost everyone seeing \\"The OC\\" for the first time, right from Season 2.  <br /> <br />I am hoping Season 3 will be better than the first, and I hope it'll make me want to actually WATCH it.
B00005AWMF|5.0|SADE IS AN ANGEL ON EARTH,SO BEYOND WOMAN.THIS ALBUM IS A MASTER PEACE.
B000002TP7|5.0|I came to beastie boys on the back of vague recommendations from a mate, not knowing what to expect. Initially, i got licensed to ill, which i enjoyed for what it is, but it was not the stuff i had been recommended. I moved to check your head, and was pleasantly surprised at songs like pass the mic, so what'cha want, live at pjs. Since then, I have been ABSOLUTELY blown away by this album. There is no other album i know of that combines punk-rock, metal, acid jazz, funk, world beats, and hip-hop, in the same album, sometimes even in the same song. And it makes for a great mix. <br /> <br />Not only is this album a great mix of styles, but it is produced crisply, with the vocals mixed down slightly to become an accompaniment to the rest of the instruments, synths blending seamlessly in and out of the music, and the tribal beats laying the foundation for some great songs. The beasties manage to record and mix accordingly for the style of each song style they attempt. <br /> <br />And they attempt a lot. Songs like 'The Update', 'Futterman's Rule' are a psychedelic funk-fest, with tribal world beats as a backbone,synths everywhere and funky guitar licks, i cant help but love them. Songs like 'Sabotage' and 'Heart Attack Man' make for a change of pace, with great punk metal riffs, and fast heavy drum beats. My personal favourite simply for its ingenuity and awesome sound is flute loop; who else but the Beasties could take a folk sounding flute riff, and bring it into the hip-hop world with funky beats, mad scratches and mad lyrics? No one, thats who. <br /> <br />Ultimately, there is something here for a fan of every type of music.I recommend this album to anyone who loves funk, punk, hip-hop, or jazz. <br /> <br />My recommendations are: <br />The Update, <br />Futterman's Rule, <br />Flute Loop, <br />Sure Shot, <br />Heart Attack Man, <br />B-Boys making with the Freak Freak. <br /> <br />Enjoy.
B000002AHC|5.0|This is considered the last album by the Byrds Mach I (the original lineup), and by many, their best.  Though I acknowledge other albums (Tamborine Man, Younger than Yesterday) as being finer albums, this is my favorite.  A perfect Sunday morning album, it is the most whimsical, most mixed, most dreamy, most pop, and most memorable of the Byrds great albums.  Unfortunately, by the time it was finished, only two original members remained.  After that, we got some great country music, but the band wasn't itself again. <br /> <br />\\"Artificial Energy\\" is a flashy pop song with questionable subject matter and is flipsided by its follower \\"Goin' Back,\\" perhaps the Byrds most tender moment.  There are several great folk & country songs, like \\"Change is Now,\\" but the most brilliant moments are the Moog synthesizer songs; the spacy numbers (\\"Dolphin's Smile,\\" \\"Natural Harmony,\\" etc.)  And \\"Old John Robertson\\" is a great Chris Hillman country tune that more than nods at Beatles tunes like \\"A Day in the Life.\\"  Thematically, it may not be as complex as \\"Sgt. Pepper,\\"  but I think its just as enjoyable and pays the same amount of attention to detail.  A Classic headphone album. <br /> <br />Overall:  10 out of 10.
B00097DXZS|5.0|This is an amazing CD!  Santana has gathered together another stellar line-up, but the true stars are Carlos and his guitar!  CHeck out \\"Trinity\\", an instrumental featuring Santana, Metallica guitarist Kirk Hammett and guitar virtuoso Robert Randolph!

B00009Z574|4.0|Released in 1978, this stylistically diverse album reflects the different directions that the individual members of the band were heading in at the end of the 1970s. For example, the relatively short pieces on Tormato range from the pastoral ambience of the harpsichord and classical guitar heavy \\"Madrigal\\", to the sophisticated hard rock of \\"Release, Release\\" (complete with a cheering stadium-sized crowd during Alan Whites \\"live\\" drum solo), to the excellent progressive rock of \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\", which closes the original album. As a bassist who was heavily influenced by Chris Squire (not only did I go out and buy a Rickenbacker 4003, I learned all of the Yes pieces note for note as a teenager), I can't help but admire how tightly linked Squire and percussionist Alan White are on this album. It is just extraordinary. Speaking of Squire, I was thrilled with his playing on the album, which seems a little looser than on previous outings and within this context sounds extremely aggressive. I also liked the tweaking of his already distinctive bass tone including the harmonization of his Rickenbacker bass and the use of a very trebly \\"Ricky\\"-sounding Gibson Thunderbird bass on the rocking \\"Release, Release\\". Steve Howe's playing is also excellent throughout - then again I can't imagine him playing poorly! Overall, the highlights of the album include Squires dreamy and excellent \\"Onward\\", along with the muscular \\"On the Silent Wings of Freedom\\", \\"Future Times/Rejoice\\", \\"Arriving UFO\\", \\"Madrigal\\", and \\"Don't Kill the Whale\\". If I had to cite the album's shortcomings, it might include the overwhelmingly busy production. In addition, some of the synthesizers that Rick Wakeman used on the recording including the Polymoog and the Birotron (it is like a mellotron yet uses 8-tracks) did not produce the nicest sounds and he reportedly kicked his Birotron off the stage during a live performance. All in all, while this album may not measure up to works like Close to the Edge (1972), it is still an excellent album for it's time. Rhino did a superb job of remastering this album, although I could have done without the bonus tracks - many of which are quite poor.he Edge (1972), it is still an excellent album for it's time.

B000ANVQ0K|4.0|The 3-disc edition released in the USA is great.  The sound is great, the picture quality is great, and the extra features are great...except - no trailer.  How can you have a special edition with no trailer?  That is the only thing keeping this set from being 5 stars.
B000002J1L|5.0|Released in 1971, this is the first album with the \\"classic\\" Genesis lineup and the first to feature the distinctive ensemble sound that would characterize their work up to late 1976.<br /><br />What is particularly noticeable about some of the longer pieces on this album including \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" is an aggressive and harsh sound that is largely reflected in Steve Hackett's guitar work.  Although I do not know this for certain, I suspect that this heaviness may have resulted from exposure to the music of fellow Charisma label band Van der graaf Generator while on \\"package\\" tours in Britain.<br /><br />One other new element that helped shape the classic Genesis sound was the addition of superb drummer Phil Collins, who brought a superior level of musicianship to the band that the previous drummer (John Mayhew) was not able to.  As such, the use of unusual time signatures increased and the ensemble work became a bit more sophisticated over that found on Trespass (1970).  Other interesting developments include the use of the mellotron by keyboardist Tony Banks, an instrument which is featured prominently on \\"Seven Stones\\" and the excellent \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\", a piece that Tony wrote while studying physics at Sussex University.  Quieter pieces on the album include \\"For Absent Friends\\" (which features Phil Collins on vocals) and \\"Harlequin\\", while \\"Harold the Barrel\\" is somewhere in the middle.<br /><br />Interestingly enough, Tony Banks has been quoted as saying he did not feel that Nursery Cryme was much of an improvement over Trespass (1970).  Although this may only hold partially true musically, conceptually and lyrically this is a completely different story.  With regard to the lyrics, the cosmic and surreal imagery that would dominate the Peter Gabriel years was first expressed on Nursery Cryme.  For example, \\"Return of the Giant Hogweed\\" describes (in anthropomorphic terms) how the invasive wetland plant species Heracleum mantegazziani (giant hogweed) threatens to take over the countryside.  As a biologist, the thought of an invasive plant (that grows to 15-20 feet in height) shouting, \\"Human bodies soon will know our anger. Kill them with your Hogweed hairs!\\" tickled me pink.<br /><br />Other bizarre imagery includes a young boy that ages suddenly, dies, and his spirit then takes up residence in a musical box belonging to his playmate.  Consumed by a \\"lifetimes worth of desires\\", the spirit of \\"young Henry\\" lunges at the girl, only to have the nanny rush into the room and destroy the musical box, thus killing poor Henry.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album that initiates a four-year period where Genesis was at a creative and artistic peak.  Although the production quality is somewhat muddy, and it does not possess the polish and sophistication of \\"Selling England by the Pound\\" (1973), this is still an excellent album and is recommended.iant hogweed) threatens to take over the countryside.

B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is an entertaining movie that has good action and gimmicks.  There is really not a lot of depth, but these type of movies don't need a lot of depth.  Here's why it's a 5 stay film: <br /> <br />1) The overall story is interesting and flows very well. <br />2) A number of top notch actors give good performances. <br />3) The movie stays on track in doesn't get side tracked by focusing too much on a particular villian, as some of the previous Batman movies did. <br />4) Christian Bale is one of the best Batmans we've seen.  He comes across as a legitimate Bruce Wayne, someone who is a little secretive but who we can still get to know.  I always felt that Val Kilmer was too aloof and Michael Keaton doesn't seem tough enough. <br />5) The special effects are very good. <br /> <br />All in all, there's a lot to like about this film.  I's one of the most fun movies to watch of this year.  Just be prepared for fun and action, because you're not going to get a real deep drama.

B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This movie is a good purchase selection for anyone with kids between the ages of 5-15.  Adults will enjoy this movie as well.  This movie has all the typical uncomfortable high school situations (other than graphc sexual situations)that make you remember the often stressful days of high school.  You know, moments like when you're called in front of gym class to perform some task in front of everyone; when you have a crush; or even when you just ride the bus on the first day and have to make new friends. <br /> <br />The super hero side is really an interesting twist.  They could've made the same movie with the young star trying to live up to his Dad's legacy in football, but instead they took the approach of having a young man who's father is a great super hero.  Add in a fun plot and you have a movie that the whole family can enjoy. <br /> <br />The young actors/actresses do fine, but Kurt Russell really shines in his role.  He was perfectly cast, as was Kelly Preston as the superhero-in-her-own-right wife. <br /> <br />The movie's theme is basically that we're all important and we should respect all of our peers.  This was a fun movie with a nice message.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.
B00004RFFS|5.0|okay this movie was on the mark with the book. and I equally love both. Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt, Kirsten Dunst, Antonio Banderas, etc al. all gave a stunning performance. I'd recommend it for everyone who loves Anne Rice, or just loves vampire movies in general.
B000001ESJ|5.0|This (I believe) is like the 4th Rush album and while it's only <br />6 songs and only a little over 30 minutes long it is one of their best albums. It features classics like \\"Xanadu\\" and <br />\\"Closer to the Heart.\\" Xanadu is one of my favorite Rush songs, an 11 minute masterpiece. The lyrics still weren't where they are now (they're still brillaint, just more steered towards science fiction stuff) and Geddy Lee sounds like a mouse on helium; but this album is amazing. Here's the tracks: <br />1. A Farewell to Kings-4/5-Good song. The guitar stands out most. <br />2. Xanadu-5/5-One of Rush's best songs. The drumming is outstanding; the song is just so f**king cool! <br />3. Closer to the Heart-5/5-The guitar solo is great. <br />4. Cinderella Man-5/5-Lyrics by Geddy Lee. Very catchy song. <br />5. Madrigal-4/5-The worst song on the album, but not really bad. A little dungeons-and-dragonsish lyrics. <br />6. Cygnus X-1-5/5-Great song. While this is one of their best, <br />Cygnus X-1 Book II Hemispheres on the album \\"Hemispheres\\" is better. <br />A.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I remember last spring when I was watching an episode of Saturday Night Live, and the episode had Don Pardo announcing, \\"On May 7th, Johnny Knoxville with musical guest System of a Down\\". And I said, \\"Really?\\" I can't remember when the last time was that SNL had a metal act for a musical guest, but that and other factors led me to check out SOAD's latest, Mezmerize.<br /><br />After the mini-intro comes the first single, \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" (ahhhh...wholesome anti-Bush music). I find it very hard to believe that people think this is the weakest song on the album; that is, unless those people are pro-war activists. All arguments aside, though, this song really made me understand why people say that Daron Malakian is one of the greatest guitarists out right now (note to another reviewer: Serj plays keyboards and Daron plays guitar, not the other way around). And energetic musical backdrops can also be found in songs like \\"Violent Pornography\\" and \\"Question!\\"<br /><br />Sadly, even great music can't make up for sub-par songwriting in some cases. \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is too weird for its own good, and \\"Cigaro\\" is the stupidest thing I've ever heard. \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\" is also rather odd.<br /><br />Oh, well; there is still other good stuff to find, like \\"Sad Statue\\". And the obligatory end-of-album mellow song \\"Lost In Hollywood\\" does comes off nicely. Some people might be mad that this album is a little more commercial than System's other albums (even though they didn't change their style at all), while others might be mad at the price considering it's a 36-minute album, but Mezmerize basically does just that.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B000002I2M|5.0|I know a lot of people who consider this the best Doors album. This album produced my favorite Doors song (Love Her Madly) butit's not the best Doors album. This, album, like \\"The Soft Parade\\" except much better is experimental. It's a little more bluesy, Morrison's voice has gone a lot deeper since the first album. The lyrics are great. There's really nothing wrong with this album. Here are the tracks: <br />1. The Changeling-5/5-Lyrics and keyboards are great. The best thing about the lyrics is that they're true. <br />2. Love Her Madly-5/5-Probably my favorite Doors song. It's just so catchy and cool. I love the lyrics, they're funny though. (Don't you love her madly? Wanna be her daddy?) <br />3. Been Down So Long-4/5-\\"Well I've been down so godd@mn long. That it looks like up to me.\\" This is probably a great song for a man about to kill himself...Or hire a french doctor to sign his death certificate and escape to Africa. <br />4. Cars Hiss by My Window-4/5-(No Comment) <br />5. L.A. Woman-5/5-Killer song. Mr. Mojo Risin' (for those of you who haven't figured it out) is an anagram for Jim Morrison's name. This is a great song. <br />6. L'America-4/5-Good song. Catchy. <br />7. Hyacinth House-5/5-This song is great. <br />8. Crawling King Snake-5/5-A great cover song. Brings to mind \\"Back Door Man.\\" <br />9. The WASP (Texas Radio & The Big Beat)-4/5-I don't really like the song, but the chorus is good. <br />10. Riders on the Storm-5/5-Beautiful song. The keyboards are great, lyrics are great. <br />A

IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THREE CHEERS, THEY ARE ALL ANSWERED IN BULLETS. TWO SONGS FROM BULLETS MAKE UP THREE CHEERS. DROWNING LESSONS AND DEMOLITION LOVERS ARE THE BASIS FOR THREE CHEERS. TRUST ME YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED!
B0002GTWYW|5.0|easily the best cd i own. the lyrcis and beats on every song are crazy. most of the best songs are not the famous ones like big popa and juicy. they're good, but who shot ya, machine gun funk, and expecially gimme the loot are just as good if not better. if you have any kind of rap collection, you have to have this cd. its still in heavy rotation in my car and its been at least 8 months since i bought it. its gonna piss a lot of people off, but i say he's better then 2pac.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Mr Whedon rocks.  He has a solid grasp of sci-fi that is rarely seen these days.  His writing is splendid.  While an action adventure, it is also a romance, a drama, comedy, just everything all together in one great show or movie.  But the writing.  This guy writes poetry.  And he makes you think without shoving down your throat.  Layers to Mr Whedon.  More please.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|I have never bought any Diana Krall music. I have a friend that has every release and I have heard some. Enough to make me think about buying some myself but I can't seem to get over the insulting manipulation. I enjoy a looker as much as the next guy and Diana is certainly that. But this picture on a Christmas collection is the ultimate in misguided manipulation. Instead of getting me to buy the CD, I decided not to just because of it. Mostly because I feel that they were attempting a cheap come on to get superficial people to make the leap. Well, I'm insulted by that.
B000005IU1|4.0|Originally unleashed in 1969, as this self-titled was the Stooge's debut effort. Proto-punk with no compromise whatsoever. It's easy to tell that this Detroit band had many influences, just to name a few are The Troggs, Kingsmen, The Who, Yardbirds and especially The Doors. Tracks of this classic release I'm not likely to grow tired of soon are \\"1969\\", his signature piece (well, sort of) \\"I Wanna Be Your Dog\\" (I've heard this covered by several bands and NO one does plays it quite like Iggy does), \\"No Fun\\", the ten-minute slammin' \\"We Will Fall\\" and \\"Little Doll\\". Heard that another label had reissued this title as a Deluxe 2-CD pressing. Very nice. A must-have.
B000000WFU|5.0|We are singing Adiemus at school with a choir of 6 for our Rememberence Service at school. We mixed up the arrangment, and have boys singing the Alto parts and a girl singing the bass, although it sounds like it wouldn't work, it sounds amazing! <br />I find this song really easy to listen to because it doesn't have any real words and it just flows over you. <br />I'd never really heard of this music before and so haven't listened to any other albums but I seriously suggest getting this!
B0000033P0|4.0|Review no. 60. Originally released in 1971, as 'Tarkus' is the follow-up to the self-titled debut (aka the Dove album-see my review). Some fans may not remember this reissue all that well. I know that I rarely pull it out for a spin. I mean, simply too many great CD's to check out all the time. Impressive tracks include the opener, the twenty-minute \\"Tarkus Medley\\", the rarely played live \\"Bitches Crystal\\" (that features some of Greg Lake's rather dark lyrics) and possibly the reissue's most rocking cut \\"Are You Ready Eddy?\\". Most definitely a '70's progressive classic. A should-have.
B000AU9UYC|5.0|I purchased this DVD and I have to say that it rocks! I loved the storytelling of the movie which chronacles Batman's early days which includes his training and his travels. I also liked the action that was featured in the movie(especially the train scene near the end of the movie). <br /> <br />This movie showcases Batman as he was meant to be seen:Dark, Brooding, and totally commited to the pursuit of justice. <br /> <br />Any Batman or comic book fan sould purchase this DVD.
0226264211|4.0|\\"Personally I'm in favor of democracy, which means that the central institutions in the society have to be under popular control. A democracy where people have a say over decisions TO THE EXTENT they are affected by those decisions.   Now, under capitalism we can't have democracy by definition. Capitalism is a system in which the central institutions of society are in principle under autocratic control. Thus, a corporation or an industry is, if we were to think of it in political terms, fascist; that is, it has tight control at the top and strict obedience has to be established at every level -- there's a little bargaining, a little give and take, but the line of authority is perfectly straightforward.     Just as I'm opposed to political fascism, I'm opposed to economic fascism. I think that until major institutions of society are under the popular control of participants and communities, it's pointless to talk about democracy. Participatory economics (PARECON) is the way to go.I'd love to see centralized power eliminated, whether it's the state or the economy, and have it diffused and ultimately under direct control of the participants. Moreover, I think that's entirely realistic. Every bit of evidence that exists (there isn't much) seems to show, for example, that workers' control increases efficiency.     A corporation is a form of private tyranny. Its directors have a responsibility to increase profit and market share, not to do good works. If they fail that responsibility, they will be removed. They have some latitude for public relations purposes, and the talk about corporate responsibility falls within that territory. But it makes no sense to regard them as benevolent institutions, freed from their institutional role. It is a public responsibility to enforce decent behavior.   What is called \\"globalization\\" is a specific form of international integration, designed and instituted for particular purposes. There are many possible alternatives. This particular form happens to be geared to the interests of private power, manufacturing corporations and financial institutions, closely linked to powerful states. Effects on others are incidental. Sometimes they happen to be beneficial, often not.     What is called \\"free trade\\" has highly protectionist elements. What is at issue are investor rights agreements, not free trade. The protestors, including the AFL-CIO, have good reasons to oppose investor rights agreements that insist on very high protection for property rights (often resulting, in fact, from taxpayer subsidy), but little or no protection for the rights of flesh-and-blood people, including rights of working people -- both in the US and in other countries. That's not oppostion to \\"free trade.\\" It is worth remembering that the press has refused even to permit the official positions of the labor movement to appear. Thus during the NAFTA debate, the labor movement had a clearly developed position, not opposed to a NAFTA, but opposed to this particular version. Its analysis and proposals happened to be rather similar to those of Congress's own research bureau, the Office of Technology Assessment. But while the labor movement was constantly berated on false grounds, its actual position was never reported. The observation generalizes.     There was a brief experiment, a very brief experiment, with something more or less like capitalism, not really but partially, really free markets, and it was such a total catastrophe that business called it off because it couldn't survive, and there were moves in the late 19th century to overcome these radical market failures and they led to various forms of concentration of capital: trusts, cartels, and others, and the one that emerged was the corporation in its modern form. Soon after corporations were granted rights by the courts. They gave them the rights of persons, meaning they have the right of freedom of speech, they can propagandize freely, advertise, they run elections and so on, and they have the protection from inspection by the state authorities which means that just as the police technically can't go into your apartment and read your papers, the public can't find out what's going on inside these totalitarian entities.   They're mostly unaccountable to the public. Of course they are not real persons, they are immortal, they are collectivist legal entities. In fact they are very similar to other organizational forms we know and are one of the forms of totalitarianism that developed in the 20th century. The others were destroyed, these still exist, and later they were required by law to be what we would call pathological in the case of real human beings.So they are required legally to maximize power and profit no matter what effect that has on anyone else. They are required to externalize costs, so if they can get the public or future generations to pay their costs, they are required to do that. It would be illegal for corporate executives to do anything else.   By now, in what are called trade agreements, which have nothing much to do with trade, corporations are granted rights that go way beyond the rights of persons. They are granted the right of what's called \\"national treatment.\\" Persons don't have that right. Like if a Mexican comes to New York, he can't claim national treatment, but if General Motors goes to Mexico, it can claim national treatment. In fact corporations can even sue states, which you and I can't do.So they're granted rights way beyond persons.   They are immortal, they are extraordinarily powerful, they are pathological by legal requirement, and that's the contemporary form of totalitarianism. They are not truly competitive, they are linked to one another. So Siemens and IBM and Toshiba carry out joint projects. They rely heavily on state power; the dynamism of the modern economy comes mostly out of the state sector, inot the private sector. Almost every aspect of what's called the \\"New Economy\\" is developed and designed at public cost and public risk: computers, electronics generally, telecommunications, the internet, lasers, whatever...Take radio. Radio was designed by the US Navy.   Mass production, modern mass production was developed in armories. If you go back to a century ago, the major problems of electrical and mechanical engineering had to do with how to place a huge gun on a moving platform, namely a ship, designing it to be able to hit a moving object, another ship, so naval gunnery.   That was the most advanced problem in metallurgy, electrical and mechanical engineering, and so on. England and Germany put huge efforts into it, the United States less so. Out of associated innovations comes the automotive industry, and so on and so forth. In fact, it's very hard to find anything in the economy that doesn't rely critically on the state sector.   People like Friedman often talk about how \\"things have improved\\" under capitalism. One could say the same thing about slavery. A slave in 1850 was better off than a slave in 1750.Is that a justification for slavery?   After 1917 Russia underwent very significant economic growth, is that a justification for bolshevism?   Throughout the 30's Hitler was probably the most popular leader in German history. He understood (like the US during WW2) that massive state expenditures can rescue a morbid capital economy from collapse. The economy was booming and Germans were living a lot better. Is that a justification for fascism?\\"     It's obvious that you know very little about economic facts.  In a free market with private property rights (which themselves are nothing more than a natural extension of personal property and individual rights), businesses and all individuals only make a profit from providing people's wants and needs.  Corporations may have a duty to shareholders, but that duty is ultimately to create good products that people will actually buy with their own hard-earned money.  Capitalism (which itself is nothing more than a system of individual rights) as a result is democratic, because those companies that help the most people are the ones that get a profit.  Compare this to all other forms where people are forced to pay and work for someone or something irregardless of whether hold up their end of the bargain (like how Americans are forced to huge taxes to public school systems despite a constantly iferior performance when compared to private \\"capitalist\\" schools that spend far less on each student, yet perform a superior job).  Capitalism works by trade and consumer demand.  Not the other way around.  And businesses can't drive a competitor out who may provide for consumers more, unless it has the government impose regulations and other such things upon the competitors.    You're right that many free trade agreements aren't really \\"free trade\\", but this is the fault of the state the those that often do democratically elect them (kind of like how people democratically elected Bill Clinton twice, who actually signed the NAFTA), not of the actual free market.  Consumers acting freely often have greater control over the economy than participants in a democracy.  Plus, participants in a democracy aren't often aware of the things that a business has to cope with, such as the actual transaction costs, scarcity, and other things.  If workers' directly controlling a business actually was more efficient, then they would be far more successful and famous than Wal-Mart, Ford, and others (due to consumer demand), but the simple fact is that all humans aren't created equal.  Sure we should have equal treatment under the law, but we all have different skills, abilities, knowledge of certain costs that relate to decisions, different ways of organizing our time, etc.    Also, fascism (an offshoot of socialism) destroyed much of the German economy during the 1930's and 40's.  The reason Hitler was so popular was because he was able to find a scapegoat in many groups, including Jews (many of whomwere capitalist businessmen) rather than the State itself.  Also, while Milton Friedman is right in many respects, it was largely incomplete.  The Austrians tended to fare better though as one of Mland those of you decrying things like the WTO, IMF, and other such things that have caused economic instability the world over, those things are State, not market institutions.  They are a result of interventionism, not laissez-faire.         As for not having democracy in capitalism.  Full, unfettered economic democracy results in the absolute loss of civil liberties as well as the loss of a distribution of responsibility and power, thus creating a plutocracy.  The people cannot control and run a government that they have given the power to control and run them instead.  Pure social democracy is inherently illogical and impossible.         Friedman isn't without his faults though.  His school-voucher scheme is just plain market-socialism really that has helped destroy the independence of many private schools and he has nothing but kind words to say about the Federal Reserve and the banking industry as all Chicagoites do.  This is where the Austrian school of economics fares much better.  Ron Paul himself, a presidential candidate has gained immense popularity for pointing out he destructive nature of the Federal Reserve on the poor and middle classes.  Let us also not forget that it was the Chicagoites that gave us the witholding tax, so that us workers can't see how much of each of our pay check is actually taken out each month.  Sadly, much of Milton Friedman's ideas have been somewhat distrous to say the least.  A much better treatise to read on capitalism is would be one of the following:    Man, Economy, and State with Power and Market by Murray N. Rothbard  Human Action by Ludwig von Mises  Healing our World in an Age of Aggression by Dr. Mary J. Ruwart
B00097DXZS|5.0|It's amazing to see Santana now 30+ years after his breakout record, still make great music. All That I Am is as good, if not better, than his last two albums, and the guests make it even better. Carlos's guitar playing is as fluid and graceful as ever, proving that he doesn't just rest on his laurels. \\"Trinity\\" with Metallica's Kirk Hammett and pedal steel whiz, Robert Randolph are worth the album price alone. you will not be dissapointed.
B000002UAU|5.0|It goes without saying that Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is a widely regarded classic and one of the most influential and culturally affecting works-of-art of all time.  At the time of its release, Sgt. Pepper turned the music world on its ear and while the quality of this LP can be questioned and compared to other Beatles releases, none of them carry the historical significance that Sgt. Pepper does.  The mere range of styles on display is enough to make the album noteworthy but to add to that, the songs here are among the most memorable pop gems of all time.  From the \\"live,\\" rocking title track and its companion piece \\"With a Little Help From My Friends,\\" the perfect Ringo song, to the pure psychedelia of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" and the clanging pop joy of \\"Getting Better,\\" The Beatles have already displayed more genius and sonic experimentation than most bands could ever dream of.  The most miraculous part is that all the various sounds and styles, from the straight rock n' roll of the theme song reprise to the circus themed \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" don't clash when lined up together and never sound even the slightest bit pretentious.  The sonic collages that are so expertly assembled here sound effortless, as if The Beatles had been doing this since the beginning of time.  Case in point, the magnificent \\"A Day In The Life,\\" a two-part song (half Lennon, half McCartney) fused together by an apocalyptic orchestra to provide one of the most thrilling listens to be found in any genre of music.  With Sgt. Pepper, The Beatles opened up the world of rock to an infinite number of possibilities but since its release no one has been able to surpass Sgt. Pepper's fearless sense of exploration or amazing coherency, not even The Beatles.
B0002NRRAG|3.0|Great elevator music - unless you listen closely you may just think that the CD is one long song.  Madeleine has an uncanny knack of making substantially disparate songs sound the same. What was her producer thinking? I can't imagine. Like I said this is good backround music if you are in a mellow mood.  The anology to Billy Holliday is ridiculous.  Madeleine's voice is pleasant and the compositions do not offend,  but unless musical homgeny is something you seek out do yourself a favor and spend your money elsewhere.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Yes, it's graphic violence, something I don't ordinarily watch, however the artistry in which it was done can only be paralelled to perhaps, \\"The Silence of the Lambs\\" and \\"The Cell\\", yet also like stepping into the pages of a comic book. <br />  Correctly done in black and white, for the most part, this movie gives prime examples of hypothetical situations where one might decide to take justice into their own hands. <br />  The casting is outstanding, the women exotically beautiful, unlike the typical barbie dolls who are usually cast into rolls of this type. <br />  This movie is a winning example of retro mingling with modern and doing it very successfully. I do not recommend this movie to anyone who can't stand graphic violence. I myself may never watch it again, although it is a most brilliant piece of work. I'd dub it a cult classic upon release.
B000B5XOY8|4.0|In the wake of the current Batman revival, courtesy of Christopher Nolan's excellent Batman Begins, I've revisited the older films except for 1997's utterly dreadful Batman and Robin which I cannot stand more than 30 minutes of. I've just acquired the new special editions of Tim Burton's two Batman films and they are most impressive. The disc has nice extras particularly a fasincating documentary on the history of Batman in the comics, and a thorough documentary which chronicles the making of the movie. Seeing Burton's 1989 film again, I can't hold it in as high regard as I once did. Seeing it as a nine-year-old, it was an earth-shattering movie, but now with my older, more experienced eye  I can see its many flaws. I guess my main complaint is the lack of a really compelling story. The beginning of the movie is great, and the end is great. But the middle really sags a bit and the narrative consists of nothing more than a series of vignettes.<br /><br />However, I've always liked Michael Keaton as Batman and Bruce Wayne, and of course Jack Nicholson owns the movie as the Joker. I think Nicholson manages to find just the right mixture of danger and humor that is essential to the character. Nicholson's Joker ends up being the film's biggest asset, and probably the main reason why it is so highly regarded. There's also an excellent supporting cast including Kim Basinger, Michael Gough, Billy Dee Williams, Robert Wuhl, and Pat Hingle. Jack Palance is excellent (briefly) as crime boss Carl Grissom, and Star Wars veteran William Hootkins is suitably slimy as corrupt Lieutenant Eckhardt. Another thing I like about the movie is the way it often feels like a 1940s gangster movie, particularly in the first half.<br /><br />Of course, the production design is a marvel as well. Anton Furst created a Gotham City that is truly unique and not recognizable as any city on Earth. It feels like a city from the 1940s or '50s, yet it has contemporary aspects as well. I like the fact that it's not completely grounded in reality or any specific time period. Another asset that truly brings the movie to another level is Danny Elfman's classic score. Elfman's music is so closely associated with the Batman character that it's hard to seperate the two. The excellent Elfman score was one thing I really missed about Batman Begins. I think this score is one of the all-time great movie scores.<br /><br />Ultimately, Batman was a big-studio Hollywood summer movie. Director Burton was forced to make some concessions so the studio would be guaranteed a hit. I don't think that Tim Burton was able to make the movie that he truly wanted to make. I also don't think that he was really comfortable at the helm of a movie this size. It was, after all, only his third feature film as a director. He had never worked with a huge budget before and he had never done action scenes before. I think he was sort of feeling his way through, and some of the movie's flaws can be explained as a result. However, the 1992 sequel Batman Returns improves, in my opinion, on the 1989 movie in many ways and I think it's the better movie. With Batman Returns, Burton was given free creative control and it undeniably bears his distinct stamp. I see Batman as a conventional big-studio movie that Burton did his best with, but Batman Returns is a true Tim Burton movie with his imagination and visual genius free to run wild. However, Batman is still a great cinematic introduction to Bob Kane's classic character.letely grounded in reality or any specific time period.

B0002KVUKM|5.0|The year is 1887, and the villagers are storming Frankenstein castle with torches and pitchforks in a scene that lets you know exactly what sort of movie you're watching. \\"Van Helsing\\" is a popcorn movie, pure and simple, inspired particularly by the classic horror films of Universal Studios, with a Hammer Studios style (especially \\"Captain Kronos - Vampire Hunter\\"), and a little James Bond and \\"Vampire Hunter D\\" thrown in. The villagers in question are Transylvanians, their anger ignited by the evil experiment taking place in the castle at the hands of Dr. Frankenstein himself, and under the watchful eye of his evil benefactor, Count Vladislaus Dracula. For reasons yet unknown to the viewer, Count Dracula has been sponsoring Dr. Frankenstein's efforts to harness the life-giving power of electricity in the form of a monster constructed from the bodies of 7 dead men. However, once the experiment is a success, the two-faced count lets his true nature show. Frankenstein's reluctance to allow his creation to be used for evil forces Dracula to put the bite on him (ouch, sorry). This disturbs the now living Frankenstein creature, who knocks Dracula into the fireplace with a piece of laboratory equipment and storms out of the castle with his father in his arms.<br /><br />Van Helsing Rule Number One: Fire doesn't work on Dracula.<br /><br />The villagers pursue the Frankenstein monster to an old windmill (classic), and, as he looms over them from the top screaming a very operatic \\"Whyyyyyy???!!!,\\" the windmill is set ablaze. Just then, the crowd is frightened away by four horrific figures emerging from the clouds. They proceed to land before the burning mill and weep at the loss of their dream. They are Dracula and his three brides. Very cool black and white opening, though campy at times and thoroughly hammy. Richard Roxburgh's Dracula takes some getting used to, but with repeat viewings he can really grow on you. Two of Dracula's three brides, Josie Maran and Elena Anaya, can suck me dry anytime. Silvia Colloca is a bit too mature and downright scary for my tastes.<br /><br />Fast forward one year, to a world that is still dark, but now in color, where we witness a wanted man named Abraham Van Helsing (Hugh Jackman) trailing another man known by two names: Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The setting is Paris, nighttime, and the trail leads to the belfry of the Notre Dame cathedral. Here, we learn the nature of Van Helsing's work. He is a monster hunter, and he brings `em back dead or a live, which often results in him being mistaken for a murderer. In the big fight scene that follows between Van Helsing and the hulking Mr. Hyde, we learn that Abraham is an easy-going character, much more likeable than the usual tough guy hero personas. He's also a religious man, though he has issues (including a loss of memory reminiscent of another famous Hugh Jackman hero), and most importantly, he's the best at what he does. Clad in a dark leather coat and wide-brimmed hat, armed with spinning tojo blades and a sharp wit, Van Helsing makes short work of Mr. Hyde, Dr. Jekyll, and the cathedral's famous Rose Window.<br /><br />Avoiding capture by the French police, Van Helsing makes his way to his home-base of sorts, the Vatican City, Rome. Through a secret door in a confessional booth, after some chastising and grumbling back and forth with Cardinal Jinette (guilt and remorse take their toll on Abraham), Van Helsing takes us into the secret lair of a holy order made up of all the religions of the world on a mission to eradicate the monsters that plague our planet. At this point, Cardinal Jinette explains Van Helsing's newest mission to him, simultaneously divulging the details of the plot to us, the audience. It seems that the last two members of a line of Transylvanian nobles, Gypsy Princess Anna Valerious and her brother, Velkan, are in dire need of help to destroy Count Vladislaus Dracula. The fate of the souls of their entire bloodline rests on accomplishing this task, and now they are down to two.  Then, in a sequence right out of a 007 film, a quirky young friar named Carl (David Wenham) introduces Van Helsing to his new \\"ahead of their time\\" array of gadgets and weaponry. Before the scene is over, Van Helsing has wrangled Carl into the mission as well.<br /><br />Cut to Transylvania, where the aforementioned gypsy prince and princess are about to spring an elaborate trap to catch a werewolf. A CGI werewolf, but possibly the second coolest looking werewolf ever depicted on film(the first being in this movie also)! Naturally, despite some very cool action and werewolf footage, things don't go as planned. The werewolf does get nailed with a silver bullet, but not before taking Velkan over a cliff with him and down to the icy waters below. Her heart sinking, the lovely Princess Anna looks on and prays for help. Luckily, Van Helsing is on his way, sidekick Carl in tow. Their arrival is not a welcome one, however. The Transylvanian villagers, the same ones we saw storming a castle one year earlier, are wary of strangers. They prepare to kill Abraham and Carl on the spot, with Princess Anna giving the orders, but are interrupted by the vampire brides on a mission to kill the final Valerious. In the process, we finally get a good look at how hot the brides are. Unfortunately, the price is the loss of Josie Maran far too soon in the movie (and with one of the worst CGI effects I've seen in a while). Killing Josie, or Marishka, as she is called in the film, earns V.H. some respect, though he is still not accepted with open arms. It is expected now, that the vampires will be more violent than ever.<br /><br />The two remaining brides return home to Dracula's secret castle, where we are reintroduced to the count, in color this time. He mourns the loss of his bride for about two seconds, walks around on the ceiling, does some ranting, gently reprimands the hideous Igor(played by the always fun and creepy Kevin J. O'Connor) who is torturing a werewolf behind a curtain, and then we're back to Anna and Van Helsing. In Anna's castle, Van Helsing and the princess toss their tactics at each other while flaunting sexual tension. Unfortunately, they don't come to an agreement, resulting in Van Helsing spraying Anna with some wicked cool knockout Binaca in the hopes that she'll have no choice but to use his plan of waiting till morning to hunt. I guess it wares off too soon though, because Anna wakes up and gets to work. Van Helsing catches up with her just in time to chase off her brother, the new werewolf, before he could do any harm during a failed attempt at warning her of Dracula's plans. Van Helsing goes after the beast, but instead has a brief run in with Top Hat, the creepiest guy in town. While Abraham attempts to kill Velkan the werewolf, Anna catches up with him, and the two have it out about people shooting at her brother... After some bonding, the monster hunters soon find themselves heading in the direction of Frankenstein castle to help Velkan and put an end to the Count. While snooping around within the castle walls, they uncover Dracula's secret plan. He has been trying to use Frankenstein's machine to bring his children to life; hundreds of hideous, gargoyle-like babies, born dead and hanging from the ceiling of the castle in slimy pods! Using mortal humans as power conductors has been fruitless, so Dracula begins to experiment on Anna's werewolf brother, Velkan. The creatures are suddenly brought to life, and Dracula sends them out to feed with his brides teaching them. As Van Helsing goes after Dracula and Anna goes after her brother, the little Dracula babies swoop down and attack the village below. Van Helsing attempts to stake Dracula, but instead of celebrating, the two heroes find themselves fleeing Frankenstein castle, outnumbered by vampires, werewolf Velkan, and the creepy Dwergi, Dracula's goblin-like henchmen.<br /><br />Van Helsing Rule Number Two: Silver stas on accomplishing this task, and now they are down to two.  Then, in a sequence right out of a 007 film, a quirky young friar named Carl (David Wenham) introduces Van Helsing to his new \\"ahead of their time\\" array of gadgets and weaponry.

It is expected now, that the vampires will be more violent than ever.  <br /> <br />The two remaining brides return home to Dracula's secret castle, where we are reintroduced to the count, in color this time. He mourns the loss of his bride for about two seconds, walks around on the ceiling, does some ranting, gently reprimands the hideous Igor(played by the always fun and creepyKevin J. O'Connor) who is torturing a werewolf behind a curtain, and then we're back to Anna and Van Helsing. In Anna's castle, Van Helsing and the princess toss their tactics at each other while flaunting sexual tension. Unfortunately, they don't come to an agreement, resulting in Van Helsing spraying Anna with some wicked cool knockout Binaca in the hopes that she'll have no choice but to use his plan of waiting till morning to hunt. I guess it wares off too soon though, because Anna wakes up and gets to work. Van Helsing catches up with her just in time to chase off her brother, the new werewolf, before he could do any harm during a failed attempt at warning her of Dracula's plans. Van Helsing goes after the beast, but instead has a brief run in with Top Hat, the creepiest guy in town. While Abraham attempts to kill Velkan the werewolf, Anna catches up with him, and the two have it out about people shooting at her brother... After some bonding, the monster hunters soon find themselves heading in the direction of Frankenstein castle to help Velkan and put an end to the Count. While snooping around within the castle walls, they uncover Dracula's secret plan. He has been trying to use Frankenstein's machine to bring his children to life; hundreds of hideous, gargoyle-like babies, born dead and hanging from the ceiling of the castle in slimy pods! Using mortal humans as power conductors has been fruitless, so Dracula begins to experiment on Anna's werewolf brother, Velkan. The creatures are suddenly brought to life, and Dracula sends them out to feed with his brides teaching them. As Van Helsing goes after Dracula and Anna goes after her brother, the little Dracula babies swoop down and attack the village below. Van Helsing attempts to stake Dracula, but instead of celebrating, the two heroes find themselves fleeing Frankenstein castle, outnumbered by vampires, werewolf Velkan, and the creepy Dwergi, Dracula's goblin-like henchmen. <br /> <br />Van Helsing Rule Number Two: Silver stakes don't work on Dracula. <br />Van Helsing Rule Number Three: Crosses don't work on Dracula, but they do burn. <br /> <br />Well, after that fun little adventure, Van Helsing and Anna stop for some wooing over a bottle of absinthe, both having learned something from their recent experience. Van Helsing has learned a bit more about his mysterious past, Anna has learned that the best thing for her brother is a quick death, and all the vampire babies exploded from an insufficient electricity supply, so no major characters are worse off for the visit. In fact, Carl even gets a little action from a villager girl whose life he saved! Typical friar... Anyway, while reflecting on the events of the previous night, Carl makes a significant discovery in the Valerious home. The young friar accidentally finds a hidden clue: a magical painting depicting two knights in battle, one transforming into a werewolf, the other into a bat-creature. Simultaneously, Anna and Van Helsing make a discovery of their own. While discussing the mystery of how to kill dracula and swigging back green liquor in the ruins of the old, burned down windmill, Anna and Van fell through a weak spot and landed in the middle of the Frankenstein monster's secret hangout! Yes, that guy is still alive! Now that morning has come and the two have regained consciousness, they find themselves face to face with the man-made man. He is in no mood for polite conversation, so Van Helsing knocks him out with a blow dart. V.H. seems to love knocking people out. Before the creature passes out, however, he manages to reveal to them the secret of his existence. He is the key to life for Dracula's children, and there are thousands more waiting to be given life in Dracula's own hidden castle. Suddenly, Van Helsing's mission is not only to destroy Dracula, but to hide and protect Frankenstein's monster from the vampire's evil clutches, or else the whole world will suffer under the frenzy of Dracula's thousands of hungry offspring! <br /> <br />As I said in the beginning, Van Helsing is a \\"popcorn flick.\\" Much like \\"The Mummy Returns,\\" \\"Van Helsing\\" is a thrill-ride of a movie. It's a special effects laden action-adventure based on the icons of Universal Studios horror. The point of a film like Van Helsing is to have a good time while watching it, and on those grounds, it's a huge success. Now, I'm not one to praise computer animated characters in live-action films. I confess, a great many of my favorite recent films rely heavily on computer generated characters, but I would almost always prefer audio-animatronics and other real-life effects over CGI, especially with werewolves and other horror related subjects. Why? Well, because I very rarely encounter CGI effects that aren't obvious, and how can you get a chill from something you KNOW isn't there? CGI effects are best when used simply to enhance real elements, and it's always better when the real outweighs the CGI. \\"Van Helsing\\" is different though. Yes, there are computer effects in this film that bother me, the death of Marishka, the mouths of the vampires (I prefer the old-fashioned kind), etc...., but these were a few points in a movie heavily laden with CGI. In a film with so many computer effects, it almost becomes more like watching a painting, making the CGI characters seem much less out of place than they appear in a film like \\"An American Werewolf In Paris.\\" With Van Helsing, so much of the backgrounds and effects are CGI that the pure CGI characters seem to blend in so much better than something that is merely pasted over a world completely real in every other aspect. Thanks to Stephen Sommers' obsession with \\"Sommersizing\\" every aspect of his films, the CGI creatures are far less distracting and far more believable. And, one has to admit, you just can't get great werewolf moves like that with costumes or animatronics. These things are fast and fierce, and the coolest looking werewolves I've ever seen. Their transformations usually involved ripping the human flesh off their bodies, which was actually cooler than I ever thought it would be (probably because it wasn't done in a gory way). And, though I don't love this new breed of werewolves that climb walls and columns like a panther or something, at least that was kept to a minimum here.  <br /> <br />Effects issues aside (since you either can take CGI characters or you can't), this film is top notch for what it aims to be. The cast is perfect. Who doesn't love Hugh Jackman? I've already raved about my two favorite vampire ladies, and Shuler Hensley was such a noble monster (I'd love to see his performance as Jud in \\"Oklahoma\\" sometime). Everyone in the cast was a perfect compliment to Hugh Jackman. I've never been big on Kate Beckinsale, but this is one of those films where you can't help but be charmed. And, oh, the music! Alan Silvestri is just awesome! Definitely, a movie for the collection. Not high art, but a perfect choice for a carefree evening of fun and adventure! I sincerely hope a sequel has not been ruled out! <br /> <br />Van Helsing is available on a great DVD (fullscreen and widescreen versions, be careful which you buy) with two commentaries (no, neither feature Hugh or Kate), a tour of Dracula's castle, outtakes, other behind the scenes treats, and a nice little look into the character of Van Helsing, the rival of Dracula since the two personalities were first cooked up by Bram Stoker in the 19th century. You can also buy Van Helsing on VHS, or get an Ultimate Edition DVD that includes the original Universal classics \\"Dracula,\\" \\"Frankenstein,\\" and \\"The Wolf Man,\\" along with a couple of extra bonus features. There's even an animated DVD prequel to Van Helsing out entitled: \\"Van Helsing - The London Assignment.\\" I believe it deals with the story of Van Helsing going after Mr. Hyde. I definitely need to pick that one up someday! <br />
B00013RC9I|5.0|Gorgeous electronica that will not disappoint. Even if you are not a fan of \\"electropop,\\" you will be after you listen to this  <br />CD. A masterful blend of airy voices and delightful textures make this a listening gem.
B000BBOUU4|4.0|Having gone through his horrendous PLANET OF THE APES re-thinking / re-imagining / re-whatever, I had forgotten how good a film-maker Tim Burton can be. This is a pretty good film full of magical moments but marred by Johnny Depp's disastrous-Michael Jackson-like-performance. <br />Here's a tip to Tim Burton, the world is full of actors, next time at least consider the possibility that Johnny Depp might be miscast for a part.
0307276902|4.0|Althouth I really enjoyed this book; it is not the suspensful page turner as described by Oprah.  It is a very good read though and kept my interest through his painful journey through recovery.    I do recommend this book.
0802130208|1.0|Apparently, this book is a comedy. I could't tell by reading it though. I think I laughed once near the end of the book. That's about it. True, the main character is ridiculous and the situations are absurd. But none of it is funny. It's just a long, repetitive, boring story about an annoying character that nobody could warm up to. If you read the first page and you don't laugh, drop this book, because it's going to be 400 more pages of the same slop.
B0009X75RO|5.0|I don't know why this hasn't been release in the US yet.  I got a copy last week in Wellington, New Zealand.  The extras are really good.  There's a mini-doco about the origins on Chicago with interviews from some of the people involved in 1975. The extended musical scenes are put together combining shots from the movie with those at rehearsals.  There are two special sections about Chita Rivera and Liza Minnelli.  The feature itself and its commentary track is the same as the first one released.
0385510454|4.0|John Grisham's The Broker is a fast-paced murder-conspiracy novel set, for the most part, in Bologna, Italy. The catch is that the reader knows who is supposed to be murdered while the possible victim slowly comes to expect the truth. The conspiracy is a creation of his own government in order to find out important intelligence secrets only the protagonist knows. The novel is full of secretive men and women, high-tech surveillance, and the rich history of Bologna, with its cuisine, its art and its architecture.<br /><br /> The Good: The characters are well-written and the reader quickly becomes fond of most of them. The scenery is depicted wonderfully, almost to the point that the reader walks beside the main character as he travels the city and learns Italian. The tension is in all the right places and the humor, while it is rare in this reader's opinion, is well-placed.<br /><br /> The Bad: The history of Bologna and other places in Italy sometimes overwhelms the story. It is almost as if Grisham needed filler pages. It's never good when this need for filler is so obvious. However, the characters and the plot excel at making the reader ignore this one defect in order to get to the end of the tale.<br /><br /> In closing, The Broker is a good novel. While it is not one of Grisham's best, it is definitely worth the read. Pick it up and give it a chance
1401300901|5.0|I'm not a big reader and when I do read I like books by Stephen King and Dean Koontz.  I was in a funk and decided I was going to bury myself into a book for a while.  A book of this size would take me months normally and I finished it in a few weeks.  Every time I would pick the book up I wouldn't put it down for hours.  It was excellent.  In some ways I could completely relate to some of the things the group of friends do and it made me laugh.  Not only did I laugh but at times I cried, it was great!
079284131X|3.0|The answer? Yes. I don't think I was the only one who, when they were young, used to go out of their bedroom, then quickly open the door to try & catch their toys out & playing, or in a different place. This plays on that idea, with a very un-scary looking doll to begin with, which says a few choice phrases - and then some. You still get similar sorts of dolls out there, with dorky phrases, and they never say anything else. Unlike Chucky.<br /><br />I've never seen this film up until a few days before Halloween, when it was considered \\"appropriate\\" to scare ourselves silly. OK, myself. I wasn't sure what to expect to be honest, but was pleasantly surprised, and am now looking forward to seeing the rest. I have to admit, once the credits rolled on this, I was looking at the back of the other DVDs, to find out how on earth they manage to bring Chucky back. Stupid question, they always will, if it means more money.<br /><br />The only real star in this - apart from Chucky obviously - is Brad Dourif, who appears briefly at the start, and starts off the whole Chucky phenonemon. Best known (to me) for his fabulous and heartstrings-pulling portrayal of a stuttering virgin in One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest (a role which he kinda repeated in Urban Legend), he disappears all too quickly in this, and is sadly missed.<br /><br />I had to admit, I did find the child actor - as most are - a little irritating at times. I'm thinking it was the whiny voice. And he sounds like he's reading off a cue card.<br /><br />I have to say, despite being a slightly unbelievable plot, it gets pulled off very well, and the doll of Chucky is well done, although done slightly 80s, as is to be expected. I expect it gets better in later films (and I can't wait to see Jennifer Tilly, she's fabulous!), and how Chucky gets brought back for another what, 5 sequels, is beyond me! I can't wait to figure out how they do it!<br /><br />Not as scary as I thought it would have been, but however, worth watching. Especially for the one scene where the old dear sees Chucky in an elevator, and says \\"ugly doll\\". His response is hilarious!<br /><br />And on one final note, instead of buying the not terrific region 1 DVD, please buy the region 2. You won't regret it.rth watching.

B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles at this point of their career are moving away from their light Rock and Roll phase.  At this point I think Bob Dylans' influence is showing in their music.  Several of the songs on this album are my favorite Beatles songs ever.  John Lennon does what I would consider his finest son, In My Life. This is not only my personal favorite, but many other fans enjoy it as well.  Michelle written by Paul McCartney also appears on this effort and remains one of his finest ever. It was a \\"throw in\\" that McCartney was working on. Lennon recommended that McCartney record it in order to finish the album.   George Harrison is also coming into his own with, If I Needed Someone which could be my Favorite George Harrison song ever.  Nowhere Man is next. Nowhere man is rumored to be about Bob Dylan. I have never been quite able to make the connection.  Think For Yourself is another George Harrison song with Paul's fuzz bass giving the song a unique sound. Think for Youself is another great song with Paul using his \\"fuzz bass to give the song a unique sound.  Norwegian Wood is another on of John Lennon's best songs ever.  No Beatles collection is complete without this CD. A classic and always will be.  Many people think this is the best Beatles album ever. I would have to agree with that................
B00002ZMNV|5.0|Perefect combination of Metallica and SF Symphony. Just play the DVD in a Home theater system and I promise you will feel you are in heaven. Its one album which I dont get bored watching zillions of times. <br /> <br />A must buy for any Metallica fan.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is a very fine album, many might argue possibly their best ever.  The Beatles at this time are at their creative best.  George Harrison was becoming a fine writer in his own right.  Harrison does his very popular Taxman, Love To You and I Want To Tell You. This is without a doubt Harrison's best effort along with, If I Needed Someone from Rubber Soul. This is when Harrison was breaking out as the fine writer we all knew and loved.  One of Lennon's finest is also on this collection I'm Only Sleeping.  In my Life is another song on the CD, many people think its his best song ever. I find it very hard to disagree.  McCartney writes song of his best songs as well. Here, There and Everywhere is another one of his very finest. In my mind Here, there and Everywhere is the same caliber as Yesterday. For no one is another outstanding song.  Paul is on top of his came here, infact the entire group seems to be.  Yellow Submarine is also on this album. Ringo Starr sings it. This is probably along with A Little Help From My Friends, Ringo's finest hour as a Beatle.  Got To Get You Into My Life with the brass that is added as another fine song by Paul. This is worthy of any collection.
B00006LWSF|5.0|This album is just damn good. I consider it Eminem's 4th cd and just as good as his first 3. Everyone on this soundtrack with the exception of Macy Gray, Boomkat and Nas (the Nas track was disappointing since God's Son and Stillmatic were both great, and I don't know what the hell Macy Gray is doing on here) rips every verse and the production is on-point to say the least. <br /> <br />\\"Lose Yourself\\" was unavoidable when it first came out, and is probably going to go down in hip-hop history as Eminem's best song. Then the album goes right into \\"Love Me\\", where the Shady Allstars put together smooth flows over a mellow track. \\"8 Mile\\", \\"Adrenaline Rush\\" and \\"Places to Go\\" are all decent 4 star songs from the aforementioned Shady members. Then the album goes into the amazing \\"Rap Game\\" from D12 (Eminem and Swift KILL this track) and \\"8 Miles and Running\\" from Jay-Z and Freeway, who was unheard of at the time this album came out. The beat is spectacular and Free rips it just as well as Jay does. Xzibit's \\"Spitshine\\" is ferocious with a banging beat, and it was really nice to hear Xzibit at his best again. The next two tracks are skip material, but right after that goes into 50 Cent's hot mixtape-diss-turned-single \\"Wanksta\\", which is the sole reason I bought his first CD \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin'\\" (4 stars). \\"Wasting My Time\\" is more filler, but it's forgivable once you see that the next track is by the incredible Rakim. The rhymes definitely dont disappoint, and it's really nice to hear Rakim again. It's a wonder why Dre hasn't got his album off the shelf yet. Young Zee's track is decent, and right after that Gang Starr comes in with an awesome track as usual, both in Premier's production and Guru's lyrics. Eminem finishes the soundtrack off with the short and sweet \\"Run Rabbit Run\\", which I heard on the radio a lot at the end of 2003. <br /> <br />Overall this soundtrack is crazy. If you're a fan of Eminem and hip-hop you should have this in your collection along withEm's 2nd and 3rd albums. Standout tracks are: <br /> <br />1) Lose Yourself <br />2) Love Me <br />3) 8 Miles and Runnin <br />4) Wanksta <br />5) Rap Game
B00001OH7O|5.0|There aren't many albums that I'd go to the bother of writing a review of, but this is certainly one to hark on about. Everybody in the world should own this gem. <br /> <br />Quite simply put, this is a thoroughly complete album. You know that even most great albums have a dodgy tune hidden in there at track 5 or something? This doesn't. In fact, each song is better than most whole albums. <br /> <br />As a lover of Bowie post 1980 albums, I'm convinced this is his best. I didn't take this out of my dish for 2 months after I'd first pressed play, and 5 years on, it still astonishes me how superb it is. It's a record that you will listen to in it's entirety every time you put it on because it's a record you won't want to have to cut short. <br /> <br />'Quicksand' is a song that I'm sure every songwriter of any merit wishes they'd made. When you add 'Life On Mars' to the score, then I think you know where I'm coming from... <br /> <br />Just buy it.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|A wonderous vision of the future started in the all too short run of the TV series Firefly continues in the big screen version of it, Serenity. The TV show and movie is about the crew of a star ship that is as much unlike the USS Enterprise as it can get. It's a ranshackle freighter skippered by Mal Reynolds, a man part Han Solo, part Jesse James. He was on the losing side of an intersteller civil war against the Alliance, a buraucratic, oppressive government that seems to consists of people who believe quite fervently they know better than other people how they should live their lives. Captain Reynolds and his motley crew, including his former second in command from the war, her husband the pilot, an engineer who is as cute as she is sharp with the hyper drive, a muscle bound mercenary in a constant state of mutiny, a preacher, a courtesan, and a doctor and his troubled (to say the least!) sister eck out a thin living doing odd jobs out on the frontier, some of them not exactly legal. They bicker and at times almost come to blows. Especialy due to the fact that the doctor's sister is wanted by the Alliance government for having been \\"enhanced\\" and damaged by a top secret government labortory.<br /><br />Oddly enough, this crew might well save the human race among the stars. The story is a paean about how the unlikeliest people can become heroes and how the right of individuals to live free if an absolute. I hope there will be many more films in this \\"verse.\\"
B000ASATWQ|2.0|I received this album in the mail two weeks ago and haven't been able to stop playing it. The funny thing is that I didn't even know what it was when I opened it, I thought I'd been sent a Rob Zombie album as a joke 'cause Damian is so white! <br /> <br />But I started playing it and damn man this is Public Enemy from '88 to '91 music. You love the beats but you want to hear the words, it makes you think and gets you up. <br /> <br />I'm going home now to hear it again.
B000B7BRMM|4.0|I've gotten pretty tired of Christmas music in recent years.  There are essentially only about 30 or 40 songs, and they have been done and redone in an endless series of rock versions, country versions, new age, etc.  I have about four dozen Christmas CDs, and that feels like way more than I need. However, I made an exception for this new Krall disc because I'm such a big fan of hers.  When I heard about this CD, I imagined the delights of hearing Diana wrapping her marvelously honeyed tones around the lyrics of \\"The Christmas Song\\" and \\"I'll Be  Home for Christmas,\\" and her versions of those tunes are indeed real swell.  However, I must admit that much of the rest of the CD was a bit disappointing to me.  The trouble is that the big band arrangements are just so uninspired and generic-sounding.  They occasionally rise above the level of ordinary (as on \\"Christmas Time Is Here\\"), but much more often they just completely failed to excite me at all.  It's impossible for me not to enjoy Diana's singing (thus the 4-star rating), but I would like to have heard better backing for these songs.
B00097DXZS|4.0|I really loved Supernatural and this one is just as good.  Don't judge a guy just because he was on American Idol.  Bo Bice just wants to make good music and I was really impressed with Brown Skin Girl.  I also liked Michelle Branch I'm Feeling You, Joss Stone with Sean Paul is very cool, and Steven Tyler song.
630512762X|4.0|I've been somewhat disappointed with a few of John Woo's American films, feeling that his prime really took place back in Hong Kong.  But FACE/OFF is a happy exception.  I was very impressed with what Woo managed to do with this film.  First of all, let's examine the premise (as others have).  It is, indeed, one of the most absurd premises of all time.  A Cop and an Evil Villain swap faces and identities and are suddenly forced to deal with each other's worlds while they desperately try to \\"get their face back.\\"  If you think about it for more than two seconds, this is the sort of plot that would make good fodder for a `B' movie...something starring Dean Cain perhaps.<br /><br />But FACE/OFF is anything but a `B' movie.  I was entertained every second of this film for two simple reasons.  (1)  The action, as in all of Woo's films, is absolutely superb.  I'm not sure how Woo is able to achieve his \\"ballet,\\" but his talent is in full throttle for the entirety of this film.  The poetic gunfights, the slaughter set to \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\\" the entire chapel sequence, the class \\"Woo\\" ending...it's all here.  (2)  The acting is incredible.  John Travolta and Nicholas Cage carry this film.  Instead of becoming a corny movie about swapped identities, both of these characters manage to have a lot of fun playing each other.  In essence, what I'm trying to say is that these two actors make the premise work.  After they have \\"switched,\\" I found myself really looking at both of them quite differently.  Every once in a while, I would have to remind myself that the premise was not real and that the actors were playing each other.  Due to the fact that both Travolta and Cage have such big personalities, the film works.  If it had been cast with the less talented bunch that we normally see in action films, it would have failed miserably.<br /><br />If you're not typically a fan of action films, I recommend that you see FACE/OFF.  It will give you a new appreciation of the genre and perhaps also give you some insight on the current work of other directors, such as Quentin Tarantino.aps also give you some insight on the current work of other directors, such as Quentin Tarantino.
B0000A7W14|5.0|This is one of the best movies I've Ever seen in my life. It's so real that you actually forget that these were actually actors and actresses, they were like the people that you see in your neighborhood on the porch every day. And I honestly learned alot from this movie. I recomend this to every one unless your caucation and easily afended, but if you can hang with it go ahead it's a really great movie.
B00004W221|5.0|RUDY is the story of a boy chasing a dream, who in the process becomes a man.  It is a plot formula that we have seen before, time and time again.  So what makes RUDY stand out so much in my mind?  I think what makes this film so successful is the fact that it is true to life, unlike many sports films.  In your typical \\"underdog\\" film, the sports team faces another losing season, only to channel their hopes and dreams into winning the state championship, the World Cup, etc.  It is a concept that is generally played out exclusively \\"on the field,\\" presenting the audience with a myopic view of the world in which sports are the only thing that matters.  I often wonder to myself, after seeing such a film, \\"What happened to them after that?\\"  And unless we're watching THE MIGHTY DUCKS, who decide to answer the question by putting out more movies, that question is left unanswered.<br /><br />RUDY is very different.  Here is a story about a dream.  It is not a dream to score the winning touchdown of a bowl game.  It is not a dream to play professional football.  It is not an unrealizable fantasy that is sloppily achieved through the magic of filmmaking.  Instead, it is a simple dream: to dress for one game on the Notre Dame football team.  That's it.  Moreover, RUDY is not the story of a man who accomplishes his goal in one season.  It takes him years of hard work and disappointment.  The effect of telling such a story is epic.  By the time our hero finally takes the field, the emotional intensity of that moment is much greater than in most other sports movies I've seen.  I am generally not really relieved or emotional when the underdog team finally wins the match-even if \\"We Are the Champions\\" is playing in the background, asking for our tears.  But I wanted to see Rudy (Sean Astin) take the field so bad, I was extremely involved in the film.<br /><br />Sean Astin does an incredible job in this role and I think it is by far one of the best performances of his career.  In short, if you like sports movies in which the underdog triumphs in the end, you will love RUDY.  It blows the genre out of the water.  Instead of focusing solely \\"on the field,\\" this film focuses more on the transformation of Rudy's character and the surrounding details and experiences of his life.  RUDY is definitely worth owning in your collection..  In short, if you like sports movies in which the underdog triumphs in the end, you will love RUDY.  It blows the genre out of the water.

B00005GL0P|5.0|\\"Rubber Soul\\" was some of the same and something different. \\"Rubber Soul\\" yielded the first Beatles hit song that had nothing to do with love or girls (\\"Nowhere Man\\"). \\"Rubber Soul\\" marked a transition from The Beatles early boy band love songs to a mature sound that could cover any subject well.<br /><br />The songs on this album are classic mid-60s. \\"You Won't See Me,\\" \\"Norwegian Wood,\\" and \\"Drive My Car\\" are each classic Beatles songs that are staples of classic rock stations. \\"You Won't See Me\\" in particular has been covered numerous times by other groups.<br /><br />\\"Nowhere Man\\" is excellent. A song about everyman, and a commentary on everyman. This song with its political overtones perhaps expressed some of the frustration the youth of the 60s had with the desire to change the world, and yet could not get oldsters to understand what they were about; and changes that happened were too slow. It's funny looking back, because now we are the oldsters, and the wheel has turned once again. The most incredible thing about this song is that it has nothing to do with love, and ranks as one of the best Beatles songs of all time. The only flaw with this song is that it, like so many other songs of the era, was a paltry 2:44 long, which was LONG by the standards of those days. Think of what The Beatles could have done had they had CDs to work with!<br /><br />I think \\"Michelle,\\" \\"Girl,\\" and \\"In My Life\\" are excellent Beatles ballads, with outstanding harmonies on \\"Girl\\" and \\"In My Life;\\" classics in a different vein from the other songs on this album.<br /><br />Of the remaining songs, \\"Think for Yourself,\\" \\"I'm Looking Through You,\\" \\"Wait,\\" and \\"If I Needed Someone\\" offer quality Beatles music.

B000A3DFZE|2.0|If you buy this disc, buy is used ... get it cheap, 'cause it's BOOOOORRRRRIIIIINNNNNGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />This guy used to be \\"god\\" ... now, ... it's very sweet, very nice songs ... about sweet nice things ... AND NO GUITAR!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />That's like watching Shaq bowl!  Maybe it peaks your' interest for a second, but it isn't worth much energy to pursue.  I kept waiting and waiting for something akin to guitar buzz, rifts ... SOMETHING!!!!!  Nope.  Not here.  Let's go bowling!!! <br /> <br />I can not recall being this disappointed in a disc ... 'cepting for Santana's new one, which is even worse. <br /> <br />RETIRE, gentlemen ... let someone else play ... they may actually want to!!
B00097DXZS|1.0|I haven't purchased this as i got burned by a similar copy protection scheme on the new Van Zant CD. Basically this new Sony scheme installs a new player on your computer, runs something in background which cannot be deleted, and you can't install this CD on your IPOD (under Windows).    Basically this will install a worm on your computer. Check the reviews for Van Zant's \\"Get Right with the Man\\" for more specifics.    *** New: added 11/2  There have been some comments regarding why is this copy protection such a big deal. Copy Protection does not give a vendor permission to wreck my computer. And this new Sony scheme is essentially a viral attack on your computer. It is not just copy protection. It installs a new media player on your computer. It installs a worm to make sure you use this player and don't download to an ipod. Look at what is involved in removing it:    1. fill out a form at Sony  2. You get called back to ask why you want to remove it. If you pass this test, then...  3. you get sent to web site to download a program which scans your computer and sends the info to another company, where...  4. They send you an email to go to another web site to down load something which will remove the Sony virus from your computer.    You want this much hassle just to play a CD?
B00005JLKB|5.0|I have loved the Superman story since I was a knee high.  I recall watching the original black and white Superman series on TV in the late 1950's and early 1960's.  Superman became my hero and I even donned long underwear and with a bath towel for a cape, I transformed myself into Superboy.  I bought all the comic books and by the time I was 12 I knew all there was to know about Superboy and Superman.  Then I \\"outgrew\\" such childhood things and entered my troubled teens, leaving Superboy behind.<br /><br />Discovering \\"Smallville\\" has rekindled my long dormant interest in things Super.  I never would have believed that a \\"modern\\" tv series could be faithful to the original intent of the comic book Superboy, but Smallville does this and more.  The plots are wonderfully entertaining and engaging!  Sure, some are a bit campy, but that's what critics said about Star Trek (the original series, when it first debuted too and look what happened to that series!<br /><br />The first season of \\"Smallville\\" introduces us to Clark Kent, his Kansas family, and the central characters in young Clark's life, such as Lana Lang, Lex Luthor, and others.  Clark is a handsome young man in the mould of Chris Reeves, and he can act too, boy can he act!  In fact, the acting is the strength of this series, as all the central characters show an amazing ability to make the supernatural life of a superboy seem so real and interesting.  I got hooked after watching the pilot episode where the baby Kal-el from Krypton plunges to earth in a spacecraft and is discovered by his future earth parents, Ma and Pa Kent.  The scripts are true to the original story of Superboy, and they trasport me back in time 45 years to my childhood, where once again I can enjoy the many adventures of Superboy, although this time without the long underwear and cape.<br /><br />If you have any doubts about buying this series, put them aside, for Smallville is no small-time show.  This is the real thing, and if you want to learn or relive the story of Superboy, this is the best place you could start.  So sit back and get hooked on a series the whole family can enjoy.<br /><br />I have just one question: if Superboy is invulnerable to all physical harm, how did the Kents ever give him a haircut?<br /><br />Most highly recommended.<br /><br />Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig, Superman fan since I was knee highyou want to learn or relive the story of Superboy, this is the best place you could start.

B000AARKOO|3.0|Besides the historical inaccuracies, the main character, Orlando Bloom, was a weak choice. His manliness is just not there. Orlando is like a ballerina crusader; weak and easily killed (not in this movie, of course). As an actor, Orlando Bloom belongs in mischievous roles such as Paris of Troy. At least in that role we know he cannot fight Menelaus because Paris is a man of lovemaking and not of sword fighting.<br /><br />I've always enjoyed Ridley Scott's storytelling. Overall Kingdom of Heaven is no different. I've enjoyed his choice of supporting actors. Liam Neeson, Jeremy Irons, and Edward Norton were a perfect choice.<br /><br />His association with famous composers such as Vangelis makes his movies timeless (think Blade Runner). The music was not as resounding this time, but the story was well glued which made the movie less reliant on its soundtrack.<br /><br />As with every movie released lately, one cannot escape the `rush to market,' which eventually diminishes the plot. This is probably what tamed this story as well.
1400034205|5.0|heavily inspired by maugham's interest in indian philosophy and his meeting with indian mystic ramana maharishi, the razor's edge is one of those rare books which can truly influence your view on life.    the story is about a easy going man from chicago, who can't find satisfaction or substance in the usual lures of life - wealth, love, fame etc. not willing to be part of the normal industrial society he travels around the world meeting new people in search of meaning - to europe and finally to india where he learns the basics of the advaita system and also experiences enlightenment. and comes back into the world ...    the book is loaded with maugham's usual keen insights on human nature - about women, friends etc. maugham apparently said that the whole book was written for one single page - the page which briefly describes the advaita vedanta philosophy.    some trivia :    1. when maugham met ramana maharishi in india, they apparently gazed into each others eyes for a couple of minutes after which maugham apparently fainted (check \\"talks with ramana maharishi\\")! then when he woke up, ramana is supposed to have said : \\"all the necessary talking is done\\", after which maugham is supposed to have departed.    2. when maugham died, a copy of s.radhakrishnan's \\"principal upanishads\\" was supposedly alongside him. the title of razor's edge is taken from a quote from the kathaa upanishad.    3. christopher isherwood, known for his translations of traditional advaita vedanta texts, is supposed to have been maugham's role model for larry darrel.    great book this - can change your life! it did mine!
B00005NS1D|5.0|This album is more than one of Elton's best recordings; it is also one of the best rock albums of all time. The production is excellent, the music is played nearly flawlessly, the lyrics are some of the best Taupin ever wrote, and the music was consistently some of the best Elton has written.<br /><br />This album starts off with a beautiful instrumental, \\"Funeral for a Friend\\", which segues into \\"Love Lies Bleeding.\\" \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" should be experienced rather than described. I plan to have \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" played at my funeral, which will hopefully be very far away.<br /><br />Everyone knows \\"Candle in the Wind.\\" This version is the original, and is a moving tribute to Marilyn Monroe.<br /><br />\\"Bennie and the Jets;\\" the song is pretty good, but didn't come off quite as well as Elton wanted it to. The crowd participated less than Elton had intended. Regardless, the lyrics and music are wonderful, and a bit of insider commentary on pop musicians and their fans.<br /><br />\\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is a 70s pop/rock anthem. Every greatest hits of the 70s list always includes this song. Played heavily on top 40 radio for several years and now frequently on classic rock stations, this song was an instant classic.<br /><br />The next two songs are underappreciated and are very good. \\"This Song Has No Title\\" and \\"Grey Seal\\" are both very good songs. There is a serious undertone to \\"Grey Seal\\" that hints at perceptions and feelings, and perhaps the difficulty of being an individual in modern society. \\"Grey Seal\\" was re-done for \\"Yellow Brick Road,\\" having been previously recorded in a style more like \\"Empty Sky.\\" The original version can be found on the \\"Rare Masters\\" CD. I prefer this version, which is more polished.<br /><br />\\"Jamaica Jerk-off\\" is a silly song. However, someone did their homework because while the song is a bit annoying at times, it fits well where it was positioned on the CD.<br /><br />\\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\" is a bluesy song that is mellow and moving, and relates life to, what else, the movies. If you like soft rock with a touch of heavy, this is a good song. \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" laments the life of prostitutes, and is sad rather than condescending. \\"The Ballad of Danny Bailey\\" should be part of a soundtrack to a movie. It feels like it came from a soundtrack. The song contains a fictional story that draws imagery from the fictionalized accounts of characters such as Bonnie and Clyde. This song just as easily could have been the ballad of Clyde Barrow. The song well executed song provides enjoyable listening.<br /><br />\\"Dirty Little Girl\\" is lyrically a bit of a puzzler for me. I was unable to definitely divine Taupin's point. On the surface the lyrics appear to be about someone physically dirty needing a bath. With the reference to social worker, likely someone who is poor. But is there a point to the lyrics? Regardless, this song is one of the rocking songs on this CD, along with two others that appear right after \\"All the Girls Love Alice,\\" which is a sorrowful song about a young female lesbian.<br /><br />Two back-to-back rockers that follow are the fastest songs on the CD, \\"Your Sister Can't Dance\\" and \\"Saturday Night's alright for Fighting.\\" These are songs to play at that party you were planning, along with \\"Dirty Little Girl.\\" Elton John can rock when he chooses.<br /><br />The last three songs cluster nicely since all three deal with different topics. The first song, \\"Roy Rogers,\\" I really enjoy, though it gives me a strong feeling of nostalgia every time I listen to it. Not really a tribute to Roy Rogers so much as a tribute to old movies and TV shows, the feeling they give you, and memories of days gone by.<br /><br />\\"Social Disease\\" is a mixture of thoughts, but the theme seems to be borderline alcohol abuse. I say borderline because the principal character seems to like his life. Perhaps that is an understatement. The principal character seems to revel in his life.<br /><br/>The last song on this CD is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, \\"Harmony.\\" As happens so often with some songs, this song is flawed in that it could have been twice as long and even then it might not have been long enough. This song is very beautiful, though there seems to be two themes intertwined that may be aspects of the same theme. One theme is that of love by someone who is on the verge of obsession. The other is a musical question; will I continue to be able to sing well in the future, and for how long? Listening to the song I was unable to pick up on the second theme, but reading the lyrics I realized that the song could be interpreted in the second way.<br /><br />If you like Elton's music, then you must be reading this review for curiosity, because you already have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". If you like pop/rock from the 70s, then you already have \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road.\\" If you have heard music from the 70s and want to find the better music from that era, you have hit one of the best. I believe that while the music sounds a little dated in spots, I believe that released today it would still sell songs. Perhaps it might even influence younger artists.<br /><br />This particular version is a Japanese reissue.  There is a large variety of this album available with varying prices.  You should check to see which version is best for you before you buy.s to revel in his life.  <br /> <br />The last song on this CD is one of Elton's beautiful ballads, \\"Harmony.\\" As happens so often with some songs, this song is flawed in that it could have been twice as long and even then it might not have been long enough.

0385510454|4.0|Despite some tepid applause for this book, I found it to be a good and exciting read. Former Washington power broker and ex con, Joel Backman, is released from his long prison sentence by means of a pardon from the outgoing President. The various secret services around the world are aware that Joel has in his possession, a series of discs which explain in detail, a satellite system which would be valuable beyond belief to any spy organisation. After being secretly whisked from his prison, he is flown to Italy and set up in a small room with a CIA agent as his handler, easing the way for him in a strange country, while he is given language lessons by a series of tutors. The rest of the book is very much a spy story with much changing of appearances and scouring of the streets of Bologna, trying to avoid the spies from Israel, China and other countries looking for him, and at the same time, trying to avoid constant surveillance from the CIA and the FBI.He befriends his female tutor who helps him to return to the US when it becomes obvious that his life is in danger, and the rest is a race against time to settle his affairs before it becomes too late. This would make a great movie if done properly....maybe Harrison Ford?
039472903X|5.0|How can you review Hamlet or War and Peace? It's absolute classics and you can't deny it.  <br /> <br />That's why I'd rather ask those who gave low ratings to this book a question: What's so outdated about this book? Is it the fact that Ogilvy favoured long copy? Or his dislike for meaningless 'creativity' for creativity's sake? Or, perhaps, the lack of references to the Internet in his book?  <br /> <br />Really, I'd like to know why guys like Ogilvy, Reeves or Hopkins seem so old-fashioned, so irrelevant to you these days. Everyone of them made mistakes - that's for sure. But I've noticed that Luke Sullivan or Jim Aitchinson repeat the same old axioms, only they call them 'cutting edge advertising' or whatever.  <br /> <br />What's so new about the fact that ads must draw the readers attention? Ol' Bill Burnbach said that forty years ago! Details may change but the foundation remains.
B0002IU988|5.0|I loved CREED, and now I also love ALTER BRIDGE!  Almost every song on this CD is awesome!  Very powerful lyrics that are backed by talented group members.  I would buy this again and again.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|I had never seen this programme until very recently. It came up as one of Amazons recommendations to me in an email. I paid it no thought, not knowing anything at all about the show. However, when I noticed that it was airing on the Hallmark Channel here in the UK, I thought I would give it a watch. After 5 episodes aired, I had already ordered the first 3 series, and now, after completing the viewing of series 1, I have ordered series 4 and 5. This should emphasise to you all just how good this show is. To all of you who think it is just another teen show (I'm 43), it most certainly is not. It is a show about relationships, with comedy thrown in, and will appeal to all ages. Lauren Graham is just outstanding as Lorelai. Her prickly relationship with her Mother is a joy to behold. This programme is a departure for myself, my usual viewing is West Wing, 24, Red Dwarf, Blackadder and shows of that ilk. But I have no hesitation whatsoever in recommending it to anyone who likes appealing characterisation, wonderful snappy dialogue and outstanding acting. 5 stars
0385486804|4.0|Krakauer's writing style has always agreed with me. Clearly his tendency toward writing his own impressions and experiences into his books is irksome to some readers, but I find that it works well here. Whether you feel that McCandless was a courageous explorer or just a damned fool, I think anyone interested in stories of true adventure will get a lot out of this book. It's not a \\"just the facts\\" narrative, but involves side-tracks into Krakauer's reactions to the main character and the reactions of others. It even strays so far as to compare McCandless to other adventurers whose travels--either through bad luck or poor decision-making--ended in death.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B00005JMXX|5.0|Quite impressed with this movie. The human fragment of the film is slender but well brought into focus by the director. The CGI and visual element was innovative and extremely exciting. The 'science' of the film - (can a film have science anyway?) was not as bad as many here think, it stands to reason that if a hurricane is powerful enough and the pressure at it's core low enough then it could draw freezing air downward from the upper layers of the atmosphere - in theory, however if it happens i dont expect it to happen like it did in this movie! There is plenty of global warming research out there which can not be dismissed as easily as a piece of entertainment, however. Back to the film, some of the dialogue was corny and badly put together...  <br /> <br />eg when one guy says to the woman 'Friedrich Nietzsche was the most important thinker of the nineteenth century'  <br /> <br />and she replies 'he was a chauvanistic pig who was in love with his sister'  <br /> <br />then he says 'he was not a chauvanistic pig' <br /> <br />They should have left it like this with an uncomfortable silence (the joke being that he was not chavanistic but was incestuous), instead she replies 'he was in love with his sister' - ruins the joke. The homeless guy and his dog were lovable characters and added a spark of humanity needed to counterbalance the pampered preppie kids around them. <br /> <br />I enjoyed this film and recommend it to any potential viewers with the warning that they should enjoy it as a piece of entertainment and a warning about the possible dangers of global warming - but please dont equate the film with the scientific global warming argument!
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|As a longtime Beatles and George Harrison fan who remembers buying this album all those years ago, it's nice to have this well-packaged memento for my DVD collection. It's all there: the concert itself, along with a collection of goodies, most notably a second disc with a documentary of the concert and other gems. However, what struck me most was the professionalism and sincerity of George Harrison himself. The ex-Beatle put an amazing show together. He asked Billy Preston, Leon Russell, Badfinger (on acoustic guitars), with other guitarists, backup singers and horn players to fill out the lineup. Yes, Eric Clapton and Bob Dylan were there, but they both kept Harrison hanging almost up to the last minute. I talk about Harrison's professionalism and sincerity because not only did he headline the show, doing great songs from his \\"All Things Must Pass\\" album, but he also did fine versions of his Beatles classics \\"Here Comes The Sun\\" and \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps.\\" It's maddening when you think that just three years later, on his North American tour, he had become so bitter. He didn't even want to perform his Beatles songs, and when he did they were unrecognizable jumbles of music. Such an injustice. He clearly had issues, and goodnessknows what was going on behind the scenes with his former bandmates from Liverpool that led Harrison to become so aloof with such masterpieces. Yet here he is just before the Bangladesh concert, telling Geraldo Rivera that he was so flattered that people would sell out the show in hours because of his connection with the Fab Four. They say Mr. Harrison was a paradox, and the change in him from 1971 to 1974 bears that out. He finally made amends in 1991 with his tour of Japan with Clapton, resulting in the live double CD of great performances. Sorry I have rambled, and there is so much more to say. I would love to sit down with Mrs. Harrison and write a book about the '74 tour, and maybe get Jim Keltner and Willie Weeks to talk as well.Hopefully the Beatles fans will understand what I'm saying here. This is a great DVD, and it belongs in your collection if you are a Harrison fan.
0066620996|5.0|The best metaphor in this book is that of the flywheel:  its heavy and with one push you can make it turn only very slowly.  But if you consistently keep pushing again and again, over time the momentum in the flywheel will keep building up until you achieve the breakthu speed you want.  You only have limited energy--if you spend this energy in areas which will keep paying back again and again longterm, you can build your momentum and deliver results whicha are quite out of proportion to what your peers can deliver, even if they are at any point stronger than you are. <br /> <br />One thing I appreciate about this book is Collins's willingness to share credit for the good ideas with his team of researchers, thereby exemplfying both his security in his own smarts and exemplfying a trait of the best managers.
B000002J09|5.0|When listening to this album for the first time, i couldn't get over just how good it was. Every song is perfection. The album shows many different sides to Led Zeppelin. There is the heavy more rocky side to the band on Black Dog and Rock 'n' Roll. The quieter more acoustic side on The Battle Of Evermore and Going To California.Then the mixture of heavy and quiet on Misty Mountain Hop and Four Sticks. Next of course come the epics Stairway to Heaven and When The Levee Breaks. This is what makes this my favourite Led Zeppelin album. the variation in styles. Also Jimmy Page is as usual breathtaking on guitar on this album, his creativity and imagination make the album great. Robert Plant also delivers one of his best vocal performances on Misty Mountain Hop, it shows a different style from him and fits in with the album really well. My personal Favourite on this album after much thinking is When The Levee Breaks,i love the use of the Harmonica on this song and Robert Plant's vocal performance is special. John Bonham's drumming power also makes this song work really well for me. This is the best last song on any album for me.
B000BB1MIC|5.0|I do believe season 5 was a great season. IF you have bought all of the other seasons on DVD, like I have you will enjoy this one too. I think the actors and actresses are the best and they perform excellent. This is one season you shouldn't miss!!
0811729117|3.0|Tigers in the mud  <br />Author-Otto Carius  <br />Translated from German to English by Robert Edwards.  <br />Stackpole Books  <br />English Copyright 1992 by J.J. Fedorowicz  <br />Paperback 365 pages/ 24 pages B/W photos, various maps. <br /> <br />This book was written by the author about his exploits and perceptions of the war on both the Eastern and Western Fronts. The author served as a tank crewman in the Czech 38t during the invasion of Russia and later as a tank commander in the 502 Heavy tank battalion. It has been claimed that he had over 150 tank kills during his career and he won the Knights Cross with oak leaves for his exploits. Wounded and convalesced several times, he ended the war on the Western Front fighting the Americans in Hunting Tigers. <br /> <br />I have been wanting to get this book for a long time and eagerly looking forward to reading it. But I have been very disappointed. The book lacks polish and is a slow read. I had to force myself to even finish it.  <br />The author writes almost in a monotone, devoid of any flourish that denotes excitement or even interest. Glossed over are only a few of his \\"over 150\\" kills. After reading his book I got the impression that he did not even get one tenth of that score. He mentions the T-34 as a superior tank when first met, but does not go into detail on the enemy equipment or hardly even the German equipment on the field. Numerous mentions of German APC's are made throughout the book. I take this and the reference to a Napalm rocket battery as well as other minor glitches in the text to poor translation.  <br />Assigned to the new JadgTiger in the final stages of the war, the author had this to say: \\"That such a monstrosity had to be constructed the final phase of the war-of all times!\\" Needless to say, he was unimpressed. In the last part of his narrative the author is clearly bitter at the fact that the enemy has won and feels letdown that the West did not join Germany and fight the Russians.<br />All in all, this book would have benefited from some else writing it, I do not question the authors record, but his book does not do the man justice!  <br /> <br />
B000001FI7|4.0|I agree with less pretentious critics of this album, if you are looking for a more musically complex sound try Massive Attack, Morcheeba, or The Mars Volta. <br /> <br />But I don't put it in the player for complexity.  To me it strips away the foreplay of the \\"trip-hop\\" label, and reduces the moment to something simple and carnal.  Beth Gibbons voice in \\"Glory Box\\" drips sex like a jilted, loved-starved Venus. <br />
B00097DXZS|5.0|There seems to be a lot of bad mouthing going around about the copyright protection that is being employed by Sony on their new releases. As an artist myself, I recognize the needs behind stopping music piracy, and am somewhat taken aback that people are not willing to honestly support the bands that they claim to respect so much. To me, it is not worth it to deprive myself of a fantastic work like Santana's \\"All That I Am\\" because it may cause some bit of inconvenience on my part. <br /> <br />In any event, since I respect Santana, I purchased the album, and it is beyond fantastic. It meets my expectation of what a CD with Carlos' kind of brand recognition should garner. When I inserted the CD into my computer, I was greeted with an opportunity to legally make backup copies, as well as other special CD enhancements. After hearing of the growing concerns about the use of \\"rootkits\\" with copy protection schemes, rather than believe the masses, I did some research myself, and learned something that set my mind at ease. As it is in many kinds of businesses, Sony/BMG uses more than one software provider for the purpose of copy protection. I then learned that a company called First 4 Internet is the company responsible for the recent scares with rootkit use, and they have admitted it freely. However, the company that produced this disc, as well as others like My Morning Jacket, Foo Fighters, Dave Matthews Band, etc, has not experienced these problems of security because their system does not include these same cloaking tecniques. If you get your Santana CD, run it, and go to the online help through the interface on the disc. This will not only provide you with the answers to most any questions you may have, it also will provide you a way to see which protected CDs have been released by this other provider, and are known to be much more safe and stable. <br /> <br />The point is that there is no reason to deprive yourself of such a great disc because of the word of concerned, yet misinformed fans. Look for yourself. Go to the Associated Press or to Cnet and see what they say about this protection.
B000B0WODA|4.0|This album for me is about at the same level of quality as the first album. The first 6 songs are absolute perfection, my favourite being 'This Boy', you just keep singing i want a car for hours after listening to it. The middle of the album is not as strong. Some of the songs begin to sound a bit familiar, or repetitive, but none the less still good songs, just not great. I like 'Outsiders' the finishing song on the album a good hard rocker which is what Franz Ferdinand do best. Still a great album.
B000A0GP0Y|2.0|I am one of many big Adam Sandler fans, and I must say I was not impressed by this film. Most people expected a non-stop laugh out loud film, sorry to burst your bubble but this one does not live up to Sandler's other big hits. Compared to Billy Madison or Big daddy, the Longest Yard just doesnt cut it. The Longest Yard just doesnt have the laughs that the other Sandler films have, or the lines that everyone remembers. I saw this one in the theatres, not worth the 8 dollars. I recommend not buying this one but maybe renting it on a boring night.
B000B7QCKO|5.0|If you're going to buy one Yanni DVD this would be the one.  It's just plain excellent in all aspects of performance, production, & songs.  Anything Yanni did after this production (either CD or DVD) just illustrates how he suborned his artistic talents and started chasing the dollar.
B000002UJQ|4.0|Personally, I think the Iron Lung(EP) album is my favorite, right next to Kid A.  But this is up there. <br /> <br />As a side note, I find it amusing that people lay waste to a band and it's fanbase in reviews then push their own favorites as immutable pillars of music. Talk about pretentious and elitist.
055357342X|5.0|This series has been the most realistic fantasy I've ever read.  Death of main characters, realistic politics and motivations.  Original creatures and situations.  Highly recommended.
B00000DGRX|5.0|Every song on this album is astounding. The sheer quality of each song is unbelievable. This album is made by 5 men who deliver to an incredible standard. The most uderrated song on the album is Maybe I'm A Leo this is a brilliant song which nobody really talks about. Smoke on the Water is brilliant the riff must go down in time as one of the best riffs of all time. My personal faourite is Highway Star, 6 minutes of frenetic,pounding rock. On the album Ritchie Blackore again reminds us how good he is on guitar, with incredible solos on lots of the songs my favourite being Highway Star. Ian Gillan has a great rock voice and delivers it again. His best performance for me being on Space Truckin'. Ian Paice must go down as one of the best rock drummers of all time and this album shows why. He has a great ability to drive songs along and does so particularly on Maybe I'm A Leo. Jon Lord and Roger Glover round of this superb album. Any rock fan should love this album. This is Deep Purple's finest album for me.
0441172717|5.0|Dune is a wonderful adventure, a dazzling piece of sci-fi, a great political thriller and a moving, memorable evocation of another world and a believable, whole people (the marvellous Fremen), vividly imagined to fit a profoundly hostile desert world, complete with a well-imagined culture, religion, social code, and so on. <br /> <br />It is all these things - but it is also amazingly predictive. The novel is basically about a desert people with an intense religion who happen to be co-located with the most valuable resource in the universe - which they only come to realise with the help of a new and even more fanatical religious leader - and manipulate to take control of everything. All the great powers must focus on this wild tribe of outlandish religious tribal people and will eventually be defeated by them. And it's all the Universe's own stupid fault - for relying so heavily on a precious resource only found in their desert realm and so vulnerable to their control. Sound familiar at all??!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I loved this movie. Seriously, I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I just reordered this movie on DVD and I'm so happy it's been made available. I watched this over and over as a child - I read all the Oz books and believe me, the interpretation in Return to Oz is much more faithful to the original series than the Judy Garland movie. There's rich textural detail and nuanced storytelling that I think Baum would have been proud of. <br /> <br />I saw this movie as a child (I was 8 when the movie came out) and although some of the scenes were disturbing, I wasn't terrified by it. Then again, children's movies when I grew up included Something Wicked This Way Comes, The Secret of N.I.M.H. and other \\"scary\\" classics. I honestly don't think there's anything wrong with exposing kids to images that may be a little disturbing. Life is not all about shiny happy people holding hands. But I was kind of a morbid kid, so I may not be the best person to give advice. <br /> <br />I consider this movie to be a lost gem. It was reviled at its release because it was so unlike \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Frankly, I hate the original movie - way too much sugar candy and twinkly froufrou for me. THIS movie gets to the heart of what the Oz series was about - a magical land of wonder, yes, but there were bad and/or terrifying things that happened, much like in C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia. I think this is a great movie for kids 10-12 and up who may have read some of the Oz books and are interested in seeing this interpretation of the world of Oz.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Various Holiday-themed Diana Krall tracks have popped up over the years, but CHRISTMAS SONGS is her first full-length Christmas album.  In recent years Diana has not rested on her laurels, musically-speaking.  Some such as myself have thought highly of her later albums, while others missed her earlier forays into pop/jazz standards.    CHRISTMAS SONGS should appeal to those on both sides of the fence, and will likely reach out to many newcomers as well.  The sense of effervescent, swinging fun that marked portions of her earlier albums is back on a number of tracks (\\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town,\\" \\"Jingle Bells,\\" etc.).  Meanwhile, those of us who feel she's emotively-deepened as a vocalist in the last few years will find ample evidence of that too, particularly on the ballads (\\"I'll Be Home For Christmas,\\" \\"White Christmas,\\" etc.).  Diana's accompiament also tries something new (for her): there's a tasty, compatible big-band on many tracks (courtesy of the Clayton/Hamilton Jazz Orchestra).  In addition, several ballads have string-dominated orchestrations (somewhat similar to those on THE LOOK OF LOVE).      Quite unusual for contemporary holiday albums is the lack of any attempts to write a new classic; there are no Krall-penned tunes here.  Most of the songs are among the holiday season's most oft-heard classics, but Diana's voice brings a fresh touch to them.  At times she effectively breaks out into scatting, and frequently tweaks the melodies to just the right extent as one would expect of a jazz singer.  Of course, her piano moves into the foreground at times as well.  Most if not all fans of Diana's late-1990s albums will be satisfied with this album from beginning to end, as will many who favor the recent discs.  It's safe to say that CHRISTMAS SONGS will prove to stand the test of time and become a classic seasonal album.

B00068NVI4|5.0|If you are a big YES fan, your eyes will be crossed after going into trance mode with this incredible dvd.  The production is top notch and the sound is excellent for a live setting.  Play guitar, play drums, bass or sing the hell out of these songs or just meditate and don't move a muscle (okay, even keyboards or a bouzouki will do), you will NOT BELIEVE the incredible level of musicianship these old friends achieve.  If ever anyone had a doubt, even after YES Symphonic - which was great, that YES could ever bring back the magic...you've been far too stingy with your appreciation!<br /><br />This concert disk is a YES-power-totem frisbee soaring to the stratosphere...WE HAVE HEAVEN!  Parts that thrilled me: South Side of the Sky, a deep cut from my favorite album (Fragile)...how great to see this rocked out again (not acoustic), they do a superb job!  Turn of the Century, the lost cut from Going for the One...unbelievably true to the original and played with total finesse and loving care...VERY BEAUTIFUL!  Long Distance Runaround (acoustic) - seeing the classic line-up play this with a playful but powerful tone and spirit - far @#^& out!!  Wouldn't it be nice to sit down with a few friends and play like that so effortlessly?  Wonderous Stories is a melodic, musical magic bell of a composition that Jon channels like a lost hymn.  And You & I is done very sweetly, I love this song, as do most YES fans...INSPIRED - and the set by Roger Dean is really majestic for the atmosphere here.  Ritual, the Topographic favorite of many (Pt. 1 - Revealing Science of God/Dance of the Dawn would be nice) is one of the main highlights for sure, they take this song to the limit!  How do they perform every nuance with such total recall, while still adding 30 years of musical growth?  WOW!  Yours is no Disgrace rivals the Yessongs version - this is one of the jam breaks for Steve.  For me, the huge surprise is this Starship Trooper (Symphonic's version is outstanding too) in the finale, already one of my favorite songs - they sound like Jehovas favorite choir doing this song (delivered with joy by all of them, but Jon particularly), and get a HUGE standing ovation afterwords...UNREAL!  It is a great opportunity to get a good look at great new material like Mind Drive and revisit early works like Sweet Dreams & Every Little Thing.<br /><br />They are so tuned into the magic of the music they have created it is a sight and sound to behold, the audience obviously thinks so!

This line-up of classic members are clearly back on the bus with the music and their relationships, they appear to be getting on very well together which is wonderful (and all healthy and happy).  Having Rick Wakeman back for this concert is reason enough to get it, he effortlessly rocks the house and plays his parts with precision.<br /><br />I see that there IS HOPE for getting older, even into your 60's and beyond, to seem ageless, timeless and plain old KICK ASS as you dance your way to oblivion...and they hopefully will be doing this for a long time to come!

B00097DXZS|3.0|all that i am...someone mentioned potporri...well it is a bit like that. we are, after all, a mix of a little bit of this and a little bit of that. i like the sound on most, and love the sound when carlos is center stage. why not 5 stars? mainly because of the copy protection. tsk tsk tsk. when will they learn? no worries. its on my mp3 player with minimal hassle. in mp3 format muahahaha. but i plan on buying another for the santana lovers in my family. it may not be new sound, but it is clean...not offesive...not embarassing...and something pretty much everyone at the office won't mind listening to. carlos just shows again he does very well on his own or with other artists complimenting him. after all...if you hear one of the songs on the radio...you'll say THAT'S SANTANA! even if he's not the one singing. i think \\"a bit of me\\" would have fit better though. \\"all that i am\\" can kinda trick you into thinking that's not much... but ok ok seriously. the cd is good. take off a star and a half for the stupid copy protection, and half a star for a few songs sounding a bit like previous material. 3 stars.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Sci-fi doesn't get much better than Serenity.  You'll find great action sequences, an intriguing plot, a cast who obviously loves their characters, and wonderfully original dialogue (I'm looking at *you* George Lucas).  Serenity is one of those movies that transcends the genre, like The Matrix.  Even if you don't like sci-fi, you'll find something to love in Serenity. <br /> <br />Based on the \\"failed\\" television series 'Firefly', Serenity takes place six months after the last episode in the series.  I say \\"failed\\" in quotes because after gross mismanagement of the series by Fox, Firefly came into its own on DVD, garnering a large, rabid fanbase (fans of the series are affectionately called Browncoats).  It continues to be one of Amazon's top DVD sellers. <br /> <br />I highly recommend picking up the DVD box set of Firefly before digging into this movie.  I know that sounds like a big commitment.  \\"You mean to tell me I have to watch 13 episodes of a failed TV show before I can watch this movie?!\\"  What I'm saying is that the show is incredible (although give it until about episode 8.  True love will set in.  Trust me.)  If you're even remotely interested in this movie, you're doing yourself a disservice by not watching the show. <br /> <br />That being said, I think Serenity stands on its own.  It has one of the most compelling villians I've seen in a sci-fi film (no sneering, every-action-movie-you've-ever-seen-villians here).  The cast is largely unknown, and I think that helps the movie because you don't have any preconceived notions about the actors.  The world is an original mash-up of American and Chinese culture, with a bit of the wild west thrown in for good measure.  The story, while generally sticking to sci-fi standards, is filled with little detailed touches of brilliance you haven't seen in a sci-fi movie since, well.. maybe the original Star Wars. <br /> <br />How about one of the opening scenes: The camera follows Mal as he walks around the ship, interacting with the crew.  The whole thing happens in one long shot, introducing you to the characters and giving you a feel for the ship.  Brilliant!  Look for the scene where Mal and Zoe are arguing in a corridor.  Notice the sound and lighting change, ever so subtly, and then let it sink in as to why.  How cool is that?  Look for the scene where River is on the verge of panic and prays \\"Please God, make me a stone.\\"  I love the dialogue in this movie.  It's witty and natural and funny as hell. <br /> <br />My guess is that most of the people reading this review are already fans.  But if you haven't seen this movie yet, do it.  We're always happy to have another Browncoat.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Like a few others, after watching the movie Serenity, I was intrigued enough about the show to rent the Firefly episodes. After watching a few episodes, I knew I had to own the series. I've consequently hooked my family and friends to being Firefly fans. <br /> <br />I love the sci-fi western mix, the dialogue, the characters (all nine crew members were perfectly cast), the stories are all superb. I don't think there is one bad episode in the season--just episodes that you have as favorites. And I have favorite moments of each episode. Another plus about this boxed set, is that the episodes are in the order the creators wanted and not how they were aired, so each episode, while self-contained, also builds the overall story. <br /> <br />The show perfectly balances humor, drama, action and mystery. What is the Shepherd's background? What exactly did the Alliance do to River? Who are the guys with blue hands?(some of which was NOT answered in the movie) <br /> <br />Anyway, a BIG thank you to Joss Whedon and the cast and crew for making such a terrific show. Please, please give this fan more.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Several things make Serenity not just your usual Sci-Fi movie. <br />1. There are no aliens.  Nope, nada, not a one.  This is about humans and how fraile and strong and stupid and brave we are.   <br /> <br />2. While it takes the Alien approach to scenery (everything looks lived in), a great deal of the action takes place on terra firma.  You see the sun more in this movie then in your average space thriller. <br /> <br />3.  The dialogue - Joss wrote it, it must be good. <br /> <br />4.  The boggey-man is real and he is us.  Plus, there's lots of them. <br /> <br />5.  No one is safe - again, Joss wrote it, so you never know who will get killed - but understand you're gonna cry like a baby. <br /> <br />and last, the characters - they will seepe into your brain and your heart and your very being.  You will see them as complete people, frustrated, raw, real.  And you will love everyone of them, even as you are sitting there cursing their names. <br /> <br />\\"I am a leaf in the wind, watch me soar.\\" <br />\\"Once you've been in Serenity, you never leave.\\"
B000002UAO|5.0|I felt that Rubber Soul was just a heartfelt cry for help...but I really found it to be the most original of the 13, though...I just purchased this to add to my collection. It was a stepping stone for the Beatles.I agree , there weren't alot of 'good' songs on it, but you have to be a true Beatlemaniac to enjoy this !! CH  ( Beatlegirl61 )
0451457994|4.0|The theme of this book is essentially the same as Childhood's End, another of Clarke's classics: a superior alien intelligence aids mankind in achieving the fabled next step of evolution that will cleanse us of our imperfections and make us into new creations.  I haven't watched the famous film version of this book yet, but as a Clarke fan I figured I ought to read the book that thrust him into the public spotlight.  I didn't enjoy this one nearly as much as Childhood's End or Rendezvous with Rama (considered by many to be Clarke's two best), but the book still highlights why Clarke is such a joy to read.  He achieves a perfect balance between adventure sci-fi and hard sci-fi, by imagining future world scenarios that are both believable and exciting.  Clarke is no master of characterization, but he is a master of evoking the wonder of the cosmos.  On the worldview level, I am tempted to be amused at the concept of aliens that aided man in his evolution from monkey to human and then on from human to demigod.  All worldviews posit a human problem and propose a solution that will bring mankind into his ideal state.  Clarke's version is interesting, but still ultimately a fantasy.  The Christian worldview claims that the problem is not an unfinished state of evolution, but sin, and the cure is not an alien intelligence, but the atoning work of Christ.   <br />
0060825219|5.0|The Alchemist, Eleven Minutes and By the River Piedra I Sat Down and Wept are magnificent stories, but undoubtedly, The Zahir is Coelho's most profound novel to date.  This beautiful story explores the significance of life through the transformation of the book's narrator, a self-consumed author obsessed with finding his missing wife.  The narrator guides the reader through his poignant exploration of mysticism and love.  This brilliant book is infinitely enjoyable.  It will metamorphose the psyche, altering our society's paradigmatic perspective on matters of the heart.  The Zahir is an exceptional tale and its essence resonates within my consciousness every day.
B00097DXZS|4.0|To all who are \\"dissing\\" the new CD - instead of being shallow dilettantes and dissecting the lyrics,guest artists, music, copy protection,etc - how about just feeling the joyful sound that comes from Carlos's fingers as he graciously shares his gift and his innate joy. If everyone were as gracious, humanistic, loving and joyful as Carlos then the world would indeed be a better place. So, instead of picking the CD apart as drivel, lighten up and just listen to the music of the man who embodies his art.
B000002UAC|5.0|This was a very original album...I love it ! It's on MY wishlist too. This was really a turning point in The Beatles lives...Put them up to the top !!They're at the top of my list.You've got to buy this... !!
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Richard Kelly is a twisted genius. Watching Donnie Darko is akin to having your brain pulled out of your head and stretched out like a rubber band. It is depressing and exhilarating, offensive and poetic, all at the same time. If you are only a casual moviegoer, do not watch this movie. If you are offended by vulgar language, do not watch this movie, as it has a lot of it, which seemed quite unnecessary to tell the story. But if you can get past that fact and the fact that this movie may well leave you feeling like your life is meaningless, by all means go ahead. It is essentially a sci-fi tale about time travel, but it takes a while before the viewer can actually figure that out. To many people it doesn't make much sense, and I had to read a few online explanations before I really understood it. At the very least I can say that Donnie Darko is original cinematic storytelling, even if I'm quite sure I never want to partake in this particular story again.  <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|It was still the same missing feeling in this PTA album...as compared with the last two albums (Ultra & Exciter)... Where is the definite DM sound (or should i say the missing distinct DM sound architected by ex-DM member, Alan Wilder) that we all very well familiar and being immitated by the producer in this PTA?     The unique of each DM albums... from the early electronic teen pop day in S&S and ABF albums, then the emerging of industrial soundscaping work in CTA, the most distinct adult, sexual album of SGR and the blackest album BC and the joyous & classic music for the masses of MFTM album, the most successful and violated DM album Violator and the tragic SOFAD album which withness the departure of Alan Wilder and the sad time goes on till now with the release of PTA. Kinda happy that the wait of 4 years for new DM materials is over. PTA bring back some old memories about DM... BUT, for PTA, it is a good try at least. The synth sounds sounded alike Erasure... Listened to PTA for few times and i just can't have enough and seem the album didn't done enough. DM can do much better... if they have more time and commitment in the making process. Anyway, I will still a 100% true DM fan and have been for 25 years and going strong.
B0002OERI0|3.0|This album is Ok and it's not as good as their earlier stuff. Dookie was a great CD filled raw emotion and it wasn't for anyone but themselves and it wasn't made to sell record. And i'm shocked that people would compare this album to the clash's london calling. That CD was one of the greatest CD's of all time by one of the greatest bands of all- time. And I'm only 13 an I know that
B00097DXZS|1.0|I just got this CD and nowhere are you pre-warned about the COPY PROTECTION all over this CD.  Who cares about the music at this point.  IPOD is not a destination, MP3 ripping is inhibited.  You may get it ripped but the output file will sound like trash.  You can copy it to your PC's hard disk but there it sits and requires keys to run.  No wonder SONY is having financial problems.  I'll return this tomorrow.  AVOID THIS CD and let ARISTA know how you feel.
0060763280|3.0|There's nothing new in this book that I haven't read or already knew from other books I have read.  I also think that the majority of the characters are fictional.<br /><br />The way the book is written is if you disagree you are probably poor you aren't succesful...hum.. I think most people who get these books are looking to improve financially.<br /><br />Part one of the book is so boring that I almost didn't want to finish and read part 2.  The second part does have good information, but like I said it's things I've already hear or read about before.<br /><br />If you have low self esteem and think you are never going to amount to anything, this is the book for you.  If you don't need a peep talk, look for another book you might be intrested in.
B00097DXZS|2.0|I have read all the review of new and long time fans, I agree with the long time fans, since Carlos success from Supernatural, he has been untouchable in the sense that those faithful who kept buying His music in the lean years just to get one or two good songs from each LP (that's a vinyl disc for you young folks)as well as attending concerts because they were affordable and because you were approachable then,now has become a lost message of freedom . Carlos, there is a quote from one of your songs, \\"Songs of Freedom\\" speaks about how you felt about music 20 years ago compared to who you are today.The fact that you or Arista put Copy write protection on the disk at this point of your career is absurd, plain and simple.Carlos,you have repeatly voice your distaste for the corporate world, yet here you are as part of it.the person who wrote to the rest of us to lighten up, just does not get it! Carlos was one in a million, the one musician who understood music at the level of Coltrane,Bola Sete, Miles,SRV and Jimi thats what hurts the most.I have been a fan for more than 30 years and like many others, carlos for many years was a Godsend, someone who stuck to thier priciples instead of pleasing the Masses just to make record companies happy.The last thought I will write in spanish. Carlos, tu fuistes una luz para mi en juventud, por parte de musica yo evite las calles violentas, por parte de ti encontre el mundo,la musica suprema y un heroe Mexicano. regresa, a tu raices de antes, ayi encontraras la luz de verdad.Que dios te vendiga siempre.

B00097DXZS|5.0|Santana has shown that he gets better with age. While it may have been tough to \\"out-do\\" his last two albums of duets, he shines on this one. \\"Just Feel Better\\" with Aerosmith's Steven Tyler is my personal favorite.
0767830555|5.0|\\"You talkin' to me?\\" <br /> <br />With those four words, a legend was born. <br /> <br />What more is there to say about Taxi Driver that hasn't already been said? Disturbing, gritty, dark, compelling... masterpiece. <br /> <br />Robert De Niro stars as Travis Bickle, who describes himself as \\"God's lonely man\\". He takes a job driving taxis because he can't sleep nights, and if he's going to roam New York City anyway, he might as well get paid for it. From here on out, the movie takes us INSIDE Travis's head. His thoughts, his feelings, his obsessions, his loneliness. This is why, although he is portrayed as a nut, the audience sort of feels for Travis (for the most part anyway). The viewer understands what is making him want to violently lash out at the messed-up world. We witness firsthand why he wants someone to \\"just flush this city right down the [edit] toilet!\\" <br /> <br />This movie portrays mid-70's NYC to a T. The hookers, pimps, pushers, they're all here, and they're all chipping away at Travis Bickle's sanity (what little he has left, anyway). <br /> <br />The two most pivotal points in the movie: when Travis finally meets an attractive woman named Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) and asks her out on a date, but screws it up badly... although Travis meant well (he honestly didn't know any better), Betsy decides to just ignore him. This is a situation almost all of us have been in, whether or not we took someone to a movie like that, and that only helps us sympathize with Travis. <br /> <br />The other pivotal point is when Travis meets a 12-year-old prostitute named Iris (Jodie Foster). Travis sees Iris as tied down, being stripped of her innocence and youth, and that he has to save her by any means necessary. <br /> <br />The best thing about Taxi Driver is that it doesn't give any easy answers. Is Travis Bickle a hero or a nutbar? And, most importantly, was Travis dead in the last scene, or is that really what happened? It is left up to the viewer to decide. <br /> <br />So, if you haven't seen this movie yet, see it (if you're not faint of heart, anyway). It's a classic, it made Bobby De Niro a legend, and it's a great movie to slap \\"Torque\\" in the face with. <br /> <br />\\"You're dead!\\"
0684853523|5.0|On Writing is as essential to any aspiring writer as a dictionary, a thesaurus, a book of baby names and Strunk and White's Elements of Style.ved in the creative process.  My father has used the basic principals on a computer program he's writing, and I've applied many of the techniques at my job.    Finally, King covers one more important thing in On Writing.  He speaks of the infamous accident where he was struck by a van.  On Writing was the book he was working on when he went walking that day, and it was the first book he went back to once he was well enough to start writing again.  In a way, it was the writing that pulled him through.  Of course, there was also his lovely wife.  Behind every successful male writer, there is a beautiful woman who keeps him in line.  Incidentally, I learned at Shore-Leave that David Mack, another Trek writer, also writes 1000 words a day.  He's gained quite a bit of success at it, and it is because he's got the discipline to stick to it.  In my opinion, On Writing is as essential to any aspiring writer as a dictionary, a thesaurus, a book of baby names and Strunk and White's Elements of Style.
B0009WFFS6|5.0|For the purist of the 60`s, this was a great reunion. To see these three great musicians perform once again was much more than I expected. Although Jack Bruce was a little short of the high notes in his vocals, he was still very strong in the songs of the past and hadn`t missed a thing over the years both vocally or in his bass. What has always captured my interest with Cream was the way all three would take a song and tie in the three differant styles to make one unique sound. To see them pull that back together again was beyond belief. Clapton`s version of \\"Stormy Monday Blues\\" was the best I`ve ever heard. Old blues classics are his specialties these days as is evident with the Robert Johnson songs but Clapton`s a master of these and other blues tunes and I will never get tired of his style. Ginger Baker continues to live up to the image of the drummers drummer. Again. The years have not taken away from his unique style and pulls everything together like no other drummer today. Watching him play makes me think that todays so-called rock drmmers could take a few lessons in interpretation of how a rock song can sound by watching and listening to Ginger Baker. All in all this was one of the best reunions today. It will be hard for some to appreciate this but for someone who`s a product of that era, it rocks. I can only hope that a U.S. tour may be in the works.
B00097DXZS|1.0|All that Carlos Santana is NOT is this sound and vision rock god he's created of himself to any currently popular artist who is coaxed to go for a brief ride onto the radio and best selling charts via a 'guest' role on a Santana track. Nothing new - and even when Rob Thomas was being exploited by Carlos, Santana was recycling old familiar riffs to unsuspecting new generations of music fans. Thomas' incredibly alluring vocal PRESENCE had more to do with the double diamond platinum selling \\"Supernatural\\" than Santana's legendary expertise on the guitar.[Rehash-Rehash.]Carlos took all credit for it - he overlooked the fact that ROB THOMAS was RED HOTTER than hell at the time. Carlos Santana used to have his own regular lead singer fronting his band - scoring hit after hit. He shamelessly exploits Pop/R&B's latest craze artists, and on occasion a veteran artist, for airplay, platinum awards and $$$. Even since the huge comeback, severe lack of creativity plagues these monotonous recordings as we hear Santana \\"just going through the motions\\" in the studio. Clive Davis should move on to the next \\"comeback\\" artist he desperately needs to redesign by rehashing the respective musical traits that once adorned and propelled such person to massive sales status in his/her past because the Santana saga has gotten old and boring as of late. If you really want to enjoy pure, undiluted, unhomogenized Santana Music - his very first three albums are available on remastered reissues here - go explore the magic of Santana's innovative brilliance on \\"SANTANA\\" - \\"ABRAXAS\\" - \\"SANTANA III\\".
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|As a general rule, a singer's best album will always be his or her compilation at any time in their career. Why purchase all Madonna albums when The Immaculate Collection would sum it up? Why bother looking for Britney's debut album when the only track worthwhile on it was to be found on Greatest Hits: My Prerogative? Certainly, Greatest Hits here sums up Shania Twain, the country-twanged diva who managed to make history by setting sale records and having major crossover to mainstream music. <br />Since every single record Shania has ever done sounds like a Greatest Hits by normal standards, its impossible to know where to begin. Shania has maintained high standards, beginning with a stunning debut, an exceptional sophomore followed by a smash called Come on Over, and by then the only way to go was 'Up'. Now, the album here sums up Shania's short but perfect catalogue in one CD.  <br />For those who are not big fans or dislike country music, like I did, then you'll still appreciate this. Shania transformed the whole image of country, and this CD basically shows how she did. All the songs were co-written by Shania with husband/producner John M Lange. The new songs are also worthwhile. Party For Two, available in two versions is a fun duet, which although underperformed on the pop charts still manages to be a groovy track to sample. Ain't No Quitter is a lazy, catchy song, despite a somewhat negative image, but overall, this album is THE album that represents country music at its best. A must buy for everyone, and as for Shania fans, well, no use telling you as you'd already have this...
B00097A5HW|5.0|I have every Shakira CD and I dont know how people can spend their time writing negative comments which are obviously out of jelousy and self centered in a certain type of music.  If you really listen to Shakira and compare her music starting with Pies Descalzos to Fijacion Oral.. you will see that there is change in every of them, and of course it is hard for people to accept and adapt to change.. like if it was something scary... so of course when they listen to something new they dont know if they like it.  I think you have to take the time to listen and really appreciate the changes and if you have any sense of music you will know what is good and what is not.  Of course in every CD there are songs you like and songs you dont.. like with every CD.  I think Shakira has made a great CD with Fijacion Oral, not only she sings, but composes, and produces.. which very few artists do.  Being an artist its about self expression and not about pleasing 100% of the people, and if jelous people insult the artist, their comments are not worth taking into consideration.  I think this CD is great and there is always something new in a new Shakira CD. If it was always the same it would be boring.
B000B0WODA|2.0|You could have done so much better! This album is such a let down. As a follow up to 2004's debt, which is one of the finest debt albums of all time; this is a poor effort. The hooks that captured Franz Ferdinand's tenacity have all but gone, the pure raw guitar sound that dominated the first album have been thrown out the window, replaced by quirky pretentious lyrics and boring instrumentation.<br /><br />The only songs that are remotely good are the opening and closing tracks (`Fallen' and `Outsiders'). In between they attempt to break new ground, but it doesn't work. They fail at a slow ballad `Eleanor put your boots on', which many critics say sounds like the Beatles. If the Beatles sounded like this then they would have sold very few records. `I'm your Villian' has its moments, but everything else sounds b-grade.<br /><br />They sound like a bad pub band, playing covers on a Friday night. If you liked their first album then keep listening to it. Don't bother with this one. Franz Ferdinand has slipped down the pecking order of great British rock bands.
B0001I55OC|1.0|I read the book and looked forward to seeing the movie.  I was so disappointed.  There was no depth to the characters, the story was week.  Also, many things were changed from the book to the movie.  They even changed some character's gender.  It was just a terrible adaptation.  The book was really good though.
1594200696|3.0|A copy of The Elements of Style has been on my shelf for more than 20 years now. It is a timeless, marvelous reference. Here, now, we have an illustrated edition. Wouldn't it be nice to actually see a few of the illustrations? I know what the original says. It's the pictures that make this edition much more expensive than the paperback version, so why not let me browse through a few here online? Guess I'll have to go to a bookstore (remember those?) and actually turn through the pages if this online offering won't show them to me.
0307276902|1.0|I already read it and I wish they would stop. This book is no good. It reminds me of F- grade Chuck Palahnuik. Enough of this already. NO MORE RECOMMENDATIONS
B00006CXSS|5.0|I'm not going to break down the series, episode by episode.  If you want a review of each episode, you should read K. Wyatt's review.  All I want to say is this series was probably THE best WWII drama I've seen to-date.  From bootcamp to the end of the war, the series takes you along with Easy Company and puts you right in the middle of the action with them as they jump into Normandy, fight through the hedgerows, take part in Operation Market-Garden, and even deal with the inactivity and boredom of post-war occupation.  Along the way, the story takes on some very potent issues, including the liberation of concentration camps.   <br /> <br />The comradery between the men of Easy company is touching.  I like how each episode keyed in on a different Easy Company member or a few different members.  I love the pre-episode interviews with the actual members of Easy.  And the post-series look into the Easy company survivors and their yearly reunions is also a treat. <br /> <br />This series definitely does not pull any punches.  In the mold of Saving Private Ryan, Hanks does not shy away from the brutality of war.  Besides actually going to France and walking the beaches and other areas of Normandy (which I've done), this series is about as close as you're going to get to experiencing WWII.   <br /> <br />Definitely an instant classic of a film series.
B000067IZ3|5.0|But has anyone noticed she has put on a lot of weight lately, if look at her pictures on IMDB she looks porked out unfortunately. <br /> <br />Anyway, this movie is good but unrealistic. I've been to Cincinnati. IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THE 1970s SOUTH BRONX PEOPLE. Jeez. Why are movie slums so unrealistic? Haven't movie makers heard of a little thing called URBAN RENEWAL that has cleaned up the slums since the early 1990s? Anyway, there is no neighborhood in Cincinnati that looks ANYWHERE near as bad as they show in the movie. You notice they do that a lot in cop shows too, they show neighborhoods that looked like war zones that haven't existed since 1992. Get with the times already people.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|This is it.  This CD is the real deal.  I'm not just talking the greatest Slipknot album, the greatest live album, the greatest metal album.  I'm talking the GREATEST ALBUM OF ALL TIME.  And I am not joking.  From the downbeat of \\"The Blister Exists\\" to the entire crowd chanting, \\"I am the push that makes you move\\" at the end of \\"Surfacing\\" this CD is the most powerful, most intense, greatest collection of 24 songs ever issued on a compact disc.   <br /> <br />To say that Slipknot is known for their live shows is an understatement.  Anytime a band with 9 people gets on stage it's a sight to be seen.  Anytime a band with 9 people gets on stage wearing terrifying masks to play the purest, loudest, most aggressively intense music of all time, it is something that must be heard by the world as a whole.  Slipknot's sound is undisputable, their message undeniable.  This band is amazing.  Some people think it's just overly angry, but those people do not know what they are talking about.  Slipknot is, without a doubt, one of the greatest bands of all time.  They take their spot with Pantera and Korn in the echelons of revitalizing and recreating the hardcore, \\"metal\\" sound, and that sound is brought to a whole new level when heard live.  The screams of the fans, the pure hoarseness in Corey's voice as he continually screams for fans to give Slipknot everything they can.  The Slipknot live experience is captured near perfectly on this CD.  Not only that, but it's less than $20!  How is that not perfect?!   <br /> <br />If you were ever a fan of Slipknot on album, in concert, or on the live DVD, \\"Disasterpieces\\" this CD is a must own.  It's absolutely the best Slipknot CD ever.  If you've never heard Slipknot before, even if you don't like music like this, pick this CD up right now!  It's guaranteed to blow your mind in one way or another.   <br /> <br />Oh yeah, and the best spoken line on the CD from Corey is definitely the speech he gives before \\"Purity\\" when he says, \\"This next song is about a girl in a box...shhh...this song is called Purity.\\"  It's priceless.  Absolutely do not miss CD.  It's perfect.
B00097DXZS|1.0|When will the record companies realize that people like me want to listen to music on our IPODs?  No more copy protected CD's for me.  As for \\"All That I Am\\"...this is Santana's 3rd attempt at the \\"let's bring in currently popular musicians and have Santana play over middle of the road pop music\\".  I thought Supernatural was great.  Shaman was OK, but enough already.  The 3rd attempt isn't nearly as exciting.  It doesn't even sound like Santana anymore.  His great guitar tones are wasted over sunny throwaway tunes.  I want to hear Santana again.  Not Bo Bice.  Save your money.
B00000JPYD|5.0|I spent the 70s hanging around mostly with musicians. Not having any particular talent with an instrument, I ended up doing studio production, concert promotion, soundboard work, etc. This was because I was in college and had the time to spend on such things, even if they didn't bring in much money. <br /> <br />Professional musicians always have a lot of time on their hands. That's a real luxury - time you can spend really listening to other musicians' work, for one thing. When this album hit the racks in '74, just about every musician I knew was listening to it intently. There's much to like here, the clean production, Trower's light touch, DeWar's vocals and Isidore's brisk drumming. It's one of the all-time great rock guitar albums, right up there with Jeff Becks' \\"Blow by Blow.\\" <br /> <br />And that's where the time porn comes in. I can remember listening to this album for the first time with two pals of mine, sitting on a deck one sunny afternoon with the stereo speakers sitting in an open window. We listened to it three times in a row, pointing out little bits of interest. And even today (2005) I can't hear this without stopping what I'm doing to listen. It's music that demands to be heard, it can't be background noise. <br /> <br />Makes me lust for more extra time in the day, time spent listening to music or reading or walking around in the fresh air. A few minutes with Trower and company is time well spent.
B000AY74OG|5.0|This movie combines humor for adults in the same jokes as for the kids! When the kids are laughing, so are the grown ups. This movie isn't like others I've seen (like Finding Nemo for example) where the knee slapping comedy for the adults is sparsely strewn throughout the show, Madagascar is packed full of laugh out loud fun for the whole family!
B00003IPFK|5.0|Owned the VHS first, I had to have it on DVD. I have watched it many times over the years. An absoloute superb cast. The performances by Robert Duvall and Tommy Lee Jones are both excellent and priceless. This and Tombstone are debatabley the 2 best westerns ever made. Lonesome Dove is a must have.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity is the movie spin-off of the much loved Firefly TV series, which was canceled mid season due to Fox's stupidity.  <br />  The film takes its name from the ship, Serenity, which is a Firefly class transport. Her crew will take on any job, as long as it pays. She is captained by Mal Reynolds (Nathan Fillion)who fought on the losing side of a civil war. First Mate Zoe (Gina Torres) fought alongside Mal in the war. Wash (Alan Tudyk) is the charismatic pilot, and Zoe's husband. Rounding out the crew is the chipper mechanic Kaylee (Jewel Staite), a more than able mercenary Jayne (Adam Baldwin), a doctor, Simon (Sean Maher), and his unstable sister River (Summer Glau). <br />   Simon and River are on the run from the totalitarian government, the Alliance. The Alliance had been preforming heinous experiments on River and Simon manages to get her back. Not willing to let their prize go, and concerned she may have gleaned top secret information, the Alliance sends an Operative to retrieve River and Simon. In the first scene you see to what lengths the Operative will go to achieve his mission. <br />   Mal is mainly concerned with keeping his crew safe and fed, which becomes increasingly harder as the Operative closes in on his prey. The longer they run, the more obvious it becomes that River has many secrets that even she doesn't know, hidden under layers of psychosis.  And then there are the Reavers, a group of cannibalistic killers who rape and murder all along the raggedy edge of space to deal with. Serenity and her crew are in for one helluva ride! <br />   Serenity has what makes any film great, real characters, great action, laugh out loud humour, thrilling heroics, and an ending that, well, you just have to see! This is what the new Star Wars should have been. I hope you took notes George. <br />  Joss Whedon's gift of storytelling is at its best here. Serenity will surprise and astonish you, make you jump, gasp, laugh and cry all at the same moment, and itwill leave you with that feeling that only a great film can give you. You know that feeling of \\"this movie just ended, but I don't want to leave yet. I want to see it again, and keep these characters with me for a long time.\\"
B00092ZL80|5.0|This show is marvelous. I've been a Chicago fan since their first album in the late 60's. Chicago's Color My World was our Prom theme (Color our World) and at our wedding we had a group much like chicago, needless to say I am a Chicago fan. I saw Earth Wind and Fire live in concert at the Ontario Speedway in 1974 at the California Jam. These are \\"True Musicians\\" Both bands ROCK and I mean Rock! See the show you will not be sorry.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I don't want to give too much away because this is the type of movie that is better enjoyed not knowing what's to come so I will try and keep this a very general review and set up the premise.<br /><br />This movie had me literally enthralled from the opening scene to the last image on screen.  The story had something for everyone, scares, screams, laughter and intrigue.  In some cases you were laughing one second and gasping a second later.  The characters are richly written and you really feel connected to each and everyone of them, including the assassin!<br /><br />The lead characters, Mal & River, are two totally different people but caught up in the same web by the overly controlling alliance government.  River, a teenage girl, was falsely lured away from her family to attend a school for \\"gifted\\" children.  But it was a cover for the government to use children with psychic abilities, enhance those natural gifts and use them for their own purposes.  River's brother, realizes something isn't right and rescues his sister and they end up on Mal's ship named Serenity.  Mal is a soldier who fought against the Alliance but was on the losing side and has made every efforts to live on the outskirts of civilization.  But, he feels an obligation to protect River and fight the Alliance assassin that has been sent to hunt her down and kill her.<br /><br />Every character in this movie is interesting and fun to watch.  If you are a fan of the series, you'll already be familiar with the crew of Serenity but you do not need to have seen the series to enjoy this movie.  Joss Whedon does an excellent job of introducing the characters in the beginning of the movie and getting on with a roller coaster of a story.  The villain is one of the best villains I've ever seen in a movie and if there ever is a sequel they could probably spin off something with this guy alone (but I hope not because I want more of the crew of Serenity).<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie.  I'm a huge sci-fi buff and I've seen all the Trek movies and all the Star Wars movies but this one, in my opinion, is the next level of sci-fi entertainment.  Star Wars was a great franchise and really introduced the world to fantastic big screen adventures and Star Trek took a beloved TV show to the big screen and it was a joy to see but Serenity is the best of both these worlds and manages to be that big screen sci-fi adventure that is richly character driven and a blast to experience.
B00005RHGL|5.0|Probably the most accurate account ever produced on film. Val Kilmer is an absoloute superb Doc Holiday who should have won awards for his performance and Kurt Russell is a great Wyatt Earp. I watch this moive serveral times a year. I firstowned this film on VHS, however, having the director's cut on DVD with all the extras is the ultimate experiance. This is a must see film, western fan or not, it's a must see. Something for everyone in this film. <br />
B0009P42UK|4.0|As a long time fan of the movie, seeing it on the PSP was jsut as good. There are no special features, but let's face it, you've probably already bought the DVD anyway.  The sound was incredible, and I've heard things I never heard before.  Worth the money, and I think Henson is making a sequel soon!
B0001NBMBC|1.0|If you still love slip-knot-pop-rock, get it <br /> <br />If you are looking at these reviews to decide whether to buy this album, take a second to think about who you would tell if you bought it.

031286504X|5.0|I am a huge horror fiction fan and lately I've been widening my collection to include older books (I usually read King, Laymon, Little, Lee, etc). So I picked up I am Legend b/c I've heard it is a classic vampire book. I can tell you I am not disapointed, this book was excellent and easy to read. I found it so interesting and fast paced I finished it in one day. The book is about Robert Neville, a man who had survived an epidemic that has turned everyone into vampires.  He has barricaded himself in his house, venturing out in the daytime to get supplies and hunt vampires. The story is compelling as he struggles with his solitude and tries to figure out why people have changed and if there is a cure.  This is a classic vampire novel and has earned a permenant place on my bookshelf!
B00097DXZS|1.0|It's copy protected so it cannot be ripped onto my IPOD in superior sound quality. On top of that, the sound is poor - poorly recorded.  <br /> <br />It's the record company formula and the artist seems to be buying into it (along with the copy protection). It certainly is NOT anything from 68-78. To each his own. I'm returning it as well tomorrow.
B000A0GP0Y|5.0|The Longest Yard (1974) has been one of the most popular football movies ever made. Director Peter Segal undertakes a major feat to recreate this movie to fit with current times. He uses the same exact story line and most of the original dialogue. With a slight change of setting and characters, the movie draws in all audiences. <br /> <br />In the original, Burt Reynolds plays the role of the main character, Paul Crewe, a former football player accused of shaving points and who ends up back in jail after violating his parole. Reynolds plays his typical macho man role. In the past, it seems that Crewe was a good, honorable man (shaving points to help his father) and later turned bitter. For example, in the first scene of the movie, he throws around his girlfriend during an argument. Shortly after, he assaults two cops trying to question him in a bar.  <br /> <br />In contrast, Paul Crewe is played by Adam Sandler in the remake. Sandler has always played underdog roles (trying to take over his fathers company in Billy Madison, the younger brother trying to save his father in Little Nicky, etc.). In The Longest Yard (2005) Sandler tries to reach out past his normal group of viewers to become the lovable bad guy. In the beginning of the movie, rather than arguing back and being physical toward his girlfriend, he explains that he has a present for her and ends up locking her in the closet. When Crewe - played by Sandler - arrives at the prison, he is hated by almost everyone. He works to gain the approval of the inmates (unlike Reynolds in the original, who was not as hated by his inmates). For example, in order to recruit one the basketball players (Megget - played by Nelly), he is forced to play a brutal game of one-on-one with one of the inmates.   <br /> <br />One of the biggest contrasts is casting. The majority of the inmates, in the original, are black, and most - if not all - of the guards are white. Similarly, most of the football players on both teams are whitewhereas all of the male cheerleaders in the audience are black. Also, the main character and his best friend are both white. On the contrary, in the remake, there is a high amount of diversity among the convicts in the prison. In addition, there is a deal of diversity among the football players and the cheerleaders. An element found in the remake that would have been very controversial in the original was the idea that the main character's best friend was black (Caretaker - played by Chris Rock). The new movie reflects the social changes that have taken place over the last thirty years.  <br /> <br />Finally, the two versions of the movies draw different audiences. Though there are a few funny parts of the movie, the original is somewhat of a serious, purely entertaining movie. There are some good, well-known actors. The movie is rated R and draws the interest of adults. In contrast, the remake of the movie draws in audiences of all kinds. The cast of this movie is phenomenal: masters of comedy, NFL players, WWE wrestlers, rappers, and popular actors and actresses. Every member of the movie's audience can recognize someone. The new version of the movie is definitely a comedy packed with many one-liners and hilarious scenes.  <br /> <br />Both The Longest Yard (1974) and The Longest Yard (2005) are great movies. Trends and time periods are the only thing that sets them apart from one another.
B00000F6LQ|5.0|If you know and love this movie, you should get this Collector's Edition asap: the extras are fabulous, and the special \\"High Definition\\" presentation with \\"pink frilly edges\\" looks just as gloriously bad as it does on any other DVD released so far. For a movie set in Middles Ages and shot in the 1970s, it's better than what you might expect. The packaging is really shoddy, with a famous glue strip that tried to break the extras DVD when I attempted to remove it from the box. Once I accomplished the extraction, I struggled for a long while, trying to figure out how to place the second DVD back in the cumbersome box of not-quite-so-sturdy construction, which basically fell apart after opening. However, is it not in the spirit of Monty Python, to have this opus magnum housed in a box whose condition mimics this of the cheap collapsing Camelot model in the film? I placed the second DVD in an empty plastic box and proceeded to discover the wonders of this deranged collection- which is great beyond words.<br />For starters, there is The Senitype, \\"a single 33-milimeter frame from the original motion picture negative\\", which comes framed in a cardboard file describing how to start collecting the yearly editions of the frame and warns you that while it is not a laxative.... well, you need to get the box to find out the rest.<br />The print edition of the script, the singalongs, the documentaries, the subtitles for People Who Don't Like the Film, the Japanese version of the movie and the Lego Block version of the Camelot Scene (my favourite!).. It will take you a couple of hours, at least, to go through the whole magnificent lot.<br />This is one collector's edition which lives up to its title, and it does it to the optional soundtrack in \\"glorious old-fashion mono\\", and animated menus with \\"very loud surround sound.\\" Highly recommended.
B000B19BCG|5.0|This is the best Supergrass album&#8211;heck, the best album I've listened to period&#8211;in a couple of years. The previous album that had this much of an impact on me (and my stereo which hasn't stopped spinning since) was The Flaming Lips' \\"Yoshimi Battles The Pink Robots\\". I don't know what these people are talking about calling this album \\"disappointing\\"! Far from it! This is simply good music. This is what rock should be. These songs try to take you back to a time when music was in fact music! I can't stop listening to it, whether I'm on the road or in bed. All the tracks are catchy and were instant favorites of mine. And as you keep listening, the songs just keep getting better. You start picking out a riff or a sound that you didn't notice before. \\"Road To Rouen\\" is a bit Beatlesque, but in a good way. The Beatles had good song structure, and I think Supergrass is tapping into that on this album. The first track, \\"Tales of Endurance\\" starts out like an album should; instrumentals building up to the vocals. This album isn't mellow, but it could be to some people. It's just a bit more relaxing than those prior. If their song \\"Late In The Day\\" were an album, this would be it. <br /> <br />Anyway, I highly recommend it. The fact that I'm on here writing a review for it is a testament to how awe-struck I am by \\"Road To Rouen\\". I've never had the motivation to write a music review before!
B000AARKOO|3.0|I liked this film in the theater.  It was fairly easy to discern fact from fiction, however, I didn't find the fictionalized elements as distracting as usual in an historical epic.  Overall I thought it was enjoyable, but I would REALLY like to see the rumored longer directer's cut of the film.  Supposedly it allows for more character development and explains some of the holes in the theatrical version.  As much as I hate double dipping by studios, in this case, I'm actively encouraging it; realease the longer Director's cut.  As the movie stands, it was enjoyable but forgettable.    EDIT:  Having now purchased and watched the 4-disc director's cut I can unequivocally recommend that version.  Quite frankly I am bewildered as to why the extended version was not released in theaters; I can only imagine the producers felt that people wouldn't want to sit through so long a film.  I, however, would gladly sit through a film of this length and quality than most of the dreck that is made these days.  I would give the 4-disc director's cut 5 stars.

0316776963|5.0|This book hooked me on David Sedaris.  I was howling from page one!  After finishing this book, I went on to read three more books by him.  Thus far, this book has been the one I've enjoyed the most.  Maybe it just set the standard too high? <br /> <br />(However, I must admit that my husband read the first two pages and never even broke a smile.)
B00082IJ08|5.0|that so many people compare this to the first ablbum and talk about how they don't like it as much. I've heard this everywhere, not just on Amazon. The truth is, this album is absolutely phenomenal. Whether or not you liked the first one, at least take a listen to the samples of this one. It's worth it. <br /> <br />Demon Days is a breath of fresh air. I just bought it a week ago and I'm still completely obsessed with it. If I turn on the radio I can't listen for more than a few minutues without saying \\"This sucks, I'm gonna listen to Demon Days some more.\\" I almost feel like buying it was a bad idea because it will be a while before I can stand to listen to other music again.  <br /> <br />Everything else is old and stale. Demon Days is something else. The catchy beats, the careful mixing, the emotional songs. It's just awesome. Buy it.
B00008AB5D|5.0|I bought this CD because of the sound quality. David Coverdale and EMI is a winning combo. I own just about everything there is Whitesnake. I even go to church with Tommy Aldridge. I saw Whitesnake perform 6/2005 in Hollywood. Coverdale isn't you're run of the mill old comeback rock star who can barely sing. NO he still has the most awesome voice in Rock and stage presence to boot. He looks great. The chicks still go crazy over'em. If your not sure about which best of Whitesnake CD to get? This be the one cause it sounds so good. 24k gold music. I can't wait to buy and see the new Still of the Night DVD. T.R.
B000ASDFJU|1.0|What the description for this box set doesn't tell you is that it is half again as tall and half again as wide as a standard DVD, so it won't even fit on the same shelf as the rest of your DVDs.  And as nice as the suede album cover might look, inside it's just a ring binder with cheap cardboard DVD holders. Definitely not the high quality boxed set I was looking forward to.  And I really was looking forward to having a decent box set of Sex and the City, since the individual season DVDs had such flimsy plastic cases (very prone to ripping at the edges if you open them at all frequently). <br /> <br />Now I'm kicking myself for having sold my individual DVDs to buy this boxed set.  Maybe in another few years they'll come out with a box set in which they do *not* skimp on the packaging.  SatC is the only series I've seen that has such consistently shoddy packaging.  I really don't understand why.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|In 2002, Joss Whedon, the creator of 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer' and 'Angel' brought to television a new series called 'Firefly.' Despite being loved by the fans, it was unjustly tried and convicted by studio execs and killed off after only airing 11 episodes. 'Serenity' is the major motion picture from the 'Firefly' 'Verse... <br /> <br />The film starts off with some background on the characters of Simon and River Tam, and how Simon frees her from an Alliance \\"school\\" where she has been subjected to numerous horrific tests. We also are introduced to the main Villain of the film, \\"The Operative.\\" His job is to find the Tam's and bring them back. <br /> <br />We then cut to the ship \\"Serenity\\" as she is flying through space towards a planet where it's crew - lead by Captain \\"Mal\\" Reynolds, has a job waiting for them. Captain Reynolds and his crew are - for lack of a better term - people for hire. You need something done/stolen/etc., you call on the crew of \\"Serenity.\\" We also learn that two of the \\"crew\\" of \\"Serenity\\" - Shepherd Book and Inara Serra - have left the ship in the intervening months (this film supposedly takes place 6 months after the \\"Firefly\\" episode \\"Objects in Space\\"). <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that things go wrong, and this leads directly into the peril that the crew will face from the \\"Operative\\" and his masters, the \\"Alliance.\\" Captain Reynolds and his crew have several tasks to undertake: keep one step ahead of the enemy; find out what secret is driving River Tam insane, and protecting themselves against other evils, not only in the blackness of space, but the evil that man can do to his fellow human beings. <br /> <br />This all comes together in an enormous space battle between the Alliance and a group of mutants called \\"Reavers.\\" It seems like nearly every science-fiction movie has to have a space battle, but this one was very smartly thought out. <br /> <br />The music was composed by David Newman, and he did a magnificent job. He had action cues where needed, suspenseful cues when called for, and basically hit every note right in scoring this film. It definitely added to the story, as most excellent film scores are designed to do. <br /> <br />There is almost everything in this film that any fan of Firefly, or any fan of science fiction, can appreciate. It has suspense, warmth, action, adventure, terror, and all of it rolled up into a two-hour movie. This is a film that actually was intelligently shot and produced, not like many films that come out of Hollywood today, where you can check your brain at the door because of the films' simplistic and stupid pandering to the masses. \\"Serenity\\" stands above all that: it brings you into the story, does its level best to get you emotionally attached to the characters, so you feel what they feel, and care about them. That is the function of a well-written film: to get you involved with the characters. <br /> <br />Hopefully this is not the end of Captain Reynolds and the crew of \\"Serenity\\" on the big screen (or small screen). A film (or television show) like this comes only once in a great while, and it deserves every accolade it can garner. Fans of the TV show and non-fans alike will be able to enjoy this film. The fans because they can re-connect with their favorite characters and the non-fans can enjoy a great science-fiction film. <br /> <br />It's too bad that Universal Home Video doesn't include trailers on their DVDs anymore. Also, they could have waited to put this out, and made it a real good release. But they usually double-dip, so there will be a \\"special edition\\" within months.
0802130208|5.0|I read this book around 1988 and have passed it around to friends over and over again.  I have picked it up and reread it all the way through and also just poked through it.  Ignatius is quotable, his sad, pathetic self is an amusing portrait of a loser, and self proclaimed intellectual who just can't get it together in this life.
B000BBOUU4|2.0|Not great things in the movie:  Unmemorable songs, needlessly protracted ending, decision to have the Oompa Loompas played by a single actor just seemed cheesy. <br /> <br />Good things: Looked great, and Johnny Depp's interpretation of Willie Wonka was excellent.   <br /> <br />So, I thought it was only okay.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This latest album from Opeth is quite possibly their best to date in my opinion. The metal is excellent, and the band never fails to throw in a nice, beautiful flow of music within the metal itself. This one is played often in my cd player!
B00097DXZS|1.0|Sorry, I was so disappointed! It was a bore, Let down like a kid on Christmas day!
B000002UAX|5.0|In hindsight, maybe the Beatles demise two albums after the White Album could have been predicted.  Over six years and ten albums the Beatles had continued to top themselves with every release.  And the White Album was proof that even Sgt. Pepper could be topped.  But it was as if, with the White Album, they had provided the masses with a template of everything that popular music could be.  It was untoppable and, as great as Abbey Road was, it wasn't better than this.  And, for these lads, that might have done more to bring on the end than all the well known squabbles that were going on.    This album does indeed go all over the place but that only works in its favor.  The first seven songs of disc 2 (which originally comprised side 3) are a perfect example.  The exhuberant rock and roll of Birthday is followed by the modern blues of Yer Blues, then the country folk of Mother Natures Son, then back for a dose of hard rock with Everybody's Got..., then the album rock (before there was such a term) of Sexy Sadie, followed by the shredding proto metal of Helter Skelter, and closing with the gorgeous ballad Long Long Long.  Far from being jarring, it makes for a captivating listening experience and the whole album is like that.  Nobody else was doing this because nobody else could.      It's all here folks.  You want retro rock and roll? You get Back in the USSR.  Hard rock? There's Birthday and Everybody's Got Something... Folk? Mother Nature's Son and Blackbird.  Country?  Rocky Racoon and Don't Pass Me By.  Confessional singer songwriting? Julia and Sexy Sadie.  Psychedelia? Glass Onion and Happiness is...  British Blues? Yer Blues.  Reggae? Obladi Oblada.  70s style album rock? While My Guitar...  I could keep going, but you get the picture.  However, all this genre crossing would be unimpressive were it not so successful.  But the Beatles were able to inhabit each genre and produce outstanding songs in each.  There really may be no other album like this in the entire rock catalog.    Much has been written about the individual Beatles acting as each others' backing band at this point. But listen to these songs and it does not come across as a bunch of session musicians backing each other up.  It comes across as a group of musicians with extraordinary songwriting abilities and who are supremely confident in their abilities.  True, they were writing independently at this point.  But, in laying these tracks down, it's clear they were working as a band, and an excellent one at that.    Of course, an album of such musical breadth is bound to have some weaknesses.  Revolution 9 fails spectacularly but it also shows that they were willing to take risks.  Honey Pie provides a glimpse into some of the treacle that Paul would produce in his solo career.  But pretty much everything else is terrific.  If someone were to arrive from outer space and ask \\"what is rock music?\\", I'd hand him a copy of the Beatles' White Album.  I can't think of another individual album that would provide such a comprehensive response to that question.
B000BEZPQE|5.0|All I have to say is that when I was able to, I got this freakin' album off the shelf and into my stereo. I know that Slipknot is awesome live... I haven't had the pleasure of seeing them live, but I have seen many videos.  And each one is awesome!!!  All I have to say is that they did an amazing job in each song... and what makes it better... all the songs are their GREAT GREAT ones.  The only thing that I think is missing is either Prosthetics or Only One, because I would like to here what Corey sounds like when he raps live... but other than that... COREY AND SLIPKNOT DID AN AMAZING JOB LIVE ON THIS CD!!! <br /> <br />It is a must have if you are a fan of Slipknot!  Or if you just like good Metal!  And you're stupid if you say that Slipknot is not metal... they're not sold out... and yes I am referring to their new album.  SLIPKNOT FOREVER!
B0002O0CM0|5.0|Not to knock Jim Morrison, but these two albums are just as good as the rest of the catalog. It may take a little while for this to grow on you, considering the star power of Morrison, but this is worth your money! Finally, I get one of my favorite songs,\\"Mosquito\\", on a proper album instead of the Canadian version of the \\"Best of\\"!
B00005JNZP|3.0|The book is amazing, but the movie leaves much to be desired. The back and forth from present day to wartime and the small stories are what make Illuminated as good as it is, and the movie utilizes only one or two of these little histories while getting way too into the 'he's writing a book' plot and less into the cool story. it's too bad. If I hadn't read the book already I may have liked it more. But it was a very silent movie, and I found myself getting bored at the cliched montages and fast-rolling cloud sequences.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|This show surprised me with its wit, its heart, its intelligence and its humor.  I didn't want to like it (too popular!) but I fell in love with it anyway when it finally came to syndicated television.  The four female characters are by turns glamorous, imperfect and neurotically, lovably real in their own individual ways, but it is Sarah JP's Carrie -- a writer with an improbable weakness for stilettos and dresses that cost a month's rent -- who is clearly the heart and soul of the show.  Much of the insight into personalities and problems (oy, there are so many problems!) comes naturally through her eyes and rarely, if ever, feels forced.  No small thing for a TV show.  Though she is the least conventionally good looking of any of the four friends, she is in many ways the most effervescent and irresistible.  Her honesty, her deep hunger for meaning, beauty and fulfillment, her smarts and her belief in herself and (even more so) her best girlfriends make this character one for the ages.  To simply call this show \\"smart\\" or \\"sexy\\" or even to say that it \\"captures the zeitgeist\\" is simply to do it a disservice.  It is a nuanced, heart-on-the-sleeve valentine to the real romance of life, friendship and the not-always-successful pursuit of happiness.  The victory isn't always in the getting, but more often in the trying.  Somehow the people who made this terrific show got that, and didn't forget it.<br /><br />That the entire enchilada is now being served up in a delicious, raspberry pink boxed set is only fitting.  Style for the stylish, but much more than mere \\"pretty\\" beats beneath the sueded finish of this attractive package.  Sex and the City showed that there is still room in television for smart writing, original thinking, and characters with genuine, human vulnerabilities beneath their streetwise, world weary ways.<br /><br />The packaging is only just the beginning ...
B00097DXZS|1.0|Despite the fact I sampled and enjoyed most of the music on this CD at a local store, I will not be purchasing this or any CD implementing Sony's latest generation of copy-protection.  Preventing people who purchase this album from making legal backups or copies for their own personal use on MP3 players is a completely unacceptable practice, and should be stopped.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, the software installed by this CD cloaks its presence on your computer, disguises itself as something else in case the average user stumbles onto references to it, and has the potential to damage computers if not removed properly (which isn't as easy as going to Add/Remove programs, as it is not listed there). <br /> <br />For more information on this new, malicious form of copy-protection, I suggest googling \\"sony+DRM+rootkit\\".
B00000I2I7|5.0|I'd been a long-time Sting fan since the Police days until ironically up to this album.  I've found that all his albums after this one have come up short and in many ways seem to be attempts at recapturing the magic he created on this album but alas not succeeding.  Yes, he had great singles after this album but not great albums which just goes to show just how good this album really is.  As a cohesive, flowing, piece of work with track after track of great songs, this album was clearly his best ever.  The only bum track here relative to the rest which probably would have been better left off the whole album would be \\"We'll Be Together\\" which just seems to stand out as the weakest track of the lot.  This version is not only remastered for a great sound, although the first track seems a little soft but thankfully the volume levels seem to adjust to their proper levels by the end of the 2nd track, and also comes with a great bonus video track on Quicktime which is the video of the best track on this disc, \\"An Englishman in New York.\\"  Great songwriting both lyrically and musically, great arrangement especially on the Jimi Hendrix standard, \\"Little Wing\\" (almost as good as the one the Corrs did)and even the liner notes are penned by Sting himself all make for a worthwhile purchase.  Highly recommended as the best version of this album that is currently out there.
B0001MDPV8|5.0|Not much needs to be said about this album except... it's Nas aka the gods first album and is the definition of a classic album. NAS is a legend, always will be, and with illmatic the legend was born. <br /> <br /> <br />BUY IT, it's a steal.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I've seen this movie twice, with friends who were Firefly fans and with total newcomers to the story.  Every one of them has come away saying \\"what a great movie\\".  The reason is not complicated, it's just that with all the big budget effects and action sequences that are part of the standard package these days, we've forgotten how satisfying a movie can be when it has an ensemble of characters we care about and a story which is well written and well acted.  Serenity does have the \\"fun factor\\" of a rollicking sci-fi adventure yarn, the sort of feel Star Wars used to have, but it also has a depth that leaves you well satisfied and keen to go right back in and see it all again.<br /><br />The DVD extras are a bonus, and whilst I'd like to see more of them, any shortcomings here aren't nearly enough reason to reduce a full 5/5 score for this particular movie.
B0000640RX|5.0|Why are Sly's movies so great?  <br /> <br />1.) The face.  <br />Every time I watch a movie like Over The Top, I can't help but laugh. If you've watched the epic arm wrestling battle between Hawk and Bull Harley, you know exactly what I'm talking about. sylvester has that awesome face that only he can make... you know, the one that makes it look like he's taking one monster of a dump. Not only that, but while he's making the face he's usually grunting like he's taking one monster of a dump.  <br /> <br />2.) The voice.  <br />Sly's got that voice that draws laughs from everybody. There are certain phrases he says that can make me laugh no matter what mood I'm in. Sly's got some sort of wierd Brooklyn-ish accent that makes it tought for him to say his \\"r's\\" and his \\"th's\\"... as a result, \\"they\\" comes out as \\"dey\\", and a name like Adrian comes out sounding like \\"ADE-WIAN!\\" Here's a listing of some of my favorite Sly sayings:  <br /> <br />From Over The Top : \\"My hat, it's like a switch... when I turn it backwards, I feel like a machine. I feel... kinda like dis twuck back heah!\\"  <br /> <br />From Rocky : \\"ADE-WIAN!!!! ADE-WIAN!!!!\\"  <br /> <br />From Rambo - First Blood : \\"Dey dwew first bwood, not me! Dey dwew first bwood.\\"  <br /> <br />From Judge Dredd : \\"I AM DA WAW!\\"  <br /> <br />3.) He's Rambo!  <br />Respect! This is the guy who portrayed John Rambo, the veteran from Vietnam who was harrased by law enforcement officials in a small town... arrested, for vagrancy! The movie was a classic then, and it remains a classic to this day. I don't care what you say, Rambo rocks the Casbah, and I wish Sly would star in another Rambo movie before he reaches his 65th birthday. Also, how many other R-Rated movies do you know that star a war veteran who is betrayed by his government, kills countless Vietnamese soldiers, pummels hapless small-town cops into submission, and shoots a government super-computer with a machine gun while going \\"YAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!\\" that managed tospawn its own children's cartoon and full line of action figures? NOT MANY! Despite Sly's appearances in movies like Driven and Get Carter, you can't hold those against him because Rambo overpowers the rubbishness of even those movies. If, for some reason, you get stuck watching Driven - which is a horrible, horrible show - just imagine how the movie would have been if Sly had acted as Rambo in that movie and you should be able to struggle through it.  <br /> <br />4.) Jack of all Trades.  <br />In the acting profession, Sly has done it all. He's an accomplished actor, script writer, and even director. He's starred in dramas, action flicks, and comedies. However, where sylvester has the most global appeal is the laugh factor. It doesn't matter if Sly's trying to be funny or not, any movie that Sly stars in is bound to get a laugh or two. Hell, Sly's funnier when he's NOT trying to be funny, as anyone who has seen 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot!' will tell you. You might laugh because of some of his stupid dialogue... you might laugh because of something he's doing in the movie that you imitate later (like sylvester lifting weights inside of his semi and doing exercises on his truck in Over The Top)... or you might laugh because he scripted and directed an entire movie that was just plain cheesy (Driven!). For instance, my first impression of Driven was that it was a terrible movie. However, after talking with my mate, we realized just how funny the movie was... simply because Sly wrote the movie expecting it to be taken seriously! With dialogue like this, it's pretty hard to take any movie seriously. Keep in mind that it isn't exact, but I'm not watching that movie again just to provide you with an exact quote.  <br /> <br />Sylvester as \\"The Hummer\\" Joe Tanto : You know what I'd do to get her back? I'd crawl!  <br />Sylvester's Rival : You'd crawl Joe??!?!?! You'd never crawl!  <br />Sylvester as \\"The Hummer\\" Joe Tanto : Ya I would crawl... I'd crawl till on my handsand knees till there's nothing left!  <br /> <br />Bottom line is, no matter what Sylvester does, we can always laugh at it, and that makes it a worthwhile endeavour to go to ANY Sylvester movie. Hey, Sly, we're laughing with you man, not at you. Really.  <br /> <br />5.) The 'dying breed' factor.  <br />For the same reasons as Arnold, you should make a point of seeing Sylvester's new movies while you still can. Sure, the old man isn't pumping them out as regularly as he used to and when he does, it's usually some stupid sappy love story under the veil of an action movie. However, you have to appreciate the fact that Sylvester was, is, and always will be one of the greatest action movie stars of all time.  <br /> <br />So take some time, rent a Sylvester and an Arnie flick tonight, and make sure to see their latest movies when they come out. You owe it to guys everywhere to support your local action movie star! The movie industry is already overrun with teenybopper movie stars and horrible teenage comedies... by passing up your opportunity the other weekend to see 'Collateral Damage' because your girlfriend wanted to go see Britney Spears' movie, you're only doing your part to see this hideous trend continue. Just remember that.  <br /> <br />Now, if you'll excuse me, I'VE GAHT TO GET OWDA HE-AH! <br />
076790592X|5.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a non-fiction, number one international bestseller written by Mitch Albom.  I was recommended a book called The Five People You Meet in Heaven which is also by Mitch Albom by a friend.  I enjoyed this book very much, so decided to read Tuesdays with Morrie as well.   <br />The book is written in the first person with Mitch as the main character.  It is not an auto biography, as the book is not about Mitch's life; but more a real story about his university professor who played a significant role in his life.   <br />Morrie Schwartz was a doctor in sociology and Mitch was a diligent student of his in the 1990's.  He was Mitch's favorite professor, and was fascinated by his wisdom and experience.  On the day of his graduation, they promised to keep in touch and the tears that they shed showed that they had more than a teacher-student relationship, but a friendship.  But Mitch was overwhelmed by reality when he stepped into the world of business, money, status.  Mitch became restrained in his work and less caring about his family, let alone his dear old professor.  When he found out that Morrie was gravely ill, he visited him.  Morrie had an illness of which he knew would lead to death, so spent every Tuesdays of his last months with Mitch and gave advice and guidance; just like the lessons from when he was in university. <br /> This book is filled with Morrie's philosophies.  He is portrayed as someone who was respected, and his honest and sincere personality made me care for him as if he was my own grandfather.  Mitch came back every Tuesday to Morrie with more love for him but was heartbroken when he saw the development of the disease and his withering body.  This made me more sympathetic towards Morrie, and his genuine kindness and thoughtfulness made his teachings more valuable to me. <br /> This book is similar to the Essais by Montaigne.  Mitch thinks up several topics in which he asks Morrie to teach him about every \\"lesson\\": Regret, death, family, emotions, aging, money, love, marriage, culture, forgiveness...  They brought up stories and advice from Morrie's own experience and thoughts and became a guide for Mitch and myself.   <br /> Carpe Diem and the almighty power of love are emphasized all throughout the book.  I liked this, because it reminded me not to take everything for granted, but to relish the moment, absorb it, learn from it and be thankful for it.  Through reading this book, I asked repeatedly to myself; \\"am I ready to die?\\"  This question is equivalent to asking \\"have I done all that I can?  Have I lived my life to the full?\\" or \\"If this person died tomorrow, have I made this person happy enough that I won't regret?\\"  And every time, my answer was a no.  For example, if I was in a fight with my sister and she asked for forgiveness and I stubbornly never forgave her, I would die, leaving guilt for my sister who I cared for very much.  If a family member died, I would be smothered with guilt for not showing my appreciation enough.  If a friend died, I would be guilty of not spending enough time with her and showing that I cared for her.  Everything that came into my head was not \\"If I died tomorrow, I would have wished that I could have had a few more days to drive my Porsche.\\" Or \\"If my Prada boots ripped tomorrow, I would have regretted not wearing it enough.\\"  As many people say you can't take material with you, love is the only thing eternal, even after death.  When you die, people remember the love they received from you, not what they received for Christmas.   <br />I noticed much of Morrie's teachings are from (the familiar topic of) the Renaissance, when man began to discover the individual self.  For example, the idea of Carpe Diem (seize the day), can be identified in the book when Morrie commented: <br /> <br />\\"When you realize that your life isn't forever, is when you realize its importance.\\" <br /> <br />The idea of \\"love can overcome all\\" and the celebration of love areclear in Shakespeare's Sonnet 29: <br /> <br />...For thy sweet love remembered such wealth brings <br /> That then I scorn to change my state with kings. <br /> <br />This can be seen between the conversation of Mitch and Morrie: <br /> <br />\\"Life is a series of pulls back and forth... A tension of opposites, like a pull on a rubber band.  Most of us live somewhere in the middle.\\" <br />Sounds like a wrestling match, I say <br />\\"A wrestling match.\\" He laughs.  \\"Yes, you could describe life that way.\\" <br />So which wins, I ask? <br />\\"Which side wins?\\" <br />He smiles at me, the crinkled eyes, the crooked teeth. <br />\\"Love wins.  Love always wins.\\" <br /> <br />The philosophy of \\"love is everlasting\\" is evident in Spenser's Sonnet: <br /> <br />...To die in dust, but you shall live by fame: <br />My verse your virtues rare shall eternize, <br />And in the heavens write your glorious name. <br />Where whenas Death shall all the world subdue, <br />Our love shall live, and later life renew. <br /> <br />This can be referred to once again in the conversation between Mitch and Morrie: <br /> <br />\\"Do you ever hear my voice sometimes when you're back at home? When you're all alone?  Maybe on the plane? Maybe in your car?\\" <br />Yes, I admitted. <br />\\"Then you will not forget me after I'm gone.  Think of my voice and I'll be there.\\" <br /> <br />I found it very interesting to find all of these principals being reinforced through a modern book.  I was once again amazed at the universal messages humanists brought, which still applies to us in the present day.  In our daily lives, it is usually forgotten because we live in a material world, a world which praises youth, a world in which seems to revolve around profiting and money, a world where more is good.  Morrie gave Mitch a second chance, to re-live his life from a different perspective, to brighten the insights.  Morrie was the \\"Coach\\" and Mitch the \\"Player\\". <br /> My favorite character was Morrie.  The thoughtof the fact that he was a real person made me feel like there was a beam of light in the world; someone with sense and deep understanding, despite of the global problems we have today.  There are signs in the book revealing that Morrie wasn't perfect, but a normal human being.  When a TV program interviewed him and asked what he was dreading when the disease took his body over and he could no-longer move, he answered: <br /> <br />\\"Well, one day soon, someone's gonna have to wipe my ass.\\" <br /> <br />This made me laugh, as if it was that little bit of comedy in Shakespeare's tragedies.  It made him human and real.  It made me realize that he also had dignity and worries about psychological traumas like that.  I was relieved and convinced, that there are people like Morrie who are wise enough to refrain from adapting to the world of cold money and material.  He gave me hope. <br /> I recommend this book to everyone.  It is a book overflowing with morals, and it helped me to focus and get my priorities straight.  The big, life's greatest questions and answers are compressed into this book.  As I was reading through this book the second time, I put pieces of paper as a book mark to remind me where Morrie's lessons applied to me most.  By the end of the book, I had bits and pieces sticking out of every page. <br />I think this is a book I will cherish for the rest of my life; one that I will pick up every now and then, read through my favorite quotes, breathe deeply, recollect my thoughts and have confidence and happiness.  I think this book will be my own bible.  <br />
B00005JM0B|5.0|While sitting through the obligatory watching of Collateral Damage the other weekend, I found myself thinking \\"This isn't really a very good movie, so why am I sitting here?\\" In case you didn't know, Collateral Damage is one of Arnold's Hollywood offering. In this particular movie, Arnold's family is killed when a Columbian terrorist bombs a prominent American building. When the government doesn't seem to want to do too much to avenge the death of his family, Arnold takes matters into his own hands (what else did you expect?). OK, so I knew that was coming. But the next thing I knew, Arnold was hiking across Columbia and taking on the Columbian Guerrilas on their own turf, by himself. Now, I've seen probably every Arnold movie in existance, and I've seen him do some pretty farfetched things... but this took the cake. Collateral Damage was kind of a disappointment. The thing that got me thinking in the first place was that I KNEW it wasn't going to be a very good movie. Something in my mind told me before I even left \\"Hey, don't spend 10 on this movie, you know it's not going to live up to Raw Deal standards!\\" But did I listen? Of course not! Why? Because it's an Arnold movie!  <br /> <br />OK, I have a policy when it comes to going to movies, and believe me when I tell you that it's not very strict. Basically, if it doesn't feature Freddie Prinze Jr., a member of any boy band, or look like a chick flick, I'll go to it. I paid good money to see Dracula 2000 so that ought to tell you that I don't really care what I watch. However, there are some movies that I HAVE to see. These movies are the ones that I try my damndest to make it to on opening night, show up early so I get prime seating, and try to coax my friends into coming with me. Movies of this nature need only meet one of three criteria, as follows :  <br /> <br />Movies that achieve 'Must-See' status in Der Dukes book:  <br />1.) Any movie that contains Ah-nuld.  <br />2.) Any movie that contains Sylvester Stallone.  <br />3.) Any movie that contains Rachael Leigh Cook.  <br /> <br />Therefore, according to rule #1, I HAD to buy and watch Collateral Damage. For all of you out there who are snickering and say \\"This guy paid to see She's All That!?\\", keep in mind that the criteria was really put to the test when Rachel Leigh Cook starred opposite Freddie Prinze, Jr., but I reached a compromise by only renting it when it went down to the 7-day rentals and not paying to see it in the theatres. So THERE! <br /> <br />Why do I have this system of movie-going standards? It's quite simple really, no one can put on a show like Ah-nuld, and not many chicks look as good as Ms. Cook. Now, you may make a case that Arnold isn't the best actor... you may say that he lacks any acting range... you may even say that he's too old. In all three cases I wouldn't argue with you. I'm not jaded enough to think that Arnold should be nominated for an Oscar, I don't go to their movies for the engaging plot, the excellent character development, and the terrific climax. Hell, no! I go for the laughs! I go for the things that you might not realize makes a movie starring one of these two actors great! So, if you've ever had troubles enjoying a movie that featured Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone, let me help you out by listing the things that make their movies great.  <br /> <br />What makes Arnold movies so great?  <br /> <br />1.) \\"We've gaht to get owda he-ah!\\"  <br />First and foremost, Arnold's catchphrase is the number one reason to go to an Arnold flick. During every Arnold movie, I hang on every word he speaks. Why? Because sometime, during every single Arnold movie ever made, Arnold shouts out his classic phrase \\"We've gaht to get owda he-ah!\\" His accent is what makes it great and it never ceases to crack me up. While the phrase might not be EXACTLY like that, you can almost bet your bottom dollar there will be some variation of it during the course of the movie. Other popular variations include \\"Let's get owda he-ah!\\", \\"Come on, let's get owda he-ah!\\", or - as was the case in Collateral Damage - \\"Theahs a BOMB in he-ah!\\"  <br /> <br />I am almost positive that that phrase (or any variataion thereof) must be included in every single movie Arnold acts in. If it's not, Arnold won't act. He probably has it written into his contractual demands. A meeting between Arnold and a movie exec would go something like this:  <br /> <br />Movie Exec : Ok Arnold, here's the deal. In this movie, you star as a battle-hardened war veteran. On a mission to South Korea, you single handedly disable the entire Korean army, disarm 15 nuclear missiles by yourself - using only a pair of wire clippers - then you rescue the soldiers from the POW camp while facing off against a mutant alien from another planet! In the end, you kill him by throwing a grenade made up of baking soda and vinegar! Total kill count is upwards of 66,000!  <br />Arnold : **Flipping through the script.** I like it... I like it... BUT THEAH IS A PLOBLEM WIT DIS SCRIPT!  <br />Movie Exec : What's wrong?! You get to kill an insane amount of people, flex your oiled up biceps, carry a log on your shoulder, drive a truck with no brakes down a steep incline, and do battle with a space alien who possesses technology unknown to man! We've fulfilled all of your contractual demands!  <br />Arnold : You've fulfilled all but ONE! \\"WE'VE GAHT TO GET OWDA HE-AH!\\" If it's not in theah, I'm OWDA HE-AH!  <br /> <br />2.) Arnold's great one-liners.  <br />Few can deliver the one-liner better than Arnie. In just about every movie, he's got to spout off a few one-liners. Usually it's just after he kills someone, so you really get to appreciate the great sense of humour Arnold has. Let me tell you about my favorite Arnold one-liners:  <br /> <br />Great one-liner #1:  <br />Early on in the movie Commando, Arnold tells one of the bad guys that he likes him so much that he's going to kill him last. Later on, Arnold catches up with the same guy and runs his Porsche off the road, then he holds him upside down over the edge of a very steep cliff. In this particular scene, Arnold mutters not one, but TWO delicious one-liners.  <br /> <br />Arnold : Hey Sully, remember when I said I would kill you last? I Lied!  <br />**Arnold lets go of Sully and Sully falls to his death.**  <br /> <br />Great one-liner #2 (Same scene!):  <br />**Arnold walks back to the car.**  <br />Girl : What did you do to him?  <br />Arnold : I let him go! (BRILLIANT!)  <br /> <br />Great one-liner #3:  <br />The final fight scene in Commando takes place between Arnold and the main bad guy, Bennett, in a boiler room. Arnold ends up throwing a steel pipe javelin-style at Bennett, and it impales him. When we see Bennett, we see the pipe sticking out of him has also ruptured one of the boilers behind him and steam is shooting out of the exposed end. Arnold mutters \\"Let off some steam, Bennett!\\"  <br /> <br />Great one-liner #4:  <br />As Arnold and his cronies bust up a terrorst camp in the jungle, Arnold is rummaging through a hut when he sees someone beside him. He pulls his knife out and throws it at his adversary, killing him and at the same time pinning him to a wooden beam. What does Arnold have to say about this? \\"Stick around!\\"  <br /> <br />Do you see the utter hilarity in all of these? You can't help but laugh when Arnold cracks a joke just after murdering someone!  <br /> <br /> <br />3.) Action, action, everywhere!  <br />If you're going to an Schwarzenegger movie to be enthralled with the plot, you are an idiot. I go to Arnold movies because I know I won't have to think for at least 90 minutes. Many times I don't want to go to a movie like Arlington Road that makes me think too hard... I just want to see a guy wielding a machine gun kill at least 150 other men. In addition, I like explosions. I'm a pyro at heart, and I know the simple mathematical equation - Arnold + starring role in a movie = explosions. Guys like to see stuff blowing up, and I'm no different. Whether it's Arnie tossing grenades, filling light bulbs up with gasoline, or detonating remote bombs, I know if I want to see lots of things go boom, all I have to do is look for Arnold's name on the movie poster.  <br /> <br />4.) The 'dying breed' factor.  <br />Only in the 80's could a guy like Arnold rise to superstardom. Face it, the guy looks like a genetic freak, he's probably spent more money on steroids than I'll see in a lifetime, he's not that great of an actor, and he's very much a one-dimensional actor (say what you want, but Kindergarten Cop was NOT a funny movie). Do you think movies like Raw Deal and Commando would be mega-hits in this day and age? Not a chance. Sure, many of us still go to action-movies, but the reality is the only thing movie studios cater to these days are pre-pubescent girls, and I don't know if too many 13 year old girls think Arnold is \\"Like, SOOOOOO HOT!\\" 9 out of 10 movies that come out nowadays are teenybopper flicks with PG-ratings. However, Arnold is one of the few actors that defines the 'action movie'. How many new action-movie stars have there been in recent years? I can't think of a single one off the top of my head. I thought there might be some hope for Josh Hartnett after seeing Blackhawk Down, but then I saw him in a preview for some stupid-ass teen movie entitled '40 days and 40 nights' (or something like that). Face it, when Arnie, Sylvester Stallone, Jean Claude Van Damme, and Steven Seagal die, we may never see another action-movie star again. As such, as these guys get older and make fewer movies, the testosterone factor of movies continues to drop at an alarming rate.  <br /> <br />OK, so we've established some pretty darn good reasons why Arnold movies are just so good. Granted, he's appeared in some pretty bad movies by ALL standards, but if someone paid me 15 million I'd appear in a show like Jingle All The Way too!
B000002NJM|4.0|But I bought this one. Couldn't help it. The music was such a prominent part of the film, more so than any other film I've seen. It was a good film, ok. I'm not in love with it. But the music was in tune with the great parts of the film- never ever witnessed this before. Witness: Samuel Jackson slipping on the gloves and coldly assasinating Chris Tucker. Could that song, don't even know what it's called, be more shocking, fitting, pretty much every adjective. And then the end of the flick with Jackie driving with a tear in her eye singing along- I do the same thing without the tear. Truth told I didn't know much about this music before I saw the movie. But it makes me feel like I was there and that makes my life more exciting and that makes a good album. Pulp fiction OST was really good too but to put it straight up, Jackie Brown is black soul that white boys don't get the pleasure to hear. Boo-yah!
B00008PC2O|4.0|I am building a multimedia computer, and this is the second theatrical feature i have tried playing.<br /><br />A big problem with this and \\"Standing in the Shadows of Motown\\" is that they were released before Windows Media 10 was available, and so required a few add-ins to make it play in WM-9. Unfortunately this skin is not upward compatible. in order to make it play, you must:<br /><br />1. Either do not install or Go to control Panel, add-remove programs, and uninstall the player that was installed by the disk called INTERACTUAL VIDEO PLAYER or suchlike.<br /><br />2. Look in the root directory of disk two for a program called DVDRUN.EXE (you may not see the \\".EXE\\" extension.) double click to run that program. DVDRUN.exe will go on the internet to obtain a 5 day license to play the movie. (after 5 days you can go get another one when needed.) The license will be installed and managed by Windows Media 10.<br /><br />3. Use windows search to find the .ASX files on the DVD. .ASX files are Windows Media 10 playlists. For Terminator 2, the first file is called CHAP_0.ASX but you should be able to use this method for other \\"legacy\\" DVD versions of .WMV movies. You only need to click on the first file, the other chapter lists are chained automatically.<br /><br />For newly released WMV-HD and, hopefully, future versions of T2, Windows Media Player 10 and above will simply start automagically and begin playing the movie.<br /><br />The minimum recommended system is a pentium 4 at 3.0 GHz or higher, i found i get an acceptable quality with a bit of stuttering with a 2.8 GHz computer. I have an AGP video card RADEON 9550, and i find increasing the AGP speed reduces dropped frames.<br /><br />If you love action movies, and you have an HDTV monitor, this movie might just be your excuse to buy or build a new multimedia computer for your family.

0792833201|3.0|I'm afraid of ghosts.  Anything that has ghosts in it freaks me out to no end.  I saw The Ring and couldn't sleep for months.  So I figured this movie would scare me at least a little, and I'm completely disappointed.  For those of you who say it's not fair to compare Poltergeist to newer movies like The Ring, I say you're being way too easy on it.  Psycho is still scary; Night of the Living Dead is still scary.  Lord knows The Exorcist is still scary. <br /> <br />A bunch of modern CG effects wouldn't save this film because it's got too many FX already! Throwing a bunch of skeletons, skull animatics, wormholes and what-have-you at the characters doesn't make a movie scary; careful pacing, appropriate music, dialogue, and cinematography do.  I'm not attacking the producer or director's skill--Jaws and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre are both horror classics--I'm just warning you people, don't expect anything scarier than Raiders of the Lost Ark or you'll be disappointed. <br /> <br />Great concepts, special effects, lots of talent.. poor execution.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I caught Jeff Buckley years ago at the Wedgewood Rooms in Portsmouth England. About 800 people shared a totally mesmeric evening.. Nothing to compare him with except his dad the late Tim Buckley.. <br /> <br />I waited a long time to hear anything so gripping. <br /> <br />I heard Damien Rice at a party thrown by a friend of mine late 2003 and after making a fool of myself playing very drunken guitar - another story - I heard the plaintive strains of Blowers Daughter.. The short neck hairs stood up... my radar was on full alert. Who is that..? <br /> <br />I promptly copied the CD to iTunes and bought it for good measure. <br /> <br />About a year ago I was fortunate enough to catch Damien Rice playing solo in Bangalow, in a little hall  just inland from Byron Bay in Australia where I live.. <br /> <br />This gig left me feeling that warm glow  of wonder that had transfixed me after hearing Jeff Buckley.. <br /> <br />This guy is the real deal.. beatiful songs.. beautifully sung.  This album transcends genre.. An absolute must!!!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It wasn't suppose to happen like this... <br /> <br />Back in the summer of 2001, Fox announced that \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" mastermind Joss Whedon would be creating a new television show that was a cross between Science Fiction and the Western Genres... For months Fox spent millions of dollars promoting the one \\"sure fire series of the season\\" but then the problems started... the pilot was too slow, Executive Heads Clashed, and Baseball season all got mixed into the mixing pot... and in the end fans where left with an out of order, mixed up, tale of identitify (which is ironic if you think about it). <br /> <br />But the fans of Joss Whedon and of the character he creates would not let this be the end of the \\"firefly\\" universe, and after much fanfare, petitions, and literal Bitching; Universal Pictures did something rather uprecidented: they green lite a \\"big-screen' movie which Joss Whedon describes as \\"a thank you to the fans.\\" <br /> <br />And that is exactly what the film version of \\"Serenity\\" is.  On the exterior it is a fast-past, character driven, science fiction blast for everyone to enjoy, and the people that did see it did enjoy it alot.  It has survived over a month on IMDB's Top 250 Movies of All Tilme List, and has recieved glowing reviews from THE NEW YORK TIMES, EBERT & ROBERT, THE SAN FRANSISCO CHRONICLE, and more... I distinctly remember a quote from the New york Times saying \\"George Lucas eat your heart out.\\" <br /> <br />But on the interior the movie was about the salvation of people, and it was a political commentary on big brotherism, and how if things in our society today keep going down the same road are future generations won't be much different from mal and zoe. <br /> <br />If your a fan of science-fiction or just good storytelling this is a movie for you.

B000002A46|5.0|My mother (now approaching 90 years) has always said, \\"... the Christmas Season begins when Bing Crosby sings `White Christmas'\\" - seeing the holidays differently, our young friends, Jess and Jamaica, gave me a cassette of Mariah Carey's \\"Merry Christmas,\\" some years back.  I was grateful; but I anticipated exchanging it at Borders after Christmas - it was, after all, music of the \\"younger generation.\\"  <br /> <br />Because Jess told me of how much thought went into the gift purchase, I was persuaded to play the cassette - and, as they say, \\"... the rest is history.\\"  This gospel-rock album is Christmas Music Hall of Fame material - it's already the most popular Christmas recording in our house. This IS the Joy of Christmas! <br /> <br />Except for a respectful and reverent \\"Silent Night\\" (track 1), \\"Merry Christmas\\" is a rousing, upbeat, house rocking celebration - my favorite is Phil Spector's \\"Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)\\" - sorry, Motown, we like Mariah's version (with Lenny Pickett on sax) better than Darlene Love's in the 1960s album, \\"A Christmas Gift for You from Phil Spector,\\" while respecting Darlene and Phil's legacy.    <br /> <br />Although widely unrecognized when it happened, the first Christmas was the seminal event of Western Civilization - now a joyous time of year, commemorating the glorious music of angels above a humble stable, sheltering a brilliant new light.  I have included a shortlist of Christmas music (in addition to \\"Merry Christmas\\"), listened to most often at our house - to enjoy and celebrate that event.   <br /> <br />In alphabetical order ... E. Power Biggs with the Columbia Chamber Orchestra:  \\"Music for a Merry Christmas\\" ... Liona Boyd:  \\"A Guitar for Christmas\\" ... The Cambridge Singers and Orchestra / John Rutter:  \\"Christmas Star\\" ... Carpenters:  \\"Christmas Portrait\\" ... Celestial Harmonies:  \\"Celestial Christmas\\" ... Chicago:  \\"Chicago XXV\\" ... Bing Crosby:  \\"White Christmas\\" ... Arthur Delmoni:  \\"Rejoice!  A String Quartet Christmas\\" ... Percy Faith and His Orchestra:  \\"Music of Christmas\\" ...

B00000J7SS|5.0|And it was not just Miles, but the players on the album. The music grooves in different directions at once. It is a new kind of groove.  Multiple electric keyboards, usually two per track, swing and swagger across this musical landscape...  <br />It was a new way of playing, based on cooperative effort which was centralized and focused on rhythm.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|fans of diana krall have been looking forward to having an album like this for a long time. this one is destined to remain a holiday staple for many years to come. she is most definitely at the top of her game during these recordings and the big band charts make even a cold day in Duluth feel comforting....i guess i now know what my perfect stocking stuffer for the season will be :)

B000BW7QWW|4.0|The critics gave it great reviews, but the public didnt go yet they went to see a horrible movie like Revenge of the Sith a gazillion times?  Unbelievable.<br /><br />Where the movie is not quite the gem the series was, because basically the show excelled because of the character interaction, and there is a lot less of that in this, it is still very enjoyable, funny and even sad.<br /><br />Buy the series and then the movie so we get a sequel.
B00097DXZS|1.0|I've loved Santana for decades, and was excited to hear about the new album.  And I even might have purchased it despite some of the less glowing reviews of the music.... But the copy protection stuff is the clincher for me - this CD is not going into my collection.<br /><br />If I can't rip it for use on my mp3 players and laptop, I'm not buying it, and I hope that many others (enough to make a dent in sales) feel the same way.  I agree with a previous reviewer; please write Arista (and Santana) about this.
B00097DXZS|2.0|1999's comeback \\"Supernatural\\" was, of course, hugely successful.  And it still sounds great today.  2002's \\"Shaman\\" followed the blueprint of its predecessor, but fell a bit short.  Now the trend continues with \\"All That I Am.\\"  And frankly, the formula is starting to wear a bit thin.<br /><br />I won't waste time justifying Carlos Santana's status as one of the greatest living musicians still working today...you probably already know that.  But his choice of material becomes less inspired with each of these well-intentioned collaborations.  The guest stars are all credible (except maybe Bo Bice?), and I have to give Santana credit for at least making a more cohesive album this time out...whatever \\"Shaman\\"'s merits might be, Macy Gray and Placido Domingo do NOT belong on the same album.<br /><br />I admit, I know very little about the pre-Supernatural Santana, so I find it ironic that the cuts I enjoyed most on \\"All That I Am\\" are, in fact, the more traditional Spanish-language dance tunes.  The duets, for the most part, are just adequate.  The Michelle Branch number is a bit too similiar to her previous colloboration with the group, \\"The Game of Love.\\"  Steven Tyler is miscast in \\"Just Feel Better.\\"  Even Santana disciples Los Lonely Boys seem to just be playing by-the-numbers on their track.<br /><br />Enough has been said about this new copy-protection process...but here's my 2 cents:  I bought a copy of Santana's CD.  I should be able to make as many copies, pull out separate tracks for mix CD's, or do ANYTHING I WANT with it because I paid for the priviledge.  The software included is very awkward, and it's not 100% compatible with my computer.  The irony is: I now have to seek out file-sharing programs--the very thing that this software seeks to end--to make copies OF A CD I PAID FOR.<br /><br />But back to the album:  I'd recommend try before you buy.  I'd make you copy to listen to, free of charge...but alas, I can't.

B000BC8TBE|5.0|I have just received this CD the other day and I've got to say that it's definetly better than the original, don't get me wrong, the original was still the best at the time! The new anniversary remix of \\"Santa Clause Is Comin' To Town\\" is nothing but incredible and definetly is better than the original! The best part about this new album release is videos galore, all of the christmas videos ever made for this album are on here, in fact, there's 2 new ones especially for this package! The first is the animated \\"All I Want For Christmas Is You (JD Remix)\\" and it's awesome, even more so, amazing! If you have the heartbreaker cd single, the inside under the cd picture, it's animated sort of like that! The last, is the animated \\"Santa Clause Is Comin' To Town (Anniversary Mix)\\" in \\"Rudolph The Red Nose Reindeer\\" style like the special they show on TV every year, pure amazement! I strongly recommend this album for any Mariah Carey fan because it doesn't get any better than this! Also, look for Mariah's rerelease of \\"The Emancipation Of Mimi\\" filled with 4 bonus tracks and a dvd of all of her videos including \\"Shake It Off\\" and the U.S. debut of \\"Get Your Number\\" on November 15th, available in two versions!!!

B000AXSN5G|2.0|I got sucked in by the glowing reviews for this and bought the CD sight unheard. Comparisons to Harvest (I should have known better) and words like \\"another masterpiece\\" got me. Once I listened to this, I realized that many of the reviews must have been from diehard Neil Young fans who would give almost anything he creates 5-star raves. This doesn't in any way compare to Harvest or any of Young's more inspired work - do not be fooled by that claim.  <br /> <br />I've always loved Neil Young's ability to bring a depth and complexity to a very simple musical style. It is truly amazing when it's at its best. When it's not, as in most of \\"Prairie Wind,\\" it just comes off as being simple. I found most of the songs on this set bland. While I love that lyrically, Young is willing to full-out explore middle age, some of these songs seem like they were pieced together pretty quickly. Something is missing. Maybe \\"Prairie Wind\\" will grow on me with future plays. I hope so. It is not Neil Young at his best, though, is in no way comparable to \\"Harvest\\" or any of Young's more accomplished work. Listen to the sound samples, enjoy the CD for what it is, but don't get sucked in by the hype.

0385513755|4.0|Amazon is THE place to buy this book - all other bookstores are selling this at the cover price of $35 plus tax.  The book itself is beautifully executed and deserves the 5 stars, with heavy slick papers and copious gorgeous illustrations.  As for Brown's writing, it did not quite live up to the hype, to which the apparently and curiously insecure Vatican unwittingly contributed.  'Angel and Demons' was a better thriller, but 'Da Vinci Code' is certainly more thought-provoking.<br /><br />Christianity is - and has always been - out of balance.  It equates Women with Original Sin and condemns flesh itself as weak and thus evil.  It casts everything in black and white, Heaven and Hell, Angel and Demons, the Saved and the Damned, Believers and Herectics, \\"You're either for us or against us\\", etc.  Brown's work reflects the modern trend toward the Eastern-influenced mysticism that centers around the concept of a balance between opposites - Yin and Yang - that coexist as a matter of immutable fact.  The Christian concept of destroying and eliminating Evil would be laughable if not tragic, as evinced by the frequent exposure of the evil hypocrisy of its leaders and followers that are turning off more people than ever.<br /><br />Brown's work is a right book at the right time, that shrewdly exploits the current Zeitgeist that something is seriously and fundamentally out of balance both in human and natural worlds, which has been shaken by war, terrorism, and ongoing massive natural disasters.  Some people see reasons to fear the Cure more than the Disease, i.e. when Earth itself corrects this imbalance, this will surely be at a cost that's nigh unimaginable.  Despite Brown's poor plotting and flat characterizations, his research is well-done, and it's an important book for this transitional period into the next millenium.
0345308239|5.0|I first read this extraordinary book in 1986, just two years after it was first published.  Picking it up again, I find it eerily applicable to our current situation. There is a familiar old adage that teaches us that those who refuse to learn history are doomed to repeat it. THE MARCH OF FOLLY brings this message back to the forefront.<br /><br />Barbara W. Tuchman eloquently discusses the bizarre propensity of governments throughout history to pursue policies contrary to their own interests. Mind you, this is not a pacifist book but rather one that begs governments to beware of the reckless pursuit of policy that might prove to be dangerous. And, yes, I admit right readily that hindsight is 20-20.<br /><br />Beginning with the Trojans and their acceptance of the Trojan Horse to benighted Papal policy during the renaissance to Britain's stupidity during the American Revolution to questionable American policy during the Vietnam war, THE MARCH OF FOLLY invites the reader to consider the fact that as things change in historic chronology apparently nothing else does.<br /><br />Given our current war policies, efforts and mistakes in Iraq, Tuchman's masterpiece is a very poignant read and we must confess, regardless of individual political leanings, that the potential for history to repeat itself yet again is considerable. Who knows, there may yet be a sequel to this one appropriately titled THE MARCH CONTINUES.<br /><br />THE HORSEMAN
0671027387|2.0|It's clear Dan Brown wants to be the Michael Bay of written words.  As you may know, Michael Bay is the king of badly formulaic movies that are low on IQ and high in decibles, cases in point 'Armageddon' and 'Bad Boys II'.  There is, of course, a big market for these silly movies, and Bay is all the richer for them.<br /><br />Dan Brown strains mightily to imitate Bay, producing a novel that is laughably over-the-top in terms of the sheer idiotic nonsense of the plot and characters.  But Brown achieves this with a slight sense of irony, as if he KNOWS he's being silly  and acknowledges his audience is too smart for this, and winks at the readers to bear with him to finish his tale.<br /><br />In his perverse pride, Brown sticks to the same hoary formula he employed in his \\"Da Vinci Code\\", \\"Angel and Demons\\", \\"Digital Fortress\\", and \\"Deception Point\\":<br /><br /> - Take a beautiful heroine who has a geeky technical job.<br /><br /> - Make the heroine motherless.<br /><br /> - Make the heroine fatherless or estranged from the father.<br /><br /> - Take a geeky but gallant Joe Schmoe who's recovering from a<br /><br />  loss and/or a heartbreak.  He's a loner with the heart of gold.<br /><br /> - Have these two discover the most idiotic-sounding conspiracy imaginable.<br /><br /> - Have these two pursued by murderous but hilariously incompetent thugs who are controlled by the 'Boss', who always turns out to be an intimate acquaintance of the heroic couple.<br /><br /> - The 'Boss' dies a spectacular death, but at no fault of the heroic couple.<br /><br /> - The heroic couple shags gratefully in bed.<br /><br />So, why did I finish the book?  The book does have the compelling entertainment value of a train wreck, and for this I gave it an extra star. But I doubt I'll be wasting any more of my time and money on Brown's infantile writings.
0790729652|5.0|I have not seen the new Batman flick yet, but for now this Batman, in my opinion, is still the best.  Michael Keaton was a surprisingly good choice for the role.  No one has done The Bat more justice.  Jack Nicholson will always be the only Joker that matters.  Nobody steals a scene like Jack.  The tone of the movie is dark, gothic and brooding--the way that Batman was originally intended to be.  It's certainly 20 miles better than the day-glo pieces of trash, \\"Batman Forever\\" & \\"Batman & Robin\\".  This movie also features one of the best Batmobiles ever.  A true classic that every child should see before viewing the new movie so they can see how it should be done.
0596007124|5.0|Very educational yet funny, very easy to understand, and to the point. If you're a java programmer then this is just the best book you will ever get. Be aware that some examples are java specific. Although java specifics are not problematic for C# and VB.Net programmers, there's no use to read them (if you're not Java developer). <br /> <br />I don't think this book is for VB6 programmers, because many aspects of OOP discussed are unavailable in VB6.
B000AYQJJ2|2.0|The Concert for Bangladesh presents what must have been an incredible event to witness in person, but the film is weighed down by static photography and an overall sense of disinterest on the part of the DP. It's fine for insomniacs, but those of us who are not battling sleeplessness will do better by spending less for the spectacular-sounding CD
0679422714|5.0|This remarkably documented historical analysis proves that Mao  was directly responsible for the death of tens of millions of his own people. <br />Mao had absolutely no respect for individual lives ('We must kill. It's good to kill.'), except his own. The security measures around him were draconic. <br />But there is more. Mao wanted nuclear weapons in order to kill half of mankind (1.35 billion people at that time) in an ultimate war between the 'socialist' and 'capitalist' countries. He wanted to be crowned emperor of the world. <br />What he didn't know was that the whole of mankind could have been wiped out. By using hundreds of nuclear bombs, calcium in human bones is partly replaced by radioactive atmospheric strontium, forcing possibly a tragically painful death on all human beings exposed. <br />That would be a formidable feat, indeed. <br /> <br />Of course, Mao realized remarkable political feats, like the unification of mainland China. But was this feat important for Mao? Absolutely not, except under his rule. He would have fought like a vulgar warlord, the unification of China under a Lin-Biao or a Peng De-huai. He threatened to do it till the last man of his loyal troops, if he lost power. <br /> <br />In Mao's paradise the only thing that reigned was fear (people didn't dare even to think). During the Cultural Revolution, there were no medical services; Mao was surrounded by an army of nurses and doctors. Married couples who lived apart could see each other not more than 12 days a year; Mao had a harem. Mao despised law and reigned by ukases like the most cynic opportunist ('right and wrong changed like day and night'). He wanted his hands completely free. <br /> <br />The overall picture of this book is appalling. One needs a strong stomach to digest thousands of human beings raped, tortured, starved to death, executed or simply killed in war, nearly every page: All that for the monstrous ambition of one man. <br /> <br />The solution is obvious: democracy, free secret elections, free speech and media. <br /> <br />This book is an extremely well deserved historical burial of an 'exceptional' human being' who turned his whole country into a deadly (literary or psychologically) concentration camp. He killed ten of millions of members of his own species, schemed to kill half of mankind and risked a total wipe-out of the homo sapiens species. <br /> <br />This is, indeed, a bombshell of a book (C. Patten) and a must read. <br /> <br />N.B. I first learned about Mao's suicidal war plans against humanity in Fred Zeller's book 'Trois points, c'est tout' (1976).
B00005QXXO|5.0|FIRST--if you have an open mind to music, disregard the reviews of PILPOL--He obviously doesn't understand that music isn't always about perfect pitch or tone.  Sometimes portraying the emotion of the music and lyrics is more important.  That is one thing that Radiohead excels at, and if you don't get it--you probably can't appreciate Radiohead--so stop trying...  <br /> <br />I'm not what I would call a DIE HARD Radiohead fan, but I do really enjoy them.  I have listened to at least parts of all of their albums, and True Love Waits is a song that really surprised me.  From the title you would assume that it's a love song, but it's really more of a codependent theme song.   <br /> <br />Live Thom Yorke's voice is definitely not perfect, but I tend to like the live tracks because I can almost feel the emotion that comes through his voice.  There are many Radiohead songs that have brought me to tears more than a few times... It is multilayered  music that never seems to get old.  :)
B000ASDFJU|5.0|When I first found out about the new Sex and the City boxed set I was a little bit upset that I had bought all the other seasons and I really wanted this one but didn't want to spend all the money.   <br />I have a solution however, I went to a local flea market where they sell used DVDs, the people there offered me $15 for each season.  It is about half what I paid for them new, but that is $115 towards the new one.  If you can find a place to sell your old DVDs do it!!!   <br />This box set is unbelieveable and I am so happy I got it, it is a lot bigger than I thought and it has so much fun stuff inside it.  I give it 5 + stars!!!
0553573403|4.0|Its one of those books that take you right into the midst of a compelling story right from the start. Being an avid SFC and fantasy reader, I like to think of myself as both an educated and passionate reader. That has an up side to it, as I am keen to be enthralled by a good story but a down side as well, as few are the books that deliver the goods.<br /><br />This one does and the best thing about starting reading it, is that it promises a long journey throughout a full series, which I am looking forward to devour.<br /><br />The set-up is wholesome, tapping into mythological roots that are both familiar enough but at the same time far from the trodden paths of other works. Characters that expose multifaceted traits, amongst which some (the most interesting ones) that do not fall flat into a good-bad definition, and story line that encompasses almost everything human witin a well unfolded nerative.<br /><br />Its fast, but the curves and expanses which the story takes are wide and surprising. There is an accuracy in the composition of that which can pass for 'reality' and that which is ringing of imaginary realms.<br /><br />In short, very good entertainment, well written, something to look forward to ease into at the end of the day.
B0007PAMBK|4.0|Even though Carnival of Souls was industrial and educational <br />film maker Herk Harvey's lone entry into the commercial film <br />market, he managed to prove that a small budget could produce a <br />film that would somehow stand the test of time with a storyline that keeps you watching, without the gore, violence and overdone special effects of today's films. <br /> <br />This DVD is unique that it offers both the original Black and White version as well as a Colorized version, plus Mike Nelson's (of MST3K) optional commentary. <br /> <br />Candace Hilligoss gives a good performance as Mary Henry, a very bewildered and confused young lady who finally learns what her <br />ultimate fate is.  <br /> <br />Others players in the film include Frances Feist as Mrs. Thomas, the landlady who seems to have a case of the weird herself, and who tosses off one of the film's most memorable lines. Sidney <br />Berger as John Linden, the next door neighbor who also happens  <br />to be the resident letch. <br /> <br />Adding much to the film were the many scenes shot at Saltair, <br />the then abandoned and damaged amusement park on the shore of the Great Salt Lake. Not only was Saltair, the inspiration for Herk <br />Harvey's film, and an integral part of it, but was and still is <br />a place that is worthy of a documentary film of it's own due to <br />it's strange history. <br /> <br />If you have never seen Carnival of Souls, get this DVD, it will <br />be worth every penny. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002S94OS|4.0|These guys are so good that I have learned to ignore the singer with his deep growling which is the only reason I gave them 4 stars. Other than that everything sounds tight. I specialy enjoy the drumming. This guy uses the bass drums a lot but he is always in control. Unbelievable!

B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is one of the more interesting movies to be made in the last decade.  It is also a good representation of the newly fashinoned post modern hero.  Napoleon floats through life without any motivation whatsoever.  He takes pleasure in the small things in life like `chapstick' and drawing fantasy cartoon characters.  The screenwriter could have organized the plot around a long protracted battle between the nerds and the cool people.  Instead, nobody in this movie seems to care about who wins or loses this battle.  Except for the `Vote for Pedro' campaign, we are left with the notion that the `nerds' and the `dorks' are happy with their lot in high school life.  In fact, we are left to believe that Napoleon's involvement in Pedro's campaign is only to serve as Pedro's bodyguard.  So although Napoleon is focused, his focus is detached.  Uncle Rico, on the other hand, has an undetached focus in his life.  Unfortunately, his focus is on the year 1982 when his football team played in the State championship.  While Uncle Rico concentrates on the past, and Napoleon arguably concentrates on nothing, Kip is the only one that focuses on the future with his relationship and eventual marriage to LaFawnduh.  It seems Kip is the only one to break out of the family's monotonous existence.  The movie is also very family friendly.  There is no violence, no gratuitous sexual innuendos and no drugs.  Hardly the usual fare of the 18-25 year old cohort which has taken to this movie.  (An age group that may be responsible for the ubiquity of the Vote for Pedro T-Shirts)  With the momentum that this movie has gained, it may be considered the first cult classic of the 00's, even though the community in the film seems to be trapped in the 1980's.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Wow what a great cd this was. I am not a big country fan and I only own Shania's Up cd so i had to but she's the only country singer I love and I ahd to get this cd. The cd has such great songs like I'm Gonna Getcha Good, UP!, Come On Over, Man! I Feel Like A Woman!, From This Moment, You're Still The One, No One Needs To Know, Whose Bed Have Your Boots and great new songs like both versions of Party for Two sung with Mark McGrath and Billy Currington also 2 othewr new songs. This cd is great no wonder wht Shania is one of the greates couintry singers ever.
0453008321|5.0|I read the Last Unicorn when it was new and I was 18. I had never read such an illumination, a fulfillment, an enlightenment. It helped me grow. And then there are the small moments - the butterfly, fluff-headed yet brave and of inestimable help; the Mr. Gick moment; the cat moved to speak - all embroidered this glorious story. <br /> <br />I returned to this book over and over across the years. I discovered Peter Beagle's own telling of it on tape - one of the best audiobook performances, in my opinion. I continue to marvel at how good this story is. It is one of the great works of literature.
B00005JO0J|5.0|When I first heard that Joss Whedon was making a movie based on the Firefly series, I was so excited, but began to wonder how he would make it.  I was concerned about several things:<br /><br />1.  Would people who didn't watch the series be able to follow along with the movie?<br /><br />2.  How was he going to make a two hour movie over a twenty episode series with hours of character development?<br /><br />3.  If the movie busted, would it kill future Joss Whedon projects?<br /><br />All of my concerns were met with outstanding answers:<br /><br />1.  The movie was done in a way that you could watch it without having seen the show (Although the show's character development does help).<br /><br />2.  Joss decided to pick a few specific character's stories and go with them in the movie (And the beautiful thing is, he left it open for sequels to go into the other characters' stories).<br /><br />3.  It didn't bust and Joss is already scheduled to write and direct two more movies in the next two years (Including the highly anticipated Wonder Woman)<br /><br />The movie is great.  It has the perfect combination of Whedon humor, action, story, drama, thrills, and character development.  It is a roller coaster ride that doesn't disappoint and I can't wait until the December release of the DVD, which with any luck will have all sorts of goodies on it.<br /><br />I hope and hope that the success of Serenity will also spawn one of two things; Either many sequels or a television network to pick up the the Firefly series and continue the saga that was so horribly murdered.
B00005NI5Y|5.0|After listening to this CD for four years, I stick with my initial reaction: it ranks up there with \\"Bringing It All Back Home,\\"\\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"Blood on the Tracks.\\"  Which is to say it's one of the all-time great rock albums. If the songwriting is not quite as consistently strong as his earlier work, the performances and production values certainly are. <br /> <br />\\"Time Out of Mind\\" was a confessional album harking back to \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" (in mood if not in delivery), but \\"Love and Theft\\" both swings and thumps. It can be wryly humorous or weightily prophetic, more in keeping with the underrated \\"Infidels.\\" Who besides Dylan could summon up the authority to deliver lines like \\"I'm gonna stand undefeated, I'm gonna speak to the crowd,/I'm gonna teach peace to the conquered, I'm gonna tame the proud\\" and not sound daft?  That's from \\"Lonesome Day Blues,\\" one of the thumping highlights.  Another is \\"Honest With Me,\\" with an irresistible guitar riff by the great Charlie Sexton. These rockers are interspersed with swingers like \\"Mississippi\\" and \\"Moonlight.\\" Kicking off the album is one of the in-betweeners, \\"Tweedle-dum and Tweedle-Dee,\\" which sets up the ferocious energy of the CD but also its knife-edge irony. <br /> <br />And to those people who say Dylan's voice sounds horrible? Just go back to your \\"American Idol\\" rehashes and have a ball. The man has never been in better voice. Sure he can't hit the high notes anymore, but he doesn't need to - that aging croak commands the full range of human emotion. <br /> <br />What we have here is an aging artist who's having a lot of fun, who answers to noone, and who knows how to help others make him sound good.  Feast on it!
B000002L68|5.0|Prince & the Revolution's Music from the Motion Picture \\"Purple Rain is my thrid favorite album of the eighties right behind the New Edition Heartbreak & Bobby Brown Don't Be Cruel albums. Like the former two albums, whenever I play it I just play from start to finish. The album starts out with the blazing track Let's Go Crazy then moves into the duet Take Me With You. Track 3 is The Beautiful Ones a song that Mariah Carey and Dru Hill tried to cover but failed at misreably. Track 4 &5 Computer Blue and Darling Nikki had to grow on me respectively. Track 6 is the song that easily made Prince a star on every level Whe Doves Cry is one of the deepest songs ever recorded and it's message is still revelant twenty one years later. Track 7 I Would Die 4 U is another favorite of mine, while Track 8 is the song that always gets my hype is called Baby I'm A Star. Fiannly Purple Rain track 9 is the deepst song on the album if Purple Rain doesn't affect you then oblivously you don't HEAR music, you listen to. No album or semiautobiographical movie will ever come close to Purple Rain. <br />
B000784WMW|5.0|I first saw this version of Jane Eyre when I was in college in the '80s. I'd never seen a repeat of it, but this Jane Eyre stayed in my heart until 2005 when I happened to see the DVD version. I bought it and have watched it over and over again since then. <br /> <br />I love this version's period setting--a grand castle, lush grounds and Victorian furnishings. Most of all, I love Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Rochester. Rochester is just as I imagined him to be from reading the book as a child--at times coarse, haunted, mysterious, engaging, commanding, assertive and desirable. (I will never know why Jane did not find him handsome; perhaps had she been less interested in the carpet, she could have seen the male beauty that was before her. Dalton is handsome, indeed, in a rugged sort of way.) This actor expertly delivered long, 18th-century dialogue in a believable way. His acting range is astonishing. From giggles to tears to female impersonation, Dalton's Rochester had me riveted and sympathizing with him, despite his \\"insolence.\\" <br /> <br />I'm very happy with my purchase. No version of Jane Eyre equals this one as far as I'm concerned.
0380789019|4.0|Most of the time, you have to take a journey of uncountable miles to go to a different world. But what if there was a world that was within reach, in your hometown, even? As main character Richard Mayhew finds out in this novel, there is a world beneath London (London Below), inhabited by people, streets, and even underground train stations that time has forgotten about. How do you get to this world? All you have to do is know how to open the right door.  <br />This book is filled with memorable characters: the door-opening girl, Door; the mysterious marquis de Carabas; the beast-killer, Hunter; Anaesthesia, Islington, Old Bailey, Lumia, etc. So many.  <br />In a nutshell, this story is about all these characters and their adventures as Door tries to figure out who killed her father, Hunter seeks the Beast, and Richard, having found this strange world, wonders if there is any way out of it--or is he stuck forever?  <br />Overall, the book moves at a fast pace without leaving the reader in the dark (you wouldn't want to be left in the dark in the sewers of London Below). You get a pretty good picture in your mind of how this place looks like. And if you're worried about another predictable, boring book with no imagination at all, fear not, this book has a labyrinth of unexpected twists and turns to keep your interest.  <br />And better yet, a reward at the end of the labyrinth.
B00082IJ08|4.0|I'm just a casual fan of Gorillaz.  I liked their first album, but I never really followed them.  I know only cursory things about the group, but I must say it's a good followup album.  It maintains a lot of what the first brought to the table, with it's mind drilling bass lines and melodies that take you a million places at once in a dimished key.  But what made this album great for me, is that after a hard night of drinking, I played this album from beginning to end while trying to recover from a hangover.  It was a relaxant for the tortured soul; perfect sunday morning album.  Not as great as the first, but holds it's own and well worth the buy.

B000002LFZ|2.0|To call this the Best of Fleetwood Mac is a little far-fetched--it does not include any of their hits and great songs from 1967-1974, forgetting the songwriting of Peter Green, Danny Kirwan, and Bob Welch..It is not a complete so called greatest hits without including the early era--the title should have read-Fleetwood Mac-the best of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham.  I am not knocking this lineup and I love the songs but my favorite is Fleetwood Mac--the Blues--the Roots.  I suggest the Then Play On album to get a really good idea how Fleetwood Mac was before Stevie and Lindsay..  Also, do not forget Bob Welch and Mystery to Me album--another Gem!!!!

B00009UW0N|3.0|\\"Halloween\\" is a scary movie, but not because of what it shows. It is scary because of what it doesn't show. The following statement may seem a bit confusing, but play along with me here. I have never been a fan of the \\"Halloween\\" series. I have though seen the last three movies that were made. I hated them! What really bothers me about the series is the fact that the character simply won't die! I become much more frustrated than scared. But I've always heard from people that the first one is the best. And from what I've seen they are right.<br /><br /> Let me go back to my first comment. \\"Halloween\\" is a great movie because of the restraint that John Carpenter shows. He never goes for the easy cheap scare. We see a murder happen in the opening minutes of the movie and then do not see another murder until almost an hour into the film. Many of you may say, hey wait a minute, that sounds pretty boring. We have to wait an hour to see blood and guts, no thanks! But to think in such a way is to miss the point. We, the audience, know someone is going to get killed but Carpenter is keeping us on pins and needles. We keep anticipating the fatale moment for one of the character but it never happens. Because of this I think of this movie more so as a suspense film and not a horror movie, and that's fine with me. It is a truly effective piece of work. Of the later films I've seen they abandoned what Carpenter was doing. Those movies were just slasher films that never really involved the audience.<br /><br /> Another thing in this movie's favor is the fact that the cast is unknowns, well at least for 1978 they were, except of course Pleasence. As I watched the movie I tried to forget that other films were made and I just tried to keep myself in the moment and when I did that I found the movie had won me over.<br /><br /> The worst thing that can be said about this movie is that it is weak on plot. The set-up is basically Myers going after Jamie-Lee Curtis but again the way Carpenter approaches the material is not in the standard way. You could look at it as if it were a chess board. Carpenter is slowing moving the pieces around setting everything up for a checkmate. We come to know these characters a little bit and we even get an understanding of the villian.<br /><br /> I'm not familar yet with all of Carpenter's work, I have only seen his \\"Fog\\" besides this. That movie didn't really work in my opinion but here with \\"Halloween\\" he shows just how talented he is. *** 1\2 out of *****<br /><br /> Bottom-line: Perhaps the best \\"Halloween\\" of the series. Not really a horror film but a suspense movie. Carpenter shows a great deal of restraint which keeps the audience on the edge of their seats through-out.terial is not in the standard way.

B000021XS0|5.0|This recording, which came out in 1999, is the continuation of an idea put forth in the song Metropolis from the Images And Words CD. It seemed a bit risky to take a 9 minute song and extrapolate a 77 minute album. The risk was well worth it. From the opening clock to the final feedback, this CD is an unmitigated masterpiece. Musically, it weaves from gentle acoustic passages to shredded metal to eastern flavours to gospel chorus, and none of it seems out of place. Some of DT's best songs (and I do mean songs- much of their other work is a stringing together of unrelated ideas) are on here, especially Through Her Eyes, Home and The Spirit Carries On. Each band member has an opportunity to shine at variuos points, but the biggest standout is vocalist James LaBrie. This is by far his best and most varied recorded performance. The CD is set up as 9 scenes complete with narration, and LaBrie sings each individual section and character with such grace and beauty as well as his usual power. In an age where prog-rock and prog-metal are almost universally derided by most critics, this CD is a refreshing oasis in the sonic soundstorm that threatens to bury us all.
630460288X|4.0|I like this movie. While Stallone has proven repeatedly he is not a great actor, he does manage to make some entertaining films. This is one of 'em.<br /><br />Ya got a futuristic society where criminals are frozen. Great idea. Thawing them out for parole hearings then drowning them again seemed to be a bit on the 'cruel and unusual' side of things, though.  Sparton (Stallone) was a cop unjustly frozen while capturing Phoenix (Wesley Snipes). Phoenix escapes and Sparton is thawed to help capture him.<br /><br />Snipes should not have gotten a dime for doing this movie. In fact, he should have forked over some $$ to the producers. It is obvious he is having a ball here being the bad guy while doing an entertaining impersonation of Dennis Rodman. (Am I the only one who saw this?) He is bloody perfect in the role. If Rodman could act (and I did see him in a movie, no, he is definately NOT an actor) he'd have been a good Phoenix, too. Still, Snipes, ever the crook, steals all the scenes in which he appears. Not difficult when he's playing against Stallone, but still very good.<br /><br />Bullock got a great part, did well in it, and worked wonders for her carreer. She owes whoever picked her for the part a big thank you. Honestly, any cutie could have done her role. Just as any of a hundred Hollywood types could have done Stallones. Snipes was the only perfectly cast actor in the bunch.<br /><br />Anyway, you have Sparton and Phoenix fighting their way through the movie, along with a cameo by Jesse the Body (Why? No one knows.) The ending is predicable, the good guys win.<br /><br />Go ahead and buy the thing. It ain't Shakespeare, but it ain't boring either.
0060531053|4.0|I haven't made homebrew in several years, so I wanted a book to bring me up to speed and cover modern developments. Charlie Papazian did all that, and more, in The Complete Joy of Home Brewing - 3rd Edition. I do agree with a pervious review that comments on the over use of the phrase \\"Relax. Don't worry. \\"Have a homebrew\\". However, considering the amount of well written and useful information, that becomes merely a minor irritant.
0800177355|3.0|The Good: great action flick, magnificiant scenery, loved Stallone doing the rock climbing. It looked real, like he was truly hanging hundreds of feet up in the air holding on by one hand. The expendable pilot, good actress, good part for her. Enjoyed a couple other of the good guys too.<br /><br />The Bad: now why would you want to split the money with anyone but the necessary? The heist called for a pilot (the Lithgow character was a pilot as well as the leader). Why the woman? Ok, someone to pilot while the evil leader keeps tabs on everything. You got to have a guy on the inside to set everything up, kill the guards, transfer the money. Lithgow is there to get it, while the pilot flies the jet. Why the two badguy expendibles? And if you're going to hire muscle, you hire pros. Especially with that much money at stake. These were overly aggresive to the point of getting in the way of the heist. They weren't needed in the original equation. And when things didn't go as planned, all they managed to do was get killed. Some obvious mistakes here and there, like the cable holding the choper to the side of the cliff. Most of the mistakes, like that one, was just sloppy. No excuse.<br /><br />The Ugly: Ah. We're back to Lithgow. Who on earth came up with the idea of him using a Gawd-awful British accent? He is NOT Anthony Hopkins, by birth or talent. He is merely an adequate actor. Not a great actor. Adequate. With that idiotic accent, he wasn't even that. And, no, calling everyone a \\"boss-tard\\" will not make us even remotely believe you're British. You just sounded like an American actor trying to do an accent badly. If you must have a British bad guy, next time hire one. My favorite would be Alan Rickman, who stole ROBIN HOOD and DIE HARD from their famous stars.<br /><br />This flick is ok if you're under the age of 12, language aside. Otherwise it is definately a renter. Don't buy it.
6301931440|5.0|This concert was Hendrix's triumphant return to his home country having made the big time in England. The previous time Hendrix was in the US he was an unknown starving in New York's Greenwich Village.  <br /> <br />Introduced by Rolling Stone, Brian \\"Prince\\" Jones, and wearing a groovy afgan coat and pink feather boa, Hendrix rips into a fast, intense version of \\"Killing Floor\\". You can understand exactly why Jimi wiped the face of the earth with Eric Clapton, with his version of this Howling Wolf number back in the UK. You can see in this concert what made Hendrix the phenomenon he was. It features most of his famous early hits. The energy is at a peak all throughout the concert, the playing is flawless, the showmanship vivid and fresh, with an extravaganza of teeth picking, amp humping and guitar smashing. The freaked out face of one the young women in the audience just says more than words could possibly express. It is a mind blowing concert.  Hendrix pulls out all the stops and I pity The Who, that had to come on after him.  <br /> <br />Even though I am a fan more of his later work I couldn't recommend this more. There is also some brief footage of some early UK Experience concerts and a nice intro by John Phillips about The Monterery Festival.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the greatest album ever put onto plastic, and I will argue that fact with anyone, anywhere anytime. Nothing has meant more to more people then the twelve special tracks that grave Nevermind. I could go into the particulars of the album, and break every song down one by one, and believe I have so much to say about everyone one of them, but I won't. I think it is distasteful for a peon like me to try and tell the world the meaning to a masterpiece.<br /><br /> The album is simple, I can play the whole thing on guitar (I'm not an amazing guitar player by any means.) and I can sing it word for word. There is just something so magical about this release. I don't have to tell you how it changed the world, made music about emotion instead of girls in thongs. Made you focus on energy instead of pyro and spandex, and forced bands to write a damn song instead of a shout out loud every one bounce up and down chorus.<br /><br /> This record is one of the single greatest influences in my life, it made me focus on substance instead of flash, and I would recommend it to anyone. In fact I've given away at least nine copies of the album because I feel that if you have a CD player you should have Nevermind.<br /><br /> This album sounds as good today as it did in its release, for some reason these songs just really don't get old. You might listen to \\"Polly\\" twenty times and get sick of it, but an hour later you realize that you're singing \\"drain you.\\"<br /><br /> Chances are if you are reading this review you are a fan like me and are just curious as to what other people think of this record. Well I love it. And if you really enjoy this album go out and get the DVD about it's recording. There are a lot of segments with Butch Vig (the producer) where he actually shows how things were mixed to give them the sound that they have. It is great to watch.<br /><br />Thank you for your time.
B00097DXZS|4.0|The songs are great, i think this cd is much better than Shaman, \\"Just feeling better\\" and \\"Trinity\\" brilliant songs.
B000301YY8|5.0|I would recomend this cd to anyone who is interested in james blunt. Not only is he a great musican, he is also an enginner. Of all the cd's i have this one inspired me to write a reviw on here. Blunt dident me leave dissaponted with any of the tracks. I love this CD after a month of listening too it. And once you do check it out you can see what everyone is talking about the last track for!!
B00005JNEI|5.0|I originally purchased this film when first released.  It provides important aspects and comparisons between what Bush uses as excuses, and what has actually happened.  The film was on Showtime again tonight; as Iraq continues to provide people with training in urban warfare, the message of this movie is as relevant as it was over a year ago.  Excellent movie.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Why was I a Depeche Mode fan?  I suppose because I first came across them on MTV in 1983 and the band had.....3 synths!  You can have 3 synths in one band??? Cool!  I loved the new electro sounds the early 80s were producing such as Yazoo, Ultravox, Caberat Voltaire, and Man Jumping.<br /><br />Depeche Mode had this great electronic backdrop.  Layered over the music landscape were the lyrics of mostly Martin Gore who wrote songs on the oddest of subjects.  S&M (Master and Servent), Avarice (Everything Counts), Shame (It Doesn't Matter Too), Suicide (Blasphemous Rumours), and songs Roman Polanski could only love (Little 15, Question of Time).<br /><br />Then in the early 90s came VIOLATER....and believe me I felt like I was!  Violated of the Depeche Mode electro cool and sinisterness!  Gone!  Replaced with schlock like the predictable \\"Personal Jesus\\", \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" songs that didn't seem to go anywhere with no deep meaning.  And ha!  They were huge hits la la la. They finally broke the charts in the grand old U$A!  Blah.<br /><br />Things got worse when Dave became a rock god and posed on the cover of GUITAR magazine.  Guitars???  So much for electro huh.<br /><br />After awhile though they kinda missed the old fans and delivered what I call the apology album : ULTRA.  Good, electro, but my dear fellows........too late and not enough.<br /><br />And now I must deal with PLAYING THE ANGEL.  How do I say what I want to say without offending those DM fans who were sucking thumbs whilst I was blaring \\"People are People\\"?  The new album is good AND THAT IS A LOT FOR ME TO SAY!  I am glad Dave took pen in hand and wrote out a few tunes.  \\"Precious\\" sounds very similar to \\"Leave in Silence\\" (1982).  Almost a return to the old retro-electro.  With a bit of modern industrial bangs for good measure.<br /><br />So will I buy this album?  Maybe.  I have held this grudge for a long time and I am getting old.  As for you young fans I mean no offense to those who thought VIOLATOR was a good album.  But wait til you are 37 and watch yourself when you complain about Nine Inch Nails selling out and doing a swing album!<br /><br />I rate this album 4/5 stars.  Check out how early electro began with these early DM albums:<br /><br />BROKEN FRAME<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN<br /><br />BLACK CELEBRATION my personal fave.<br /><br />Cheers.ought VIOLATOR was a good album.

B0007N1AI6|2.0|I just picked up \\"Angel of Retribution\\" and \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" by fellow U.K. legends, Deep Purple. What I didn't see coming was, I felt bored by the new Priest, but really enjoyed the new Purple. Go figure. I feel like Deep Purple are growing \\"older\\" gracefully, but not Judas Priest. It sounds like they are selling out with this disc. But, if you like Deep Purple check \\"Rapture of the Deep\\" out.<br /><br />I guess \\"Angel of Retribution\\" needs the BONUS DVD, because it sure wouldn't be worth it on it's own. Buy it used...if you must.<br /><br />\\"Angel of Retribution\\" - 2 stars<br />\\"Rapture of the Deep\\" - 4 3/4 stars
0061020680|5.0|All Mort's father wants for him is an apprenticeship, but everybody passes up on this scrawny boy.  Then after all of the other people have left one figure comes out to accept the boy, it is none other than Death.<br /><br />Hereafter we follow Mort as he explores Death's Domain, meets Death's daughter, and learns the ropes of being Death.  Meanwhile Death gets distracted by studying humanity and gradually Mort starts to become death, even SPEAKING IN THE VOICE.  It isn't long, however, before things start to go terribly wrong, without Death at the reigns.<br /><br />I actually read this volume after Reaper Man and Hogfather, so I was quite interested to learn more about Albert and see the roots (literarily speaking) of Death's Domain.  I also enjoyed seeing Mort grow and then struggle as only a human would, with the job of being Death and asking many questions that Death never could have.<br /><br />If you've enjoyed seeing Death at the edges of other Discworld novels then you should definately check out his first starring role.  Also, being fairly early in the series it can be a good introduction to the Disc without any real spoilers or prerequisites.
0062502182|1.0|It is hard to imagine that a book this shallow could become a best seller. With the wealth of fine, complex and challenging books one could read to spark contemplation about one's life path, why would any adult choose this one? I forced myself to finish it out of loyalty to my book club, but like several others we've been \\"conned\\" into reading by clueless reviewers (The Five People You Meet in Heaven, the Four Agreements) it is at its core a quick buck book. Apparently, if you repackage any simple truism you heard from Grandma in the nursery, you can rake in many dollars from the gullible. I am just glad I followed my heart and got the book from the library. I'll give the money saved to a good cause as part of my path to my personal legend.
B00000K3D4|5.0|OK.  I hate it when Bowie is bashed.  This film is fantasy.  This film has puppets.  This film has GREAT Bowie music.  This film has 2 cute kids.  This film has stunning sets.  The plot is good enough; it seems to conform to purgatory dogma and being \\"prayed\\" out of there.  Oh yeah!  Courage and perseverance do conquer all: Simplistic thought but very, very true and applicable.<br /><br />Now, if you are seeking solutions and secrets to the Cosmos, look elsewhere.  This movie targets children and the child in adults.  You have been warned.<br /><br />F.Y.I.  The music that bugs some viewers is Bowie at \\"children,\\" but with a ghoulish, mystical flair.  Also, the music as soundtrack works to imply different dimensions between time and space.  Thus, the musical interludes must be obliquely spaced.<br /><br />Enjoy . . . or not.
0156027321|5.0|Wow.  What a book!  What a story!  This is an amazing story..  Read it, you will not be disappointed.  The story flows off the pages, and the structure and the storytelling are amazing.  The book tells of a young Indian boy who is stuck on a lifeboat for 227 days with a Bengal tiger.  <br /> <br />I can tell you that my relationship with my cat will never be the same after having read it.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|When I heard the boys were making a new album, the first thing that came to my mind was, \\"how are they ever going to top '()'?\\"  which is one of my to 10 favorite CD's of all time.  Well.. I don't know if they topped it, but they sure did blow me away with this!  This is how the CD runs down..  1. Takk.. - like all their other albums, they start off with a soft, dream-like sounding intro song.  Pretty good one too.  2. Glosoli - at first, it sounds like reminants from \\"ba ba ti ki di do,\\" then like a song on \\"()\\" the bass comes in, and the melody starts building and building to a very loud and rocking climax! Very nice.  3. Hoppipolla - A very nice and pretty piano melody that makes you feel like you're at a parade.  A very up-beat song.  4. Med Blodnasir - This song seems to flow right out of Hoppipolla and go right into a 3/4 jam with some brass players and some \\"oooh aeeyy ohhh's\\" in the background, very upbeat as well.  5. Se Lest - This is the one where they use a celeste. A very soft, and \\"icy\\" sounding instrument. Played with piano accomp. Nice and relaxing.  6. Saeglopur - really great song! Probably the best of the record.  Starts with some strong chords on the piano, then like a wave, it breaks into the full band playing the melody.  Very strong and dramatic sounding  7. Milano - The string arrangement in this song is awesome! Kudos to Amiima!  8. Gong - Another really good one.  Upbeat but meloncholy, with a nice groove that you can almost dance too!  9. Andvari - an instrumental that flows right out of \\"gong\\".  10. Svo Hljott - A nice slower song with loud climaxes during the chourus, still has a \\"hopefull\\" feeling to it.  11. Heysatan - a very intimate piece that closes the album perfectly!  No percussion, just guitars, keyboards, and vocals.  Sweet, but somber.    Tracks 7, 8, and 10 sound like they went back to the \\"Hopelandic\\" lyrics from \\"( )\\"    Overall... a very good CD, very different sounding compared the earlier stuff.  The biggest change is that they sound more \\"hopefull\\" than previous stuff. You can tell that the band has grown since \\"()\\"
B0000029GA|5.0|Well, for a lil hoodlum from NY, this is a very thought provoking and solid album. You could almost call this smart rap. Very intellectual lyrics, Nas goes on about his childhood, his thoughts, his ideas, not just his ego...unlike alot of cats out there. You get a real feel of his mentality...If you asked what goes on in a typical day for Nas in NY? He could tell you, and you would know. When Jay-Z said that this album is a classic,,,,he was right..it is. But, this is the only album Nas can be proud about...all albums that came after this is absolute garbage. Peace out....buuuuoyyy.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|First of all, let me say, if ur a true death cab fan, you will agree with me that whoever said that this cd isn't worth a $12+ purchase is a complete idiot. <br /> <br />But anyways, my opinion on this cd is that it is refreshing, unexpecting, and it flows nice. The cd starts with Marching Bands of Manhattan, which I think was a great opener. The calm guitar and astonishing lyrics are great. Here's my score on each of the songs on PLANS. <br /> <br />Marching Bands of Manhattan (5/5) This track really stands out. <br />Soul Meets Body (4.5/5) Extremely good flowing songs, but there are better tracks so I give it a 4.5 <br />Summer Skin (5/5) Lyrics are comforting. Also, the drums really stand out in this song. <br />Different Names for the Same Thing (4.5/5) Great lyrics and really moving music, the piano in this song is great. Also, in the middle of it, they play the bass and drums for a little, and I thought that it flowed greatly with this song. <br />I Will Follow You Into The Dark (5/5) This is easily one of my favorites, nice guitar to start off, and well-thought, beautiful lyrics. Great chorus! <br />Your Heart Is An Empty Room (5/5) This song is another favorite, by the way, it's hard to have favorites for this cd, because all of the songs are unbelieveable. Very soothing chorus. <br />Someday You Will Be Loved (5/5) Nice flowing bass and great lyrics, awesome chorus. I think this song is great because a lot of people can somewhat relate to it. <br />Crooked Teeth (4/5) Someone told me they thought this was the best song on the album, but it's not. It's good, nothing special, I think the chorus is very clever though. <br />What Sarah Said (5/5) This is truly my favorite, either this or Brothers on a Hotel Bed, the piano is so soothing. The lyrics are great, but Ben's voice is even better on this song. Very flowing and calm. \\"So who's gonna watch you die?\\" At the end of the song, this is repeated and I think it sticks out and stays in your mind all day. <br />Brothers on a Hotel Bed (5/5) Very abstract, I think. The piano and drums flow great together. The lyrics of this song are great. By the way, I love how Death Cab put so much piano on this cd. \\"Like Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\", the title of this song is repeated towards the end.I think it sticks in your mind just like What Sarah Said. \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\" and \\"What Sarah Said\\" are easily my two most favorite songs on this album. <br />Stable Song (4.5/5) This slow-paced song is a good closing song, very mellow guitar. Catchy lyrics. <br /> <br />So, this brings me to say, that with many artists their first few albums are better than their last few, I think it's the opposite with Death Cab for Cutie. They are one of my favorite bands, and I think that Plans is better than any of their old ones. Which brings me to say, this album deserves five stars, hands down.
B000002WYW|5.0|I cannot understand why people do not consider this some of the Wu's best work.  The beats are brilliant.  The rap is intelligent.  The mixture is gold.  Some of these tracks follow a more traditonal rap format, with choruses, intros, etc. but Forever is as close as you get to guys on the street rappin straight street poetry.  These guys flow.  The rap beyond b****** and h***.  This stuff is Ministry.   <br /> <br />\\"Cash rules still don't nothin move but the money...\\"
B000AMWIVM|5.0|Saw gave birth to the Jigsaw Killer..which i guarantee will be famous as saw 2 Has come out (Pretty Good) and saw 3 in 1-2 years.... Saw Is a example of Tarantinos reservior dogs...Very LOW BUDGET but Excellnt Business..And Great Film..
B000AJJNPY|5.0|That's really all there is to say about this album.It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside. Don't let the negative reviews fool you: Just about everything negative said about this album has been posted by ignorant critics with absolutely no knowledge of music whatsoever (i.e. giving \\"takk...\\" one star, but giving a Good Charlotte album three). If you like Sigur Ros, this album will be playing everywhere you go for the next six months. If you didn't like Sigur Ros in the first place, why are you even wasting your time, not only to listen to their new album, but to also post a review of it?
B00008WG3U|5.0|First of all, this is musically a HIGH QUALITY album! <br /> <br />Secondly, to everyone who is whining about the politics in this album: Face it, Bush engaged in an unprovoked conflict and blatently lied to the world about the justification; not to mention the criminal mismanagement of the post war strategy. <br />Furthermore, the Bush administration has carefully created and disseminated propaganda through the mainstream media. No president has ever created fake newscasts designed to look authentic. Even the General Accounting Office (a government agency) wrote a report criticizing the practice. <br />This album also hints at some of the U.S.'s illegal detainment policies. And now that Cheney is advocating torture as a means of interrogation by C.I.A. agents, the album is of ever increasing relevance. <br /> <br />Finally, the \\"Idiots are taking over\\" track is overwhelmingly accurate! ;)
B0008ISM40|4.0|Trent has matured VERY much on this album. Especially coming from his f'ed up, depressed, anti-Christian days of The Downward Spiral. I personally think he found religion, maybe that's why some people hate this album, because if you look at this album's lyrics from a religious point-of-view you'll see what I mean. He actually is chronicling his own life in the form of music with this album. I think its great, and I'm glad he's finaly crawling up the downward spiral=). <br /> <br />Take, for example, the song Only-I think he's making fun of the way he used to feel towards religion. When he screams \\"There is no you! There is only me!\\" he isn't truly saying that God doesn't exist, but he is actually illustrating how he used to bang his head against the wall in his misery and say that. When you watch the video for Only, you can see that when he says \\"I just made you up to hurt myself, yeah, I just made you up to hurt myself-and it worked, yes it did!\\" he is actually rocking back and forth in an insecure, paranoid sort of way. He doensn't actually believe what he's saying, he's just once again illustrating how he used to be that way. <br /> <br />Or another example is The Hand That Feeds. The line \\"Will you bite the hand that feeds you? Will you stay down on your knees?\\" <br />is basically saying \\"Will you fight God and continue to suffer? <br />Or will you accept him and LIVE?\\" <br /> <br />On last thing-PLAY THE RECORD BACKWARDS, if you know how. There is all sorts of religious stuff in there about the Bible, Jesus, and him admitting that Christians are right. But you don't have to believe in subliminal messages to find religion in the lyrics because the forewards lyrics alone, when actually studied, show his new found faith.  <br /> <br />I know it says these things for a fact because the whole subliminal phrases, when recorded and then played in reverse, become the original lyrics.  <br /> <br />THE HAND THAT FEEDS <br />Forewards: \\"Will you bite the hand that feedsyou? Will you stay down on your knees?  <br /> <br />Backwards: \\"Seen with my own eyes, it's You, He's deep in my (head/heart), He helped me live\\".  <br /> <br />ONLY <br />Forewards: \\"There is no you, there is only me! There is no f-ing you, there is only me!\\" <br /> <br />Backwards: \\"He made me lost, they're right, well hearing it-for once-they're right! He made me lost, you are the only one, they're right!\\"  <br /> <br />F:\\"And now I know why things aren't as pretty on the inside...\\" <br /> <br />R:\\"Our savior he is returning soon and I wonder when...\\" <br /> <br />F:\\"I just made you up to hurt myself\\" <br /> <br />R:\\"Awesome, your word(s), all these answers are\\" <br /> <br />

B000B5IPLK|3.0|Alicia Keys has truly done it all in the music world.  After being signed to other labels before ultimately being blessed with Clive Davis and J Records, she has sold millions of records, won awards and accolades galore, been on countless magazine covers, admired the world over by fans and those looking for a good role model, and solidified a lasting musical career for years to come.  She is compared to legends that have paved the way for her to be where she is, including Aretha Franklin, Prince, and the late Donny Hathaway.  Being of mixed race, she is embraced by both Blacks and Whites as well as other people who love her for her music, her beauty, and her style.  So it was basically a no-brainer that a live album from this classically-trained pianist-turned-R&B superstar would be stellar in every way imaginable.  Well, some might be surprised with the inequities that are widespread on this Unplugged album.<br /><br />I have to stop now and say that I am a fan of Alicia Keys through and through.  I've seen her perform live twice now: once at the beginning of her climb to stardom when Fallin' was all you would hear from practically every urban station in America, and another time when she had proven herself as a superstar and sold millions of copies of Songs In A Minor to all her newly attained fans.  I own both her studio albums, and continue to support everything she does.  (Getting ready to drop a bomb now)  But Unplugged is far from the tree when it comes to comparing it to her multi-platinum gems.  Don't get me wrong, she does a pretty good job throughout the entire recorded performance.  But that's like a CEO giving an speech to his employees, saying all the right things but still stumbling over his or her words.  Sure, it was a \\"pretty good job\\" but it's certainly nowhere near the best that they can do.  So is the case with Alicia Keys and her Unplugged album.<br /><br />Performing new school classics like \\"A Woman's Worth,\\" \\"Fallin,\\" and \\"You Don't Know My Name\\" are passable, sometimes hitting the wrong note, not catching her breath, and overstretching her voice at times.  And the background singers should've been screened or something because they sound like somebody you'd find at your local talent show held at bar trying to pass itself as a club (we've all been to one of those!)  Even her newest song  \\"Unbreakable\\" sounds a little rushed when you listen to it.  And her song with Adam Levine entitled \\"Wild Horses\\" is way out of left field.  It sounds like a deep topic, but you would never know it. With Levine's overbearing twang, and Alicia's missteps at trying to gel with Levine's flow on the song, your left wondering why they even did the song in the first place.<br /><br />I know you probably are sitting there in astonishment...believe me, I was doing the same thing.  I literally had to listen to this album over and over again to make sure I was losing it.  But alas, it is all there for your ears to hear in disbelief.  I was trying to think of reasons why the singing was off that night, and all I could come up with was the possibility of too much rehearsing.  It helps that the majority of Unplugged is full of decently performed songs that we have come to love and enjoy.  But there were easily a lot of keys missed that day by Alicia.  After hearing the musical massacre on a bunch of these songs, you might actually wish you had left your cd player Unplugged!

0307276902|1.0|I was watching Oprah a week or so ago and she and several members of her audience raved that they couldn't put the book down.  I haven't found one like that since the Thornbirds so decided to buy it.  Made a special trip to a bookstore about 15 miles from my home and settled in when I returned home to read this.  I kept thinking it would get better and when I got to page 53 I just stopped and thought, I have had enough.  When I took it to our local library this afternoon the librarian was thrilled to receive it and said they had a huge waiting list.  I told her that I thought it was absolutely terrible and can't imagine anyone finishing this book.  I must say that this is the only book I have ever gone to read the last page because I knew I would never finish reading it.
0393327655|2.0|I agree with the author's general conclusion (religion does more harm than good, and we should discard it) but I can't recommend this book.  The author drones on and on about the philosophical aspects of morality and ethics.  Ugh.  Some people may enjoy reading that sort of stuff (for page after endless page), but I'd rather have a root canal.

B00006AFUR|3.0|Some may enjoy this album a lot but for me I only really enjoyed half of it to the full extent. Its a good cd but some songs just didnt do anything for me. Songs that I love are \\"Capricorn\\", \\"Edge of the Earth\\", \\"Oblivion\\", and \\"Fallen\\". The rest are ok but nothing I would probably want to hear alone with out being in concession with the rest of the albums tracks. It was a nice listen and a keeper, but nothing groundbreaking. Worth a Listen
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Oh Rod - what happened? I loved you back with the Faces and your early solo stuff but this - this -this - how can I put it - is reallly baadddb, and I don't mean in a James Brown way. Frankly you sound like a lady and if I want to hear some classic ballads, I'll put on Frank Sinatra.  <br />So Rod, what gives? I'm sure you have enough money to retire in comfort, so please stop making a fool of yourself. <br />Meanwhile, I'll put on 'Every Picture Tells a Story'  - AHHH - now that's better.
B00070Q7VO|1.0|Buble is pure record company hype and more the work of a publicist than any musical accomplishment.  It sells and that's all that matters.  The deceased original artists are light years better but marketing magic has put Buble in everyone's faces.  At some point, Buble will flame out through overexposure or the teeny boppers grow up.  Buble represents why music is in such disarray through monopolistic practices that emphasize star making marketing over artistry, which retards the development of new sounds and talent.  The day will come when people will toss their Buble, Brittany Spears, and Ashlee Simpson CDs in the trash heap wondering, \\"What was I thinking when I bought this schlock?\\"
6305311463|1.0|I am perfectly aware that part of the mission for the Criterion Collection is to promote an awareness and appreciation for, not just old or overlooked masterpeices, but also contemporary films which fit certain niches.  I'm also all for recognition of the place \\"summer\\" movies in cinema; I like two hours worth of eye-gasm visuals, stunts and head thumping THX sound just as much as the next guy (Matrix anyone? how bout the X-men?).  Michael Bay's movies are like Justin Timberlake's songs; tolerable if your twelve or are on the back end of a four day bender.  Acknowleging the very existance of movies from Bay would not be worth my time if it were not for the fact that the Criterion Collection has released DVDs of not just Armageddon, but the Rock as well.  Everyone who gives two s**ts for cinema should make an effort to watch as many C.C. movies as they can get their hands on, but why they chose Armageddon and The Rock to feature as archtypal summer movies is beyond my comprehension.  Granted some of the specials with The Rock are actually pretty cool, but God, a music video with Aerosmith?  I'd rather eat glass.  I won't belabor the horrors of these movies others have covered that ground sufficiently. I'm more dissapointed with the C.C. for expending effort to release Michael Bay movies, at least they could have done Aliens or T2.

B000286RKW|5.0|First things first, this movie is not overrated. If you want to see an overrated crime film, watch Scarface (the movie that every 13 year old rap fan seems to salivate over after seeing their favorite rapper display his/her copy on MTV's \\"Cribs\\"). I'm a big fan of Robert De Niro (he's my favorite actor) and Martin Scorsese (my favorite director next to Stanley Kubrick), so this movie was a true treat. The film is based on the real life gangster Henry Hill.<br /><br />This film is very memorable by top class performances by Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, but Ray Liotta steals the show. There are only two movies on organized crime that you need to see. The Godfather and Goodfellas. Goodfellas brilliantly and according to many real goodfellas, accurately depicts mob life. In my opinion,  this is a true 5 star film. From the screenplay to the acting to the directing, it's a masterpiece of filmmaking. It just seems as though everyone in the movie is custom fit to their role. Very, very few films achieve that. So many memorable lines and scenes, its too many to list. I know this review doesn't say much, but trust me, this movie is a must see!<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B0000041XX|5.0|You can read the technical information about the contents of this CD above. That is not what this review is about. I became intrested in opera about 1 1/2 years ago because of happening upon Mario Lanza. Since then, I have experienced many great truly operatic voices, including the \\"King,\\" Pavarotti.<br />If you are just discovering opera, suffice it to say; Buy this album!!! It was the concert that launched the 3 Tenors phenomenon. It is full of uplifting, heart- tugging favorites, and you will find yourself listening to it over and over. Buy the dvd as well. It imparts absolute electricity! I am a young  pianist and vocalist, and this concert is truly inspiring to me! You won't regret one penny you spend on this!
B000053VAF|5.0|\\"Dogma\\" was the first film by Kevin Smith that I was introduced to, and it quickly made me a fan of him. Basically, the film is about these two fallen angels, who decide to become human because they have found a loophole that will gain them re-enterance into heaven via entering a Catholic church in New Jersey. However, if they do re-enter heaven, they will prove that God is imperfect, thus ending all of existence. Bethany, the last zion, is contacted by the voice of God, because she is the great-great-great (etc.) grand-niece of Jesus Christ himself. Along with two profits, a muse, the voice of God, and an apostle, Bethany travels to New Jersey in order to stop their re-entry, while attempting to avoid Azrael, an ex-muse turned demon who wants to get his revenge on God.<br /><br />The acting was superb, Kevin's writing was creative and hilarious, and the movie made you think. Several points in the movie reinforce Smith's point that this is a movie about the importance of faith. I love how it took story lines from the Bible and made an original plot and comedy with them. It unearthed common questions. Why can't God be a woman? What happens when you cut off an angel's wings? Add alcohol and a sense of irony to an angel and what are you going to get? If there were really muses what productions of this day and age would they be responsible for? Everyone played their roles very well and it made for a really amusing movie. Kevin Smith is a genius. I highly advise this movie to ANYONE.
4789009637|5.0|I'm a student at Texas A&M University and our Japanese professor uses this book to teach us. It is VERY helpful and is full of lots of helpful tips and ways to relate Japanese to English. Not only does our professor use it, but also many different universities with Japanese programs across the nation (including Harvard and Stanford) use Genki to teach there students with. I highly recommend this. Don't forget the workbook and the CD's!
B000001Y2U|4.0|I would like to start my review by saying that people who dont like this album shouldn't write reviews that give no justification for why you dont like it.  At least explain the reason for disliking it.  In one of the kid reviews on this page, the reviewer just states that he hates the album and thinks Manson should die.  In my opinion, that is very immature and doesn't help people at all. <br />Anyway, now that is out of my system, let's get down to business.  <br />Antichrist Superstar is Marilyn Manson's 2nd full length album.  It was produced by Tent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails, and you can definitely hear the similarities between this album and The Downward Spiral, which was released by NIN two years prior.  However Manson manages to keep things original by throwing in his goth-metal sound and unique style.   <br />This album is considered a concept album, telling of the coming of the Antichrist through a character named the Worm.  The lyrics are intentionally vague.  The storyline idea is what initially drew me to this album.  I am not a satanist, nor do I believe that all society should be wiped away, but I find Manson's view intriguing and it is interesting to listen to his lyrics, follow the story, and see what he has to say about the world.   <br />This is probably Manson's most sonically original album, but the lyrics are lacking in profoundness.  There are some clever lines here in each song, but I think albums such as Mechanical Animals and Holy Wood were much more effective in promoting Manson's views. <br />Overall, an essential album for anyone looking for a good, shocking, metal album.
B0009VRHLK|4.0|...just kidding. but that's the only reason i could think of for this film getting a 1 star rating.  <br />Packing a slow-burning punch to the heart and soul, ' The Brown Bunny' gently reveals a lonely man's wanderings across america as he grapples with his life now seemingly anaesthetized by the absence of his former love.  <br />Recommended viewing, one of my favourite films of the year.

This only shows the mentality of such and you can only imagine the bands he says are good. <br />I've been listening to music since the early 60's, growing up with all the original music producing bands (Beatles, Stones, Sabbath, Doors, Deep Purple, Blue Oyster Cult) and you need to appreciate these new bands because all of them are somehow related to some early bands.  <br />If you are an older and more experienced music listener you will know what I mean.
B0007O38F8|1.0|I just can't seem to understand what happens to rappers as they move along in their careers.  How can you have such grit and intensity on one album, and then turn into an R & B act on the next?  I am extremely disappointed with this 50 Cent album.  \\"Get Rich Or Die Tryin'\\" was an absolute classic, front to back.  And 50's releases prior to \\"Get Rich...\\" were strong lyrically, even if some of the production was weak.  But \\"The Massacre\\" is just straight garbage!  Now I know why I've always gone back to listening to underground and local hip-hop... the artists still care about the music.  First 50 Cent dates Vivica, now he's trying to BE like Vivica... Hollywood!  I hope his soul is worth all the cash... because the respect that he's lost with the TRUE fans of rap music can never be replaced.  Please America, don't waste your cash on \\"The Massacre.\\"
B000AYQJJ2|5.0|Well, the boxed set deluxe edition of \\"The Concert for Bangladesh\\" is a thing of beauty - the package is almost identical to the classic 3-record boxed set, with no hideous bar codes marring the cover - and the visuals, the sound, and the extras on the 2nd disc are all sublime. The sticker and the postcard remind me of being a kid in the 70s, 'cause when you bought a Wings or an Elton John album, for example, there would be lots of cool stuff inside - of course that doesn't happen now. Fun things could still be made to fit inside well-designed CD packages, but ours is a disposable culture and the the record companies are just to cheap.<br /><br />Of course, George Harrison's oeuvre was/is the antithesis of \\"cheap\\" and \\"disposable,\\" and this concert, following his now-stone-classic solo debut \\"All Thing Must Pass,\\" was his finest hour. It's good to at long last see and hear Bob Dylan's performance of \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit.\\" But where is George's performance of \\"Hear Me Lord\\" from the afternoon show? It's nowhere to be found on either the remastered DVD or CD? His equally gospel-fueled \\"Awaiting On You All\\" sounds amazing, so it's hard to think that his performance of  the stirring \\"Hear Me Lord\\" would be anything less than stellar. So why wasn't that included in either package? I'm assuming that all this was done under the supervision of Harrison, and then his family following his untimely demise. The ommission of \\"Hear Me Lord\\" is as glaring as the ommissions on \\"The Dark Horse Years\\" boxed set. Very annoying. I'm also annoyed that Dylan didn't appear in the commentaries along with Ringo, Eric, Ravi et al. Of course being a Dylan fan does mean putting up with the man's eccentric quirks (which George evidently did very well). One of the nicest bonuses is seeing and hearing Bob and George dueting on \\"If Not For You\\" at the rehearsals, looking at each other each time they sang \\"if not for you\\" - very sweet, and their deep friendship and mutual admiration is obvious. Sometimes in our star-struck culture, we need to be reminded that icons are human beings who need refuge from their fame and maybe can seek solace in each other. That said, where is \\"Hear Me Lord?\\"<br /><br />I've not bought the remastered CD. Based on the reviews that I've read here, I'm not sure if I will. Who cares if the gospel voices sounds \\"dated\\"; hence the \\"need\\" for them to be muted? That sounds suspiciously racist and culturally biased to me.

B00097DXZS|5.0|I knew it would be good, but I was really shocked at HOW good it was. It's a rare thing nowadays - that first listen when you just go \\"Wha...What was that???!!! Yes its that good. Copyright protection mumbo jumbo aside, Carlos has once again proved that old phrase \\"3rd times a charm\\" - and it is. Steven Tyler sound as great as ever - you even get his signature scream on \\"Just Feel Better\\". Though widely unknown, Anthony Hamilton fits in perfectly among the roster of stars. \\"Twisted\\" featuring Hamilton sounds like it was written during the soul drenched 70's. And then for all you guitar freaks - you get a triple dose of sweet distortion on \\"Trinity\\" with Kirk Hammett, and pedal steel wiz, Robert Randolph.  <br /> <br />This new record will please anybody. Now if only they'll release it on vinyl!!!
B00000JS1M|5.0|I do not own this import CD but the original vinyl picture disc. I am not a Saxon fanatic but I know what I like and \\"The Power and the Glory\\" album was the pinnacle for the group in my opinion.

1400034779|5.0|Dr. Alexander McCall Smith's most famous work, The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency, is a charming and witty novel featuring a cast of equally likable characters.  Protagonist Precious Ramotswe, a witty and intelligent woman of size, runs the only ladies' detective agency in Botswana.  Her perseverance and sharp mind allow her to solve a variety of crimes, including the kidnapping of a young boy by a witch doctor for \\"strengthening spell\\" purposes.  Throughout the novel, Smith integrates a subtle yet exceedingly entertaining humor with deeper moral issues, producing a novel that is at once both thought provoking and light.  This quality adds to the appeal of substance of the novel as well as serves to produce characters that earn the reader's approval and respect. <br /> At the very heart of her character, Precious Ramotswe presents a picture of happiness and success.  Living an extremely laid back lifestyle in Africa, and without a single care to live anywhere else, Precious appeals to the on-the-go American reader in every way.  She represents something that Americans long for as they \\"hustle and bustle\\" throughout their busy lives: a certain peace and satisfaction with their accomplishments.  In some ways, the stereotypical American is insatiable.  He or she embodies the \\"more, more, more\\" ideal, in which no achievement-no matter how great-is ever enough.  Precious provides a counterpoint to this drive in every way.  She is both effective in her daily activities, and happy lounging the day away with her cup of tea.  When she has something to accomplish, she possesses an immense amount of practical intelligence and patience, and when no clients knock on her door, she is content to spend the day with a friend or magazine.  As a society, the American public is envious of Precious because of her driven, yet patient attitude.  Her lifestyle represents one that few Americans are able to achieve.  The \\"businesspeople\\" are on the go at every hour of the day or night; the mothers are constantly running to and from activities with their children; the \\"workingman\\" spends eight hours on the clock and then collapses in front of the television with a beer; the \\"sloth\\" lives off welfare and doesn't ever accomplish anything.  And yet, not one of these people can claim true happiness.  None of them possess that \\"happy medium\\" in which they are content to glide along the flow of life-enjoying challenges that arise, and just noticing the beauty that exists around them.  This fact alone adds an immense amount of appeal to the novel.  <br /> Also intermingled with Precious's enviable anecdotal lifestyle is a sense of humor that adds another dimension to both the novel as a whole and her likeability as a character.  For instance, in many of Dr. McCall Smith's novels he includes mention of a ravenous crocodile that consumes unsuspecting victims.  This novel is no different.  Precious is asked to find the husband of a woman who has disappeared after attending a baptism.  Using her wit and stamina, Precious brings her neighbor's dog to the river and, upon the appearance of a crocodile, she proceeds to kill it, cut open its stomach, extract the man's jewelry, and present the evidence to the man's wife.  Surprisingly, the wife is relieved that her husband had not run off with another woman, and is happy for her newly gained freedom.  This humorous and unexpected approach to a tragic tale is common throughout the novel, and allows Dr. Smith to present a variety of gruesome stories in a lighthearted, enjoyable manner.       <br /> Precious's physical description provides another instance for Dr. McCall Smith to utilize his humorous writing faculties.  As a large black woman, unconcerned with her weight and extremely practical about exactly what she can and cannot fit into, one can only imagine her going about her detective work.  The reader can only laugh out loud while envisioning Precious's attempt to fit into a crowd while following a young girl, or \\"hiding\\" in the overgrown garden of a suspicious doctor-or set of doctors, as she later learns.  Obviously, one would presume that the woman's large and attention-drawing stature would impede her sleuthing ability, but instead, this quality makes her more likable and trustable to other characters.  This draws yet another contrast between the African and American societies in general.  The very nature of Precious's physical character directly contrasts the American ideal of beauty and social acceptability.  Yet, the reader is invariably drawn to her as the epitome of the \\"perfectly rounded\\" (no pun intended) character.  It is through the humor and dignity of every aspect of her physical nature and lifestyle that she gains the reader's respect and admiration.  <br />
B00097DXZS|1.0|Sorry diehards but Carlos is selling out to the mainstream, what was once beautiful music from this man has turned into the same crap we hear from every other mainstream artist you see on mtv day in and day out.... <br />   I bought this at a local store cause it was cheap... 9.95... gonna take it out and play frisbee with it tomorrow or give it to the first hip hopper that comes along.... <br />   Carlos is no longer a Shaman.. just a Shame....
B000006TRV|5.0|This whole album got me through some really mellow moments. Not many people realize the story being told, and how everyone could relate to \\"Pink\\" in some form or another. In my opinion, if you want to hear genius guitar play, look no further than this album. If it doesn't make the hairs on the back of your neck stand, and doesn't inspire you to really look at your own life and the wall we create within and around ourselves, then you will never really understand the power of this album, and maybe you should just stick to the typical top 40 charts/MTV/pop music of today.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old
B000002BYD|4.0|Haven't heard a bad PJ album yet and Yield is no exception. That being said, it's not my favorite and ranks 4th on my list. I'll start by giving you a few reasons why I give this 4 stars. The first is I skip three tracks on a regular basis. Those are the unknown 8th track of only drums, Push Me, Pull Me, and Do The Evolution. Before anyone gets on my case about DTE there's a reason. The song itself sounds fine but I don't care at all for evolution. I understand a lot of people like it though and it's certainly not a bad song. Push Me, Pull Me is a song a lot like I'm Open on No Code in that Ed has this voice over thing going and the song is a little funky.<br /><br />Enough of the bad, onto the good. First of all, Given To Fly is my second favorite Pearl Jam song behind only Rearviewmirror. It's a bit slower paced but the lyrics are amazing. Not to mention at the climax of the song Eddie really belts it out. The other songs I find strong are Wishlist(a slow song that can hold many different meanings), Low Light(written by Jeff Ament, most unique track but beautifully written), and No Way. Throughout you can tell each song is a bit less experimental than No Code while still delievering a different sound. The PJ usual guitar solos and amazing vocals are all there as you'd expect. There's the interesting song like Pilate that has a chorus you wouldn't really expect as well.<br /><br />At this point if you've been getting all the PJ CD's in order you'll notice they always seem to do a great job on album artwork that captures the feel of the album itself. In this case you have an open road with a Yield sign. To me this, along with the booklet of black and white pictures showing beautiful locations, give a feel of infinite possibilites or an open mind. With some of the topics of the songs like Faithful, Do The Evolution, Given To Fly, Wishlist, you get that same feel. Pearl Jam are the masters to me when it comes to making music really seem like an art. They also get better with every album and you never can predict what each will sound like before your first listen.<br /><br />Overall, if you've liked Pearl Jam's work(most particularly No Code) you should love this album all the same. Whatever you do don't give up on PJ after a listen or two when it comes to a new album. This is the case with Yield as it may take some time to grow on you.better with every album and you never can predict what each will sound like before your first listen. <br /> <br />Overall, if you've liked Pearl Jam's work(most particularly No Code) you should love this album all the same.

B00005LC4B|5.0|Martin Scorsese's 1991 remake of the 1962 thriller stars Robert De Niro as Max Cady (in an oscar nominated performance), a recently released from prison ex-con, who seeks revenge, therefore decides to stalk and terrorize his lawyer's family (his wife, played by Jessica Lange, and 15 year old daughter, played by Juliette Lewis, who was also nominated for an oscar) after figuring out that his lawyer, Sam Bowden (played by Nick Nolte), hid a document from his once illiterate client that could have gotten his sentence revoked. Gregory Peck and Robert Mitchum from the original appear in this film as well, and it was nice to see them.<br /><br />For his role in \\"Cape Fear\\", De Niro researched sexual predator crimes for the part and suggested the scene where his character bites the victim. De Niro paid a dentist $5,000 to make his teeth look suitably bad for the role of Max Cady. After filming, he paid $20,000 to have them fixed. De Niro did a lot of working out several months before the movie and during the shoot to make him the muscular Max Cady, reportedly taking his body fat down to only 3%.<br /><br />In the end: The performances are amazing, Martin Scorsese's direction is excellent as usual, and Freddie Francis' cinematography is stunning. This film will keep you on the edge of your seat as you see Max Cady begin to terrorize Sam Bowden and his whole family, taking it from one extreme to the next.<br /><br />Recommended!

0767803434|4.0|When Air Force One, carrying President James Marshall and his family, is taken over by terrorists, the President makes it to the escape pod on the plane, but he refuses to leave while his family is still on board. With all members of the Secret Service dead and the terrorists threatening to kill a hostage every half-hour until a prisoner is released from a Russian jail, it is up to Marshall to stop the terrorists. Will he be able to stop the terrorists and save his family?<br /><br />Okay, in this type of film viewers know from the beginning that the good guys are going to win and the bad guys are going to lose, badly, but not before lots of people die. But, while somewhat predictable, and highly implausible, this is still a good thriller, with plenty of edge of your seat chills. There's just enough twist on the action adventure formula to keep the viewer from guessing what will happen next.<br /><br />Director Wolfgang Petersen deserves most of the credit for making this film work as well as it does. There are plenty of thrilling action sequences, especially the one that closes out the movie. Harrison Ford is a bit stiff as the President at the beginning of the film, but loosens up and does fine once he gets into action hero mode. Gary Oldman is wonderfully creepy as the main terrorist. Glenn Close and Dean Stockwell do fine as the Vice President and Defense Secretary. William H. Macy is, as always, perfect in a supporting role. Wendy Crewson is also good as the First Lady.<br /><br />This is a good action adventure film.

B000BBOUU4|2.0|Stick with \\"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory\\".  I don't know what Depp and Burton were on when they made this one, but neither of them is up to their usual level.  The feel of the movie was inconsistent and Depp couldn't seem to decide if his character was creepy, wise, childish...or maybe he *meant* to seem schizophrenic.  The backstory bit was mostly a waste of time, the same goal could have been accomplished with about 1/3 of the time devoted to it.  Parts of the movie were delightful, but overall I found it a waste of ticket money.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Opeth is probably the most talented and original sounding bands out there today.  This album shows that not only does progressive music has a future, but it very likely is the future of rock music. <br /> <br />What you have hear is a perfect combination of new and old styles of progressive rock and death metal music.  It had been something they had been experimenting with since their first album Orchid, but I think they really perfected it with this one. <br /> <br />Prevalent instruments include guitars of all types including beautiful acoustic guitar playing and heavy and impressive electric guitar playing.  The vocals are spot on, and it always amazes me how Mike can switch seamlessly between his grunting death metal voice, and his angelic clean sounding vioce.  The drumming and bass playing are top notch, proving that this rhythm section is definitely one of the best out there.  But the most notable addition is that of the keyboards playing a more prominent role. <br /> <br />You will hear mellotrons mix guitars beautifully and used in ways very similar to King Crimson and early Genesis.  There are also some synth and organ sounds throughout this album, to give it an earrie and medieval gothic feel.  It sounds kind of like Old School symphonic progressive rock, but with a much more modern recording quality and style of death metal.  You can clearly hear a strong influence of classical music on some of these epics, particularly on Reverie. <br /> <br />The changing dynamics are also very impressive.  You will have to listen to this cd very loud, because you will want to hear every nuance of the quiet sections, and will feel the needed to be fully eviscerated by the heavier sections. <br /> <br />These guys have gone way beyond Tool in their epic orchestrations, and have surpassed them as the current masters of progressive metal.

If you never purchase another dvd you must have this one.  For most movies - once does it and then it's on the the next one.  Firefly and now Serenity are both repeat watches.  I promise you'll never get tired of it.  Five stars doesn't even come close.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had never seen the TV show \\"Firefly\\" prior to walking into Serenity.  However, I had heard of it, and I WAS aware that the movie was set in the \\"Firefly\\" universe and featured the same characters.  Knowing that, many things could have complicated this movie for me, but not a single thing did. <br /> <br />The trailers are what actually enticed me to see the movie.  While watching them, I didn't get the notion that Serenity was your average \\"sci-fi\\" movie, and it isn't.  Unlike many other sci-fi movies, it never goes out of it's way to say, \\"Hey!  I'm a sci-fi movie!\\"  There are no aliens.  What it does have, that many other sci-fi movies lack, is heart -- humour, great dialogue, engauging characters -- which drives a great story.  And it's a story worth watching.  It's a fantastic film that features great action sequences, intriguing characters, air-tight pacing, and a gripping plot.  I still do not refer to it as \\"sci-fi\\", because \\"sci-fi\\" is rarely so fantastic. <br /> <br />Also prior to seeing Serenity, I promised myself that if I enjoyed the movie, I would purchase the Firefly DVD set.  Around the 11 or 12 minute mark of the movie, I remember thinking to myself \\"I am going to love this movie\\" -- a reaction that was elicited by the introduction to the movie's central characters.  The next morning I found myself talking to the cashier at the local HMV.  As I handed him the Firefly DVD set, he asked me if I had seen Serenity yet.  I remember saying to him, \\"I promised myself that if I loved the movie, I would buy the Firefly DVDs...\\"
B000AADYRQ|5.0|For whatever reason, I had never listened to this band before someone told me to check out Plans.<br /><br />I can't compare to the other albums, but this one is achingly beautiful. I have it on shuffle with the newest Tears for Fears CD (Everyone loves a happy ending) and somehow they complement each other in a wonderful way.  But then I shuffled RadioHeads's Kid A with Prince's Musicology and loved that too!
B0001MDQ2G|5.0|I love this band.  It's sort of like Blind Guardian, mixed with death metal and Middle Eastern music.  Really cool stuff.  Buy this if you want some great original metal.
B00003CXIY|3.0|This movie was sorta funny, but not near the great comedy class.  The second movie was much better.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the greatest film/mini-series ever..EVER made!!! If any of you don't agree I challenge you to a fist fight!! I could watch this whole thing every week and never get tired of it..it is absolutely engaging..and it stays with you.
B000AY3KN0|5.0|I am very much looking forward to this release, now even more after learning the lost spider pit sequence has been reconstructed by Peter Jackson, creator of the new \\"King Kong\\" due out in theaters in December. I'm just hopeful the spider scene is included in the newly restored film and is not just an extra on the bonus features disc.  <br />The first movie I ever watched, according to my mother, was the original \\"King Kong.\\" I apparently watched it intently from my playpen sometime in the early 1970s. \\"King Kong\\" also happens to be the first videotape I purchased in the 1980s. I remember reading the Book of Lists 2 back in the late 1970s and it featured a section on the most famous scenes cut out of movies. One of them was the scene in 1931's \\"Frankenstein,\\" when Boris Karloff, playing the monster, threw a little girl into a lake. That scene has since been restored by Universal, but I'll never forget the joy of seeing it for the first time. I purchased the restored version of Frankenstein on video back in the late 1980s and it was great to finally see the cut lake scene after years of wondering what it was like. I still get a kick out of seeing it today. One of the other famous cuts mentioned in the same book, however, was the spider sequence. <br />The cut was made in 1933. It's 2005 and a print of it has never been found. But I'd rather see a reconstructed spider sequence than nothing at all. Hopefully, it's a part of the movie and not just an extra. And, you can't go wrong with it when you have Peter Jackson behind it. Well, I guess we'll have to wait until Nov. 22 to see how it all pans out.
B0000683DH|5.0|This is the movie that saved Star Trek. If it weren't for 'Wrath of Khan', the franchise might have died. This film is packed with excitement, great effects, an excellent script and some truly memorable performances by Shatner (\\"Khan you bloodsucker!\\"), Nimoy and Ricardo Montalban. The ending scenes, especially with Shatner and Nimoy are certainly some of the best in the history of Star Trek. Whoever thought up the glass wall was a genius. <br /> <br />The extra features on the special edition make for great viewing as well. You will learn how Nick Meyer saved Star Trek from its very creator. <br /> <br />'The Wrath of Khan' lives up to all the hype, and then some. Khan is one of the all-time great sci-fi villians!
B00005B36H|5.0|This is one of the greatest progressive albums ever. Strong words, but I felt it necessary. Reviewing Tool's music is incredibly difficult, but at the end of the day, I simply adore this album. So I will give my account.<br /><br />The debate over \\"Aenima\\" or \\"Lateralus\\" is all very well, and really boils down to personal taste concerning the different styles, but the brilliance of each release is undeniable. On \\"Lateralus\\" Tool go for a more progressive approach with less interludes (anyone that calls them fillers can just...) and longer, more intricately structured songs, and in some cases extended pieces (\\"Disposition/Reflection/Triad\\").<br /><br />Thematically the album takes a change of direction from \\"Aenima\\", which preached self-awareness and thinking for ones self, and quite a bit of aggressive lamenting on the worst aspects of society. \\"Lateralus\\" has a far more spiritual vibe, with songs similar in theme to \\"46&2\\", addressing evolving within, learning to live on despite the hardships life brings.<br /><br />Musically \\"Lateralus\\" opens with a mighty swipe. \\"The Grudge\\" answers any queries straight away - this is going to be another typically complex Tool album. The intricate structuring takes a while to get used to (like most of Tool's lengthier songs) but once the time changes, guitar chopping/changing, complex signatures and outstanding vocals sink in, you have Tool's finest album opener. \\"Eon Blue Apocalypse\\" leads seamlessly into \\"The Patient\\", a true progressive piece, slowly building with MJK's menacing whispers into an onslaught of powerful riffs and drumming. As a side note, Danny's drumming has never been as important as it is in \\"Lateralus\\" as he really holds the music together, a necessity given the added complexity of the structuring. In my opinion he takes the limelight here.<br /><br />\\"Schism\\" is probably Tool's most recognisable song thanks to MTV. Perhaps a Tool fan might be angered by MTV playing this song, and perhaps it will put off those die-hard metalheads among us. But really, this is a good song, combining brooding vocal and guitar melodies with a stunning middle section that builds and twists in typical Tool fashion. \\"Parabol/Parabola\\" is a fine piece, once again demonstrating Tool's strengthened progressive quality on \\"Lateralus\\". The piece starts slowly, building the main theme until an eruption of fuzzy guitars takes your head off, evolving into one of the most unapologetic rockers Tool has created for years.<br /><br />The last part of the album really distinguishes \\"Lateralus\\" from previous Tool albums, starting with \\"Ticks & Leeches\\", Tool's heaviest song to date. The best aspect of this song is that this is Danny's strongest performance in Tool history. He really gives those skins something to think about, laying down an enthralling and energetic introduction. Unfortunately I feel MJK goes a little overboard with some harsh screaming, and it just seems to ruin the spiritual and calming vibes of the album. But all is forgiven - the title track is simply flooring. The climax is plainly stunning; everything you can possibly like about Tool is on display here - sumptuous vocals, complex time signatures and intricate guitar playing. The song is also the thematic pinnacle of the album, emphasising the themes of living through hardships and gaining spiritual peace with the inspiring and uplifting MJK lines of \\"ride the spiral to the end, it may just go where no ones been\\" and \\"spiral out, keep going\\". Along with \\"46&2\\" this is the most positive and elevating song in the Tool catalogue.<br /><br />Just when you think things cannot in any way improve, the \\"Disposition/Reflection/Triad\\" epic cuts your jugular. Starting with a short middle east-esque piece, mostly evolving around harmonic guitar and vocal melodies, the band moves seamlessly into \\"Reflection\\", arguably Tool's finest work to date. Those short melodies explored on \\"Disposition\\" come back and form the main themes and structures for the song. MJK's performance is simply beautiful, creating an initial sinister and dark vibe complemented perfectly by Justin's driving bass lines and Danny's tribal drumming. As the song progresses so do the lyrics and the subsequent theme. In keeping with the rousing and positive themes of \\"Lateralus\\", the depressed and lonely character first depicted in the song finds hope and motivation to change his ways before he \\"pines away\\", giving the song a flourishing and optimistic ending. The song then fades into \\"Triad\\", a short and sharp metal exploit; again retaining the eastern flavour with some nicely executed sound sampling. To sum up these last few songs -  \\"Lateralus\\" starts top notch, and ends even better<br /><br />I cannot recommend this album enough, just buy it and listen. The new millennium's first masterpiece.l, creating an initial sinister and dark vibe complemented perfectly by Justin's driving bass lines and Danny's tribal drumming.

B0000AUHOH|3.0|We all know that Star Trek V is generally considered the worst in the franchise, and that most people like to blame its director, William Shatner. After watching 'Star trek: Nemesis' and the special features on 'The Final Frontier', I can tell you that people are wrong on both counts. <br /> <br />Firstly, Star Trek V is easily better than the total disaster that was 'Nemesis', and is probably better than 'Insurrection' as well. Admittedly, the movie has many problems, but it's far from unwatchable. <br /> <br />Secondly, when watching the special features on 'Final Frontier' it becomes clear that almost everything worked against William Shatner. I know it sounds like I've bought into some sort of Shatner egotist sob-story, but that's not the case. Watch the features, the facts are all there. Forced script changes, cuts, deadlines, low budget, effects shipped out to some awful company that 'didn't care' how they turned out... Everyone who watched this with me felt sorry for Shatner at the end. He got the short end of the stick on this one. <br /> <br />Anyway, Trek fans will want to pick this up for completeness, and I highly reccommend the special edition. Watch this one again, it's really not too bad.
B00065MDSQ|5.0|After acquiring KC's early `symphonic' releases I was inclined to try the powerful 70's KC, and how I was blown away. This album is quite simply brutal, full of Sabbathy riffs and hard, no-nonsense drumming from Brufford.<br /><br />The opening track `Red' is one of KC's finest to date, it chugs and churns its way through fierce guitar riffs, changes in tempo, melody...just a great powerful track. `Fallen Angel' is another glorious song, KC's twisted take on a ballad, the chorus is catchy and undeniably pop, but the jaw-dropping jazz improvisation passages retain that schizophrenic unpredictable style that makes KC so enjoyable. `One More Red Nightmare' is an obvious progression from the title track, sinister riffs and harsh drumming, but once again KC throw in some simply weird elements, such as the Bowie-esque verse which flows seamlessly into the hard hitting chorus. No KC album is complete without long jazz improv jams, and here its `Providence', I used to find myself skipping this track but now I find it compelling to just sit back, relax and absorb the wondrous playing. The closer `Starless' is one of KC's finest closers, bordering on the earlier symphonic style with its ethereal chorus and vocal melodies, this is a fine way to finish a fine album.<br /><br />For fans of progressive rock and prog metal this is simply a must have.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is a brilliant film that blends genres together in a masterful and often surprising fashion.  I enjoyed this film more than any sci-fi film in recent memory. <br />  A lot of fun.  I'm really looking forward to watching it again on DVD.  There aren't many films that I enjoy rewatching - but this is definitely one of the few.

B000AL730Y|5.0|My best friend and love gifted me with this CD on a recent birthday. A Beatles fan, I own only two McCartney solo CDs - Tripping the Live Fantastic and All the Best. I've gotten away from listening to the radio, other than talk, during the last 15 years and must admit that I had no idea what McCartney had been into since his Wings days.<br /><br />Chaos and Creation in the Backyard showcases McCartney at his best. His songwriting is much more refined and sophisticated, yet there remains, on several cuts, an unmistakable Beatles flavor, although you don't have to be a Beatles fan to appreciate it. More serious than in his Beatle's days, a couple cuts on Chaos and Creation still maintain a certain playfulness, while others belie the maturity of a full life lived well.<br /><br />None of the 13 cuts can be considered B-side, and although I enjoyed this disk on my very first listen, each subsequent listening has found some new subtle nuance. For years I wondered which Beatle - Lennon or McCartney - was the better composer/songwriter. Today, as a result of Chaos and Creation, I can honestly say McCartney was the greater influence. There may be better musicians, but as a songwriter/composer, McCartney is second to no one. Others may criticize a lost edge to his work, but in my opinion his creativity, like a fine wine, has improved with age.<br /><br />The special edition disc includes a DVD which I found a pleasant surprise, with McCartney talking about the writing and recording of Chaos and Creation, and a nice addition. Had I purchased this disk, I would not have balked at the few extra dollars.<br /><br />Highly recommended, although be forewarned: this CD demands sequential listening.
B000929AJQ|3.0|I've always been a kind of `casual' fan of NIN's work, I enjoy `The Downwrad Spiral' every now and then, if I'm in the mood for it and `Fragile' has decent moments so I felt inclined to try this. I can't say I'm disappointed as I didn't really have much expectation, but I didn't fall in love with it either.<br /><br />The album starts rather poorly in my opinion, the first three tracks are derived NIN, never really progressing into anything more than just meandering clich&eacute;d industrial noise. I say clich&eacute;d due to the lyrics, which never really pick up at any point in the album, Trent sings of the usual self obsession and hatred, `don't you f*cking know what you are?' - never one for eloquence. The middle part of the album picks up a little, once again the lyrics are putrid but the music, at times, covers it up. The title track is an interesting piece, personally I quite enjoy it, the heavy industrial vibe works well for the first time on the album and creates a sinister, brooding atmosphere. The last part of the album is NIN at their best, picking up with the fun toe-tapping `Only', through the glorious glam pop of `Sunspots' and finishing wonderfully with the eccentric ballad of `Right Where It Belongs'.<br /><br />For NIN fans, this is a must have, you will find the typical Trent hate lyrics, crunchy guitar sounds and general depressing themes. For those who don't mind a bit of Trent from time to time, this will be an enjoyable listen, but don't expect too much.
0553381350|5.0|WOW !! The master writer is at it again !<br />The Right Stuff is one of Tom Wolf's very best work.<br />This book is so good that it is hard to put down. The story of America's best fliers, John Glenn, Chuck Yeager, Guss Grissom and many others, is not only terrific but also griping.<br />Tom Wolfe gets personal, in a very positive way, in introducing us to the wifes of these test pilots and future astronauts. By doing it, he is telling us what it must of have been like to be the wife of a man who decides to take on the most dangerous profession in the world for the glory of it all.<br />It brings us back to a time when real heroes were very much part of our livelyhood.<br />He is also very accurate with his characters and timeline.<br />He is detailed oriented and has done extensive research to make his book come alive.<br />Breathtaking and thrilling.<br />A MUST READ.
B000000IW9|5.0|Let me say that this album keeps GNR from being merely the sum of the various explosive parts of Appetite for Destruction, their first LP, the measuring rod for all hard rock bands for all time.  What sets UYI 2 apart is its depth and wide variety of material.  This LP has your belligerent songs (Get in the Ring, Shotgun Blues)and your misogynstic rockers (Pretty Tied Up, You Could Be Mine) that are regular staples in rock, albeit with Axl's unique lyric mastery, but there's also a lot of introspection here.  Estranged is an epic of lost love and disillusionment, a song on par with Stairway to Heaven but more grounded in the concrete world in which we live.  14 Years and Yesterdays prove that the band had matured since AFD, providing an insight into the band's mentality beyond illicit drug use and nefarious sexual acts.  But one of the most haunting songs on the album is Pretty Tied Up, which on the surface seems to be a tell-all about an S & M tryst, but is actually a prophetic view of the band's destruction several years before it happened.  But it isn't all emotional baggage with this diverse LP:  Locomotive provides the riff-laden guitar work and screeching vocals that are a GNR trademark.  I have listened to this album non-stop for 14 years now and it still moves me to the core.  You must have this!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|You may think my title is just a farce, a delusion of grandeur if you will. But I think not. <br /> <br />You've probably read a thousand review on that this movie is about. A girl is a fugitive on a ship, suddenly she goes bonkers and she's being hunted down by an Operative, so the rag tag crew of the Serenity must find out why and put an end to their constant running(That being the quick version). But I'll show you some critics views on the movie. <br /> <br />Orson Scott Card, one of, if not the, greatest science fiction writers of all time, and Hugo/Nebula award winning author, said, \\"I'm not going to say it's the best science fiction movie, ever. Oh, wait. Yes I am.\\" And he went on to say, \\"So stop reading this. Go get your tickets. See this movie.\\" <br /> <br />Dom, of Mega Tokyo, the incredibly popular web comic, said, \\"And, without having any experience with Joss Whedon's writing style, without having any prior knowledge of anything that had ever happened in Firefly, I watched the movie.\\" He went on to say, \\"The dialogue was clever, but only when it would be most effective, and the jokes never seemed cheap. The movie was excellent at changing gears from tension to humor to action, and for perhaps the first time in years, I was actually at the edge of my seat sometimes instead of slouching back.\\" <br /> <br />\\"An A-grade experience. The writing is impeccable, the chemistry among the cast is fantastic, the performances are great, and the action is non-stop!\\" Clint Morris from MOVIEHOLE stated. <br /> <br />Richard of TheMovieBlog.com says, \\"That is indeed the key to this movie, Whedon's writing, it's superb. The dialogue is sharp, witty, quickfire and sarcasm filled. He's also got a great understanding of how to pull the audience's strings. Tension, suspense and impending danger often twist around in a shocking or explosive moment delivering a good deal of the entertainment value. He's without a doubt a great writer and director and he shows it here, he's a great entertainer.\\" <br /> <br />Without a doubt this movie is incredible. Great acting, writing, cinematography, the whole works. A comedic, dramatic, acion-packed theatric experience is coming to DVD on December 20th, and I suggest we all get our copies.
B000B5XOXY|3.0|Batman Forever was the first bat-flick not directed by Tim Burton. Instead, Joel Schulmacher took the helm and while it wasn't great, it wasn't that bad either. <br /> <br />Val Kilmer's Batman was average at best but I actually liked his interpretation of Bruce Wayne! Plus, he fit the look of Wayne better! I always joked they should've brought Michael Keaton back to play Batman but let Kilmer play Wayne! <br /> <br />Anyway, Jim Carrey's Riddler was great! While not on the level of Frank Gorshin by any means, Carrey was one of the few saving graces of the film. The introduction of Robin was handled very well too and Chris O'Donell was the perfect choice. <br /> <br />Nicole Kidman's character was not really needed as she was just eye candy at best. Kind of a shame since she is a good actor to go along with her looks. Tommy Lee Jones was just totally wasted in this picture! Two-Face was easily one of the most sinister characters in the comics! Only third behind Ra's Al Guhl and, of course, The Joker! If I had to make one request to current director Christopher Dolan, then it would be please use Two-Face in one of the new films if only to restore the character's tragic duel personality in the way it was meant to be seen. <br /> <br />Anyway, back to the piece as a whole, it certainly leans more towards Adam West style Batman BUT it does keep some element of The Dark Knight that most have grown accustom to in recent years. While not a classic, it certainly was better than that hot mess Joel made later called \\"Batman & Robin\\"! Get it and watch it just to pass the time. Again, it isn't as great as the first two Batman's before it or Batman Begins. It isn't even as funny as the old Batman movie from the 60's but it is worth watching nonetheless!

B00097DXZS|1.0|10 years ago when had bought the Santana Brothers Disc you could play Carlos Santana Music&actually get some blank looks like does He still make records? nowadays He is playing guest on his own Albums which has that Clive Davis formula trademark stamp all over them just Alicia Keys Albums,but that is another story or is it?? carlos has a few decent moments such as having Robert Randolph on board.but Once \\"Smooth\\" Hit there was no going back.actually when you know some of your Santana history this trilogy of Duet Albums ain't that different from back in the day if you remember back in the 70's when \\"I'm Winning\\" was a Huge Hit.but the difference between now&then is that Carlos would stop after going for the Radio Hit with 1-2 songs,not a whole Album of the same formula.He is basically known for His signature riffs&now allowing others to send him up the charts.He has gained more attention in the past 6 years with the Guest format,but at what Musical cost??
B000000OAH|5.0|jazz is more like a 4 or 4.5. solid album with a  song that shouldn't have been on the album, (more of that jazz) the album has great songs like \\"don't stop me now\\" and the fun \\"fat bottomed girls\\" it's not queen all time best but it's still a great album.
B000002UAF|5.0|This is a truly outstanding collection of early Beatle compositions and my favorite Beatle movie.  The music is pure and of extraordinary caliber; Lennon & McCartney's works remain nonpareil.  This, as with the Beatles' earlier albums, one can find a vast array of musical styles and high caliber lyrics.  The Gestalt Beatles, or the sum being greater than the whole of its parts is evident in this recording as well - these four men were truly what made the group work and have the cultural influence they will continue to have.<br /><br />The title song on this album was also the title of the Beatles' first movie which was released in 1964.  A funny, upbeat, \\"upBeatle\\" movie, it is loosely based on the Beatles' lives during their meteoric rise to fame.<br /><br />The Beatles not only influenced fashion by their clothing choice and trademark coiffure; they left an indelible stamp on music by sticking with their own originality and individuality.  The movie reflects the individuality of each Beatle and how he uses that in their music.<br /><br />\\"A Hard Day's Night\\" is truly the ideal pop/rock & roll collection.  John Lennon wrote the majority of the songs for the movie, including the stellar \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You,\\" which George sang lead on.  In fact, George in effect made that his song.  It is one of the best songs on this collection.  John's hard driving rhythms, guitar playing and singing are evident throughout this collection; just listen to the title song.  \\"If I Fell\\" was a true Lennon ballad; this beautifully sad, bittersweet song works quite well with the balladeering McCartney and McCartney contributions such as \\"And I Love Her.\\"<br /><br />This collection, like the title film is an exercise in fast paced motion.  \\"I Should Have Known Better,\\" a Lennon classic replete with harmonica and excellent vocals and the more upbeat \\"Tell Me Why,\\" and, \\"Any Time At All\\" will make you want to dance.  (Not all of the songs on this collection were included in the film).<br /><br />Paul McCartney really rocks on this collection.  The 1964 classic, \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" remains one of my all time favorites and was already a hit before this collection was even released.  George Harrison and his phenomenal guitar playing really sets the songs on fire; he really tears it up on \\"Can't Buy Me Love.\\"<br /><br />My own personal favorite, \\"Things We Said Today\\" is truly one of the best songs from a lyrical standpoint.  It appears to examine a relationship critically, yet lovingly and in a somewhat bittersweet tone.  John Lennon gave Paul McCartney his stamp of approval in re this song.  \\"Things We Said Today\\" is pure McCartney; it is a love ballad at its best.<br /><br />Although this collection boasts of no Harrison compositions, George sets a musical wildfire with his strong vocals on \\"I'm Happy Just to Dance With You.\\"  It is doubtful that anybody could have sung that song nearly as well or have given it as much heart as George did.  That was my favorite song in the movie; George tore it up with that one and his phenomenal guitar playing for the title song, \\"A Hard Day's Night.\\"  From the second you hear that opening chord, you feel good all over.  I just LOVE it!<br /><br />Ringo kept the beat perfectly; his bongo playing in \\"And I Love Her\\" was wonderful.  This is truly a feel good collection.<br /><br />You will be at no loss of excellent songs; this is a treasure trove of hits.  You will find yourself dancing as you listen to this stellar collection.

0385338686|1.0|I enjoyed \\"Confessions of a Shopaholic' so when I needed a light, easy read I picked this.  Oh what a mistake.  It's a drag, and it seriously lacked a believable plot.   Especially ludicrous was the press conference event at the end where Samantha, a supposedly excellent lawyer punched her colleague in public.  Duh.  If you must read this, go pick it up at a library.  Don't waste your money buying a copy.
B0007N1AI6|2.0|this CD from priest sounded pretty good on the first few listens, but after a few weeks of hearing these songs i noticed how fast these songs get old.  I think priest will put out a stronger album next time.
B0006J28KU|5.0|Heat is still my all time favorite movie even though it has a weak ending. I have watched Heat countless times over the last seven years. It is absolutely an all star movie with lots of rich dialogue, an intricate plot, lots of suspense and a great score. Both main characters Neil McCauley (Robert DeNiro) and Vincent Hanna (Al Pacino) are brilliantly developed and thoroughly believable. There are many scenes that touch on human emotions. That is what makes this movie so enjoyable to watch again and again. Although Robert DeNiro's character is the bad guy I can't help but root for him. He is the tough bad guy and yet so likeable. He is some kind of a hero. That's why it is totally believable that Edy (Ami Breneman) decides to stay with Neil. Among all the characters Robert DeNiro has played in his career so far, the one of Neil McCauley can't be topped. There is only the last scene  which is not well done. Actually I can't understand how they could come up with such a totally unbelievable final scene. It lacks all real martial arts and will hurt anyone who knows about them and shooting. Neither a master thief nor a master cop with the background those guys must have, would act like this. There would have been many other possible endings to get to that final scene which I somehow like, though it is a bit theatrical. Why not a simple ending where neither of the two makes a mistake, like a gun jams at the worst moment. Each gun has a stoppage once in a while. Anyway, `Heat' is still my favorite movie.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|Hands down, the best documentary yet of the 20th century's most significant songwriter/poet, \\"No Direction Home\\" brilliantly follows young Robert Zimmerman on his journey from Minnesota to New York and his re-birth as \\"Bob Dylan.\\"<br /><br />The highlights are the interviews Dylan gave to his manager, Jeff Rosen, in which the ever elusive legend seems to let down his guard for maybe the first time, and looks back on the times that he helped shape and which shaped him. Never before has Dylan seemed so relaxed and open.<br /><br />The concert footage, including legendary performances at Newport and at the famous \\"Royal Albert Hall\\" concert, is extraordinary, but there is much to savor here, including witty and insightful reminiscences from Dylan colleagues, including Joan Baez, Alan Ginsberg, Bobby Neuwirth, and, most memorably, the late, great Dave Van Ronk.<br /><br />Martin Scorsese is less a \\"director\\" here than a sculptor, having taken miles of rare footage and shaping them into a compelling narrative for PBS' excellent \\"American Masters\\" series. The footage includes performances by some of Dylan's contemporaries, as well as his influences, all of which help put his career in perspective.<br /><br />\\"No Direction Home\\" only follows Dylan through 1966, the year of the motorcycle accident that provided him with a much needed respite from the madness of fame. There's a lot of ground yet to cover, including Dylan's remarkable series of 70's albums (\\"Blood on the Tracks\\" through \\"Slow Train Coming\\"), his controversial conversion to Christianity, the downward spiral of the 80s, and his return to form in the 90s when the Never Ending Tour was in full swing. This is one time when a sequel is not only welcome, but necessary.<br /><br />Brian W. Fairbanks
B0000630BT|3.0|priest fans tend to overate this album a bit, but it's still a pretty good album. \\"painkiller\\" is possibly their greatest song and album cover, but song's like \\"leather rebel\\" and \\"metal meltdown\\" bring it down a a bit.

B00097DXZS|1.0|I was reading most of the five star reviews--each reviewer sounding like they barely discovered Santana three albums ago. Supernatural was good, but trust me, folks, you ain't heard nothing yet if you haven't heard the rest of his catalog. I grew up on Santana's music, all of it, not just his greatest hits, but everything: Santana, Abraxas, Santana III, Caravanserai, Welcome, Borboletta, Lotus, Marathon, Zebop, Blues For Salvador, Milagro, this, yes, all of this is what defines the Santana sound for me. Sorry to say, but All That I Am lacks the heart and the focus of  the great albums I just mentioned. I miss that Santana. Forget record sales and cool colaborations, give me music.

B000AARKOO|4.0|I have to give only 4 stars because a couple of scenes seemed to a little silly to me. However, this is an excellent film. It's everything that \\"Gladiator\\" was not. Ridley Scott scores big this time. I fully expect this film to return when the Oscar nominations are announced next February.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Let me be perfectly clear about my point of view-- I'm one of the converted \\"Firefly\\" folks-- my brother gave me the DVD set of the TV series for Christmas the year before last and during one massive snowstorm where I couldn't go anywhere and had nothing to do, I threw on the pilot for heck of it and ended up totally hooked. <br /> <br />Now odds are I was going to like \\"Serenity\\", but what amazed me is how MUCH I liked it-- I haven't seen a movie more than once since I was in college; I've saw Serenity five times. <br /> <br />So what made me do this?  Quite simply, the movie was fantastic on a number of levels-- it's exciting, well paced, doesn't trade action for story (or character) development and vice versa.  The extended cast (nine actors returning from the TV show) wear their characters well, the story is captivating, the dialog is well scripted, and the movie feels great.  But perhaps most importantly, when it's sweet and romantic, it doesn't feel cliched, when it's comic, it doesn't feel forced, and when it's suspenseful, you wonder whether or not the entire cast is going to die.  This is something that's really hard to capture and was perhaps most impressive to me. <br /> <br />I won't talk much to the plot, I'm sure others who review movies more often than I do will do better at it than I will-- the basics of the story is that Captain Malcolm Reynolds and his crew of a transport ship called Serenity take odd jobs, sometimes less than legal in a future where technology is too expensive for everyone to afford the best.  Along the way, they pick up two passengers who turn out to be fugitives.  By and large, the movie deals with the governments attempt to capture the two of them and their motivations as such. <br /> <br />Since it doesn't come out for two months as of when I'm writing this review, I can't speak to the special features and commentary track.  I will update the review with that information when the time comes.  But suffice to say based soley onthe movie, this one is well worth the investment.  Highly recommended.
B000001EL3|5.0|I remember sitting next to the stereo at 6 years old with the volume turned down listening to this LP because my Grandmother was convinced that Kiss were devil worshipers. This album has forever remained my favorite all-time rock & roll album. It represents everything cool about the late 70's...rebellion and just REAL rock.  Gene Simmons seemed to have more vocals on this LP than the others, and perhaps even though he scared the hell out of me, I like him the most. Great Expectations will always remain my favorite Kiss song, as the lyrics are haunting. If you haven't had the chance to hear this in completion - you must!!

B0007CNXUK|3.0|It's no wonder Michael Jackson is drawn to Peter Pan and the concept of Neverland from this 2004 romanticized telling of playwright James M. Barrie's attachment to the Llewelyn Davies family as the inspiration for his classic play. Director Marc Forster, whose only other credit I know is the melodramatic and overrated \\"Monster's Ball\\", draws fine performances from his cast, but the film itself is oddly uninvolving at least until the last twenty minutes. Forster, along with screenwriter David Magee, takes a rather reverential attitude toward their subject, and this beatific sense is heightened by the immaculate approach toward the production.<br /><br />The result seems targeted squarely at the Merchant-Ivory connoisseur of good taste, but somewhere along the way, the edges have been dulled, and the intensity of feeling that Barrie has for the boys has been mollified for a broader audience. Fortunately, Johnny Depp has been ideally cast as Barrie mimicking a convincing Scottish accent in a surprisingly restrained performance. Even so, his unsullied playfulness comes through in his scenes with the children even if they tend to go on ad nauseam. Looking almost too radiant with an innate inability to convey fragility, Kate Winslet has the saintly role of Sylvia Llewelyn Davies, the sickly mother who lives selflessly for her boys while in self-denial about her undisclosed illness.<br /><br />Even more thankless is the role of Barrie's social climbing wife Mary played in an overly pinched manner by Radha Mitchell (take a look at the outtakes to see a much livelier actress at work). Because her character is drawn in such shallow strokes, the unspoken love implied between Barrie and Sylvia seems all the more distracting from the main point of the story, the parallel between life and fantasy in Barrie's writing of \\"Peter Pan\\". Unbelievably nearly forty years since her enigmatic Lara in David Lean's \\"Doctor Zhivago\\", Julie Christie plays the predictable part of Sylvia's unyielding, Gladys Cooper-type mother with conviction, supposedly the inspiration for Captain Hook. I only wish her character was developed more to match her well-missed talent. In an even smaller role, Dustin Hoffman plays money-conscious impresario Charles Frohman with welcome panache.<br /><br />All four boys are effortless though the standout is Freddie Highmore, who plays the pivotal role of third son Peter. He plaintively lends the gravity of a serious child recovering from his father's death and unwillingly in the throes of a man consumed with fantasy, especially poignant in the closing scene with Depp. The recreation of the original production of \\"Peter Pan\\" is done well, even the fanciful scenes toward the end. I also think credit is due to composer Jan A.P. Kaczmarek, who provides an ethereal and evocative musical score.<br /><br />The DVD has the standard set of extras. Forster, Magee and producer Richard Gladstein - though sadly none of the actors - provide informative commentary on an alternate audio track. There are three deleted scenes and about five minutes worth of outtakes which frankly could have blessedly goosed the pacing of the film. Of course, there is the expected making-of featurette, \\"The Magic of Finding Neverland\\" but also a quick film on the film's special effects which could have been much longer and a stars-on-the-red-carpet clip that is completely disposable.unyielding, Gladys Cooper-type mother with conviction, supposedly the inspiration for Captain Hook.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I haven't been captivated by a sci-fi movie like this since /The Empire Strikes Back/. From the attention-grabbing transitions and pans in the first ten minutes, to the smart dialogue and twisted battle scenes, Serenity takes space opera back to its roots and reminds you how sci-fi movies are supposed to be. If you liked the last /Star Wars/ because it wasn't as awful as the first two prequels, maybe it's time you should see this. No previous knowledge of /Firefly/ required!
1594200696|4.0|Many of us baby boomers have lived and breathed William Strunk Jr.'s and E.B. White's \\"Elements of Style\\" as we attempted to reacquaint ourselves with the rules of the road when it comes to writing clear prose. Its compact size (only 105 pages) and clear organization made the tome the pinnacle of usability before such factors came into play as successful criteria for any easy-to-use reference manual. The book, at least White's famous revision of it, is as old as me, both of us born in 1959, and clearly both of us are in need of an overhaul to refresh the knowledge we present to a more contemporary audience.<br /><br />Enter artist Maira Kalman, who was so inspired by the book when she discovered it at a yard sale four years ago that she applied her considerable artistic gift and contributed 59 colorful illustrations to this version. The net result is a charming and comical addendum to an established classic. Keep in mind that the original intention of the authors was simply to present eight elementary rules of usage, ten elementary principles of composition and a list of commonly misused words or expressions. Consequently, it's impressive how Kalman is able to stay true to the rigidity of the book's structure with her whimsical images. Even though in earlier days I actually preferred the slap of the ruler of White's terse instructional style, I think Kalman brings a sense of humanity that is totally unexpected.
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|I love this album.  I've played it so many time my roommates threaten to hide it from me.  I liked this one better than 'songs for the dead' which I tired of quickly (a friend called it music to strangle cats by).  Queens are evolving and I like the direction better this time around.  I was afraid that this album would be more 'songs for the deaf' slick but sort of soulless.  This is still sort of slick but edgy and pointed.  The album itself is all very good music not hit and miss like their other albums.  Pick it up.
0525948023|5.0|Our schools and universities are filled with teachers who are teaching truths that were taught long before they were born. The mark of a good teacher is not whether they can  teach only \\"new truths\\" but how clear and relevant they can communicate eternal truth to the listener. This is Eckhart Tolle's gift. Most of the ideas in \\"A New Earth\\" can be found in Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism and other spritual teachings, but Tolle's ability to find the essence and harmony of those teachings, strip them of their doctrinal coverings and comminicate those ideas in an effective and relevant manner makes this book of the most important written in the past couple of decades. This is a book that can be taught and studied in any church, temple or synagogue, yet still be enjoyed by those who would never consider stepping into any of those places.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|It would be superficial to say that Serenity is a science fiction movie. Serenity is a movie that uses genres as a foundation upon which to build a story about real people, who just happen to be vagabonds on a rusty old spaceship.<br /><br />The plot: Malcolm, captain of the space-ship Serenity and his crew are doing their usual gallivanting around in space, trying to eke out a living in a politically hostile environment, with one difference: their crew is temporarily supplemented by a young doctor (Simon) and his mentally unstable, but very telepathic, younger sister, River. Simon and River are fugitives from the afore-mentioned political hostility, embodied by a sword-wielding man known as \\"the Operative\\". The crew, the fugitives, the government, and a group of very evil secondary villains called Reavers, provide a magnificent cast of characters whose conflict (and other interactions, but mostly conflict) kept me spellbound for the entire movie.<br /><br />I've long been a fan of both Star Wars and Star Trek, but Serenity is better than either.  Reflecting on the movie afterwards, I kept finding similarities to Star Trek: Voyager.  Both shows focus on a small ship and her rag-tag crew. The crews squabble a lot, but ultimately pull together for the common good.  However, I liked Serenity much more than I ever liked Voyager because it was so much more real and alive.  Star Trek has science fiction, and interesting characters.  Star Wars has this plus a nice background mythology and some realistic grittiness.  Serenity includes all of the above, plus humor, more grittiness, sex, theft, and really nasty bad guys.  The result is a realistic universe that people in this messed up world can relate to.<br /><br />In the last few years a lot of science fiction and fantasy movies have had two things:  lots of characters with British accents, and cheesy lines.  Serenity once again leaves its competitors in the dust by transcending all predictability by using fairly neutral, Chinese, and American accents, as well as a British accent from India.  Instead of cheesy lines, it goes for totally-unexpected-and-hilarious, such as: \\"Been more'n a year since I had anything twixt my nethers weren't run on batteries!\\"  There is no denying that the language is odd, and it may take you a while to get used to it.  But stay with the language, because it's so worth listening to!  The odd terminology and turns of phrase drive home the fact that this is not just another sci-fi copy.<br /><br />(Spoiler alert!) A popular phrase in screen-writing these days is \\"action that tells the story\\". I first remember seeing this concept in The Bourne Identity. Serenity does an even better job because it has an even more interesting motivation for violence, and it juggles multiple action characters. If you've read anything about the history of Serenity you already know that River has some amazing skills. She is also a very attractive young woman. In an average movie, a young male viewer (such as myself) might be inclined to focus on the person on screen more than on her character. In this case, River's character is so incredibly fascinating that you can't help but focus on her character. She is complex, she invokes sympathy, and she has more dimensions than the average human, let alone movie character. Although Malcolm and his crew seem like the main characters of the movie, it is ultimately River who steals the show.  (End spoiler).<br /><br />I've always assumed that if you notice computer graphics in a movie, it is because they are badly done.  Serenity dashed this theory for me.  The three or four times I noticed effects elements, they didn't take center stage or in any way distract from the movie.  They simply communicated the necessary information to the audience and then got out of the way and let the story continue.  The shots of planets were extremely beautiful; an excellent counterpoint to other, more disturbing, images in the movie.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, Serenity has some elements that border on horror.  The filmmakers made an excellent decision when they decided to leave most of the disturbing imagery to the audience's imagination. The Reavers are a hideous and evil \\"people\\" whose presence could easily have been overplayed for shock value. But the film judiciously cuts around them, never showing more than a glimpse of their horrible faces. In place of these images are lines such as, \\"You know he's better off dead than what the Reavers would have done to him.\\" Once again, the movie is about the characters, rather than about something as superficial as Reaver make-up.<br /><br />I can only think of one negative thing to say about Serenity: There were a few times during big action scenes when two characters would hold an important (and usually emotional) conversation. Obviously, in terms of sound mixing, you have to turn the environmental sounds down so that you can hear the dialog, but I think they went too far.  Two or three times, the contrast of these suddenly quiet conversations broke the mood for me.<br /><br />On the other hand, there was another kind of mood change that I liked a lot. Being a mentally unstable psychic, River expresses a lot of her personality inside her own head. In the medium of film, it is easy to go inside someone's head, and Serenity does a marvelous job of it. I didn't grow up watching movies, so I have often found myself a little confused when movies do things like this. In Serenity it was always crystal clear to me, and the revelations brought by these psychic journeys helped connect the audience to River and her huge part in the story.<br /><br />Serenity is an excellent movie.  It might be a little confusing at first, but if you are a action movie fan or science-fiction fan at all, or if you just like great story-telling, you will like it.<br /><br />Note: For the few who don't know, Serenity is based on the TV series Firefly.  When I watched Serenity, I had never seen Firefly, but I still loved the movie!  Since then, I have watched most of the Firefly series.  All the praise I have given the movie also applies to the TV series.<br />As I mentioned before, Serenity has some elements that border on horror.

B00000DC7J|5.0|This is music to breathe and dream to. Piazolla at his best is probably the most enchanting and transcendental. It takes a Master Extraordinaire to make music like this, Piazolla's recordings only get better with age and never outdated because it is made up of the spirit and passions of a life lived richly. The Melancholy laments of the Bandoneon is truly one of the most haunting, nostalgic most beautiful musical Innovations ever made and noone interprets the manic poetry of it like Piazolla. I can't say much more then what the others have said here but this belongs in every serious music afficianado's collection.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I'm not going to review the content.  You either love or hate this film; there's no in-between.    I'm not going to review the extras.  Too many have already done that.    Instead, I'm going to point out a few things people either haven't discussed or have made mistakes when discussing.    1.  The film is spread over 2 discs because it has 3 commentary tracks, a pod branching option, 5 separate sound/language tracks and 3 subtitles.  Try fitting all that with a 3:15 film on one DVD.  Just try.  Give Cameron a break, here.    2.  The 3-disc version DOES contain the parodies--they're on Easter Eggs, OK?  Hunt around.  Or read the Easter Egg review on Amazon.  Thanks for the tip, BTW.    3.  There is a video artifact on Disc 1 at about 1:19:19.  It apparently is on ALL the DVD's out there.  No word if Paramount will exchange discs.  If you didn't know, you'd be hard pressed to see it, but once you do, it is noticeable.    Hope this helps!
B000AL730O|4.0|Naturally all Beatles' fans are at least curious about a new album from the most prolific ex-member of the greatest band ever.  So you read the first stories about Chaos referring to it as the best thing he's done in 30 years.  Well, it just isn't. There are at least 5 excellent songs here and Paul is sounding serious and soulful. But as a whole the album is a bit too serious.  Still, Paul does manage to avoid the tameness and predictability that filled most of his albums from the mid 70's up until his true comeback in Flaming Pie. <br />True, there are more interesting production choices and original ideas here than there were on Driving Rain. But, Run Devil Run has much more of the energy that made Paul famous and Flaming Pie has more good songs than Driving Rain and Chaos and Creation combined. Put the best songs from Paul's last four albums together and you've got the equal of Rubber Soul. Try it.

B000002NIW|5.0|Deftones. Just one of those bands that will always yank my attention. They never cease to amaze me with every album they put out. Even their newest, B-Sides & Rarities is a treat to listen to. This happens to be my favorite album by them by just a slight hair above the rest. I enjoy listening to ATF so much because I think it blends the best out of all Deftone records...one track doesn't particularly stand out, but the whole album is amazing. <br />1.My Own Summer (Shove It) 10/10...One of my favorite guitar riffs of all time, also the first Deftones song I ever heard and it's still great after all these listens. <br />2.Lhabia 8/10...This song's decent...doesn't grab my attention too much, still good though. <br />3.Mascara 8.5/10...Deftones first all out soft song (excluding \\"Fist\\") and it's a song that'll grow on you. At first, Chino's vocals seem a tad annoying but it's overall good. <br />4.Around The Fur 10/10...Wow. This song grabbed my attention the most off the album and is certainly one of my favorite Deftones songs of all time. Very heavy when it needs to be, simply amazing. <br />5.Rickets 8.5/10...Running in at 2:42, this song does unfortuneately seem like heavy filler, but that's not neccesarily a bad thing, still good. <br />6.Be Quiet and Drive (Far Away) 9/10...A definite fan favorite, and for good reason. A less heavy song, with great guitars and whiny, but melodic vocals. One of their first big hits. <br />7.Lotion 8.5/10...This song basically sums up the cd. Heavy. This has some great bass in the middle and reminds me of something off of Adrenaline, very good. <br />8.Dai The Flu 8/10...This is a song alot of people like, but i'm not a huge fan..it's still great, and the title is from Chi's middle name..but one of my least favorites. <br />9.Headup 9.5/10...This features Max Cavalera of Sepultra and Soulfly fame, and this is one of the heaviest songs the Deftones have ever recorded, and actually through all the heaviness, has a heartfilled message about Max's daughter. The riff is amazing. <br />10.MX 9/10...Good way to end this great album. Heavy throughout with female vocals courtesy of Abe's wife, and it seems like the chorus is sung from underwater...very cool. <br /> <br />Overall tremendous. It really does depend on what mood i'm in to pick out my favorite D'Tones record, but most of the time this is it. Pick it up..definitely good stuff.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|In a year of great science fiction disappointments (Star Wars:RotS, Hitchhiker's Guide) there has been one standout film. This is it. It's well written, well acted, and was well worth watching. <br /> <br />The story centers around River Tam, a 17 year old girl with tremendous intelligence, physical prowess, and some psychic ability. She was freed from a government research facility by her brother, Simon, a medical doctor who gave up everything he had to do this.  <br /> <br />They've taken refuge on the cargo ship 'Serenity', which works on the fringes of the galaxy. The ship is a motley crew of anti-heroes led by Mal Reynolds, a veteran of the losing side recent civil war. They take an jobs they can, not always honest ones.  <br /> <br />The story begins when the government (called 'The Alliance') feels that it must retrieve River Tam at any cost because she may have read the minds of high officials when they observed her at the research facility. The send a man known only as the 'Operative' to retrieve her by any means necessary.  <br /> <br />I really enjoyed the movie. It has a lot of action, but unlike most science fiction movies, the action occurs in service of the plot instead of driving it. The film plays like many of Clint Eastwood's westrerns- the good guys aren't always good; the bad guys aren't totally evil.  <br /> <br />The actors work very well together and play their parts very well. The people who really stand out are Nathan Fillion, Summer Glau, and Chiwetel Ejiofor.  <br /> <br />Fillion plays Mal Reynolds, Serenity's Captain, and his performance reminds me a lot of Harrison Ford in Blade Runner. Mal is a conflicted hero. Part of him won't let go of the honor and sense of duty from his military service - while tries living a life of crime. You can see Mal's struggle in the writing, but Nathan does a great job bringing the conflict to life in his interactions with the crew. Nathan really makes Mal a believable character. <br /> <br />Summer Glau plays River Tam. She really stands out for two reasons: she plays River very well; and she does a lot of her own stunt work. I think a lot of actors wouldn't resist the tendency to go over the top with River's mental illness, but Summer approaches the top without every truely going over. River evolves nicely during the movie from a young woman with no grasp on reality to a woman who's starting regain some grasp. The fight scenes involving River are extremely physical - they involve martial arts, weapons, and gymnastics. It's quite clear that Summer does most, if not all, of them.  <br /> <br />Chiwetel Ejiofor plays 'The Operative'. This is a role where many actors would've gone over the top. The Operative is a ruthless, efficient killer. Chiwetel makes him seem very charming, sophisticated, and intelligent. He really reminds me of some of the classic James Bond villains. It's almost impossible to hate this character and that's large due to the fine work of the actor.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Generally, people think of sci-fi as being nerdy, unapproachable, unrelatable, and so on. But Serenity (and Firefly as well, obviously) does something that most sci-fi does not-- it focuses on the characters, their day to day struggles and the things that motivate them-- not intergalactic space adventure. Not wacky alien species. But the lives of people, people not so different than you.  <br /> <br />As an audience, we may not be able to relate to travelling to another moon, but we can almost all relate to having a car that others laugh at for being junky, but that we love-- because its reliable, and familiar, and is a little mobile home. Such is the same with the good ship Serenity. Most of us have at one point sacrificed something for someone else. We've felt the ache as a loved one turned and left. We've cursed the job market and printed up dozens of resumes. So do the characters, and so, even if they are kicking ass, or running in a cowardly fashion, or whatever-- we believe them. They are endearing because many of their plights are similar to our own.  <br /> <br />Another thing that separates Serenity from the rest-- it isnt cliche. All bets are off in Whedon's universe. Things happen that you don't expect, and that you probably wont like at first... but what it comes down to is good storytelling. In the real world, anything could happen. Things don't go as planned. Things aren't wrapped up in perfect little boxes. In Serenity, it is the same. The story is grand. The music is lilting, lovely, heartbreaking, heroic, haunting, exuberant, fearless. The script is peppered with humor, but nothing that seems out of place.  <br /> <br />Serenity isn't a movie for sci-fi lovers. Serenity is a movie for everyone.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|This film is slightly arty and I suppose it is what you might call 'Oscar bait' for Bill Murray in that it is nothing like his popular sort of role - nothing like STRIPES anyway . <br /> <br />I heard a lot about it and if you have ever been in his character's situation that it may mean more to you . I have , so it did connect with me . I like actors playing with their stereotypes and this is a successful example .  <br /> <br />Try it and be ready for something a little different . <br />Looks like the Coppola family talent is inherited .
079284131X|4.0|This movie is definitly one of the best if not the best doll movies to be released. A great classic at that. <br /> <br />PLot- A man dying of a gun shot put his dying soul in a Good Guy Doll ( Chucky ) through Voodoo magic. Only to now have to find a body to transfer his soul to before becoming human. <br /> <br />This movie is great no doubt an excellent plot with some good acting, and a doll named Chucky that is pure evil and will kill anything that gets in his way. <br /> <br />the movie never bores and keeps you watching and at many times Chucky releases little lines of humor which are fyunny, but the humor in this movie is not over done and really none at all besides what Chucky say on those 2 or 3 times. This movie is meant to be a hgorror and a serious one at that which is what i respect. <br /> <br />Cant really compare it to anything as it in much of a way is very origional of a plot. <br /> <br />the funny thing is I rate it so high and talk so highly of it yet i wont shell out the $10 for it, I guess i always know it will be around so ill get it when i feel like it.
B000002LOM|5.0|Spring of 1991: I am a 20-year-old student a Manhattan College in the Bronx. I remember traveling the 1/9 train subway with my friend and college radio partner to Tower Records downtown. Remember: There was no web, no leaks, and no previews. I remember it was chilly, and I was still getting over being dumped by my first college girlfriend. All I wanted was to hear this cd. I bought it and read the lyrics on the subway heading back to my dorm room. <br /> <br />\\"So how did I end up so deeply involved with the very existence I planned on avoiding?\\" is staring at me. Almost a paraphrase of what this girl had just told me before kicking me out of her dorm room a month ago! The chilling lyrics come from Kill Uncle's \\"Driving Your Girlfriend Home\\" which remains one of his best songs to date- a beautiful poem featuring honest lyrics repeated by a chilling base line. <br /> <br />For weeks I was glued to \\"Uncle\\" and 14 years later it remains on my all time favorites. A collection of rock, jazz and opera type songs, a collage of feelings and ideas.  <br /> <br />\\"Our Frank\\" is a clever pop song mocking someone who takes him or herself too seriously. \\"Our frank and open deep conversations, they get me nowhere, they just bring me down\\" kicks off this brilliant album. \\"Asian Rut\\" is a brilliant opera duet including a violin crying about prejudice in the English school system. \\"Sing Your Life\\" is a fun, rockabilly style piece offering people 15 seconds of fame, years before the reality craze took over. \\"King Leer\\" is a jazzy selection mocking him and a love affair gone bound. Other favorites include \\"Found Found Found\\" \\"(I'm) The End Of The Family Line\\" and \\"There's A Place In hell For Me And My Friends.\\" <br /> <br />Maybe the critics in 1991 were confused by the deepness of the context both lyrically and musically of \\"Kill Uncle.\\" It's a must for any cd collection. <br /> <br />Bob Stei <br />WZZO <br />Allentown, PA <br />
0792841344|4.0|Phantasm with out a doubt is one of my top horrors of my collection. As I think this was a movie not meant to become so successful but did. <br /> <br />Basically a boy discovers a man and some of his creatures from another galaxy working in the nearby funeral home. It is a pretty strong scrpit with some solid acting and does not get boring at all, and infact is quit creepy and very original at that. <br /> <br />Not bloody though thereare like 3 or so parts that are the rest is morelike a horror/Sci-Fi flick that brings everything ou want in a horror especially onhe made from the 70's and 80's. <br /> <br />For all of you die hrad fans out there a toy series called Neca just released a set of figures called \\" Cult Classic series 2 and one of the figures is the tall man with his little creature and the flying ball. The set also features FRreddy krugger from the new nightmare, the Bunny from Donnie Darkko and last Leather face from the original 1974 ( this is the leather face at the end of the movie with the suit and the women face on. I picked up three of the 4, leaving the Bunny on the shelf as I liked the flick but dont consider the bunny a horror movie character. Which is what I actually collect. or get what i can when i find them, sorry to getoff topic.
B000000OQF|5.0|I THOUGHT I WOULD NEVER LIKE ROCK N ROLL, BUT THIS ALBUM CAUGHT MY EAR...MUCH RESPECT.
B00008WT5E|5.0|I've reviewed this album before, but I feel I did not do it enough justice. Everybody knows that all AC/DC albums rock the roof off, but one has to determine which are the BEST ones, if he really wants to blow up some heads, and this, my friends, is easily one of the best...<br />BETTER THAN HIGHWAY TO HELL!!!! ABSOLUTELY!<br />This would be the last of the raw, rude AC/DC with Bon, before they went high class with producer Mutt Lange. Most people thought Lange did wonders for the band, but I always thought Bon sounded a helluvalot better without the polish...<br />As underated as this album is, it seems that many agree that this is one of the bands best achievements. What I don't quite understand is why everyone automatically brings up how cool of a song SIN CITY is, right off the bat? It's the weakest song in the mix... ROCK AND ROLL DAMNATION, the opener is amazingly cool. You can tell that the band was trying to click a little with a radio sound on this tune, but its still straight up evil. \\"You say that you want respect? Honey for what?\\"<br />From here we go into the somewhat lengthy, but never dull DOWN PAYMENT BLUES... many refer to this as a bluesy album in general, but I think that has mainly to do with this song, and the closer KICKED IN THE TEETH... if anything the band gets a little more sophisticated in their song writing abilities, making this album probably their most versatile.<br />The next song GIMME A BULLET has a classic rock/top 40 radio sound, while RIFF RAFF is just some insane Angus/Malcom riffing. WHATS NEXT TO THE MOON, is one of my favorite songs of all time... starts out slow but builds and builds until you are pumping your fists in the air... the rest of the songs are great AC/DC too, I just don't want to make this review too long!<br />Basically, this is an AC/DC album that requires repeated listens. It's not as trashy as some of the previous albums, but it is still rude, crude, Bon Scott at some of his creative best, and he just sounds so much more free-spirited without all the glitz that would be found on his next and final album Highway To Hell.<br />This album goes un-noticed if you ain't as tight on AC/DC as I am, but if you like their brand of rock (if you don't WHATS WRONG WITH YOU, I outta bust your nog) you should know this is one of the top shelf classics.rited without all the glitz that would be found on his next and final album Highway To Hell.  This album goes un-noticed if you ain't as tight on AC/DC as I am, but if you like their brand of rock (if you don't WHATS WRONG WITH YOU, I outta bust your nog) you should know this is one of the top shelf classics.

B000B0WODA|5.0|No, Franz Ferdinand, I could not have it so much better. Finally an album jam-packed with enough cocky lyrics and pop beats that will kick the overplayed Killers album out of my CD player. A major thumbs up to Franz Ferdinand's second album. For those listening to retro-glam pop rock bands, this album reminds me of the early days of Bowie combined with The Killers, Ted Leo and the Pharmacists, and Arcade Fire ...

B000089RVX|5.0|This soundtrack is really high quality music; the money I spent was well worth it, and I've yet to grow bored of the music after listening to it for months. 5 stars no doubt. I suppose the only complaint for this soundtrack is that the songs themselves are a little formuliac; each song seems to have the same \\"format\\" (lyrics, chorus, lyrics, chorus, climatic lyrics, chorus, end of song). Personally, I don't mind this, so my 5 stars remain.
B0002858YS|2.0|The Killers are one of those bands that was pretty much at the right place at the right time.  To the high school set that enamors the band, they are original, sharp-dressed, sly Goth-influenced dance-rockers.  To many of us who were alive to see the '80s, they're unoriginal, commercially calculated, eager to please Duran Duran knockoffs - but hey, those lads sure are sharp-dressed, aren't they?  While these guys attempt to conjure up the moody, detached vibes of bands like Depeche Mode and New Order (the latter of which provided their name, taken from their song and video for \\"Crystal\\"), with their bouncy rhythms and Brandon Flowers' earnest vocals they wind up sounding more like the Archies of new wave ... because this is what an eager to please pop/rock act like the Killers are supposed to do, right? <br /> <br />The Killers' debut album, Hot Fuss, isn't all that bad - it's just been done before.  It's also awfully disjointed - \\"Mr. Brightside\\" is a song about seeing the woman you pine for with another man, but the song's sugary bounce leaves you wondering as to whether Flowers will stay up all night laughing or crying about the situation.  And some of the lyrics seem like they don't make any discernable sense ... \\"Someone is calling my name / From the back of the restaurant\\", with vocal distortion on the second line ... ooooh, spooky!  But the album is not without its positive moments - the addition of a gospel choir on tracks like \\"All These Things That I've Done\\" adds a nice touch, and \\"Midnight Show\\" shows that maybe something more uptempo can work in this context, if executed correctly. <br /> <br />In summary: Hot Fuss is alright, but you've heard it all before.  The Killers might do better to follow their influences and take some chances, but on the whole this sounds too much like Duran Duran (circa \\"Rio\\" and \\"Girls On Film\\") to be taken too seriously.  The Bravery and Bloc Party are two bands with a similar sound, but are more diverse and not quite as predictable as the Killers - definitely check them out if you haven't yet.
B000B7HZXM|3.0|Rod's first 3 songbook releases captivated me, but I found his latest to be a disappointment. Time to move on Rod. <br />Difficult for me as a long time R.S. fan to admit, but there is just no magic here....
B000BBOUU4|4.0|I liked the movie, my daughters thought it was funny.  I remember the orginial when it came out and nothing compares to it.  This movie takes on new twists about the backstory to Willy Wonka which was entertaining, and the new take on the Wonkavator was really neat.  Other than that, it was the same old plot line (with hints by Johnny Depp throughout the film that \\"this seems familiar some how\\").  All and all not a bad film.
B00097DXZS|5.0|While not as daring as lets say Abraxsas, Santana's new album provides an enjoyable listen throughout. I was uneasy about it because it was another round of duets, but I was so impressed with it all. Santana still sounds fresh from start to finish.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is one of the greatest Christmas movies ever made, and as long as this package contains a widescreen version, I will be purchasing it as soon as it is released. <br /> <br />I won't even begin to guess the validity of the rumor that this release will only feature the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" in the 4:3 (fullscreen) version.  However, allow me to explain why, perhaps, that may not be a bad thing for \\"purist's.\\" <br /> <br />When the film was initially released in theaters, Disney cut the song \\"When Love is Gone\\" because they deemed it to \\"adult\\" in nature (They also did this with the song \\"If I Never Knew You,\\" from the film Pocahontas).  When \\"The Muppet Christmas Carol\\" finally made it to TV and VHS (both in 4:3 Fullscreen), Brian Henson insisted that the song be returned to the film. <br /> <br />Therefore, this DVD release may, if the rumor is true, contain two complete versions of the film: the theatrical version (without the song), and the TV/VHS version (with the song).  Unfortunately this goes against the present day trend of: widescreen is for adults, fullscreen is for kids.  I suppose the true \\"purist\\" would insist that a third version be bundled in this release; a \\"Director's Cut\\" if you will.  Maybe that will come out next year when we all re-purchase this movie in HD-DVD.  Oh the joys of consumerism.
0767827694|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, particularly the acting, scenery, and sublime imagery.  For example the desert location for the \\"ambassador period\\" was bleak and barren, matching Orlando's mood and temperament at the time.  As has been mentioned by others, Tilda Swinton played the role magnificently; much better than my expectations, and I admire Sally Potter's vision and respectful interpretation of Woolf's story, extending the original 1928 ending into a current, modern setting.<br /><br />This film is a great companion to the book, or vice-versa.  If you haven't read the book, do so first.  If it's been a few years, re-read Woolf after viewing the movie.
B000ARXAUU|5.0|HOME is one of the most beautifully crafted cds I have ever heard.  The melodies are enchanting and the songs have the ability to make you cry.  Although the songs are all traditional and written long before this album, the Corr's touch to each one of them is magical.  This album is timeless, a must have for anyone who loves music.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I was slightly nervous when I purchased this album as the last two Mode albums (Ultra and Exciter) haven't done anything for me at all, but as soon as I heard the opening synth chords of mind-blowing first track \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" I knew they were back on form. This track easily slots into my all time top ten Depeche Mode tunes. \\"John The Revelator\\" and particularly \\"Suffer Well\\" (my tip for next single) confirmed my feelings that this was going to be money well spent. First single \\"Precious\\" is this album's \\"Enjoy The Silence\\", with a hypnotic melody that manages to be both yearning and uplifting. The other really standout track is \\"Lilian\\", surely a future single release, which has more than an echo of \\"Sacred\\" from 1987 classic Music For The Masses. The final track \\"The Darkest Star\\" is a bleaker version of Violator's \\"Waiting For The Night\\", and is no less haunting. All in all then, a superb return to form.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I pity all the poor idiots who enjoyed this movie, because their IQs aren't even high enough to understand how stupid they are.  This is, without a doubt, the lowest form of entertainment I have ever been subjected to.  I only regret that I didn't walk out of the theater sooner.  The sex, drugs, and violence are uncontrolled and take over the entire movie.  The plot is minimal at best.  The visuals are revolutionary, but who cares when that's the only good quality?  Sin City is common, unremarkable, and fit for white trash.
B000069CWE|5.0|WOW...I got this CD and was just FLOORED at how much DIFFERENT this CD was than Hybrid Theory.  This is not just songs with a new rap or a different bridge...These are brand new songs with different beats and different lyrics and AMAZING guest spots.  Ever better than the original! <br /> <br />1. Opening - I love the violins here in the open and in the close...very serene and just set the tone.  Linkin Park is such a unique band that plays on every facet of music...very talented band <br />    <br />2. Pts. Of Athrty (Feat. Jay Gordon of Orgy) - I was not a fan of the original, but this is one awsome song...Orgy did good. <br />    <br />3. Enth E Nd (Feat Kutmasta Kurt & Motion Man) - I hated In The End as well, and as much as I think this is a supperior version it's still one of the weakest on the CD <br />    <br />4. Chali - An intro, Chali on the tellie <br />    <br />5. Frgt/10 (Feat. Alchemist & Chali 2na) - GREAT SONG, darker than the original, real gangsta :P <br />     <br />6. P5hng Me A*wy (Feat. Stephen Richards of Taproot) - Awsome...I did feel that the chorus was a little lacking...I would have aranged it a little different so that Chester souded slightly more melodic... <br />     <br />7. Plc.4 Mie Haed (Amp Live Remix Feat Zion Of Zion I) - One of the best on the album...perfect song and a great club song <br />     <br />8. X-ecutioner Style (X-Ecutioners Feat.

Riff Raff - Another teliphone message <br />     <br />11. Wth>You (Feat. Chairman Hahn & Aceyalone) - Great reinvisionment of this song.  I kinda like the origional a little better, but I'm a little pregudice there. <br />   <br />12. Ntr/Mssion - Just as the name says, just an intermission <br />         <br />13. PPr:Kut (Feat.

0804106304|4.0|The Joy Luck Club portrays mother daughter relationships and their constant struggles.  Right from the beginning Amy Tan creates a mom against daughter atmosphere, which made me choose sides.  I often found myself on the side of the daughters and feeling like their mom's were meddlers and too old fashioned.  As the novel develops I figure out that the mothers were the way they were because of the many struggles they experienced in their lives.  In that light it is helpful the way Tan structured this novel to allow the reader to travel through the mothers' journey.  I began to understand the mom's more and found on occasion to look at the daughters as inconsiderate, selfish and unwilling to give their mom's a chance.   <br /> <br />The biggest downfall for having eight different people tell a story from their point of view is that the stories tend to blur into one.  I cannot recall all the stories and assign the correct mother to it.  However, each of the stories helped the reader to understand the actions the mother's took in the present were based on the actions they took or did not take in the past.   <br /> <br />The short story format creates many different turning points for the reader.  However, Jing-mei's final narration is the most significant turning point.  As Jing-mei makes the journey to see her once-thought-to-be-dead twin sisters, she worries that she will not be able to tell them anything about their mother Suyuan.  Once she laid eyes on her sisters the gap was bridged for Jing-mei.  These two Chinese girls are her flesh and blood.  By observing the sisters lives she realizes she will be able to better understand exactly who Suyuan was.  All the years of feeling like her mother was a stranger will be clarified.  Who Suyuan was in China is directly related to who she became once she came to the United States.  This encounter helps Jing-mei come to the realization that no matter where she was born or raised, she will always have ties to her Chinese heritage.  She could choose to ignore it or finally embrace it.      <br /> <br /> <br />
B000AU9UYM|1.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is a great example of what happens when good guys (Chris Nolan, Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Gary Oldman) go bad. And I don't mean dudding themselves up in a batcape and fighting crime: I mean turning out a superhyped, yawn-inducing stinker like \\"Batman Begins\\".<br /><br />So with that: 10 Reasons why the once-talented Chris Nolan's hopelessly tedious, depression/sleep-inducing greenish-tinted floater stinks up the joint:<br /><br />1)It's dull. Achingly so. It goes on and on, and just when you think it's about to exhaust itself and die---it goes on and on.<br /><br />2) It's dull, did I mention that? How can you make a story about a psychopath vigilante who duds himself up in a flouncy cape and tights dull? I dunno, but Nolan did it.<br /><br />3) It's Dark. *Really* Dark.<br /><br />By that I mean it's underlit: it's hard to see anything, because Nolan doesn't know how to light his sequences.<br /><br />4) The action sequences bite, hard. Why? Because the camera is shoved up against the Batman's left nostril: every fight sequence is close-cut, cropped, psycho-edited, and so tightly shot that you can't see who's BAMFING and BAPPING and THWAPPING who. So maybe it's best that it's so dark it's impossible to see what's happening because---well, nothing really is.<br /><br />5) The \\"Batmobile\\" (basically a huge, hideous, mutant farm tractor spray-painted black) drives around on the rooftops of Gotham. Yes, really.<br /><br />When I think Dark, Brooding, Vigilante Justice, I think the original, sleek, armored-up Batmobile of the Burton masterpiece. I do *not* think John Deere lower-40 special, tooling around amongst the chimney-pots of Gotham City.<br /><br />6)Batman (Christian Bale, who tries, dammit, he really tries) is played as psychotic yuppie (a la American Psycho), or a fluty voiced drag-queen. C'mon, listen to the Voice: tell me, if you were a Gotham criminal, you wouldn't die giggling.<br /><br />6)Batman doesn't loom, or hulk, or menace: he squats.<br /><br />Not crouches, squats.<br /><br />This is meant to suggest coiled rage: it suggests, instead, a man in the final, lethal stages of terminal, chronic constipation.<br /><br />7)Qui-Gon Jin (Liam Neeson) is in this movie, playing Qui-Gon Jin channeling Oprah by way of Dr. Phil. Oh, and Ra's Al-Ghul, evidently, is Arabic for \\"I wear cheesy facial hair\\".<br /><br />8) The chief villain, Potato Sack, wears a potato-sack over his head. No, honestly, a potato-sack. This is meant to just TERRIFY you, man, scare you senseless.<br /><br />Why does he wear a potato sack over his head? My theory: so he doesn't have to watch \\"Batman Begins\\" like you, chump. Oh, and he sprays his victims with some kind of hallucinogenic spray. I actually *envied* the Scarecrow's victims: at least they experienced an emotion other than sleep, apathy, boredom, or raw contempt, all of which this movie induces in spades.<br /><br />9) Katie Holmes and her hideously scary hands. Some advice, Katie: next time spend a little of the money you're blowing in the Scientology bunker having your engrams removed---on acting lessons.<br /><br />10) \\"Batman Begins\\" actually makes Gary Oldman (the once-and-future Commissioner Gordon) look like a silly, incompetent, middle-aged dufus---oddly enough, the target demographic for this silly, incomptent, middle-aged movie. How is it possible to squander the talent of the incomparable Gary Oldman? How is it possible to make a Batman movie into an incomprehensible, incoherent, mind-numbing snorefest that features a John Deere tractor tooling about on somebody's rooftop? I dunno, but Nolan does it.<br /><br />Things I'd rather do than see \\"Batman Begins\\" ever again:<br /><br />1) Drive red-hot pokers into my eyes.<br /><br />2) Stab myself in the face with a rusty knife.<br /><br />3) Sever my right leg and surgically re-attach it to my a**.<br /><br />4) Take a bath in a tub full of acid.<br /><br />5) Read the Encyclopedia Britannica cover-to-cover in asingle sitting, in Braille.<br /><br />6) Watch \\"Gigli\\" again.<br /><br />Let the order go forth: all copies of the negative to \\"Batman Begins\\" should be burned, and the ashes sealed in an airtight container and shot into the Sun. Well, except one copy: round up all fans of this rancid, stinking turd, surgically remove their eyelids, and force them to watch this abomination over and over---forever.<br /><br />P.S.: If you enjoyed \\"Batman Begins\\", check out \\"Catwoman\\" and \\"Doom\\". You'll dig 'em.<br /><br />JSGr /> <br />5) Read the Encyclopedia Britannica cover-to-cover in a single sitting, in Braille.  <br /> <br />6) Watch \\"Gigli\\" again.  <br /> <br />Let the order go forth: all copies of the negative to \\"Batman Begins\\" should be burned, and the ashes sealed in an airtight container and shot into the Sun.

B000056IKS|5.0|Formed by guitarist Michael Rother and percussionist Klaus Dinger, both veterans of Kraftwerk, Neu! (1972 - Gronland, 2005) pushed to the limit the technique of iterative patterns and the impressionistic approach that were popular among contemporary cosmic musicians. Pieces such as Negativland are essentially continuums of rhythmic impulses propelled by Dinger's legendary \\"motorik beat\\" and by obsessive repetition of ferocious percussive patterns (occasionally bordering on jack-hammer noise). It was tribal drumming applied to the devastating neurosis of the post-industriale era. <br />Product as the following from Conrad Plank (the same that the first Kraftwerks had produced), it brought the concepts of iteration and impressionism that already flashed substantially to the exasperation ` in the work of the cosmic musicians of that years. The passages are essentially continuum of rhythmic impulses, based exclusively on the percussions and on the incessant repetition of fierce patterns percussivi. In practice the passage becomes a ritual of decostruzione of the sound: the pressing one, obsessive course favors him to emerge some details. The method also serves to exalt neurosis dilaniante of the post-industrial era. The black tribalismo of Popol Vuh and the romantic futurism of Kraftwerk, Neu! have reached to a suffering hiper-realism of wagnerian intensity. The album contains six purely instrumental suites. Degenerate daughter of the dilated psichedelia, this music exalts the two sonorous extreme, that of the absurd aritmico (Sonderangebot, an exercise of only noise in a cosmic void and Lieber Honig, wise of voiceless song in one not less ghostly atmosphere of casual sounds) and that of the supersonic vortex: Hallogallo and ` pure percussivita ` of battery electronics and guitars, perturbed hardly by accords minimali and from cacophonous troubles. The ten minutes of Negativland are a match of demoniac expressionism and tribalismo heavy-metal, an orgy of wicked instincts, a vortex of noises that and ` the psiconalitic image of the daily paper. With this austere and hypnotic masterpiece, the tradition teutonica (Gothic, superhominica, desperate) bride to the psychological tensions of the modern age. Neu!  invented the \\" motorik \\" \\" beat \\", that propulsive pulsation, constant, pressing, that transformed anguish in trance.
B000BW7QWW|4.0|Really nice conclusion to the TV series.  Firefly(the series) was unlike anything else ever before shown on television and Serenity was a nice going away present.  Hopefully a sequel is made so all of us SCI-FI nuts can get goosebumps all over again. :)  It Rocked!
B000AL730O|5.0|This is a gem.  Like many of the best rock albums, however, one must spend time with it, get to know it.  The greatness of the entirety of Chaos and Creation only begins to emerge around, say, ten, perhaps even fifteen, listens.  But it's well worth the wait.  Chaos and Creation is record by a former Beatle and, unlike many of Macca's solo outings, it sounds like it. In fact, I would hazard to say that many of the tracks are as good, if not better, than some of his best Beatle compositions.  At the same time, the record represents an advance in McCartney's development as a human being, songwriter, and all-around musical genius.  It also represents a musical \\"tip of the hat\\" to the great George Harrrison.  <br /> <br />There is only one song on this record that falls short of utter brilliance--the last one.   <br /> <br />Fine Line\\" is a dead-on rocker, with a wonderful production.  Starts off spare, but then insideously incorporates those strings, ultimately giving it an ELO-type feel, but with the spunk and driving beat of songs like \\"Hey Bulldog\\" or \\"Flaming Pie.\\"  A great pop song, an instant classic.   <br /> <br />\\"Jenny Wren\\" is a cousin to Blackbird, in music and sentiment.  McCartney has a fascination and love for wounded beauty.  (Ergo, Heather Mill McCartney) The track is amazingly catchy and reminds me somewhat of Julia in terms of someo of the harmonic play.  Another classic.   <br /> <br />\\"At The Mercy\\" may be one the best songs I've ever heard in my life.  It takes a few listens, but this song triggers an amazing  aesthetic rush in me.  It's got a partial dissonance that can be found in many of the songs on this cd.  But those McCartney double tracked vocals are so Beatley and pleasing to the ear.  The verses have a minor/diminished color harmonically, while the listless lyrics add further depth to the mood. But this resolves into a glorious refrain (\\"If you show me love I won't refuse\\"), which, as it develops, reminds me of \\"Beware of Darkness\\" or something else off All Things Must Pass.  The flourish that follows \\"We can watch the universe explode\\" carries within its womb the pure rock n' roll greatness that is Paul McCartney.    <br /> <br />\\"Friends to Go\\" rocks and, again, smacks of Harrison.  I love this song.   <br /> <br />\\"English Tea\\" is along the same lines as Revolver's \\"For No One\\" and is a melodic delight.  The three words at end of each verse (\\"any sunday morning\\")are musical masterpieces in an of themselves, while the middle section is as good as any he's ever written.  <br /> <br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" is a song to Heather, in essence.  When he sings the title line my knees get weak, and the middle sections is, here again, a tremendous composition in itself.  Yet another classic.  <br /> <br />\\"A Certain Softness\\" might be my second favorite on the cd after At the Mercy.  The double-tracked vocals, and backing track, give it an \\"And I Love Her\\" feel.  Other musical counsins are \\"Bluebird\\" (Band on the Run), \\"Distractions\\" (Flowers in the Dirt), and that one from Flaming Pie (\\"you're the only one I'd choose\\" or something like that) An adventurous melody and execution, and a delicate lyric about the ineffability of love and desire.   <br /> <br />\\"Follow Me\\" is a perfectly written rock jewel.  <br /> <br />\\"Promise to You Girl\\" finds its roots in Lady Madonna, but ends   up sounding more like a Wings greatest hit.  (BTW, Wings is my favorite band after the Beatles.)  <br /> <br />\\"This Never Happened Before\\" breaks my heart, a simple heartfelt lyric but put to a melody that only  Sir Paul can compose.    This song shows you why he is the most successful pop songwriter that has ever lived.        <br /> <br />\\"Anyway\\" is the only song on the record that, in parts, bugs me.  The verse is a blatant rip-off of People Get Ready. The rest of the song is brilliant.  He could have changed up two or three notes in the verse and this song would be another rare Macca jewel.  But hey, I cannot complain about one weak spot.  The  record is five stars and more.
B0009RJVI6|3.0|Although this was a fascinating, intelligent and unique examination on evil in contemporary society, it was approximately sixty pages too long and thick with repetition. <br /> <br />It grew somewhat monotonous with the continual focus on the downfalls of America, and while I don't disagree, I got the point relatively early on. Similarly, while I empathised with Kevin's mother, I felt that the self-pity was too heavy-handed, although this is somewhat negated by the revelation at the end of the text. <br /> <br />I also felt there were some unsettling Freudian undertones to the text, particularly  with the mother's decision to allow him to return to the house and Kevin's bathroom antics.  <br /> <br />Nevertheless, a unique and extremely unsettling read with superb writing and an interesting premise.
B00097DXZS|1.0|Thank you for informing me beforehand that this product is copy-protected and won't play on all machines.  I will save my money and not purchase this product.  SONY take note: you have lost this customer with your arrogant contempt for the public who purchase your products.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|They really need to get rid of copy protection on CDs. This is a great CD but I'm giving it 1 star to voice my frustration at the system. By the way there are ways around this, just read some of the other posts.
1401200923|5.0|A lot of people think Hush is Clayface.  But if you read the last part you'll know Riddler wasn't talking about Clayface.  He was talking about a spoiled child...a child who is now 19 years old and in Batman's life again.  Read Under the Hood if you really wanna know who Hush is.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|The best thing about this collection, when it came out several years ago, was that it was the first time that anyone had thought to chronicle the Beatles #1 Hits in the appropriate order.  As such, this is a wonderful way to introduce young people to the Beatles. Even though all of their recorded work is terrific, their albums vary in mood and genre.  This release, though, allows the listener to glean what a monster the Beatles were for the, approximately, eight years that they were together, making hit records that changed the face of modern music. Personally, I never was a real big fan of the early pop singles, so, for me, this collection starts with \\"Eight Days a Week\\" to the conclusion of \\"Lady Madonna.\\" Even for true fans, this is a unique set because of how it was put together, but more important, it is a lesson in 60's pop rock for the uninitiated.
B0009ZHJ7S|5.0|I watched this movie several times and found it to be hilarious every time! The first time, I watched it with my family on pay-per-view and we were all laughing our heads off!! The second time I was watching with friends from a DVD and found more funny things that I hadn't caught the first time! This is an extremely funny movie and everyone I've spoken to about it agrees! If you haven't found anything funny about it, you're just not catching the inuendos. Some are more subtle than others. This is a great movie and I strongly recommend it for any who enjoys side splitting comedies! :)
B0009WFFS6|4.0|It's a wonderful site to see Eric, Jack and Ginger back together again. However, I had to adjust to this set. After years of listening to Cream as men in their youth, the sound of Cream, in my head, is still the sound that comes from the Live Cream I & II sets as well as the live set from Wheels of Fire. The guys at 60-something are not the same as they were at 20/30-something.  I know that that sounds like it should be painfully obvious, but it's difficult to position a musical icon in your head in a different way other than the way it was when it was at it's most powerful. I think alot of people will go into this thinking they're going to hear Crossroads from 1968 at the Fillmore or N.S.U. from the Live Cream I Set. You will not hear those renditions! Still, these three men are musicians' musicians and this is a wonderful set. I was delighted to hear Pressed Rat and Warthog and Deserted Cities of the Heart from Wheels of Fire. Their versions of Toad and Crossroads, although different and played more deliberately, are powerful. The hits like White Room and Sunshine of Your Love were played pretty traditionally. The performances, for the most part, are tight and extremely well received. I missed the recent New York shows, but I'm looking forward to more from the masters in the coming years.... maybe a studio album??? A must buy for Cream fans and for those who think that you can be over 40 and still rock hard.
B00000FCBC|5.0|I think this is perhaps the most genius and humbling move they could make in light of their dramatic change from long-haired rebels to shorn men of class. My favorite especially is Bob Seger's \\"Turn the Page\\" and the Anti-Nowhere League's \\"So What\\", a vicious, but awesome song that has even the foul-mouthed blushing. Other favorite mention are Thin Lizzy's \\"Whiskey in the Jar\\", Lynard Skynard's \\"Tuesday's Gone\\" with a ensemble of great musician (too many to mention), and the Misfits's \\"Die, Die My Darling.\\"     In addition to the new recordings of '98, there's also Garage Days Re-Revisited from '87, Garage Days Revisited from '84 with Cliff Burton's memorable bass, B-Sides and One-Offs from '88-'91, and Motorhead songs done in '95 for Lemmy's 50th B-Day.     Buy it, listen to it, love it!
6305949980|5.0|tim burton has made so many films, but i believe this one is one of the best.  this film has a certain charm to it that makes it magical and enjoyable for all ages.  this is a great holiday movie whether it be halloween or christmas.  if you have not yet seen this film, i would highlt recommend it.
0385338686|2.0|I love Sophie Kinsella's writing--I think her other books rise above the \\"chick-lit\\" genre. She's a great humorist and satirist, and what I love about her books is that you can tell the author is smarter than her characters, and that Kinsella is gently poking fun at women and men and our foibles. Though some in the literary world would view Kinsella as writing pure fluff, I think she is a genuinely talented satirist. <br /> <br />I was disappointed in the Undomestic Goddess, however; I felt the writing was too lazy and could have used more editing and drafts. It was simply too hard for me to believe that Samantha Sweeting could be a high-powered lawyer. Kinsella could have made this more believable if she spent some time portraying Samantha as a top lawyer but also as a dreamy, sometimes spacy person even in her lawyer days (having a \\"messy desk\\" is not enough to prove this), but instead Kinsella has Samantha jump right from her lawyer life into being domestic help, without ever really questioning the complexities of this situation. Samantha buckles too easily when Melissa insults her--I couldn't believe she didn't stand up for herself more--and her utter subservience to Trish and Eddie was also not believable. Curtseying the first time was funny, but continuing it was ridiculous. When Samantha cites her 'photographic memory' in remembering the invitation on Arnold's desk it also seems ridiculous--she's portrayed as too much of an airhead to believe she has a photographic memory. While the spacy, goofy qualities of Becky Bloomwood are endearing--Becky's eternal optimism and 'accidentally-on-purpose' phrases are funny in that character--in Samantha they felt insulting. How on earth could she be a top lawyer and also be such an airhead? I also couldn't believe that she was really happy as a maid. Wouldn't she be bored, and miss the work of using her brain that being a lawyer requires? (Or did she feel that much of her work as a lawyer was drudgery?) If Kinsella had spent some time showing Samantha's appreciation of the history of the domestic arts, some view of domestic work that would actually require thinking or an intelligent brain--if she had showed Samantha using her brain--it would have made her more believable. She never shows Samantha reading a book, or doing anything that requires a grain of intelligence. I felt like the character of Samantha was simply Becky Bloomwood pretending to be a lawyer. Faking it. At the end, when Guy tells Samantha, 'You have the best legal mind any of us have ever seen' and 'You have more brains than anyone in that room' I thought: OH PLEASE. That was the end of liking the book for me. The best legal mind any of us have ever seen?! Simply telling the reader that Samantha is a great lawyer is not enough to make it believable. If she is, how come she never thinks anything about the actual work of her legal career, its ins and outs and details, save for spying on one of Eddie's contracts? Guy's statement is so incredibly ridiculous that I can't believe Kinsella could even write it, or that her editors would let it be published. I could believe it, maybe, if she was a mediocre, dissatisfied, mid-level lawyer--but one of the best legal minds? It's like watching Britney Spears portray a lawyer, and then hearing that she has one of the best legal minds out there. It makes the entire book seem even more ridiculous. I actually felt insulted as a reader. <br /> <br />I know that Kinsella is a better writer than this. I just want her to push herself further as a writer, and keep being funny and satirizing our lives--yet not at the expense of making her characters seem like idiots. There were moments when I felt angry, as a reader, reading the Undomestic Goddess. Does she think I'm stupid enough to believe this, I kept thinking? Does she think women are this stupid? What I like about Becky Bloomwood is that Becky has moments of actually showing she has brains and rising above her character. <br /> <br />Please, Sophie Kinsella, add a little more complexity, depth, and nuance into your next novel! We, your readers, deserve it. If you want to write about an intelligent woman character, then actually MAKE HER INTELLIGENT.
B0000VD04M|5.0|i have loved this film for years and i feel that it's overlooked. many tim burton fans have not seen this movie, which is a shame because it's brilliant.  johnny depp, as always, gives a memorable performance as edward wood, the famously awful movie director.  the movie is both comic yet sad at times.  i recommend it to any burton fan.
B00097DXZS|5.0|As a longtime fan of the Santana band, I wasn't sure what to think about the new album but previewed some tracks online and just went out and bought it.  I've got to tell you that this record is really great to listen to.  It starts off with \\"Hermes\\" and \\"El Fuego,\\" two classic Santana band cuts, and then Carlos works with a diverse group of outside singers including Mary J. Blige, Steven Tyler, Will.I.Am, Joss Stone, Los Lonely Boys and Anthony Hamilton.  There's even a killer instrumental cut with Kirk Hammett from Metallica and Robert Randolph.  On repeated listens, I honestly think it's better than Shaman and almost as transcendent as Supernatural.  Definitely glad I picked it up - a new favorite at my house!
B00005JMJG|5.0|this is a spectacular film.  one of both winslet and carrey's best roles yet.  this movie is more original than any that i have seen.   it could be classified as a dark comedy but i believe it is much more of a love story than it is sometimes made out to be.  this is really a great movie and i would recommend  it to anyone looking for something different than the ordinary chick flicks!
1594200440|4.0|This book is a big hit in Australia and my curiosity compelled me to recommend it for my book group. <br />Ultimately, I very much enjoyed it. Yes, it was farcsical at times and the viagra jokes were getting a bit tired. Valentina is a huge stereotypical 'type'(in joke here)but great fun in lots of ways.The excerpts from Nicolai's Tractor book became a bit dull, but the historical references to the war, Stalin and the labour camps were insightful and thought provoking. <br />Deviating from the main story of crass,coniving refugee trying to take advantage of a poor crazy old man, I was drawn to the 'family' story and particualrly the relationship between the two sisters and their relationship with their father. The irony is that without the greedy 'slut' divorcee the sisters would still be on non-speaking terms and their father would be dying of loneliness. <br />I would acutally like to give this 4 1/2 stars as 4 doesnt seem enought, yet 5 doesnt allow for the odd flaw.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|Chan-wook Park's amazing flick \\"Oldboy\\" is a modern day Shakespearean type saga of deceit, vengeance and reprisal played out against a current South Korean setting.<br /><br />Oh Dae-su, played amazingly by Min-sik Choi, is a womanizing Seoul businessman, husband and father of a young daughter who is inexplicably confined in a private prison cell for 15 years.  In his solitude his only attachment to the outside world is a TV.  While watching he learns of the brutal murder of his wife, orphaning his child.  From that point he musters all his power to sharpen himself both physically and mentally for revenge against those who immersed him in this predicament.<br /><br />After being released he embarks on a blood thirsty campaign of vindication.  While doing so he becomes befriended to a young female sushi chef Mi-do played by an innocent Hye-jeong Kang.  They eventually fall in love and she supports him in his quest.  Soon after his released he is outfitted with a cell phone and wads of cash by his tormentor.  It is established that he is to be given 5 days to ascertain the reason for his incarceration by his captor or the life of Mi-do will be forfeited.<br /><br />This last part of the flick chronicles Oh dae-su's voyage of discovery as to the genesis of the deeds that caused his plight.  What is revealed is a stunning sequence of events leading to an unpredictable and ironic conclusion to an extremely well crafted and written plot that is superbly directed by Park.
B000AL730O|4.0|I have to admit, I'm not a huge Paul McCartney fan. His past albums never grabbed me that much, and I found them way to \\"pop\\" for my taste. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this newest offering however, and have started buying it for friends for Christmas. <br />Soulful without pretense, this CD is the perfect background music for dinner (our last guests said \\"who is this\\"? and were amazed when we said Sir Paul!) Most songs are reflections and have a nostalgic feel to them. He's said in many interviews he channeled George Harrison and you can tell. George is by far my fave Beatle--all quirks and different sounds.  <br />Listen to a few tracks here on Amazon and I'm sure you'll end up buying it. Great stuff.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The movie Serenity is one of the best movies in the last 10-20 years. It is a movie that spans action and human relations. From the opening dialogue to the titles to space action scenes to fight scenes to character revealing conversations this is a movie that stands out above the crowd. I have seen the movie 8 times in theatres and keep finding new gems to admire and appreciate.<br /><br />It is a story about 9 individuals that find themselves in a dangerous time with dangerous people after them. How they survive and make the hard decisions is a edge of the seat story. I am a movie watching fan. I enjoy Sci-fi, action and especially if they are funny. This was the perfect movie for me. It has well portrayed suspense, action and humor.<br /><br />Even the villain was outstanding. Every action movie fan has sat through totally unreal villains that are laughable. The Operative is not laughable. He is a villain we call can be afraid of, without despising or hating.<br /><br />The special effects where incredible, especially considering the budget they had to work with. Some extensive fight scenes included unarmed combat, guns, cannons, swords and long bows. The stand out special effect was the space battle scene. I love a pod race as much as the next person, but here we are talking about a space battle involving 80 craft from the perspective of one ship traveling through the battle.<br /><br />In spite of all the action, the human relations are the reason to see this movie. The movie is about love, loss, fear and impossible decisions. In this movie you again learn that some decisions are so difficult that no choice is the right choice. You learn that loss can hurt no matter how good the cause. And you learn to love 9 characters and their lives. I want to visit this world again and spend more time with these characters.
B00079FUI6|5.0|When a new show with fresh new ideas come out, it's reason to Celebrate! In the same way \\"Moonlighting\\" and \\"Northern Exposure\\" broke a mold, so does Desperate Housewives. Each episode is so well crafted and the dialog so witty, you can watch again and again and still find new stuff to enjoy. The mystery surrounding the neighborhood is only the beginning to this story as every housewife have their own comical lives to deal with. It's also not a cream-puff show as murders are shown with shocking clarity (Paul kills the meddling neighbor by smashing her head in!) and dark humor weaves itself in each episode.  <br />The magnificent cast is perfectly tailored for each wife. From the ditzy Teri Hatcher to the wonderful Marcia Cross, each lady brings a certain something to the screen.  <br />Part Soap Opera, part Dramady and all fun, this show is a winner. Treat yourself to the first season today. You'll be glad you did!
B00081MUY0|5.0|I will admit, this is probably not my *favorite* Donovan album, but there is absolutely no denying the fact that it is his greatest LP.  Musically and lyrically, it keeps you engaged the entire play time.  Unfortunately, I hope that people aren't put off by the fact that there are only two hit titles on this album. I must clarify, that, in my opinion, Donovan was also and 'album artist' and not merely a 'singles artist.' The songs on this album can stand out on their own as brilliant pieces. <br /> <br />The album starts off with one of Donovan's most popular hits, \\"Sunshine Superman\\" which gets you engaged as you are about to brace yourself for the 6 minute and 45 second \\"Legend of a Girl Child Linda.\\" The dreamy instruments and equally dreamy lyrics are just gorgeous. \\"Three King Fishers\\" and \\"Ferris Wheel\\" follow in the same vein as \\"Linda\\" as they are slower, more lyrically-based songs. The fifth song on the LP, \\"Bert's Blues\\" returns more to the \\"Sunshine\\" sound, although it is still slower in tempo. <br /> <br />Side 2 of the LP kicks off with Donovan's other hit \\"Season of the Witch.\\" It goes without saying that this song is essential Donovan, and it's placement on the album (Track 6 of 10) is a strategic move that works; it holds the listener's attention and interest. \\"The Trip\\" is a fitting follow-up to \\"Season.\\" It's a quick-paced beat rock that just sounds great. Next is the slow and beautiful \\"Guinevere\\" which follows much in the path of \\"Legend of a Girl Child Linda.\\" \\"The Fat Angel\\" picks up the tempo for one final hurrah as it prepares you for the last track on the album, \\"Celeste,\\" which is in my opinion, possibly Donovan's best song, outright. Lyrically, it is hard to be matched by any other song by Mr. Leitch, and the melody is just beautiful. <br /> <br />This edition contains seven bonus tracks which will please Donovan fans, as we have been without studio outtakes and demos for quite a while. <br />The $16.99 price for this edition is just okay.If you're a collector and want the bonus tracks, I recommend this disc, however, if you are just interested in hearing the album, the $9.99 edition will suit you fine.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Ok, its one thing if the \\"official Amazon reveiwer\\" doesn't like an album. If she says its musically poor and sloppily put together then she would be doing her job.  However taking a beautifuly crafted (while admittedly harsh) album and tearing it apart based on her political veiws is borderline slander. Even worse, she proves she hasn't listened to the album!!! In another weak mannered attempt to sling mud at Eminem,she says that Eminem is too scared to touch Puffy... need I quote, Miss Berry? In regards to Jennifer Lopez, Eminem prods Puffy (her at-the-time beau), saying: Sorry Puff, I don't give a f*ck if this chick was my own mother/ I'd still f*ck'er with no rubber/and c*m inside'er and have a son and a new brother at the same time and just say that it aint mine.
B000002552|4.0|While most will speak volumes on the historical significance of the sessions from which this set is sourced, I will just say that it is a very fun listen. Songs such as \\"Odds and Ends,\\" \\"Yazoo Street Scandal,\\" \\"Please Mrs. Henry,\\" and \\"Tiny Montgomery\\" just put me in a good mood... <br /> <br />...this is not to say however that there is no emotion or soul to this album. \\"Ain't No More Cane,\\" \\"Ruben Remus\\" and \\"Bessie Smith\\" are beautiful songs with great melodies. <br /> <br />The contents of this album get 5 stars, but one star was taken off for the fact that both discs fit comfortably on to one, with about 3 or 4 minutes to spare. Ah, Columbia will do anything to make an extra buck.
B000002MP2|5.0|Thanks to the huge commercial success of Nirvana's Nevermind and the 75,000 copies of Kerplunk! sold on word-of-mouth alone, Green Day was able to sign to major label Reprise and release their classic mainstream debut, Dookie. On this 14-track collection of well-crafted punk songs, Billie Joe illustrates tales of lethargic self-destruction, paranoia, and boredom with results that are nothing less than enthralling. The neurotic spazziness of \\"Basket Case,\\" the snotty, Onanistic antics of \\"Longview,\\" the strange coming-of-age tale \\"Welcome to Paradise,\\" and the total apathy of \\"Burnout\\" all display Billie Joe's ever \\"maturing\\" writing skills; his lyrical prowess recalls the likes of Johnny Rotten with some of the most selfish and hilarious stories to grace punk music since the seventies. Billie Joe's technical skill on the guitar may not be so evident but his power-chords hit with more impact than anyone since Pete Townshend. Whatever the guitar work leaves to be desired is satisfied by the superb instrumentation and sense of urgency lended to every song by the tightness of the rhythm section comprised of Mike Dirnt and Tre Cool--their contribution to the group is immense and the play between the three musicians helps elevate Green Day's music above all of their imitators. Green Day may have just been at the right place at the right time but Dookie went on to sell over 11 million units worldwide; they would later prove that this release was no fluke either, continuing to churn out hit after hit throughout the 90s and into the new millenium, making them one of the most influential and successful bands of the time.
B00005JOHO|4.0|Suggestion for potential viewers of this movie: <br />This is a \\"feel good\\" movie and not intended to be a classic, so pleae enjoy it for what it is [warts and all]. <br /> <br />This movie is the best it can be and admittedly it is not perfect.  As with other reviews, the movie cannot possibly achieve the unrealistic goal of being perfect due to the many conflicting goals.  However, it is an enjoyable movie and meant for sheer entertainment (never mind historical accuracy). <br /> <br />I am an avid historical reader of golf's history, yet I can forgive the director's conundrum of trying to portray the many historical details required in the conventional two hour film.  This is an impossible task and therefore requires some trade-offs.  Furthermore, Ouimet's romance was simply contrived to have some audience appeal... there were many movie-making techniques used in the film intended to create mainstream appeal in order to gain box office sales. <br /> <br />As far as the movie's historical content, it did not include many of the required details regarding equipment; background for the main characters; geo-politcal trends, status and rationale simply because it was not possible.  This is forgiveable, but only for either the tolerant or the uninformed (of golf and its history).  I, for one, can forgive this simply because I already knew the history of Ouimet, Vardon, et al. <br /> <br />My suggestion for those who are not beneficiaries of the pleasure of knowing the historical details is to read the biographies of each of the main characters, but to do that requires more than a casual interest in the game. <br /> <br />Lebouf's performance is very impressive, displaying a maturity beyond his years.  His charisma drew me in while his ability to play off Josh Flitter [Eddie the Caddie] who's exceptional performance (for a 12 year old) was uncanny.  His intuitive comedic timing was impeccable: e.g. \\"Read it, Role it, Hole it\\" <br /> <br />Paxton's visual techniques, portraying the flight of the ball were remniscant of George Lucas' techniques in Star Wars, placing us in the cockpit of a starfighter.  Very entertaining. <br /> <br />I'd also like to point out one outstanding feature in the film for which I have personal experience: \\"the zone\\".  For novices, this is  the ability to focus completely on one single objective (e.g. holing a putt) at the exclusion of all external distractions (e.g. a boisterous gallery or a wiley competitor).  Movie viewers will experience Paxton's visual metaphor that takes us into Vardon's mind as he cancels out all other external distractions and \\"sees the hole\\" in a serene setting with blue skies and no galleries, etc.  I simply love this metaphor for its ability to portray (albeit inadequately) what it is like to be \\"in the zone\\"... a very Tiger-like (Woods) characteristic. <br /> <br />While on the subject of metaphors, Paxton's other great metaphor was Vardon's demons (the Black Top Hat men in the opening scene). In my mind, this is a great depiction of self-doubt that runs through a player's mind when in the position of having to make a putt (or a great drive, etc.).  That one moment when you doubt yourself, whether you're good enough to make that shot.  The Black Top Hat Men (to me) represent the doubt for Vardon... whether he's ever been good enough.  These demons are what drive many a great athlete.  Bobby Jones (another golf great) for example would get sick throughout his matches and lose as much as 20 lbs. of body weight due to his internal drive to achieve perfection.  In the end, I liked Paxton's metaphor a lot. <br /> <br />Lastly, the relationship between Francis Ouimet and his father, played by Elias Koteas was exceptionally accurate for the historical time and cultural beliefs of underclass immigrants.  Kudos to Koteas portraying a villainous father who is redemmed in the end... like many fathers.  Although a little hokey, it worked from an entertainment perspective.
B0006GAOCW|3.0|If you're looking for a good family film with clean language, clean scenes, and a clean script, you couldn't go wrong here. FIRST DAUGHTER has all those prerequisites.<br /><br />The film introduces us to Samantha (Katie Holmes, PIECES OF APRIL) who happens to be the daughter of the current President of the United States -- played well by Michael Keaton (BATMAN). She's on her way to college and adulthood but with little emotional support from her mother and father. Every aspect of her life has been laid out for her, and now she has to try and find out \\"who\\" she is. Is she really happy? Does she have an opinion on ...well ...anything?<br /><br />The film pulls us through her early time at Redmond University but does so using a lopsided script and rushed revelations. She has to contend with the overbearing status of her secret service contingent, her every move being tracked by the tabloids, and a roommate who has personal baggage of her own.<br /><br />Although the film was at times touching (especially when Keaton and Holmes are on screen together as father and daughter), the script rushes us through any trials and tribulations, as well as life-changes regarding parenthood and growing up.<br /><br />Also the movie felt like an overly sweet pill that was difficult to swallow. Even though Samantha had problems, there was never anything even remotely obstacle-like that she couldn't have easily overcome with her available resources (as shown when she takes her friends on a trip in an Air Force One jet; which, by the way, would NEVER happen, so credibility was seriously lost there).<br /><br />But I'm sure this film will have a pretty powerful appeal to the preteens and early teens out there. And parents can rest easy knowing that there's very little (if anything) in this slight movie that'll corrupt the pliable young minds of their kids.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|What else needs to be said?  This is intelligent TV/movie (no, that's not an oxymoron).  The characters live and the Verse is consistent.  World building is an art and I'd say Joss Whedon has got it down pat.  I can't wait to see the special features on this DVD and hear the commentaries.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road was recorded at a time when The Beatles were all moving in different directions. Lennon had met Yoko and was involved with her. McCartney was still very serious about the group and tried to keep it together. NcCartney had also recently married Linda Eastman.  George Harrison had been with Bob Dylan in New York for several months and had started working with Eric Clapton.  Ringo was somewhat disillusioned with it all.  After the White Album and Let It Be, where they had been fighting and unable to work as a unit, as they always had before. I think they all knew this would be their last album.  Some of the songs had been written during the Let It Be Sessions, and were finished for this album.  Abbey Road was another grounbreaker in the way the album was recorded. Lennon and McCartney used short songs in succesion in order to give the album its personality. Many people have called this a concept album and I personally dont see why.  Come Together is one of John Lennon' best songs, certainly from this era.  George Harrison writes his two finest songs ever, Something, and Here Comes The Sun. Frank Sinatra who recorded Something called it the finest \\"Lennon, McCartney\\" song ever written. That tells you something.   Other fine songs on this album are, Because, where they use very tasteful three part harmony. Because is vocally the finest song the Beatles ever recorded. Lennon talks about how he wrote this song. One night he was drunk and started playing the Moonlight Sonata, backwards on the piano, he added words and there you have it.  What used to be side two is loaded with short songs including, You Never Give Me Your Money, Sun King, Mean Mr Mustard, Polythene Pam, She Came In Through The Bathroom Window, And probably the best of the bunch, Golden Slumbers.  Carry That Weight, The End, and Her Majesty. On the original vinyl release in the 60's Her Majesty appeared, but was not listed on the album cover.  There was really no way the Beatles could improve, sothey called it quits. A fabulous swan song by the greatest Rock and Roll band ever. Truely a classic.
039472903X|5.0|This book talks about how to make ads, what their objective should be and what mistakes to avoid. <br /> <br />It also delves on the advertising business itself, both from inside and from the client's perspective.  <br /> <br />This is a very practical and concise book. Definitely worth reading. Even for the professionals, since many of the ads that are published make those very mistakes which Ogilvy warns against. <br /> <br />Another interesting author on the subject is Claude Hopkins. <br /> <br />
0060751967|5.0|I don't care about people saying that this book is not a keeper. I love it. And Kerrelyn..you better get working on the series to this novel fast. I am dying to read more about Roman's future. I want to read about their kids, and most of all i want to know about Gregori and the harem..but it looks like Simone is his favorite..But in regards about this book. I love it.. I reread it to the point where i have this whole book memorized front to back. Yes true, the ending was kind of disappointing because we want to know more. It should have like a \\"epilogue\\" or something letting us know about what happened a couple of years later..but hey.. you have your own reasons why.. But i give this book a two thumbs up..5 stars for me.....whoo-hoo..go on with your bad self..hahaha
B000AARKOO|5.0|KOH follows a distraught blacksmith, Orlando Bloom, living in France after his wife committed suicide and is therefore banned from entering heaven.  During this time he meets his father, Liam Neeson, who wants him to travel to Jerusalem, and, Bloom decided to go to help his wife get into heaven and erase a vile sin he committed, as well. <br /> <br />The background and costumes feel authentic.  There's a lot of background setup which doesn't register during the first watching but you'll pick it up in your later viewings. <br /> <br />When Bloom arrives in Jerusalem he finds a liberating \\"world\\" where Muslims and Christians live together in the heart of the world.  But, of course, this paradise is shaken when some bad apples in the Templar Order, a legion of knights, incite war with the Arab leader, Saladin, catapulting the tale into a series of wars and finally a massive siege against Jerusalem. <br /> <br />At it's core, KOH is about human consciousness of \\"doing the right thing\\".  Time after time, Bloom's character is given the easy way out but chooses to do what is honorable.  Compare this to some of the less savory characters in KOH. <br /> <br />Jeremy Irons has a supporting role to the king of Jerusalem.  Kudos to the actor playing Saladin (Ghassan Moussaud) (look for Bloom's question to him: \\"What is Jerusalem?\\"), as well as the actor playing the bad Templar, Brendan Gleeson, who played Reynauld, an actual Historical character.  Edward Norton plays the masked leper king of Jerusalem. <br /> <br />As for Historical authenticity, I'd say this is more Historical than Hollywood but it's not totally accurate.  Bloom's negotiations with Saladin are mostly true, for instance, and, phrases like \\"God wills it!\\" was commonly said in the day by those of such religious fervor.  Enough said on the Historical accuracy. <br /> <br />According to the director, there will be an extended version coming out which includes an hour or so of extra footage.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|I've always been a huge Enigma fan and have listened to every album countless times. But the criticism this piece of work has received baffles me. Yes, this album may journey down a different path, but it's a journey well worth taking.  <br /> <br />Some Enigma fans may miss the Gregorian chants from past albums but I find this just as spiritual. Gregorian chants, as haunting and beautiful as they are, can become repetitious and may even alienate some listeners who may not relate to that type of sound or spirituality. With the exception of a few tracks that fall flat, this CD is amazing. Track 3 \\"Incognito\\" is richly dark and passionate but one of my favorite parts is the transition the music takes into track 4, \\"Page of Cups\\". I want to advise everyone that this CD was meant to be heard with headphones. Only then can you really experience it. \\"Boum-Boum\\" is the stand-out single and deserves more attention then it received. Track 7 \\"Look of Today\\" is an addictive dance song in dark Enigma style and is followed by the seductive \\"In the Shadow, In the Night\\", which is absolutely amazing. The CD closes with \\"Following the Sun\\", which to me must be what heaven sounds like. I'll never tire of that song and that alone is worth buying the album. <br /> <br />I challenge the critics to give this CD a second listen. When you are ready to relax and take an amazing journey down a beautiful seductive road, play this CD...and wear headphones!
B00005YJMX|4.0|This version of the Nosferatu story directed by Werner Herzog is just absolutely haunting. I have not seen the classic 'Nosferatu' made in the 1920s, but this is a prime modern example of how the real Dracula story is supposed to be. It is made by a man with real vision, craft, and maturity. Sadly, though, through countless remakes and spoofs, the Dracula story has become like a joke in our culture. Most people do not see the story as a tragedy. Dracula is seen as a kind of lady's man, rather than a cursed and lonely individual seeking love and affection.  The highlight of the film is, of course, the performace of Klaus Kinski.  He gives yet another stunning and creepy performance, playing the part of the tortured Count Dracula.  Once again, bravo, for so few actors in film history can touch him.
B000002G8H|5.0|Slowhand is one of the milestones of Clapton's career. On this album you have some of the best songs he has ever recorded.  Cocaine leads off and has been a signature song since this album was released, and remains one of his concert staples to this day.  Next is Wonderful Tonight which is one of the finest songs of his career and remains a concert staple to this day as well.  Lay Down Sally is next and spent some time on the charts in the 70's when this first came out.   Clapton at this time was going through a country phase in his life and its shows.  Next Time You See Her and We're All The Way are country songs.  The Core is another of my personal favorites and is a solid performance.  Mean Old Frisco is slide guitar at its very best. And finally the CD concludes with Peaches and Diesel.  No Eric Clapton collection is complete without this CD.
B0008G2IRO|5.0|This CD\DVD combo set is everything that you could want. The bonus features on the DVD are out of this world. If you liked their first album, and dig their lyrics, then you can't wait to get this album and hear \\"noodle\\" sing in her heavenly voice, or get down with \\"2d\\" and his heavy-hearted songwritting. In a few words, get this album.
0446577383|1.0|I've enjoyed all of Baldacci's past works, but I found this book weird. A very retro trip back to story lines of the 70s: CIA = bad, United States = bad; Middle East terrorists = good; rebel CIA agent = good; Secret Service = Keystone Kops; vice president and Cabinet = inept bunglers; and on and on.<br /><br />Obviously, Baldacci is using the forum of his novel to promote his own political agenda. Bad enough under the best of circumstances, but he doesn't even do it well in this very confusing mish-mash of a novel. It's inept and heavy-handed. Noble Middel East terrorists? Please, spare me. The only things he left out were Lynn Redgrave and Michael Moore as sympathetic characters.<br /><br />Speaking of characters, the ones in this novel don't even react realistically to the events taking place around them - I suppose in an attempt to keep plot surprises hidden. For example, one of the leads is shown at the beginning of the story mourning his long-dead daughter. However, when he finally discovers her true fate, his response is very blase. What's up with that?<br /><br />As to the plot: this was about as confusing as it gets. It made no sense at all, and since the characters were such cartoons, I didn't even care. Frankly, I'm surprised I even finished this thing. It was kind of like watching a train wreck: you know you should turn away out of decency, but it's just so amazing that you can't.<br /><br />My advice: save your money.
0441009425|1.0|Interesting and fairly absorbing at the start, but as I progressed further, it became apparent that there is one major flaw with this book...<br /><br />The author's problem seems to be his inability to create convincing characters. He attempts to inject an emotional & moral gravitas into his characters, but it's SO inconsistent and all rather half-hearted, that in effect you simply can't believe in the characters and their motivations.<br /><br />I have since read Redemption Ark, the second novel in the series, hoping this would be an improvement; more of the same here, but Absolution Gap, takes the biscuit! The characters in this novel (the third in the series) are absolutely, horrendously one dimensional. I have major issues with their motivations in this book, in particular Quaiche and Scorpio. Without divulging major plot events, the former's conversion is totally unbelievable and the latter is an altogether different character from the previous novel! The rest are ciphers, if the author was to interchange their names you wouldn't even bat an eyelid. Yes, it's that inconsistent!!!<br /><br />I left Absolution Gap half way through, and bought Pandora's Star by Peter F Hamilton on a whim. All I can say is that this is lightyears ahead of Revelation Space! The characters here are totally believable and well researched. The premise is also excellent. This is how epic sci-fi should be done!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|From the first minute to the very last, the movie Serenity simply does not let up. It's a roller-coaster of emotions, you won't go five minutes without laughing at something happening or something being said, and you won't go a minute without wondering if everybody's gonna make it out alive from this escapade. You will laugh, you might cry, you will definitely be shocked, but you will never be bored! This is simply movie-making at it's finest, and the best movie I've ever seen. No comparison.
B000002UAU|5.0|The Beatles at this time had reached a creative road block. Paul McCartney suggested that they use the name Sgt Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and try to project what they might write if they were members of that band. What you have here are the most creative songs the Beatles have ever done.  This shows Lennon and McCartney at their creative best.   Sgt Pepper opens the CD and is one of their better rockers, especially from this era. Ringo also does the song, With A Lillte Help From My Friends which along with Yellow Submarine could be his best ever.  Lucy In The Sky with Diamonds could be John Lennons most controversial song ever. There was a controversy at the time about the song being about drugs (LSD). As Lennon tells the story Julian came home one day with a painting he had done at school. John asked what the painting was about. Julian responded, its Lucy in the sky with diamonds. Being For The Benefit Of Mr Kite is a song, Lennon took from an old turn of the century Circus poster. He took the lyrics directly from the poster. The poster contained virtually all the lyrics that are included in the song.  The only song George Harrison adds is, Within You and Without You. George talked about during an interview how this was a very boring album for him because he sat it out virtually. This is his only contribution on the entire album.  When I'm 64 was a song McCartney wrote with Frank Sinatra in mind. If you listen closely you can hear how Sinatra might sing it. It definately has a big band sound to it.  A Day In The Life is possibly the finest song John Lennon ever wrote. It does sound very out of place here. I do know it is my favorite John Lennon song ever. I remember the first time I heard it. I had never heard anything like it.  This is another of the very many Beatles classics that no collector should be without. Even the cover art was way ahead of its time and still is actually............
B000A6T1JU|4.0|I don't know why but I never thought I'd like this movie. I never gave it a chance until the video game came out and it became one of my new favorite games. So I decided to check-out the movie and I must say it's a fun and cool movie. Surprisingly though the game has more of a story. It gives you back stories to why Cleon started the Warriors and to how people like Swan joined up with them. It also gives Cleon a bigger part and he sounds a lot like Samual L. Jackson lol. The movie just has the Warriors trying to get back to Coney Island after they are framed for killing a big gang leader. While besides that, the game has them getting into all sorts of trouble. Plus in the game you get to kick Luther's ass as Swan when they don't fight in the movie.  So in ways it's superior than the movie since you'd love to see Swan kick his ass in the movie.<br /><br />  Still though the movie is great fun for what it is. The acting isn't bad either by it's unrecognizeable cast of actors. Watching the movie made me wonder why guys like Michael  Beck (Swan), didn't go one to bigger and better. He's great as Swan who has to be the Warriors new leader after the gang gets seperated from it's leader Cleon. He gives one of the most badass performances I ever seen.<br /><br />  James Remar (The Phanton, 48 Hours, Blade Trinity) is the most recognizeable actor because he's still in many movies and tv shows today. He plays the toughest guy in the gang next to Swan. Always wanting to get laid gets him in trouble though. The movies strongest point is probably the relationship between Swan and Mercy. She's a tough girl who doesn't mind getting into trouble and wants to be part of the Warriors as soon as she sees them. She was with the Orphans but they aren't tough enough for her. Swan just sees her as trouble but he's also curious about her and wants to understand her. She also wants to understand him. The two have strong chemestry too so it adds something nice to the movie besides all the running and fighting.<br /><br />  I hear that Tony Scott has a remake planned for 2006 and that's a shame. Although I did pretty much call the game better. That at least stayed true to the movie without really trying to out-due it or be better. I don't want to see anyone else play Swan or a remake without the corny 70's music. I mean who's gonna play Swan, the girly Orlando Bloom ?? lol. If you like movies like the Outsiders or even Sin City, you should check-out the Warriors.nning and fighting.<br /><br />  I hear that Tony Scott has a remake planned for 2006 and that's a shame.

B000BB1MI2|4.0|Tim Burton's adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is nicely Roald Dahlish, while making Wonka's backstory nicely Burtonish. Another touch only Burton would have done is the casting of Johnny Depp as a pasty, androgynous Wonka with disturbing similarities to Michael Jackson (Depp and the boy were in NEVERLAND together, for crying-out-loud!!), who was still in the news at the time of the film's theater release. Depp, as always, is kooky, great fun to watch. Freddie Highmore is a fine Charlie B. Infact, all the casting is superb, Grandpa Joe is prefect! Deep Roy as all of the Oompa Loompas really is the best feature of the feature.<br /><br />Some of Dahl's more technically difficult scenes make it into this version, like the Chocolate Palace and the factory squirrels. The film contains a more solid end than the original, or the book (which hooks into the sequel \\"Charlie and Glass Elevator.\\" Burton stays safely away from the 34 year-old classic, as Depp avoids any immiation of Wilder's performance.<br /><br />The film is good family fair, if over-grand \\"eye-candy.\\"
0440237688|5.0|I randomly picked this book up at the library and couldn't put it down once I started. Honestly, I was expecting the sort of teen horror stuff that Lowry is famous for and thought it would just be a quick read. Well, it was a quick read, sure, but certainly not easy to get out of my mind. It really has some great themes to discuss with others. I was thoroughly absorbed in the story and the characters and thought that Lowry did an excellent job of creating the world inside this book. <br /> <br />I would recommend this book to adolescents and adults both and think it would be a very interesting book to discuss with both groups.
0553208845|5.0|In my humble opinion, this is a book about a very universal human sentiment: search for meaning.  It suggests via Siddhartha's path of this search that the \\"meaning\\" of life may not be the right question to start with.  He found \\"meaning\\" neither in active search for it in the intellectual realm nor in the physical realm.  The body nor the mind is the right conductor to experience \\"meaning\\" of life.  Neither the pleasure of \\"knowing\\" things in the intellectual realm nor the pleasure of \\"being\\" in the physical stimulations of the body turned out to be the right path to \\"meaning.\\" As all \\"religious\\" pursuits are based on a pursuit of some \\"ideal\\" place or being, so is Budhism. It isn't about arriving there in real life.  It's about seeing it, albeit in distance.  This book chronicles such search for meaning through the lens of a man in a distant land, culture and time.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I have the movie Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children. I thought it was one of the best CG movies i've seen. the graphics are better than the Matrix trilogy movies.the story was really good (if u beat the game it all makes sense) and a few surprises are sprinkled in. i fell in love wit this movie. all u idiot critics that say this movie sux are gay and still watch old star wars movies and say the first one was the best. everything was better wen u were younger. so shut up. were in 2005 and everything is better and cooler. bottom line: GET THIS IF U CAN NOW. cause its as good as the Final Fantasy 10 Movie. And yes there's one in Japan and i've seen it. haha suckas! also thanx to striderlighter for all the info. i wanted to say that too.read his cause it's the best review on this subject
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This has quickly become a favorite music DVD. I have found it to be quite addicting, and find myself watching it over and over. I'm a bit puzzled by some of the criticism of \\"too much production\\" that I read in some of the reviews -- I think the horns, violin, and keyboards complement the songs quite well (and don't get in the way).  <br />The new guitarist, Steuart Smith, is quite amazing, playing the old Don Felder leads note for note but adding some things here and there. He makes Joe Walsh look rather pedestrian. Henley and Frey still sound quite good on vocals, considering that they're \\"old guys\\" by now. It would have been nice if they had introduced the band, especially Steuart -- and they should have let Steuart take a bow with them at the end. <br />The video work is great -- the cameras show the proper soloist during solo numbers, and we get a lot of variety (there must have been a LOT of cameras that night). The crowd shots are really good, and I get almost as much pleasure watching Aussies (many rather young) watching the Eagles as I do seeing the \\"old guys\\" themselves. <br />All in all, a video well worth having!
B00004R7TP|5.0|I believe Kate Bush is quite possible the greatest female artist England has ever produced. Never have a known an artist so perfectly entwine emotion, intrigue, realism, poetry, surrealism, musical mastery, lyrical genius and vocal exception.<br /><br />Kate is like an whirling mix of every art form imaginable, the stuff you like, recognise and which speaks for you as well as the stuff the draws on different and not so favoured emotions and responses. All this with a liberal sprinkling of good old fashioned, British eccentrism. Every time I play one of Kate's albums it's like visiting an art gallery and seeing old masters along with peices I have to work a little harder on to get to the message.<br /><br />This album is no exception in her vast catologue of intrigue and mystery. It is sublime and addictive. A sensual pleasure and a emotive joy. Classic! Did I mention that this lady just happens to be ethereally beautiful too? So the intrigue grows and the mystery unfolds without end......
B000BBOUU4|4.0|This is a very colorful, fun spirited movie that adds up to not much. Hold the original movie in your heart and look at this remake as something different. It makes no good points about people, life and living as the original movie with Gene Wilder did. In fact, this film was gasply removed from the moral of the book, but it is colorfully fascinating and, moment to moment, very fun to watch.
B00005GL0Q|5.0|So much better than Rubber Soul, although the two would have made a great double-LP set! I really love this album though..it has alot of 'George' influence on it.I think he got the short end of the stick while with the Beatles...Just Fabulous..Can't wait to buy the Import !!

B000BTC5LW|5.0|It's clear from this that Pink Floyd was not at all a destroyed band, but one very much alive. The video allows for a close-up glimpse of the band in addition to the light display, that might be lost to the audience at the actual concert. For that it may even surpass the concertgoing experience for those who prefer a more intimate musical experience.  <br /> <br />At times it may seem that the younger touring musicians are more \\"into it\\" than the band, but then Pink Floyd has always been more reserved than some. The Floyd members show their passion in subtler ways. If anybody in the band has a tendency to be visibly animated, surprisingly enough (or is it?) it's the softspoken keyboardist Richard Wright, who reacts very clearly to the music.  <br /> <br />\\"But if I have the audio CD, should I buy this too?\\"  <br /> <br />Absolutely! Even though most of the tracks are similar in style, on some the combination of light and sound heightens the experience. Also, the video-only tracks are well worth hearing. But perhaps the most stunning difference is in \\"Sorrow\\". While the CD version takes a more mournful, softer approach, the video version is a hard-rocking tune that draws the most passionate playing out of all three members. If David Gilmour and Nick Mason are on fire, then Richard Wright is positively explosive on this song. Letting loose with a screaming, uncharacteristically aggressive Hammond assault, one almost wonders if the keys will survive such a performance (especially given the fire in his eyes!).  <br /> <br />The only thing at all lacking on the VHS was the picture quality, which although good, is not up to modern standards of clarity. The long awaited upcoming DVD will rectify this.  <br /> <br />Ps: Count me in too!, please release The Wall Live DVD in 2006. There's a petition which more than 5,200 fans have signed in!. We know there's a lot of footage both from Earls Court 1980,} and 1981, and Nassau Coliseum 1980. Also there's a documentary from behind the wall out there!. Even on the official site we can watch footage from The Wall Live concerts!. Please let it happen
B0000029AP|5.0|This is a groundbreaking album. Finally, after few years in Rock N' Roll world and two albums behind them, Steven and boys produced the album that brought them on higher stage. No longer critics dared to say that Aerosmith are Stones Copycats; now they created their own, original style that they followed throughout the 70s, and they won the charts with singles like \\"Walk This Way\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\". <br /> <br />It took me some time to understand the greatness of this album. I used to like \\"Rocks\\" better; now I think both are equally great, just a bit different; \\"Rocks\\" is basically hard rock stuff; and \\"Toys\\" is more variete; it has the rock n' roll classics like the title track, \\"Sweet Emotion\\" and \\"Walk This Way\\", but also a ballad \\"You See Me Crying\\" or blues cover \\"Big Ten Inch Record\\". <br /> <br />Toys In The Attic - Short, intense, hard rocker. Great opening to the album. This one kicks ass. 10/10 <br /> <br />Uncle Salty - A sad, thrilling song about sexual abuse. Not the one to be ma favourite, but it's good. 8/10 <br /> <br />Adam's Apple - I like this song better and better with every time I listen to it. Great rocker about garden of eden. Cool. 9/10 <br /> <br />Walk This Way - A classic. Guess everybody knows it from the radio. Filled with incredible riffs from Joe Perry. After years it gets a bit old, but still love it. 10/10 <br /> <br />Big Ten Inch Record - Awesome blues cover with a funny lyrics to it. \\"I whip out my big ten inch... record...\\" love this song. However if You want to hear the TRUE version of this song, check the one on \\"Pandora's Box\\". 10/10 <br /> <br />Sweet Emotion - Another classic. Incredible riffing in this one, at the end the song gets another turn. One of Aerosmith's best. 10/10 <br /> <br />No More No More - More melodic and softer than the others. This song is really great, but still not enough to give it ten. 9,5/10 <br /> <br />Round And Round - A weird kind of metal. I think if other band recorded it, it would be oneof its greatest. But it's untypical for Aerosmith. 7,5/10 <br /> <br />You See Me Crying - This song tears my soul apart. Sweet ballad leaving You a bit dreamy. This is one of Aerosmith greatest ballads.  <br /> <br />A must have album. Guess I don't need to say more.
B000001ELL|4.0|1979 (the last album of the seventies)dynasty is probably the most underrated kiss album ever, why ?because they said this album was disco and plus;peter criss was asked to stop making the album after the ``dirty livin``song.<br />i am a die-hard kiss fan and for somme reasons dynasty is one of my favorite kiss album because every songs exept the gene songs are great.the only song that have disco style are dirty livin and sure know something but even those i like them.i was made for loving you is one of my favorite kiss song and almost everyone like or love it the higlights exept the singles are Ace songs  2000 man is great, and hard times is one of my fav on the album, save your love is great also.Ace songs are best because they represent him or at least Space-Ace his character.magic touch is a great one of Stanley that is great i like this album because you can listen to every pretty much song.if you are a die-hard fan get it .i couldnt give this five star because of peter criss departure  but overal great album somme people blast it so i guess everyone has different tastes.its a good or a bad kiss album dependiding on your tastes,the album doesn t get the respect it deserves.kiss got judjed badly for this album because its disco,maybe the fans were dissapointed but disco fan worlwide loved it.and as a result it went platinum (their last platinum album until a couple years ,and &igrave; was made for loving you got a top 20 chart position being one of their best song on the charts.you got to accept that kiss did this album for marketing.their second attemp at disco `unmasked`didnt beat this one.the reason i like the album is because ace does a large contribution to it,he wrote 3 songs and sings them.ace `s song arent that much of disco they rock!this album wont please to everybody ,if you expect something usual like love gun,destroyer you wont like this.kiss needed a replacement for peter criss as `dirty livin`was the last song he did on the album and anton fig replaced him,a good drummer.kiss wanted to be different and try something else and fans booed that choice.good album in my opinion not destroyer or rock and roll over but good and different.A style disco fans will like or poeple that like sweeter stuff.Many of my rewiews are kiss rewiews.good drummer.kiss wanted to be different and try something else and fans booed that choice.good album in my opinion not destroyer or rock and roll over but good and different.A style disco fans will like or poeple that like sweeter stuff.Many of my rewiews are kiss rewiews.
B0002ZYE1Y|3.0|I have always been a nightwish fan, owning all of their Cd's so far. But sadly you just may find yourself listening to 1/2 the songs on this CD Once...the name suggests. Dark Chest of wonders, Nemo, planet hell and The siren are pretty good songs, but the rest seem to fall short of Nightwish's awesome albums Oceanborn, Wishmaster and Century child. Some problems I found -  Jukka's druming which has been awesome on previous albums is almost not there =/. And at times it seems like there too much ochestra at times. Emppu's guitar work on some songs seems like the bare basics =?. Some of the songs seem to lack that nightwish flow and feel that has been seen on their other albums. If you are new to nightwish, i'd recommend starting with OceanBorn, wishmaster & Century child.
B00009W8N2|4.0|On their 1995 debut, \\"Orchid,\\" these Swedish metalheads more-or-less laid their cards on the table. All of the songs on here are around or more than ten minutes long. Plus, while some of these songs are either pretty or heavy, most of them are both. Opeth blend death metal (with electric guitars and heavy barks) and lighter, prog rock (which includes acoustic guitars and proper crooning). Since few (or no) other bands can seamlessly intertwine these two polar opposite genres into one song, Opeth are kind of in a league/genre of their own. And that should really show you how incredible and interesting this band is. The opening song is mainly heavy, but its sporadic acoustic breakdowns make \\"In Mist She Was Standing\\" have several different tempos and rhythm changes. At a mere three minutes, it is only an interlude track, but \\"Silhouette\\" is, in my opinion, one of the prettiest song ever written by Opeth. Drummer Anders plays the piano, here, and makes the whole song sound very cool and delicate. The very next track, however, returns to their heavier roots (with a surging guitar and double bass attack and a few wicked bellows). \\"Twilight Is My Robe\\" features light, almost prog-ish strumming, but also a few rapid, propulsive tempo changes which quick, walloping drum work. Track six, \\"Requiem\\" is the other interlude, but its soft acoustic guitar strings make this song very pretty, as well. The last track I'll mention is \\"Apostle In Triumph.\\" It begins with more acoustic plucking and some hand percussion, but, with the help of double bass drumming and Mikael's violent vocals, the song gradually builds and becomes heavier.<br /><br />The only thing that actually drags \\"Orchid\\" down is the bonus track (which was included on this album's re-release). This track, \\"Into the Frost of Winter,\\" seems really forced, out of place, and just kind of odd. Also, if you listen to Opeth's later albums (like \\"Deliverance\\"), you'll realize that Peter's guitar playing has greatly improved over time (and that it is really quite amateur, here.) But this is still a fine album, and a great place to start if your new to Opeth. Recommended to all fans of the band, and fans death and prog metal.e (and that it is really quite amateur, here.)

B0000A02TZ|3.0|When I was 10 AH hit theatres. Naturally I didn't get to see it on it's release (though you can bet I wanted to). I assumed there was tons of nudity and sex going on and other stuff. When I finally did see it (many years later) I couldn't believe how tame it all really was. Tame in the sense it was mostly nude-and-sex free. It also wasn't anywhere near as funny as it was supposed to be from the reports I heard of it when I was a kid (neither was Monty Python but that's another story).This film is basically a (actually) good-hearted, semi-accurate nostalgia look at life just before Vietnam changed America.
B000001DYJ|5.0|Alive 2 wasnt up to the level of the original Alive!16years after Alive 3 come to stores whats worth the bait?EVERITHING this album is outstanding Alive 3 is basicly a live remake of the 80s kiss albums with a couple of kiss classics.They also included 4 songs from their last studio album`revenge`wich is great.Its not the great Alive but its good its does sound live.it includes songs from almost every 80s album exept a couple like unmasked,the elder and others.It doesnt excludes classics like detroit rock city,deuce,watching you and others but it focuses mainly on the 80s.Eric Singer does a great job at the drums so does Bruce Kulick at the guitar part his `star spangled banner`performance  is very impresssive.There is 16 songs live from 1993 ,the booklet included has cool pictures inside.If you just listen to it then its not as good as on the`confidential and exposed`dvd wich includes most of the Alive3 concert,it looks amazing and they are performing at their best.Its a good value this album is outstanding!i love it.Maybe its not from the original lineup but its good anyway.a great effort on this live album.there is a missing song`take it off`that they did not include here.very recomended!
B000A7Q2DM|5.0|Finally an actor who can actually have a band and its really good.  I picked up the album after I saw them in concert recently at MSG in NYC.  They were the opening act for Audioslave (AWESOME!)  and they sounded phenomenal.  One of the best new bands I have seen in years.  I ordered their debut album and am waiting to hear it.  If this album is any indication Im sure I will love it.  P.S they did a cool remake of Bjork's song Hunter.
0307276902|5.0|I can't say I enjoyed reading this book, but it was completely fascinating and sucks you in from the first line.  I had to put it down several times and just take a breath, but I could never put it down for long.  The critics say it's too long, but I had to go get my copy to verify that it was indeed 400 pages, as I read it in a few days.  The writing style takes some getting used to, but it does serve to emphasize and highlight what Mr. Frey was going through. <br /> <br />I have been permanently affected by this book and I respect the author for putting it all out there for all to see.  I'm sure it will help lots of people struggling with addictions (if they read the book) to see that they are not alone and that you can break free.   <br /> <br />Kudos, Mr. Frey, very well done!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|SAW is a good thriller: a film with a lot of potential, but lacking in follow-through.  On the one hand, the premise is very cool.  Two men wake up in a bathroom, chained to piping, completely unaware of where they are or why.  As the film progresses, these two men start to piece together their situation: they have been planted in this situation by a deranged madman, someone who enjoys placing his victims in life-or-death situations and forcing them to make horrific decisions.  It's a marvelous setup and the surprising conclusion is right on target and thrilling.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the film reeks of a small budget.  The acting, in particular, is quite poor.  Unlike SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS, SAW fails to explore its characters.  Instead, the madman's device becomes the center of the entire film and our poor actors get to scream and cry their way through 100 minutes.  Moreover, our madman is portrayed as a deranged person, complete with a secret lair and everything.  Unfortunately, we don't come any closer to understanding him by the end of the film than we did at the start.  He appears to be \\"teaching\\" his victims a moral lesson, but what that lesson is in his mind is completely obtuse.  Both SEVEN and SILENCE OF THE LAMBS also have clever plot devices, deranged madmen, and the like.  But unlike SAW, they decide to spend most of their time revealing their characters instead of merely relying on the plot devices.  The result is a much more engaging, interesting, and ultimately satisfying thriller.  It may seem like a strange thing to say, but exploring the haunted games of a madman is not nearly as creepy as exploring the haunted depths of a madman's mind.<br /><br />In the end, SAW has a really cool plot device on its hand, but lacks the heart and complexity of other thrillers.  It's definitely worth a look and will thrill anyone who loves this genre.  But with mediocre acting and complexity, it will never reach the status of either SEVEN or SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.
B000001EL3|2.0|KISS' 1976 effort Destroyer is an iconic album, even if it wasn't good it still had that amazing album cover but  thankfully the songs on it are good and we have memorable classic tunes that have stayed in the band's setlists  and keep receiving airplay on Classic Rock radio over the years; \\"Detroit Rock City\\", \\"God of Thunder\\", \\"Shout It Out Loud\\", \\"King of the Night Time Word\\" and the ballad \\"Beth\\". I can't say that Destroyer was my favorite KISS record or the one that I thought best, but for most it was their entry into the world of KISS and it's constantly on top album lists year after year. Looking back Destroyer was a very different album than the early KISS records which were rawer and in Dressed To Kill's case acoustic, and very Beatles influenced. Coming off the heels of the hot and successful Alive! Album a double live album that very much saved the band's career, KISS's fourth studio album is a more complex and layered one and much of that is due to producer Bob Ezrin known for his work with Alice Cooper. Destroyer featured choirs and orchestra and expended the sound of the band (I don't think anyone imagined KISS doing material like \\"Great Expectations\\").<br /><br />2012 marks the 35th anniversary of Destroyer and as a landmark album it's only normal that something would be done to celebrate this classic album. Ezrin himself remixed the album and changed and tweaked things here and there, the result is a more current sounding Destroyer. Changes are very noticeable on some songs like \\"Detroit Rock City\\", some are minor like adding some acoustic guitar to \\"Beth\\" and others like \\"Do You Love Me?\\" and \\"Flaming Youth\\" sound much more different as the drums have been brought forward and are more present. Bob played with echoes and certain sounds that some things that weren't noticeable on the original can be heard on Destroyer (Detroit Rock City is a good example of this). I'm not sure why Bob wanted to remix the album and even from the (neat) liner notes it doesn't seem like he had reasons other that he wanted to have fun with it revisit a classic, change a few things to his liking and for fun, the fact that it's the 35th anniversary  and probably earning himself a paycheck in the whole process.<br /><br />To be honest, I think they completely missed the boat with this release. Fans like myself who probably own this numerous times on Vinyl, Cassette, the 1997 Remaster will want it for collection purposes, the alternate album cover (which is I must say nice with the Alive! Costumes still present)and liner notes and mostly to hear what has been \\"fixed\\" or changed. It's interesting to hear the songs you grew up listening to in a different way and notice the little (or big) changes but other than a novelty, you'll nearly always put on the one you grew up with. The only addition was \\"Sweet Pain\\" with an alternate guitar soloWhat disappointed me is that this was initially advertized as something bigger. A two disc version with demos, unreleased stuff, different cuts or whatever the case might have been and we have none of that. A live CD or DVD would've been amazing.  It seems KISS themselves didn't have anything AT ALL to do with it, not even contributing liner notes.<br /><br />The die-hard will get Ressurected, but so far I don't think anyone is impressed or satisfied with this release and it seems more of a quick cash grab than anything (and let's face it...they knew we'd buy it anyway). As I said earlier, this is mostly a novelty and a failed opportunity to celebrate one of Rock's biggest and most iconic releases. Maybe someday they'll re-re-release it with the extras we want.  It's not a terrible remix I believe some of it sounds really good (I would've liked more acoustic guitars on \\"Beth\\" but maybe that's just me...).  The hiccup has been much talked about by now, and the half missing beat at the beginning of \\"Flaming Youth\\" is annoying. It's an unnecessary remix but one that fans will want to check out nonetheless but I suspect I won't be playing these very often. The packaging is nice, with the fake record engraved on the CD and the amazing picture behind it, liner notes are nice to read. I'll mostly remember Ressurected for something that it COULD have been. 2/5 stars.t I suspect I won't be playing these very often.

B000BW7QWW|5.0|I love the characters of Firefly and was elated when this movie came out. This movie continues with the story of the crew of Serenity. Joss Whedon has continued with his wonderful character development. I really, really, really hope that this film made enough money for the studio so that we might have yet one more voyage.   If you want to know why so many people love this movie/show look no further than the fine cast and creator. It is the people that make this film work.     The film is wonderful, the show is wonderful. I don't know how I can make until Dec. 20.
B00005JN5X|2.0|Personally I welcome anything from visual maestro Terry Gilliam or ex-Monty Python members, but 'The Brothers Grimm' falls short of enchanting magic of 'The Fisher King' or deliciously dark humor of 'Time Bandits.'  'The Brothers Grimm' is fun to see, especially the detailed visual techniques of the director, but the story is stale and dull, not knowing what it wants to do.  Sorry if I offend his fans, but this Grimm world is far from the originality his name is always associated with. <br /> <br />[GOOD STARTING...] You know where the problem lies.  It is the story of Ehren Kruger, whose previous work was very ordinary horror 'Ring 2.'  Matt Damon and Heath Ledger are The Brothers Grimm, who, in this film, are not respected scholars of falklore, but are jolly con-men who make good use of gimmicks to convince the unsuspecting German people of the presence of the horrifying witches.  Of course, it is the brothers who banish the monsters from the village before receiving the money. <br /> <br />So far the story is not bad.  Silly, but OK, I kind of like that.  Then, we are told that girls are missing in the cursed forest surrounding one decaying tower, where a witch (a real one, played by Monica Bellucci) is said to live.  There, many girls start to vanish, including Little Red Riding Hood. <br /> <br />[AND THE STORY GETS ASTRAY] Nice touch, I admit.  However, the film gets slower, becoming more and more dull as it reaches the part where the French troop led by the commander Jonathan Pryce (remember him in Gilliam's masterpiece 'Brazil'?).  They arrest the Brothers after occupying the land, and hand them to an overconfidnet \\"Italian\\" officer Peter Stormare, who does overact so much that I really wished his early and quick demise.  Sadly Terry Gillaim thought otherwise. <br /> <br />The rest of the stort is about the mystery of the forest, which is not particularly fascinating.  Kruger's script fails to interest us because of the too familiar elements, and as the story nears the conclusion, the logics of the film starts to fall apart.  The climax is terribly incoherent, and the disenchanting love triangle involving one femele hunter (Lena Hedley) only drags me down. <br /> <br />Thankfully Terry Gilliam's vibrant imagination and his wicked humor are still there, barely saving the film itself from a total mess.  Well, actually, it IS a mess, especially in the second half, and not-so-good CGIs (of the wolf, specially) and very detached acting from Bellucci do not help, but still a beautiful mess to see.  But I'd rather watch his great films in the past again, except 'Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas.'
B000002HK4|3.0|This is a very good album, but the one thing you have to realize is that this is mainly live stuff.  Uh - am I the only one that noticed that that is  NOT labrie singing on \\"Perfect Strangers\\"?@!  I see all these reviews from die hard dream theater fans, and they all fail to mention that Bruce Dickinson sings on that track.  Oh well, this album would've been better if they had actually played all of the songs on seperate tracks instead of the medley.  But then I guess they wouldn't have been able to fit the title track.  Buy the album if you're a collector, otherwise, there are definitely better DT albums to choose from.
0307276902|2.0|After seeing Oprah and her staff go on and on about this book.  I had to see what the big hype was all about.  I bought 3 books, one for myself and 2 as gifts..big mistake. He bucked the whole treatment process so why was he there or allowed to stay?  I was hoping to find some secret in recovering from an addiction but was left feeling empty at the end since he recovered by just saying \\"no\\" to his addictions.  I wish willpower was that strong in everyone, then there wouldn't be addictions.  I am disappointed in Oprah for endosing a book by someone that does not believe in God. I am also disappointed in Oprah for saying it was a page turner and I don't understand why anyone would stay up at night to read it, I had to make myself finish it.
B000B5IPLK|3.0|Okay, I liked her alot better when she first came out with Songs In A Minor.  I will admit that a few of her songs have touched me.  But she doesn't have that fire in her performances and voice that moves me to the edge of the seat.  I think she is a much better writer, and pianoist than vocalist.  She strains on many of the songs on this Unplugged and her notes are not clear and strong.  Unbreakable is a great song but could you please let Angie Stone sing it for me.  If I Were Your Woman is not her song and you can really tell on this unplugged joint because she oversings it and her voice sounds hoarse and falters many times through to the end of the song. I really prefer her better when she sings in her lower range. I kind of have a bone to pick regarding Alicia because the year when her album was nominated against India Erie she won in every category. This was in my opinion a mistake because India's album was great as well.  Alicia's single was the only song that I felt was deserving of a Grammy.  But she was Clive Davis' protegie so I am sure that carried some weight. I know she was Summa Cum at her school but still aint got nothing on the B................eyonce.  The best part of the Unplugged concert was the ending when Def, COmmon & Marley blessed the show at the end.  I did like her vocal poetry selection.  It is a shame she did not package that project to sell in that manner and not as a book of poems.  I think it would have been more appropriate since her music is her mainstay. That is not to say that I don't like her but I think she needs to stay in her lane and not stretch herself to pursue MEGASTARDOM. If youv'e got it just let it flow and it will show.
0300108834|5.0|There isn't much I can add much to the other reviews, but I just wanted to say that A Little History of the World is the best overview of world history for children that I've ran across. I highly recommend it to all the homeschoolers out there, and especially those who have children with attention disorders. My daughter does and this book completely held her attention and even had her asking questions. I can't praise this book highly enough.  <br /> <br />
B0000069NM|5.0|The Sco-man and the ever trippy MMW boys melt the outer layer off your cerebral cortex with this masterpiece album.If you cant groove to this youre either dead or very near death.This album is funkier than underneath your watch-band and I guarantee you will experience  booty-movement.

B000957O82|3.0|Hitch brings to the screen the story of a consultant who helps guys on their dates.  Things get a bit more complicated when he finds himself in need of help... <br />It is not very unique, nevertheless, it is quite pleasant. <br />The major setback is in relation to the choice for lead actress, which was poor at best; this film does not seem to be her thing, and she is not very likable.  Overall, she is not convincing in her role.   <br />Aside from that, the setting and the plot are pretty good! <br />In short, far from being a masterpiece, it is a movie worth watching as it will provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might not want to go as far as purchasing it.  3 Stars <br />
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Make no mistake, if you like any Iron Maiden made after Number of the Beast, then you will love this album. I know that there are some fans out there who have been around since the first album and believe that there is nothing that Iron Maiden could do now that could ever possibly equal up to their early stuff. To them I say, \\"Put on your lps, close the blinds, and continue to hate everything new or different that comes from 'your' bands.\\" <br /> <br />Truth is, this album sounds just as amazing as Seventh Son or Somewhere in Time. Believe me, when you hear it through a good stereo system, the three guitars are awesome! <br /> <br />That's not to say that every song is amazing, but as a whole, the album is incredible.  <br /> <br />STAND OUT SONGS: The Wicker Man (Hey, a classic already), Brave New World (Underated I find, this song is incredible), The Nomad (Tell me you don't bang your fists when the drums come in during the middle part), Out of the Silent Planet (You HAVE to yell along), even The Thin Line Between Love and Hate (It's different, but in a good way) <br /> <br />GOOD, BUT NOT THE BEST: Ghost of the Navigator (A little overrated I find), Blood Brothers (It's good, just lacking something that would make it great), Dream of Mirrors (Sounds like a B-side from Somewhere in Time) <br /> <br />FILLER SONGS: The Mercenary (this theme's been addressed before), The Fallen Angel (for some reason I just don't dig it) <br /> <br />It's truely inspiring to know that a couple of seventies/eighties metal bands are still making the music that metalheads want to hear. Might I also suggest Helloween, another eighties metal band that continues to make music you want to hear. If you don't know about them, get Treasure Chest, their greatest hits album. You won't be sorry.
B00004R7TP|5.0|A great many remasters are nothing more than taking the original master tapes and printing them as is. The bass was often toned down for vinyl recordings as loud bass on the inside of a record caused problems. The first cuts could handle it but not the last cuts on a side
B00008QSA5|5.0|I first heard a couple of tracks of this fantastic CD on 9412.com and I knew that I had to have it in my collection. I have listened to it just about everyday and I hear something just a little bit different each time.  <br /> <br />Mike Bloomfield is an absolute guenis with the guitar on this album. Of course Al Kooper and Stephen Stills are no slouches either. Yes, this is the same Stephen Stills that went later to help form Crosby, Stills and Nash.  <br /> <br />I would recommend this Cd to anyone that is seriously thinking about starting a blues collection. A must have for the hard core blues listener.
B000099T2L|5.0|BORN ON SEPTEMBER 4, 1981 IN HOUSTON, TEXAS WAS AFRICAN AMERICAN  BEYONCE GISELLE KNOWLES. SHE IS USUALLY REFERRED TO NOW AS HER STAGE NAME BEYONCE. SHE IS AN R & B SINGER, ACTRESS, AND CHIEF SONGWRITER AND PRODUCER IN THE GROUP DESTINY'S CHILD. NOT ONLY WAS SHE A MEMBER OF DESTINY'S CHILD, YET A SOLOIST. <br /> DESTINY'S CILD HAS COME OUT WITH SEVERAL CDs. DC STARTED RELEASING THEIR CDs WITH THE GROUPS SELF TITLED ALBUM IN 1998, AGAIN IN 1999, AND RECENTLY IN 2004 AND THEIR FINAL ONE LAST MONTH. ALTHOUGH DC HAS ACCOMPLISHED MUCH OVER THE YEARS AND REALEASED MANY CDs, BEYONCE HAS ONLY RELEASED ONE DEBUT SOLO ALBUM. BEYONCE'S DEBUT SOLO ALBUM IS BY FAR MORE BETTER THAN ANY CD THAT DESTINY'S CHILD WILL EVER OR HAS EVER RELEASED.  <br /> DESTINY'S CHILD HAS A NUMBER OF SONGS THAT HIT NUMBER ONE ON THE CHARTS. THEY ALSO TOURED  WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE. AMONG THE THREE ARTIST, MICHELLE, KELLY AND BEYONCE, BEYONCE IS THE MOST TALENTED. SHE IS AN ACTRESS, DOES COMERCIALS AND FROM THE SONGS ON HER CD WAS THE FIRST IN A VERY LONG TIME TO HAVE A SINGLE AND A CD HIT NUMBER ONE ON THE CHARTS IN THE USA AND INTERNATIONAL.  <br /> BECAUSE OF BEYONCE'S GOD GIVEN TALENT AS A SONGWRITER SHE WROTE MAJORITY OF THE SONGS FOR HER AND THE TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF THE GROUP. THE SONGS ARE BASED ON THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES. NATURALLY, THE SONGS FROM DESTINY'S CHILD AND DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE ARE GOING TO SHARE SOME SIMILARITIES , BUT FOR BEYONCE'S SINGLE  \\" DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE\\" SHE ONLY HAD TO WRITE FOR HERSELF SO THE SONGS ARE MUCH MORE PERSONAL. BEYONCE  WANTED PEOPLE TO HEAR HER RANGE AND ALL THE MUSICAL INFLUENCES FROM HIP- HOP TO ROCK TO JAZZ AND THERE IS EVEN A SHUGGIE OTIS SAMPLE AL PACKED INTO ONE MULTI- SELLING POP/URBAN CD. <br /> THERE IS REALLY NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CDs OF DESTINY'S CHILD AND \\" DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE\\". HOWEVER, DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE IS MORE MATURE, PLAYFUL, AND DEEPLY PASSIONATE AND SEXUALLY AGGRESSIVE. IT IS THE SOUND OF A GROWN WOMAN CLEARLY STAKING HER CLAIM IN THE WORLD, IN THE PROCESS, REDIFINING THE EXPECTATIONS OF WHO SHE REALLY IS. DESTINY'S CHILD HAS MATURED THEIR STYLE OF SINGING OVER THE YEARS, BUT OVERALL PRESENTS A VIBE OF A  SILLY, PLAYFUL, GROUP OF FRIENDS SHARING THEIR LIFE THROUGH A FORM OF HARMONICAL VOCALIZATION. <br /> BEYONCE KNOWLES', \\"DANGEROUOSLY IN LOVE\\", IS THE BEST CD BETWEEN HER A SOLOIST AND THAT AS A MEMBER OF DESTINY'S CHILD. DC HAS RELEASED MANY CDs BUT \\"DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE\\" WAS A CHANCE FOR BEYONCE TO GROW AS A WRITER AND A SINGER. IT HAS MORE BALLADS AND BECAUSE IT WAS JUST HERSELF THE VOCALS ARE NOT AS PRECISELY PRODUCED.  <br />
B000BEZPQE|5.0|let me begin by saying i'm a HUGE slipknot fan. i would never say anything as a result of me disliking them. moving on- there seems to be something not right with the sound of corey's voice. the horse- sounding high pitched wails bursting from his gullet sound as though he needs to give his throat a rest. maybe this is why it takes them a while to record an album. anyone who listens to this album and has seen 'DISASTERPIECES' (you must buy this DVD) or seen them in concert recently or even tuned into conan o'brian or the tonight show or in fact the ever boring jimmy kimmel show knows what i'm talking about. another thing is if you've seen anything live of slipknot you they go through the rounds at every show. the \\"Hands in the air. Jump!\\" during 'liberate', the \\"This is an old song...\\" to the pace ruining \\"Get the f--- down\\" interlude on 'spit it out', and many others. they are all here is they were from the past 6 years. i gave this review 5 stars because it's slipknot. i paid 7 bucks for this 2 disc c.d. and glad i didn't pay more. don't get me wrong, i like it, just a little disappointed. this band is WAY better than this album. if you don't own anything slipknot, go out and BUY (support) their music. if you're a true 'knot head like myself buy this. in my opinion, a better slipknot live album would be DISASTERPIECES burnt onto c.d. for your listening enjoyment.
B00003CWL6|5.0|American Beauty is without a doubt the freshest, funniest, honest, and most insightful film in memory.<br /><br />It tells the story of Lester Burhnam (Kevin Spacey), the seemingly average, suburban man. He has it all; a lovely wife (Annette Benning), a cheerleader daughter(Thora Birch), a job for a major corproration, and a large house. But the film asks us to \\"look closer\\" and it does just that. We can clearly see that his life, marriage, and relationships are crumbling. He is going through a midlife crisis, wondering what he has done with his life to make it worthwhile. He quits his job and tries to seduce his daughter's best friend (Mena Suvari). The movie desplays not only his struggle, but the struggle of all the supporting character to see the beauty in life.<br /><br />The acting is certainly a standout. Spacey leads a cast that all inhabit their roles to surprising lengths. Each line is said to seeming perfection, and comes across and understandable and believeable.<br /><br />It is the directoral debut for Sam Mendes, who does an astonishingly great job. Each shot seems to have a purpose, and it if facinating to watch their lives intertwine.<br /><br />The screenplay is what makes the film a classic, though. The diolauge is fresh and crisp, while at the same time believeable. It is also incredibly funny and satirical, despite a strong subject matter (a lot of people find it odd that I laughed at a movie about a pedophile).<br /><br />Overall, American Beauty is an example of what happens when everything in a movie is done to perfection. It will become a classic representation of the movies of our generation. See what all the hype is about.<br /><br />It is truly one of the greatest films of our time.
0394800184|5.0|In spite of its simplicity, this book has the most riveting plot of any baby book I've ever come across.  What could be more compelling to a child than losing your own mother and not knowing what she looks like?  The ensuing search has small children on the edge of their high chairs.  The whimsical mother surrogates, dog, cat, etc., are absurdly funny to even the youngest.  The spunky protagonist is brave and persistent and, with a little help from the most outrageous \\"mother\\" of all, the \\"Snort,\\" the baby bird eventually finds his own true mother.  The illustrations are comic and endearing.  I particularly like this book because the illustrations do not overshadow the TEXT.  Kids today are inundated with easily accessible IMAGES,GRAPHICS.  They need WORDS, LANGUAGE, early and often!  Both of my children came under the spell of Are You My Mother at an early age.  Moreover, I give it and the accompanying toy bird character at every baby shower I attend.  I think it asks a pertinent question that moms as well as kids could ponder.  As a bonus, Are You My Mother will be read by the child later as a beginning reader.  I absolutely love this book and so do kids!
B000001GY9|5.0|Leonard Bernstein (1918-1990) made a terrific recording of the 4 Schumann Symphonies in the early 1960s with the New York Philharmonic for Columbia records, re-released by Sony Classical in the Royal Edition series of Bernstein recordings in 1993.  The Sony Schumanns are now harder to find, but DG has reissued Bernstein's 1984-85 Vienna Philharmonic Schumann Symphonies in this budget 2-fer, which is quite good.<br /><br />In Vienna, Bernstein conducts with his usual fire and flair, and is much better in these Schumanns than in his cycle of the Brahms Symphonies with the Vienna Philharmonic (DG, 1983).  Symphony 1 is youthful and fiery, and Symphony 2 quite fine in I and II, but III is too intense, with a really SLOW ending filled with mannerisms, IV quite good until the closing pages, which are slowed down too much for dramatic emphasis.  (Perhaps this was more effective in a live concert than on a recording, but I find the ending just too slow for what the music can take.)  Symphony 3 is as good as Bernstein's New York recording, which is considered excellent by many critics. Symphony 3 has a noble I, and a really sparking V which moves and verges on going out of control in the closing pages, but doesn't, for a really EXCITING ending. Symphony 4 is better than in New York, and in some ways resembles Furtwangler's classic Berlin Philharmonic recording (DG Originals) but has the repeat in I.  Bernstein's Vienna Symphony 4 is intense and dramatic, and well worth hearing.<br /><br />Other options?  If you can find them, Bernstein's earlier Sony \\"Royal edition\\" release of Symphonies 1,2; and 3 (coupled with 4 which isn't as good);  Szell/Cleveland (Sony);  Giulini/Los Angeles for Symphony 3 (DG); and Karl Bohm/Vienna for Symphony 4 (Orfeo, with Beethoven Symphony 4).  In spite of a less than great Symphony 2, I recommend this.
B0000069NM|5.0|Too much funk for one man to handle...only listen to this album with friends, and only if you want to shake it like an English nanny with an infant! This album is what it is all about..more soul than an R n' B convention, more funk than a smelly thru-hiker after a month on the trail, more groove than Stella could ever get back, and more balls than an 85 pound bullfighter. This is an album done by true masters of modern jazz, and it's done so tastefully that it could easily have been produced in the era of Miles himself. Don't buy it if you don't appreciate jazz, but if you do, you'll find that this album plays and plays and you can't stop moving long enough to cut it off.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|Listened to some of this today on WGBH-Boston, with host Lisa Mullins:  \\"a recording that features 18th century vocal music by Handel and Scarlatti, music once considered so scandalous that it was banned in Rome.\\"  I can see why, on hearing it I dropped everything, listened and was pulled into a mood of divine bliss.  That could be dangerous to the Catholic church, known to suppress all such states.  I then came here to Amazon and immediately purchased.  I may be tempted to worship differently now.
B0007GAEW6|2.0|YOu might like this CD if your very partial to expiremental music, but it bored the crap out me.  I expected more, but they probably figured they only need a couple good songs and the rest can be \\"oh it'd be crazy if we sample the sound of a bus for 4 minutes!\\"
B000056K04|2.0|The electric guitar coming from Dave track after track on this album hurts not only my acoustically-tuned, Dave-Matthews-oriented ears, but my soul as well.  Dave Matthew's niche is with the acoustic guitar.  Putting an electric guitar into Dave Matthew's hands for song after song on a studio album kills everything the band has worked for as far as image and sound goes. <br /> <br />The Dave Matthews Band should work to produce themselves.  Nobody knows their own limitations better than they do.  With the amazing departed talent of Lillywhite, the band should be able to grow and expand off of knowledge they acquired from him.  The band has a marvelous future, even after the release of the travesty, Stand Up, if only they ditch the producers and self-produce.  It worked wonders for Led Zeppelin.  With Jimmy Page producing their albums, they were golden. <br /> <br />Some songs ring true the classic Dave style, even if they're leadened down with an electric guitar, such as \\"The Space Between.\\"  Songs like \\"Everyday\\" and \\"When the World Ends\\" are a couple of my picks from the album because they cling more to the grassroots style of the band, and involve less electric guitar, and more of an acoustic feel. <br /> <br />Overall, the lyrics are well below par for Dave Matthews.  He's a genius lyricist, and aside from a few notable exceptions (\\"When the World Ends,\\" \\"Mother Father,\\" and \\"If I Had it All\\"), the lyrics do not do justice to his incredible talent. <br /> <br />Songs like \\"Sleep to Dream Her,\\" \\"Fool to Think,\\" and \\"Dreams of Our Fathers\\" are typical 'skip-its' for even a die-hard DMB fan such as myself. <br /> <br />Don't buy the album, you'll be disappointed.  THIS IS NOT AN ALBUM FOR BEGINNERS TO DMB TO EVER BEGIN ON.  If you want a good beginners DMB album, buy \\"Under the Table and Dreaming.\\"  This album, Everyday, will pervert Dave forever for you.  If you must, download the below asteriked, rated songs: <br /> <br />1. I Did It (7.8/10) <br />2. When the World Ends (9.5/10)* <br />3. The Space Between (9.2/10)* <br />4. Dreams of Our Fathers (5.8/10) <br />5. So Right (7.0/10) <br />6. If I Had it All (8.0/10) <br />7. What You Are (8.2/10) <br />8. Angel (5.0/10) <br />9. Fool to Think (7.5/10) <br />10. Sleep to Dream Her (4.7/10) <br />11. Mother Father (8.5/10)* <br />12. Everyday (8.8/10)* <br /> <br />Overall album rating:  5/10 <br />Overall lyrics:  6.5/10 <br />Overall vocals:  8.0/10 <br />Overall rythym:  8.5/10 <br />Overall solos:  7.5/10 <br />Overall sound:  4.5/10 (attributed mostly to production, mixing) <br />Overall band potential on songs:  9.0/10 (as far as production will allow for with these tracks) <br />Overall BAND performance:  8.0/10 <br />Overall flow from track to track:  3.0/10 <br />Overall repeat value for most songs:  1.0/10 <br /> <br />Some songs are worth download.  But do not buy this album.  It's a waste of money.  Especially if you are a beginning Dave fan.  DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM FIRST.  I repeat, buy \\"Under the Table and Dreaming.\\"  You will like it.
B00006DEFA|5.0|The notoriety of this fabulous and enrapturing movie would seem to reside precisely, in the similar Mozart temperament that permeates it from the first shots. Humor, irreverence, joy of living, grace, charm and lack of pomp and circumstance. Mozart and Salieri, the arouse of a genius in the Court, the fertile and creative inspiration of Salzburg 's son is sculpted and showed with such freshness and naturalness that you may well think this could be the happy result of a successful transcription of an Operatic script into the screen.<br /><br />There is not any detail out of context. Tom Hulce in the role of his life and Murray Abraham as the pathetic Italian composer deserved him an Academy Award.<br /><br />The next January 27th 2006 the whole world will be celebrating the 250th anniversary of this notable composer. And in this sense the renowned Concert Halls all over the world, from the Royal Festival Hall to Carnegie Hall to the most discrete theaters will show us the music of this genius , a true artistic patrimony of the mankind.<br /><br />So it results more than desirable to begin with this memorable homage ito Mozart 's memory and his invaluable musical legacy, that should be listened far beyond this extraordinary date.
B000065U1N|4.0|When the world could no longer watch the genocide of Somalia by internal warring tribes, the United States and the U.N. stepped in to referee the conflict. President Clinton ordered Rangers and Special Forces into the fray to control the bloodshed. Using lightly-armored, fast-response teams, the brave American servicemen found themselves outgunned and out-numbered at the point of conflict.<br /><br />The heroism of these brave warriors in the face of overwhelming odds will put a lump in your throat. Well-acted, scripted and written, Black Hawk Down is a disturbing rear-view look into a not-so-successful policy which caused many deaths and injuries to some of America's bravest souls. It also should give pause to policy-makers who set our sons and daughters in harm's way without sufficient armor or battle plan. But it probably won't.<br /><br />Black Hawk Down is more than an action film. It is an exclamation point to a failed foreign policy operation. One wonders if this set the stage, in some way, for America's passive response in Rwanda and other African conflicts.
B00000DLVA|3.0|I have only ever hear the Cardy's on the radio. I borrowed this from the library as I wasnt that confident to buy it. Sure, she has a sexy voice that can transform a dull song into bedtime listening!!! <br /> <br />I am writing this review for only one reason though. Explode/Implode... ermmm... how they didnt get sued for copying Stairway To Heaven I will never understand. <br /> <br />One more reason, Erase/Rewind - great track. The rest of the album is listen and shelve it. <br /> <br />Cheers <br />
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I loved the movie JAWS. I saw this movie with my grandpa when I was about 12 years old. It scared the crap out of me at first. Now that i am 14, the movie is just awesome and well put together. I think after 30 years, this movie is still really amazing. Not to mention that the \\"fake\\" shark (also called Bruce by Steven Spielberg) Only worked for about 5 minutes to 6 seconds on a normal film day. It is so cool to watch the movie that pretty much catapolted the three main actors, and Spielberg's carrier. I reccommend this movie. But, don't show this movie to the littler kids, unless you like them seeing lots of blood and hearing swear words. Also, one kid gets eaten. I think everyone should see this movie.        And for all you shark lovers information. I am fasinated by sharks, this movie made me want to learn more about them. So, if you watch this movie, don't think this is what sharks are really like. I think Spielberg made this a film from the book, becaus he thought it would make a good story. What do you know, it became the first summer blockbuster. There is my opinion.
B00070Q7VO|1.0|I have this Japanese restaurant I like (a lot) near my workplace that assaults my ears with M Buble CD's during my lunch... What a horrid way to ruin a dining experience for a customer.  I can't believe how terrible the arrangements are! This muses is boring, mutinous, predictable, and just plain irritating
B0000C0FJB|5.0|Back in 2002, I was smart enough to catch Rush at the Arco Arena in Marysville, CA at the start of the second leg of their Vapor Trails tour. It had been twenty-one years since I had last seen Rush live - on the first night of the Moving Pictures tour back in 1981! - and I was really looking forward to seeing how my favorite band had progressed over those two decades. As soon as I got to my seat and took a look at the stage, I knew I was in for a real treat because set up at Geddy Lee's spot at stage right were three clothes dryers! \\"Yep,\\" I thought to myself, \\"the guys are still nutjobs and this is gonna be one show that I'll never forget.\\" And, of course, Rush came out, put on a super performance, and proved me right. Fast forward to 2003 and, when I heard about the release of Rush In Rio, my first thought was \\"Who could forget those dryers?\\" Well, now the answer is \\"anyone who owns Rush In Rio (the DVD) can't!\\" How cool is that? Pretty damned, I say. <br /> <br />But I digress; down to the meat and potatoes. Rush In Rio is Rush's latest live release that documents the last concert of the Vapor Trails tour in Rio de Janeiro Brazil, available in 3-CD and 2-DVD sets. Nutbag that I am, I went straight out and got both sets, and I'm glad I did. Both sets are great, each in their own way, but mostly as a record of Rush's inspired performance that night - the guys really rocked! <br /> <br />Each set contains a couple of gems unique to its format; the CD has two \\"board bootleg\\" songs recorded at other concerts during the tour (\\"Between Sun And Moon\\" and \\"Vital Signs,\\" which I heard in Marysville in lieu of \\"New World Man\\" and \\"Closer To The Heart\\"), while the DVD has two \\"easter eggs\\" to be hunted down (the \\"By-Tor & The Snow Dog\\" animation and a 1975 performance of \\"Anthem\\"). The DVD also features the \\"Boys In Brazil\\" documentary of Rush's three dates in Brazil. Intimate and informative, \\"Boys In Brazil\\" includes interviews and travelogues from Lee, Lifeson, and Peartthat provide an \\"insider's view\\" of the events that transpired during the Brazil stint and a further glimpse into the band's personalities. Extra kudos to Rush for their \\"can do\\" attitudes by playing during a tropical storm - you can actually see the rain and the wind - at the Sao Paulo show! <br /> <br />I do have a couple of gripes with Rush In Rio. First, the sound on the DVD set actually surpasses that of the CD's. For some reason, the CD sound is murky and bottom heavy, and takes some of the edge off of the guitars and drums. But the DVD is a completely different matter, as the sound is mixed (probably due to the DTS recording equipment) more in the mid range. As a result, all instruments and performances are crystal clear, and the overall sound is genuinely representative of a concert experience. Second, the editing is occasionally baffling. The quick cuts between Lee, Lifeson, and Peart nicely support the momentum of the performances, but there are several instances where the shot is not fixed on the appropriate player, such as focusing on Neil Peart during a crucial Alex Lifeson solo. <br /> <br />Conspicuously absent is any complaint about Rush selling us the same old set list. Yeah, almost all of Rush In Rio was heard on prior live releases, but never like this. That's because Rush found a previously untapped fan base in Brazil, an incredibly enthusiastic multitude that demonstrated their love for Rush by showing up in huge numbers (60,000 in Sao Paulo, the Rush attendance record) and in turn inspired the band to really play their hearts out. Which probably wasn't hard to do; the fans practically worshipped the band, were quite vocal in their appreciation that Rush chose to visit Brazil, knew the words to all the songs - even the girls, for crying out loud - and even sang along during the instrumentals \\"YYZ\\" and \\"La Villa Strangiato.\\" Now, who wouldn't be inspired by that? A very special night, indeed, and the Brazilian throng had no problems with the \\"oldstandards\\" (so what if it was the first time they'd heard Rush live?), so why should we? A non-issue, sez me. <br /> <br />Rush fans like me, are already streaming into the stores to get Rush In Rio and, entre nous, you should, too. During a candid moment in \\"The Boys In Brazil\\", Alex Lifeson admits that this might have been \\"the last time (he) get(s) to play these songs\\" and given Rush's long history, there might be some truth in that statement. If that should prove to be the case, then Rush In Rio might just be the finest of swansongs - but let's hope not. Instead, look at it this way: Rush In Rio is a gloriously rocking document of what might just be the pinnacle of Rush's career and, to my mind, the best rock release - prog or otherwise - of 2003. Truly, a Must Have! <br /> <br />
B00003CXA2|1.0|This has to be the most overrated movie of all time. How people were so easily lassoed into its cheap sentimentality and utter banality is beyond understanding. Forrest is supposed to represent the simple kindness we all have inside of us, and its told to us in the movie with all the subtly of a sledgehammer. The scene of Forrest running and his leg braces breaking into pieces is particularly heavy-handed and laughable. Movies like this pander to artificial Hallmark-like sentimentality and makes the characters and situations as deep and fulfilling as a damp dish rag. The rambling tour through the decades, where Forrest is computer enhanced into various events in history, seems more forced and corny than remotely believable. And the whole \\"make lemonade out of lemons\\" psychobabble spewed throughout the film is more insulting than encouraging: in real life, most people hardly get the opportunities to make a drop of lemonade, let alone go through all the historical extravagances that Forrest does. Shameless, sappy, boring, and clumsy, FORREST GUMP (a Best Picture winner, no less!) is an insult to any humane human. <br />
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Whether youre a Pink Floyd fan or not(and I really wasnt until now), this video presentation of the legendary rock group is an absolute must see.     I have been to many a great rock concert in my time, but never have I seen or heard such a finley tuned musical mix of radically honest social commentary and extraordinary visual entertainment.     Its amazing how the members of Pink Floyd and their producers/directors etc., successfully blends sad historical social realisms with a prophetic insight of what could become of this world we live in; yet it is entertining to the extreme. When you see this video, youll realize that its like a plasma charged documentary about the injustices of past and recent govenments, the highs and lows of the drug culture, stark opinions about high society and deep insights to the basic truths of the human condition all wrapped in to a techno-luminary visual and sound extravaganza. Thankfully, Pink Floyd doesnt shove this in your face, rather,there is a nice steady pulse when there should be, and pounding ones when appropriate. Many of the visuals are presented with keen likenesses to Pink Floyds brilliantly developed lyrical metaphors that actually make you laugh at times and really think at others...(see the segment Dark Side of the Moon.)     Its all beautifully mixed and bundled together with Gilmore and Cos famous musical scores, deeply profound psychological lyrics and emotionally charged psychodelic visual story telling. The awesome stage videos(presented inside of a gigantic revolving hoop)lighting and laser effects galore and superb sound mixing propel this concert event into a class all its own.     Pink Floyd Pulse is an eye and mind blowing theatrical experience that will take you through time, space and history in one of the most unique and brilliant ways ever produced in a concert setting. So pop in the video, turn out the lights, turn up the sound and dont take your pulse while watching this. David Gilmour is at his absolute best along with the Floyd gang and the light show is unbeatable.     5+ Stars.    NOW PLEASE RELEASE PINK FLOYD THE WALL LIVE DVD IN 2006!!!!!
0307236722|5.0|This book contains some of the best receipes.  I've used so many cookbooks but have never seen one like this.   <br /> <br />Martha Stewart and her team have created a book not only for beginning bakers but also long time bakers.  It includes tips and tricks that will make baking much more simple.  Each receipe is EASY, yes easy, and turns out wonderful.  There is almost no room to mess up in these recipes, so the end result is beautfiul and delicious.  You must try the cakes when you buy the book, they're to die for.
B00009RAJJ|1.0|It's hard to believe this is the same band that recorde the great RUMORS album. IN TUSK , we've got 20 of the most pedestrian, boring and obnoxious kind of pop ever written by a major. I can't repeat it enough, the songs are BORING, lifeless, the arrangments are poor. IT's a very bad album, on of the wrost albums of the vast Fleetwood Mac's catalogue. yet somehow it became a cult album. Go figure...
1559408855|1.0|David Cronenberg's film Videodrome was right: pretty soon people will be wanting to watch movies of pure torture, with no redeeming values what so ever. Im sure I'll get o out of 137 people finding this review helpful, and that sickens me. In my opinion, movies like this are bad for your mind. The whole movie is a bunch of innocent teenagers being torured, raped, molested, disembowled, and wirse things of which I won't even describe. I can't believe people enjoy this movie. Im not trying to insult anyone, im just trying to get people to realize that they are enjoying a movie about kids being tortured and sodomized. Im not some fanatical christian, or over protective parent, Im just a college kid whose worried about what movies like this do to people's minds.
0671027387|3.0|Though I found the writing of this novel to be very easy to read, and the pace enjoyable, there was depth lacking in the story that made it short a few stars.<br /><br />The characters were not well developed enough to understand their motives. Throw away lines and nasty, two-dimensional politics form a backbone of the story that left me, as a reader, wishing for something more substantial.<br /><br />The scientific plot was absolutely cool, and the resolution thereof had enough twists and turns to make me happy, though.<br /><br />A book that's a quick read, but won't leave you wondering about it, as angels and demons did (for me, anyhow).<br /><br />(*)>
B00070Q7VO|4.0|His debut album was better? <br />Some says but I admit his growth in artistic way as a vocalist. <br />Have happy holiday with good old and new music with his vocal! <br />By the way, why \\"Spider-man's Theme\\" is released as maxi single only?
B00005JMAH|4.0|I agree with most reviews but i think Alfonso Cuarn Just went a little to dark, i mean hogswarts was falling apart, come on! I understand darker, a bit older and musty just because it's POA in which the book is but it's like this year clases were in somekind of acient ruin's not a school where magical studies are commited,and the Hogwarts grounds look very chaotic not like the first parts which seem to be a well organized, i think weather and outdoor efect were really good in acordance to the book, the fog, the rain, etc. Well aside from hogwarts looking like a graveyard i think it was well done.Just hope that for GOF we dont get too Bright and Happy (HP 1,2) or the Dark Graveyard (3)... and lupin tranformation sucked big time worst werewolf i've ever since ok i get the werewolves isn't synonymous with fur but that blue-grayish hairless Mexican dog craked me up.
B00000JHAU|5.0|I have been listening to Belle and Sebastian for quite some time now. I have managed to get my hands on every album they have released. This album \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" is by far their best album. The elaborate musical arrangements and the melancholy vocals are wonderful. It is very difficult to put into words how great this album is. So just purchase it and listen for yourself!  <br />
B000B7BRMM|5.0|For all of you that have problems with the sexy marketing of Diana, I think it would be best to simply lighten up and celebrate the wonderful festive music on the CD.  Do the sexy poses really take anything away from the great music?  And it's not like this is anything new.  Check out the Julie London record covers from 50 years ago. Let the girl be glamorous and let the music speak for itself.  And the music is swinging!!  Man, I can hardly sit still during the fast paced numbers and the slow ones are \\"sitting by the fire with your sweetheart\\" kind of music.  I do wish there was at least one song that refered to the reason for the season but you can't have everything.  \\"Count your Blessings\\" is a nice treat at the end of the album and nicely captures the reflections, hopes and dreams of the season.  Buy this.  You won't be sorry.  Maybe some of you could just put a plain brown wrap around the cover and dig the music.  As for me, I really don't mind looking at a pretty girl in a christmas dress.
0385338082|3.0|I think Sophie Kinsella found inspiration for this book \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" from her much earlier publication of another title under her real name of Madeleine Wickham. As some of you may know by now, Sophie Kinsella is her pen name. <br /> <br />In \\"The Wedding Girl\\" by Madeleine Wickham, secrets abound among many characters. In one sub-plot, there is a secondary character who is a much younger lady who falls for a much older man. Emma Corrigan and Jack Harper must have sprung forth from this liasion in this earlier book \\"The Wedding Girl\\" as the teasing is very similar to that of the yound lady & much older man seen in \\"The Wedding Girl\\". <br /> <br />The treatment of secrets is more frivolous in \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\" whereas in \\"The Wedding Girl\\" its more rooted in reality. <br /> <br />So for those of you curious enough to find out about Sophie Kinsella earlier books, I mean Madeleine Wickham then read \\"The Wedding Girl\\" to continue with her secrets theme.
0876852630|5.0|I've read most of Bukowski's work. In my humble opinion this is Bukowski at his bare-knuckle best. You can sense the desperation in his writing. He's young and hungry. Still a contender. I wonder what happened to the elf. I think that I worked with him at Harris Bakery in Maine many years ago.
0552997692|5.0|If you don't know, Madeleine Wickham is the real name for Sophie Kinsella (pen name). Yeap, the one who wrote the highly successful Shopaholic series. Under her real name of Madeleine Wickham, she wrote several books which have more substance than the frothy ones under Sophie Kinsella. That's why she used a pen name to keep her styles of writing apart.    The Wedding Girl is one such book with much meaty substance. She must have germinated her ideas for \\"Can you Keep A Secret?\\" which she wrote later under Sophie Kinsella from this earlier book, The Wedding Girl.     Are secrets better left unearthed or are they better off exposed to those that concern you? How would it affect relationships that have formed preconceived set values and change the dynamics? Will it be the same? That is the recurring fear harboured by Milly Havill who got married for a frivolous reason 10 years ago and now has to un-do that marriage in order to marry the person she truly loves.    Familiarity breeds contempt within the family. This is the ongoing theme in the book, you think you know someone too well and you begin to perform selective memory. You  only bring up characteristics that you dislike about them which becomes all too consuming for you and bury their good points fathoms deep. That is until someone from outside your immediate family brings to you a new perspective on their characters.     The author deftly handles the multitude of secrets harboured by several characters. The secrets harboured here are definitely more grounded in reality than those in \\"Can You Keep A Secret?\\".    Read it or you will miss out on a much earlier Sophie Kinsella very sophisticated story telling skills!!!
B0007P3582|1.0|alright when i first listened to 50 cent(which was get rich or die tryin) i thought he was a alright rapper with tight beats, ok flows, and got dr. dre on his beats, and eminem for support and frienship. i thought he was gonna be a really good rapper. at the time people were always talkin about how tight he was and his flows. so when tha massacre came out i was hella excited to get it. i bought it and 50 cent has 22 songs(one is the intro)and they are all tha same to me. same topics, no new ryhmes, same words, and is it me or do i feel he doesnt open his mouth when he raps. let me tell ya this is ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!!!!!!!! Personally i feel he is ruinin hip hop. I really wished eminem did not sign him. because we have to deal wit g-unit. also all of the g-unit rappers is better than 50 lyrical wise.

6305320802|5.0|It is one of my favourite musicals, I first saw this show,when I was aged 9, 7th Sept 1957 at the Prince of Wales Theatre in Hobart, Tasmania, Australia. I enjoyed most of the songs. I had a crush on the short blonde hair dancer-Virginia Bosler I think, if wrong please correct me. Favorite songs- Surrey with the Fringe On Top, Farmer and The Cowman, I recently purchased the WScreen version, with the missing 12 minutes, brought back memories-great stuff-fantastic. <br />I can't wait for the 50 Anniverary Edition. <br />Kindest Regards <br />Peter J Barr

0783114893|5.0|I just saw this movie last week on AMC and I was surprised at how good it was!  Normally I don't watch many movies from the 80's, because they're kind of dated (I mostly grew up in the 90s), but this one could have taken place in any year.  It's about a kid (C. Thomas Howell) who is driving from Chicago to San Diego.  Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, he picks up a hitch-hiker (Rutger Hauer) to keep himself from falling asleep at the wheel.  Almost as soon as the hitcher gets into the car, you know that something is not right.  You later find out that he cuts off the limbs of the people that pick him up.  The kid is able to throw him out of the car and thinks he is free of that psycho when a station wagon with the hitcher inside passes his car on the interstate.  Throughout the rest of the movie, the hitcher plays mind games with the kid and won't let him go until he is pushed to his breaking point.  This movie is so good because it keeps you on the edge of your seat, wanting to see what happens next.  What is also great is that you see hardly any blood and guts.  It is scarier when the gruesome scenes are only implied.  I absolutely love this movie!
B000002C1W|4.0|First of all....Who cares if Waters is or isn't in the band?  The band carried on after Syd left, why can't they do the same after Roger.  They were both talented people and both couldn't handle the floyd, so let it be.  Nextly I'd like say this is a good album.  The music is so real, maybe too 80's at times, but a little of that is okay now and then.  <br /> <br /> I do wonder why Rick Wright (the keyboardist) was left out of the album picture?  He is mentioned in the credits so I found it odd.  It did have Nick and David though...curious.  If anyone has any ideas tell me....please.
0385510454|1.0|John Grisham has written two books worth reading: The Firm and The Pelican Brief and maybe The Client. Every book since then has been amateurish at best and just plain tedious. This one follows suit. My sense is that Grisham knows that if a book comes out with his name on it, he will put another several hundred thousand dollars in the bank. So he goes through the motions of writing something that the gullible will buy. Good for him, but not so good for us. I am sure that if this were his first book and he was an unknown, it would not have gotten published. This book has only the sketchiest plot and what there is of it is basically silly. The characters are cliches at best and completely unbelievable otherwise. The story development is pedestrian and uncreative. At least there was no religion in this one (see The Testament and The Street Lawyer). I really wish Grisham would get back to the form of the two books listed above. Then he would be worth reading again. I think I am going to give up on this guy. There are too many other good authors to read.
B000AARKOO|5.0|. . .by trying to describe it. Seeing as how so many other people have already done such a good job at doing just that. But I will give you my opinion. <br /> <br />I am well versed in the history of the Crusades. This movie is more historically accurate then most hollywood films based on historical events (which is usually accurate on some of the larger things, but not the details). It had a lot of the details down right or close (also quite a few wrong, but nothing that big). It gave a good impression of the politics that was going on during the Crusades. <br /> <br />Whether Orlando Bloom was the right actor for his role, is debateable. He did a good portrayal in my opinion. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this movie!
6302886228|5.0|WHat are you guys at SONY waiting to release this title on DVD? <br />For such \\"Powerful\\" people, one must think that clearing the path for this should not be such a hard thing. <br />I would pay, any reasonable amount to own this concert on DVD. DO IT!
B0006213WG|5.0|I first heard Sum 41 with there release \\"All Killer, No Filler\\". Which was a good album, but I always found to have a few \\"Filler\\" songs in it. Very entertaining album, nonetheless. <br /> <br />Then they released \\"Does this look Infected?\\". I found that album to be a major letdown. It had a FEW really good songs on it, the rest weren't even filler songs, just boring garbage. I expected that to be the last I heard of them. <br /> <br />With \\"Chuck\\" I can say, its a great album, from begining to end. It starts off rocking really hard at the start, then midway through the album, it mellows down. Its usually an album I like to put on, in my weekly poker games. <br /> <br />Highly recommended!
B000AJJNPY|1.0|I am big fan of all of Sigur Ros  Material, but when I first I heard this album, with my headphones and volume perfectly <br />prepared for a pure delight, I was very dissapointed. Sure there are some interesting sounds here and there, but nothing that really grabs you like their earlier work.I guess I'll just <br />get out all of my Mogwai and Godspeed albums again. There were many great bands playing this post-rock type music before Sigur Ros appeared on the scene. Maybe a little less PR and more artistic concentration. Thanks for being interested enough to read this.
B0000CABBW|5.0|Two of 2003's best movies were filmed in New Zealand. Both featured great creatures and small heroes, and both ended with exotic ships sailing into the sea.  But there the similarities end.  For one was the grand, multiple-Oscar winning, special-effects laden, fantasy epic \\"The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.\\"  The other was \\"Whale Rider,\\" a relatively low-budget picture about a Maori girl coming of age. Both films are equally astonishing in their own ways. <br /> <br />Paikea (Keisha Castle-Hughes) is a girl who survives the deaths of both her mother and twin brother during childbirth.  While the family grieves, Paikea's grandfather, Koro, suffers an additional loss, for Paikea's twin brother was the expected male heir to the family's noble line of prophets, who descended from a legendary \\"Whale Rider.\\"  The rest of the film deals with the complicated family dynamic between Paikea, Koro, and Paikea's father, Porourangi, who resents Koro's old-fashioned ways and flees to Germany to pursue a career as an artist.  Paikea comes to realize the importance of her family's legacy, and struggles to achieve it while also striving for the affection and acceptance of her grandfather. <br /> <br />The driving force behind \\"Whale Rider\\" is a brilliant performance by first-time actress Keisha Castle-Hughes as Paikea.  Before seeing \\"Whale Rider,\\" I was astonished that she was nominated for an Oscar; after seeing it, I wished she would have won.  The supporting cast is uniformly strong; special mention goes to Rawiri Paratene, who deftly navigates Koro's conflicting feelings for Paikea.  The story is simple enough, but populated with profound themes on familial relationships, issues of gender equality, and environmental concerns.  Director Niki Caro wisely avoids overindulging in location photography; she captures the Maori milieu as much from the faces of her actors as from their surroundings.  <br /> <br />\\"Whale Rider\\" succeeds on many levels: it's epic and intimate,exciting and educational, humorous and heartbreaking. I can't think of anyone whom I wouldn't recommend it to.
B000003N7K|5.0|This album is off the scale, rating it is like trying to rate something sacred. I noticed several reviews with four stars - are you joking? Unless you are Duke Ellington, you are not allowed to find fault with this work.. I doubt Duke would have anyhow. Incidentally, Esquire Magazine found this to be the best album of all time, which is enough to make me want to wretch - those self serving strivers have Billy Strayhorn spinning in his casket. This is purely about music, not cars, stars or here you ares.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin II (1969.), Led Zeppelin's second studio album<br /><br />At the end of the 1960's, Led Zeppelin burst onto the scene with a hard rocking, bluesy sound that was very revelatory at the time. The band's debut, released in January 1969 was a massive hit and multiple copies were sold in the first few months of its release. Following the debut, the band embarked on a large amount of touring during '69, especially in the USA. During this time, the band worked on laying down songs for a new album and they recorded these songs whenever they could whilst on the road touring. Led Zeppelin II was released in the October of 1969 and already had half a million advanced orders; listeners eager to see how good the band's follow up album was going to be.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin's debut was a classic and their second effort was no less. Led Zeppelin II is for me, the album which really consolidated and established the band. Led Zeppelin II proved the band were no fluke. The album effectively continues in the same hard rocking vein as the first album. There's plenty of blues in there (i.e. 'Lemon Song') and theres plenty of songs with real attitude (i.e. Whole Lotta Love). It is quite hard to believe how good this album shapes up to be, given the erratic, stop-start way the album was recorded whilst the band were touring. With this album, Zeppelin managed the unique feat of producing two classic albums in a year. Led Zeppelin II is also the first album by the band to credit Robert Plant as a songwriter. However, that said, you can see a much greater maturity in his vocals and songs such as 'What Is And What Should Never Be' as well as 'Thank You' show his tender songwriting abilities. Jimmy Page showcases his genius again on this album with frequent stunning guitar play, as does John Paul Jones with some more great bass lines. John Bonham is well ... himself as usual; his drumming on every Led Zeppelin album is nothing short of exceptional. Overall though, eventhough this album is strangely labelled as the band's first heavy album, I would personally say that it is not as heavy or raw as the first album; similarly it is less consistent in style. However, this doesn't detract from the album's overall standard; it is still classic material. The album afterall has shifted millions of copies and stayed 100+ weeks in the album chart. The 'Brown Bomber' cover for this album is afterall instantly recognisable.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin's second album starts off with one of the all time famous riffs. The riff to 'Whole Lotta Love' is even recognisable by people who don't listen to Led Zeppelin, its that famous. That said, this hard rocking song is a classic.

The furious pace then settles down a little for 'What Is And What Should Never Be', my personal favourite track on the album. Dreamy verses to this song contrasted by a classic hard-rocking chorus make this track a great one. The surprise guitar entry at the end of the track is brilliant. Still fully acknowledging their blues roots, Led Zeppelin jam out the 'Lemon Song' next. Originally titled 'Killing Floor', the song features some excellent bass hooks and some catchy guitar work.

B000002J1U|4.0|Led Zeppelin III (1970.), Led Zeppelin's third studio album<br /><br />In 1969, Led Zeppelin became practically an overnight sensation with their first two albums which were hard-rock blues classics. Led Zeppelin's popularity meant that their third album was easily one of the most anticipated albums of 1970. Many fans assumedly were expecting another heavy blues effort from the band in a similar vein to their first two albums. However, fans couldn't have been further off the mark with their guess. Led Zeppelin, being a band who like to diversify/experiment (or at least, we know now in retrospect), produced an album quite different in sound from the first two. Instead of a multitude of songs with crushing electric guitar melodies, the band put out an album which was largely acoustic and folk based. Fans were actually quite shocked by this and many didn't quite know what to make of it. As a result, Led Zeppelin III has grown to be one of Led Zeppelin's more underrated albums, but is this truly a deserved reflection?<br /><br />For me, eventhough I don't regard this album as being quite on the level of the first two Led Zeppelin albums, Led Zeppelin III is an excellent album. I personally completely agree with what Led Zeppelin did with using acoustic ideas for this album. Led Zeppelin, being the groundbreaking band they are, were hardly going to settle back and keep to exactly the same hard-rock and blues formula throughout their careers. In that respect, the acoustic based album was one that they were destined to make. Saying that, fans should have been only too aware of Jimmy Page's taste for acoustic play, given he'd employed it with the Yardbirds and in songs on the first two albums such as 'Ramble On'. Page was hardly going to restrict his adept guitar play to his Gibson Les Paul electric guitar. That said though, this album still has its more rocking moments. Songs such as 'Immigrant Song' and 'Out On The Tiles' are heavier efforts and the blues of 'Since I've Been Loving You' is classic early Zeppelin style. However, aside from this, the album is mostly acoustic and is very much a chilled out affair which you can really relax to.<br /><br />'Immigrant Song' is the album's short but powerful opener. I would even go as far to say this is Led Zep's most aggressive opening track that they put on their albums. The strong rolling riffs and Plant's foreboding wails with lyrics about Viking raiders give this song a steely edge. The classic opener then runs into 'Friends' and the acoustics begin. This is a great track, with a catchy melody. The exit to the track has a string group in the background; a great idea to finish the track. Following this is a return to the hard rocking vein of things with 'Celebration', an upbeat song with a racing riff. Then we come to 'Since I've Been Loving You'. There is only one word for this track ... AWESOME. This is for me, the best blues styled song that Led Zeppelin ever made. Page's guitar melodies are awesome, as is the organ accompanyment played by John Paul Jones. Plant sings out heartwrenching lyrics that powerfully resonate through this 7 minute masterpiece. Next up, to finish the first half of the album is 'Out On The Tiles'; a gritty hard rocker with lots of energy. It has a similar feel to 'Good Times, Bad Times' from the first album.<br /><br />For the second half of the album, we hit acoustic sounds full on. The first of these is 'Gallows Pole', a folk traditional arranged by Page. More nifty guitar work accompanies Plant singing about a man being hanged. The song gathers speed progressively and it builds into a great climax. 'Tangerine' is a chilled out acoustic gem with a dreamy quality. Then comes 'Thats The Way', the third masterpiece track of the album, after 'Immigrant Song' and 'Since I've Been Loving You'. The acoustic riff is timeless; this is a folk-based masterpiece. Plant sings this song with amazing vocal control. 'Bron Yr Aur Stomp' is an acoustic sing along, the titleinspired by a cottage in Wales. It has some great grooves and is an enjoyable listen. Sadly though, the last track, 'Hats Off To Roy Harper' leaves a lot to be desired. The scratchy guitar play and disjointed vocals just leaves me thinking 'URGHHHHHH'. I could never get into this song and is probably the only Zep tune that I can't listen to. The b-side masterpiece song 'Hey Hey What Can I Do' should have been on here instead, or indeed 'Travelling Riverside Blues'. Had either track have been included instead of 'Hats Off' I would have given this album 5 stars.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin III is an excellent change of style by the band. Sadly it didn't please all fans at the time of its release (though most were won back with the follow up in Led Zeppelin IV) but for me, and any of the open minded fans of the band, this is an excellent effort. Eventhough this is by far not the band's best work, it is still an undeservedly underrated album. I would personally recommend this Led Zeppelin album to any new fan of the band looking for more beyond the hard-rocking stuff or any open minded listener in general.e title inspired by a cottage in Wales.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|I came to know them while being in Australia when meeting my Icelandic girlfriend at the time... she gave me as a present Agaetis Byrjun. When I played it, it was the most beautiful and soothing sound I had ever heard. The brilliantness of Staralfur made me feel a chill through my bones and Vidrar put tears in my eyes the very first time I heard it. I couldn't believe how it was possible that people produced such beautiful sounds. Their music made me dream, made me feel. Music is not music if you can't feel it and Sigur Rs's sound makes you drift away to a different world. A world different from us, a wolrd only possible when listening to these beautiful sounds. <br /> <br />Then ( ) came into the light. It was completely different from Agaetis. More sober, more obscure bust just as beautiful. Untitled #1 is haunting and despite everyone saying that it is kind of depressing, I find it highly cheerful and happy. Another song that when the moment is right brings tears into my eyes. <br /> <br />But Takk... Takk... is heaven. Takk's sound is the most cheerful album the band has ever made. The striking intro to Glsli and how the song delivers its climax is brilliant. Takk is beautiful, Takk is celestial voices. Takk's beauty cannot be described with words. Hoppippolla follows with a piano arrangement that goes deep into the mind to explore and to illuminate even the most darkest of caves. For myself, I can't help but shed some tears everytime I hear this album.. it doesn't matter which song because every single one is absolutely brilliant and beautiful in its own way. Takk is a celebration for life, a celebration for all the beautiful things that are present in this world. Even people who are not Sigur Rs fans will find this album highly listenable and enjoyable.  <br /> <br />Takk will be hard to top... everytime I listen to it, I cannot satisfy myself with any other type of music. It's just that beautiful. The best disc so far, and for me, one of the greatest of all time by one of the most incredible groups ever to be present on this earth. Who would say that this foursome who play the guitar with violin bows, the bass with drum sticks and uses xylophones and bells would produce the most beautiful sounds of the earth?
B0007YMUZW|2.0|If you're looking for more upbeat Ryan Adams' songs like New York, New York....well, look elsewhere.  This album is so mellow it's depressing.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|In this age of mediocre music, it is good to have these gods of rock come back together and show that they still have it, in spades to show the world how it is done. Every tune on this CD is a winner, a classic, and well crafted. Clapton's licks are not drug laced, but are well honed with not only precision but passion. The same can be said for Jack Bruce and Ginger Baker on their instruments. Vocals are great and shared. Great harmonies on \\"Sleepy Time Time\\". <br /> <br />I'm so glad these guys got back together before the inevitable reaper takes them away, pun intended. I'm not much younger than they and it adds to my satisfaction that the late 60's - early 70's was indeed the classic age of rock and that I was a part of it. I will get the DVD and the LPs and pass them to posterity just as my Dad did for me with his great love for the big band sound. Long live Classic Rock!
B00097DXZS|5.0|With or without the content protection featured on the cd, the album is darn good. It makes no difference that you cant burn it. That should have no affect on your choice to buy it or not. The album is full of great songs - some that are more poppy, and some that go back to the source. Santana is a truly gifted man, and this album is a clear indication of his gift.
B0000C0FJB|5.0|There are two kinds of popular bands in this world. First are the bands that are overplayed on the radio, are seen all the time on TV, and churn out catchy pop songs like there is no tomorrow. They are rarely very musically talented, relying on catchy, but simple and repetitive beats.  <br /> <br />They also rarely write their own songs. They tour when they want to and make millions doing little. As the old Dire Straits song goes, these bands get their money for nothin' and their chicks for free. The other type of popular band is the type that you don't hear on the radio very much. They get their popularity by word of mouth and by their endless touring. They write their own songs, which are usually very intricate and thought-out. Their songs are very good, and are loved by all of their fans, but they are not cheesy or pop-catchy enough to become radio super-hits. But all-in-all, they are the bands that will stay together for years and continue to deliver great music, while their more popular counterparts tend to whither out after 5 or so years due to internal struggle for the limelight or other reasons.  <br /> <br />Rush, who have been churning out great songs and albums for the past thirty years is one of those latter bands. They are a trio of talented musicians and lyricists that known how to make their audiences and fans feel great. They work hard and play hard. Having seen them in concert for the first time a few days ago, I have to say that it was the best concert I have ever been to. I then went out the next day and purchased their live album, \\"Rock in Rio\\". They are the only band I have ever seen live that did not have an opening act.  <br /> <br />Instead of having an opening act that played for 45 minutes, then have 15 minutes between bands, and then come out and play for an hour and a half, Rush just came right out and started rocking. They continued doing so for the next three hours. They have to have the most stamina of any band.  <br /> <br />Having seen them in concert one day and then buying and listening to their live album the next, I have to say that \\"Rock in Rio\\" truly captures the band as they are onstage. The THREE disc set is exactly what Rush sounds like in person. They don't sound like middle-aged men who make the oldies touring circuit every summer to pay the bills. They, instead, sound like they are 25 again and vying for their time in the sun. They blaze through their songlist as if it was their only concert, even though this was actually their last date of their 2002 tour.  <br /> <br />They sound amazing as they evenly let their respective instruments complement each other instead of overwhelm each other. Geddy Lee plays the bass as well as he ever did, as a bass beat is often the centerpiece of Rush's songs. Alex Lifeson is awesome, as he always has been, on guitar, playing like his last name was Van Halen. And the true star of the band, Neil Peart, plays the drums better than probably any drummer out there. He has a truly amazing drum solo on the CD that will blow you away. He was even better when I saw him in concert with about 100 types of drums around him. He truly looked and sounded like he lived behind those drums.  <br /> <br />The band gets the audience rocking with a huge set of some of their best hits, both old and new. The only difference with my concert experience and the \\"Rock in Rio\\" CD was about 40,000 people. On the CD you can hear all 40,000 singing along with almost every song. I have heard many live albums, but I have never heard anything like this before. On the opening and most popular track, \\"Tom Sawyer\\", Geddy might as well have just held off on his singing, as the whole Rio crowd sings along as loud as they can through the whole song! Other popular classics, especially, were sung along to as if these people were singing to God himself. Songs such as \\"New World Man\\", \\"Distant Early Warning\\", \\"Big Money\\", \\"Closer to the Heart\\", \\"Red Sector A\\", \\"Spirit of Radio\\", \\"Limelight\\",and \\"Working Man\\" are all sung with the fervor of youth by the band and the audience alike. These songs sound as good or better on this live album than on their respective studio releases. Along with these timeless classics are some of Rush's newer material, such as \\"Earthshine\\",  <br />\\"Secret Touch\\", and \\"One Little Victory\\". All of these new songs will become classics in time. Not only does this live album contain many of Rush's greatest vocal hits, it also contains many of their amazing instrumental songs. These include \\"YYZ\\", \\"O Baterista\\", and \\"La Villa Strangiato\\".  <br /> <br />Overall, this album truly captures the essence, sound, and feel of a Rush concert, unlike many other live albums. I would have to say that this rates right up there with Kiss' \\"Alive!\\" album as being one of the greatest live recordings of all time. Hopefully it will help usher in a new era of Rush fans, as from what I saw of them live and what you can hear on this mind blowing CD nirvana, they are far from retirement.  <br />
B00005JNJV|4.0|The origins of Batman are explored in this fine fifth installment of the Batman series.  Young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) tumbles down an abandoned well on his family's property.  While in the well, he is set upon by a group of angry bats. After some time, Bruce is finally rescued by his father, but he now has a terrible fear of bats.  Later, Bruce witnesses the horrible murder of his mother and father. Years later and still shaken from the death of his parents, Bruce ventures abroad to learn the means to fight injustice and turn fear against those who prey on the fearful. <br /> <br />Bruce meets Henri Ducard (Lian Neeson)a member of a secret society known as the League of Shadows.  Henri trains Bruce in fighting injustice , but some of their methods seem very extreme. These methods will show up later in the film. <br /> <br />Bruce returns to Gotham city to find it a cesspool for crime bosses and wrong-doers.  Carmine Falcone (Tom Wilkinson) has managed to buy off most of the cops and judges in Gotham so his mob basically controls the town.  One of Falcone's thugs is doctor Jonathan Crane (Cillian Murphy).  Known as the \\"scarecrow\\", he has developed a gas that can poison people as well as Gotham's water supply.  Inhalig the gas can cause people to go insane. Crane is getting ready to unleash this gas on the citizens of Gotham. <br /> <br />Bruce decides that he must do something to help the people of Gotham.  He enlists the help of Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a techie who works at Wayne Enterprises.  He developed all kinds of cool gear, such as a kevlar suit and a high-performance ATV.  With Lucius' help, Bruce uses these items to give birth to Batman.  Even with all of this high-tech gear, will Batman be able to stop Carmine Falcone and the scarecrow before they destroy Gotham? <br /> <br />I enjoyed this movie a great deal.  The special effects are very good, and I enjoyed seeing how Bruce became Batman.  The acting, especially by Liam Neeson and Morgan Freeman, is superb.  I recommend this movie very highly.  Watch and see how a troubled child matures into a great crime-fighting superhero.
0307276902|5.0|Forget about the happy little outing to the dentist without anesthesia you all heard so much about... there are other very noteworthy and moving parts in this book.  I laughed hysterically and cried tears of sorrow AND almost wet my pants at the same time when Frey describes the \\"Bald Man\\" confessing his sins at the treatment center.   The puzzling part of what Frey does in this book is make himself a blank canvas.  In the begining he is quiet (gives one word answers),tough (has no problem with tackling people who get in his face) pukes a lot(and I mean a lot!)  doesn't offer too much of himself at first but pulls you along nicely until you get to the second half of the book when finally all the loose ends are tied  together and characters develope.  Every character Frey meets in treatment is presented with an uncanny description-some I thought I knew.  You will meet the devil himself at one point-  a red snake tatooed on his throat, smells of rot, has freshly amputated  arms and cries out for crank-if thats not scarey enough to keep you from drug addiction I don't know what is.....OH! I do know!-its Freys description of what is really in one of those boarded up buildings where people on the edge of sanity shoot up and smoke (whatever it is) that will eventually kill them.  Hold on to your hats folks-its' quite a ride. <br />Not too many people have rooted around in hell and turned and walked back  to write a book about it.  For those of us who wouldn't/couldn't/ didn't  go these extremes,  you will know what it is like-from begining to end-no detail spared.   The beauty of this story and Freys' sheer inner strength to just hold on with the help of some friends, in the face of his own addiction to drugs and alcohol.   Dont expect \\"Pulitzer Prize\\" but I believe  James Frey  delivered the goods here, - breaking through the stranglehold of addiction and I could /did relate.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|I thought Donnie Darko was a decent movie, and I can definitely understand how it became the cult classic it is. However, my personal opinion is that the movie is highly overrated by its followers. Though it brings up interesting questions, \\"Donnie Darko\\" doesn't really add anything to the floor.
B00003000M|1.0|This is, by far and away, the worst album ever made.  Anyone who loves and appreciates Bob's music and message of peace and happiness should avoid this album.  In one of the terrible songs, some stupid rapper actually starts talking about rocket launchers.  Rocket launchers?  What irrelevent bullsh*t!  This album is disrespectful towards the legend himself and his true fans.  It should be wiped off the face of the earth.  TERRIBLE!!
B00097DXZS|5.0|I just got the album and its great. All the guests really make it special. I love collaborations, and this one is chock full of 'em.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|First off let me say that when I heard about this movie I was SO excited!  Then when I saw it, I was NOT let down.  The treatment of the characters were respectful and stimulated my memories of the engrosing relationship we all had with them in the game.  I was (pleasantly) surprised that they basically gave more airtime to \\"hidden characters\\" Yuffie and Vincent, than more main characters like Cid and Barrett (remember wishing that Yuffie, Vincent and Cait Sith would appear in the \\"movie sequences\\" ingame?).  I'm not complaining however...Yuffie was my favorite next to Cloud! <br /> <br />I even experienced the same frusttration I had in the game that Tifa and Cloud never quite crossed that romance barrier(I was rooting for Tifa, not Aeris in the game...remember the \\"romance points?\\")   <br /> <br />Overall it was a turbo charged experience and JOY for any lover of the game. <br /> <br />HOWEVER... <br /> <br />I was watching it with my nephew who'd never played the game and he was utterly clueless the entire movie.  If this is going to be released in theaters, it's going to do monumentally poorly.  If you haven't played FFVII, you won't understand even the rudiments of what's going on.  In the end my nephew didn't like the movie feeling, \\"left out.\\"   <br /> <br />This movie is exclusively for the fans which I don't consider an overly bad thing, but a curious marketing decision.  With plot/character developement depending entirely on the memories of the viewer was a major contributer to the various complaints you'll hear about the limited plot and storyline. <br /> <br />If you played the game you will LOVE this.  If you did not, you might like it if you just enjoy fantastic computer animation and action sequences. <br /> <br />In closing.... <br />Up with Tifa! <br />Down with Aeris!
B00006F7XJ|4.0|Joe John Santafripponi's seal of approval. Absolute great guitar work and breathtaking instrumental passages make this CD worth looking into. Weak vocals bog down some of the songs but all is forgiven when the guitar takes over. I would love Camel to do another all instrumental album. These guys are symphonic masters.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hate myself.  I hate myself for not paying better attention when this series was alive, fresh on TV.  We American TV consumers are idiots, and we pay for it in talk shows and \\"reality\\" TV.<br /><br />Like many others here, I was captivated by the quirky ads for the film \\"Serenity.\\"  I was hooked from the first landing of that great little ship and crew.  I saw the movie again a couple of days later, which I rarely do.  A little web searching, and I found the DVD series.  I've just finished disc 3.<br /><br />This series (and related film, \\"Serenity\\") capture the best of what it is to be a human, and the worst.  In the persona of Capt. Mal Reynolds, Nathan Fillion plays the ultimate redemption tale; a man who has been on the right side and lost the battle, a man who has lost his faith yet remains good at the core just because.  The series teaches, with humor, drama and poignancy, what \\"love\\" really is.<br /><br />I thought I was just getting these for me.  My 17 year old, very cool football playing son ended up watching the whole series in one day while home sick from school.  He wanted to talk about some of the things he learned about people from the shows.<br /><br />I think his time was better spent that day watching \\"Firefly\\" than it was in school.
B000059XUP|2.0|Director Tim Pope's direction of the film could have been perhaps a bit better, but from a purely visual sense the movie is not without its strong points. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the strength of the story itself.  It would have been better not to have tied Mia Kirshner's \\"Sarah\\" character to the that of the first Crow film and the overall strength of the narrative (and especially the dialogue) left much to be desired. <br /> <br />And similar to what i said of Tim Pope's direction, i credit the actors for getting as much mileage and investing as much of themselves in the somewhat weak source material that was the script/screenplay for The Crow: City of Angels
B0002SROT0|5.0|Sadly, I didnt really get into Elliot until after his death.   Having previously heard a little from him, I saw this album and decided to pick it up, and was blown away.  The first time I listened, I didnt really get it, but each subsequent time I fell more into the music and somehow feel like this is his most soul-bearing work.  Its profound sadness is masked by a sometimes heavy electric foreground, but it resurfaces in numbers like 'last hour', 'twilight', and 'lets get lost'.  I love that his voice seems to haunt the music and enhance it at the same time.  This album just makes the sadness of his needless death that much more frustrating.  My favorite songs on this album are \\"Pretty (ugly before), and Twilight.
B000AY807Q|5.0|Neil Young: Prairie Wind (Limited Edition CD/DVD)...<br /><br />AUDIO DISC:<br /><br /> ...TRACK #1: The Painter ... A Slow One. A pleasant tune about inspiration and focus, responsibility and remembrance, reminiscent of 'Are You Ready For The Country?' from Harvest (and maybe 'Mansion On The Hill' from Ragged Glory). A nice, calm beat with lilting peddle-steel by Ben Keith in the left channel, and that broomstick-snare sound that keeps you in the mellow groove. Get prepared for the best, by-the-pot-belly-stove, intimate, acoustic, musical get-together you will have experienced in many a blue moon! You'll think that the whole cast of Northern Exposure might show up to sing along at any moment (as Neil's music fits right in with the atmosphere of that good old program)! This song sounds like it could have been a great Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young tune. It also kinda reminds me of the live version of 'On The Way Home' from 4 Way Street when Neil sings, \\"It's a long road...\\" It's got that 'and I miss you now' feel to it. I can't take this album out of my discman! I just want to keep on playing it. It's that great.<br /><br /> ... TRACK #2: No Wonder ... A Medium One. This one reminds me of the 'World On A String' vocal melody from Tonight's The Night. A haunting song, especially between the verses when Ben Keith is playing that spooky slide lick on that sweet and soulful peddle-steel guitar of his. This one sticks to your ribs. It's that good! This one could have been a real rocker. You really gotta give Neil Young credit for sticking to his guns and intentionally focusing on creating a folk-rock album instead of a Crazy Horse hard-rock album. Any of these songs could have been turned into rockers, but they would have lost the beauty created by this particular ensemble of musicians who are a huge part of Neil's past, present, and future. The magic of Harvest has been resurrected... and it even FEELS like the original Harvest - the album cover as well as the music! (In fact, if you go to Neil Young's website, NEIL'S GARAGE, you can even order a copy of the album as a Gatefold Double LP.) The vocal and organ interplay is beautiful. Another ecological manifesto; the theme echoes the same sentiments expressed in 'Be The Rain' from GREENDALE. 'SAVE ALASKA!' Captain Beefheart would be proud of this one, a song that partly serves to protect the beauty of what he calls \\"God's Golfball.\\" Indeed, the U.S. Senators are selling us ALL down the river, and the waters are in danger of being polluted even more because of the current, anti-environmental, political climate in Washington, D.C.. Right-On!, Neil Young, for expressing something we all feel so strongly. The fiddles at the end evoke the spirit of Native American Plains Indian music. Beautiful.<br /><br />...TRACK #3: Falling Off The Face Of The Earth ... A Slow One. This song showcases the sensitive side of Neil Young, up-close and personal. Wonderful harmony vocals that really add a touch of sweetness and airiness to the mix. In fact, the harmony vocals on this whole album are outstandingly beautiful. You hardly even notice that there's a back-up band playing behind Neil - and on this song, that's the way it should be. The words and the vocals are what matter the most here. It's like Neil is whispering a sweet song in your ear. (Thank God for quality mic-preamps and compressors!) Real intimate and pretty.<br /><br />...TRACK #4: Far From Home ... A Fast One. A rockabilly song with a good beat and tasty horns the way Van Morrison uses them; not overdone. Funky, dobro lap-steel work from Ben Keith on the left - with Piscean soul! (Yeah, that's right, you heard that word 'prairie' again in this song, too. Are you getting it yet?) Almost autobiographical. This one could have been on the This Notes For You album, or the Old Ways album, but it works better here. Come on, everybody! Let's get up and wag our tails!<br /><br />...TRACK #5: It's A Dream ... A Slow One. You'll swear Neil's gonnastart singing 'After The Gold Rush' when you hear the piano intro. Neil sings \\"on the roof\\" in that just-woke-up, slurry, 'Tonight's The Night' voice that kind of sounds like a sober Tom Waits. The strings are breathtakingly beautiful and echoe the string work on 'There's A World' from Harvest (the song, I believe, that Bob Dylan told Neil he thought was wonderful - or was that, 'A Man Needs A Maid'?) A song about days gone by and a way of life that has come to an end. Mayberry R.F.D. comes to mind. Neil was made for singing this kind of stuff. He loves both trains and Indians (even though it was the building of the railroads that was a major contributor to the destruction of the Indians' way of life), the real romantic character that he is. The beauty of the west comes to life!<br /><br />...TRACK #6: Prairie Wind ... A Medium One. Entering Dreamland - the way only Neil Young can take you there! The acoustic guitar is strumming hard on this one, and the harmonica blows out a funky melody. (You'll think of GREENDALE). Again, the harmony vocals really shine here. The organ on the right comes in at the right times, and there's also a very tasty tambourine on the right. (The high-end of the audio spectrum is so well-defined here that it makes you wonder if they are using Apogee analog-to-digital converters at Redwood Digital when they transfer the analog, multi-track masters into the digital domain. It sounds so real!) The image on the album cover comes from this song. At one point, the lyrics remind me of Pink Floyd's 'Learning To Fly' video - the first one - with the Native American Indian shaman teaching the young man how to fly in dreamtime. (Hey, Don Juan!) Neil's singing in that storytelling voice he can get into. Real cool. The brass is tasty and perfectly placed in the mix. I guess Neil wanted to keep this one authentic, down-home, and live-sounding, as he even left in what possibly sounds like a minor, guitar, chord-change flub-up after he sings, \\"I don't remember what he said.\\" I love the way he sings, \\"it may be a mirage.\\" This man has PASSION!<br /><br />...TRACK #7: Here For You ... A Slow One. This one has the feel of Old Ways, and could have been on that album. In fact, this whole album will remind you of Silver & Gold, Harvest Moon, Old Ways, Comes A Time, and Harvest - but, to me, it is closest in spirit and sound to the original Harvest and Comes A Time, which is really great if you love those records like I do. The harmonica is real pretty, and the peddle-steel on the left will soothe your aching bones and weary heart. Neil is singing like he's almost going to cry on the choruses: \\"You might say, I'm here for you.\\" It's real raw, like Joni Mitchell on her Blue album.<br /><br />...TRACK #8: This Old Guitar ... A Slow One. Man, if this don't sound just like 'Harvest Moon' with new words, I'll be damned! But hey, if Peter Townsend can milk the hell out of Tommy for all it's worth, who are we to judge Neil Young for recycling a good tune from his own repertoire? Even the piano riff on the right sounds similar. It works for me, and it's a great song. (Maybe this was Neil's intent all along? Frank Zappa called it: Conceptual Continuity! Hey, even Dave Grohl admitted that Nirvana's song, 'Rape Me', if I'm not mistaken, is the same lick as 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' only inverted.) Even the intentional flub-up that Neil puts in after he sings, \\"searched for gold,\\" is there to add perfection to the lyric of the song when Neil then sings, \\"It can't be blamed for my mistakes.\\" It's like the archetypal idea of perfection: in order for anything to be truly 'perfect,' it must include some intentional imperfection, so as to be humble in 'the eyes of God' or something. It's like the master, Navajo rug weavers leaving an odd strand in there somewhere, or a Tibetan Buddhist sand painting being destroyed by its makers after it has been completed in order to represent the impermanence of existence in this human realm / bardo of reality. By doing that, Neil speaks volumes! I love this song like I love 'Winterlong' from DECADE. Emmyloy Harris really shines here. You'll think of Comes A Time, for sure, as well as American Stars 'N Bars. Also, the subtle percussion in the left channel is real tasty! Listening to this touching song makes me wonder who'll be playing my guitar when I'm gone. Johnny Cash once gave Bob Dylan a treasured acoustic guitar of his. In 1993, Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter took an ancient Gibson A-40 mandolin of his down off the wall of his home and handed it over to guitarist Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon. One wonders who will end up playing this guitar of Hank Williams that Neil has honored so eloquently with this soulful song, a guitar which Neal carefully puts to rest with a gentle hand after he finishes playing it, as you will see on the DVD part of this album. He truly cherishes this guitar.<br /><br />...TRACK #9: He Was The King ... A Fast One. Musically, this harks back in spirit to Neil's Everybody's Rockin' album released in 1983. I love the studio banter intro and outro between Neil, Ben, and the band. This one's a real hit! This is the one that will stick in your head! If this ain't the best song ever written about Elvis Presley, I'll be damned! Neil really nailed it on this one. He covers Elvis's whole career in a wide sweep that moves from verse / vignette to verse / vignette in a real rockabilly style that pays tribute to Elvis's raw, rock and roll, early days (as well as his Vegas days, with the horns!) of hayride, flat-bed truck performances with Scotty Moore and Bill Black when they called themselves Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys - before Colonel Parker got a hold of him and changed everything. You know these guys were having fun in the studio when they recorded this one. This is Neil relaxed - fun, funny, free, and breezy. This is not the INTENSE, live-on-stage, 'Like A Hurricane' delivery - but it's just as passionate just the same. There's a nice dobro here, too. Even the last, off-the-beat, snare-drum, back-beat hit fits in with the whole spirit and concept of this song, as well as this down-home album. It has that live feel. Damn the pro-tools, fix-it-in-the-mix, digital overdubs! This one ROCKS! Wait till you hear this song! You'll be singing it in your head for days on end. Love it.<br /><br />...TRACK #10: When God Made Me ... A Slow One. This is Neil Young's 'Imagine,' the anthemic John Lennon song from John's Imagine album that Neil chose to sing during the America: A Tribute To Heroes 2-hour telethon, live broadcast on TV on September 21, 2001 produced to raise funds for the families of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.. It is that good! It is also the song he recently played during the \\"Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast\\" performance that aired on TV on Friday, September 9th of this year which has so far raised an estimated 30 million dollars for The Salvation Army, The Red Cross, and USA Freedom Corps to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina. (That concert also featured Dr. John The Night Tripper, as well as the Foo Fighters appropriately belting out a beautiful cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Born On The Bayou.') This song - 'When God Made Me' - is one of the most beautiful songs ever written by Neil or anyone else. In its beautiful simplicity, the melody matches the lyrics perfectly. It's a great gospel tune, and spiritual in the true sense of the word. I can see this song being sung in every Unitarian Universalist church in the land and at High School graduation ceremonies the world over. This song - and whole album - is a real epiphany. Bravo, Neil Young! Thank you for this musical masterpiece. ... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kid ...<br /><br />VIDEO DISC: This is a real treat. You can watch the actual, recording studio performances of all ten songs as they were being performed and recorded onto analog tape. The performances are presented in a multiple, split-screen format like the movie WOODSTOCK was presented, with solos featured in the center of the screen at times. The sound is pristine, as it is of the highest quality, 24 BIT / 96 kHz DVD Audio sound commercially available at this time. Some believe this to be better than the SACD 1-Bitstream medium, as DVD Audio is less prone to digital jittering and more stable as an archival medium. Speaking of archives, those of us who have been waiting for 'DECADE TWO' all these years can't wait for Neil Young's ARCHIVES to finally be released! The very first thing you see on the DVD is a white sheet blowing in the breeze, hiding the words of the MENU options behind it. It soon gets blown away by the nightime prairie wind. The MENU choices are: Sessions Movie, High Resolution Audio Info, and More. Sub-Menus include: Play, Song Selection, Audio Info, Songs - all 10 of them, Sessions Audio Information, Player Setup Tips, Color Bars: Shakey Pictures Logo with Color Bands (a hoot!), Biographies /  Discographies, and DVD Credits - all of which are accompanied on the screen with photos of Neil Young's studio. The Biographies / Discographies section is really detailed, thorough, chronologically accurate, and interesting. It includes information on all the players on the album: Neil Young (Neil's Discography has things in there I never even heard about, let alone heard; things like: \\"Elyse\\" released in 1968 by Elyse.), Ben Keith, Rick 'The Bass Player' Rosas, Karl Himmel, Spooner Oldham, Chad Cromwell, Wayne Jackson, Diana Dewitt, Gary Pigg, Anthony Crawford, Grant Boatwright, Emmylou Harris, and, of course, Neil's wife, Pegi Young. (Rick and Chad both played with Neil on ELDORADO!) It's very well done, and was obviously put together with great care and precision. The whole DVD is a labor of love, for sure. Watch it and feel the wonder! ... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kideality. By doing that, Neil speaks volumes! I love this song like I love 'Winterlong' from DECADE. Emmyloy Harris really shines here. You'll think of Comes A Time, for sure, as well as American Stars 'N Bars. Also, the subtle percussion in the left channel is real tasty! Listening to this touching song makes me wonder who'll be playing my guitar when I'm gone. Johnny Cash once gave Bob Dylan a treasured acoustic guitar of his. In 1993, Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter took an ancient Gibson A-40 mandolin of his down off the wall of his home and handed it over to guitarist Christopher Thorn of Blind Melon. One wonders who will end up playing this guitar of Hank Williams that Neil has honored so eloquently with this soulful song, a guitar which Neal carefully puts to rest with a gentle hand after he finishes playing it, as you will see on the DVD part of this album. He truly cherishes this guitar.<br /><br />...TRACK #9: He Was The King ... A Fast One. Musically, this harks back in spirit to Neil's Everybody's Rockin' album released in 1983. I love the studio banter intro and outro between Neil, Ben, and the band. This one's a real hit! This is the one that will stick in your head! If this ain't the best song ever written about Elvis Presley, I'll be damned! Neil really nailed it on this one. He covers Elvis's whole career in a wide sweep that moves from verse / vignette to verse / vignette in a real rockabilly style that pays tribute to Elvis's raw, rock and roll, early days (as well as his Vegas days, with the horns!) of hayride, flat-bed truck performances with Scotty Moore and Bill Black when they called themselves Hillbilly Cat and the Blue Moon Boys - before Colonel Parker got a hold of him and changed everything. You know these guys were having fun in the studio when they recorded this one. This is Neil relaxed - fun, funny, free, and breezy. This is not the INTENSE, live-on-stage, 'Like A Hurricane' delivery - but it's just as passionate just the same. There's a nice dobro here, too. Even the last, off-the-beat, snare-drum, back-beat hit fits in with the whole spirit and concept of this song, as well as this down-home album. It has that live feel. Damn the pro-tools, fix-it-in-the-mix, digital overdubs! This one ROCKS! Wait till you hear this song! You'll be singing it in your head for days on end. Love it.<br /><br />...TRACK #10: When God Made Me ... A Slow One. This is Neil Young's 'Imagine,' the anthemic John Lennon song from John's Imagine album that Neil chose to sing during the America: A Tribute To Heroes 2-hour telethon, live broadcast on TV on September 21, 2001 produced to raise funds for the families of the victims of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York City and Washington, D.C.. It is that good! It is also the song he recently played during the \\"Shelter from the Storm: A Concert for the Gulf Coast\\" performance that aired on TV on Friday, September 9th of this year which has so far raised an estimated 30 million dollars for The Salvation Army, The Red Cross, and USA Freedom Corps to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina. (That concert also featured Dr. John The Night Tripper, as well as the Foo Fighters appropriately belting out a beautiful cover of Creedence Clearwater Revival's 'Born On The Bayou.') This song - 'When God Made Me' - is one of the most beautiful songs ever written by Neil or anyone else. In its beautiful simplicity, the melody matches the lyrics perfectly. It's a great gospel tune, and spiritual in the true sense of the word. I can see this song being sung in every Unitarian Universalist church in the land and at High School graduation ceremonies the world over. This song - and whole album - is a real epiphany. Bravo, Neil Young! Thank you for this musical masterpiece. ... YOWZA! - The Aeolian Kid ...<br /><br />VIDEO DISC: This is a real treat. You can watch the actual, recording studio performances of all ten songs as they were being performed and recorded onto analog tape. The performances are presented in a multiple, split-screen format like the movie WOODSTOCK was presented, with solos featured in the center of the screen at times. The sound is pristine, as it is of the highest quality, 24 BIT / 96 kHz DVD Audio sound commercially available at this time. Some believe this to be better than the SACD 1-Bitstream medium, as DVD Audio is less prone to digital jittering and more stable as an archival medium. Speaking of archives, those of us who have been waiting for 'DECADE TWO' all these years can't wait for Neil Young's ARCHIVES to finally be released! The very first thing you see on the DVD is a white sheet blowing in the breeze, hiding the words of the MENU options behind it. It soon gets blown away by the nightime prairie wind. The MENU choices are: Sessions Movie, High Resolution Audio Info, and More. Sub-Menus include: Play, Song Selection, Audio Info, Songs - all 10 of them, Sessions Audio Information, Player Setup Tips, Color Bars: Shakey Pictures Logo with Color Bands (a hoot!), Biographies /  Discographies, and DVD Credits - all of which are accompanied on the screen with photos of Neil Young's studio. The Biographies / Discographies section is really detailed, thorough, chronologically accurate, and interesting. It includes information on all the players on the album: Neil Young (Neil's Discography has things in there I never even heard about, let alone heard; things like: \\"Elyse\\" released in 1968 by Elyse.), Ben Keith, Rick 'The Bass Player' Rosas, Karl Himmel, Spooner Oldham, Chad Cromwell, Wayne Jackson, Diana Dewitt, Gary Pigg, Anthony Crawford, Grant Boatwright, Emmylou Harris, and, of course, Neil's wife, Pegi Young. (Rick and Chad both played with Neil on ELDORADO!) It's very well done, and was obviously put together with great care and precision. The whole DVD is a labor of love, for sure.

B00097DXZS|5.0|I've been a fan of Santana now for over 30 years. I even remember when he was on the Ed Sullivan Show. But I must say how nice it is that both me and my 15 year old daughter can enjoy this music together. Finally - something we both agree on! She's a big fan of the Black Eyed Peas, and actually the song \\"I Am Somebody\\" with Will of the Black Eyed Peas is the best, but really we love the whole record...I mean album. It's nice to know that my daughter is listening to music with a positive message, and that's what Santana brings.
B000AU9UYM|2.0|Okay, I'm obviously in the minority, but here goes...    Christopher Nolan's Memento is one of my favorite movies. I would go so far as to rank it alongside The Godfather and Vertigo. I think it's that good. It is clever, original, and well written.     Christopher Nolan's Batman Begins is none of the above. True, it promises a character study of what drives a man to dress up like a bat and fight crime, and it does do a decent job of delivering on that promise. That aspect of the movie was interesting and reasonably wall done. But it's also just window dressing. Batman Begins is really just another dumb, big-budget action movie, an empty spectacle we've seen twenty times before.     The writing was particularly disappointing after the brilliance of Memento. Once Batman takes on the massive criminal plot threatening Gotham nothing really makes much sense. The characters never have conversations -- they reel off what someone must think are witty one liners, or they make deep statements about becoming one with your fear and what you are on the surface defines you. Or something like that. It all ends with that big action movie cliche -- everything's okay because the bad guy dies a just death -- while ignoring the fact that there are hallucinating, homicidal zombies roaming the streets of Gotham. In my book that's a loose end.    But I go on. My point is that Nolan has gone from making a truly original film to dressing up tired action movie cliches. I have to assume that the pressures of making a franchise movie drove things in this direction (although Spider-man II shows how good a big-budget superhero movie can be). Batman Begins was just a huge disappointment to me. I would have expected this had Jerry Bruckheimer's name been on it (or Joel Schumacher's), but I expected so much more from Nolan.
0792151712|5.0|I have noticed that many of these reviews have criticized the Titanic for being an overdramatic, cliche piece only designed to please teenage girls. You say that the only reason this film went over so well at the box office was because of the scores of ridiculous 14-year-old girls who went 10 times to see it so they could drool over Leonardo Dicaprio, and cried only for his death. I suppose you will have to call me a silly girl too, then, because if I had had the opportunity to view it 10 times over in the theater, I most definetely would have. But it certainly would not have been because of Leonardo Dicaprio.     <br /> <br />I suppose I am a foolish girl. I cried during this movie, which I never do, but I began crying far before Jack's death. You all seem to have a terrible opinion of teenage girls, to think that every single one of us only notices death when it is that of a hot male. And perhaps you are in some cases right; many of us are quite shallow. But do you really think that the movie was made so that no one cared about the other deaths? And you call us shallow. Didn't you see them? Didn't you see the captain as his room was being flooded, or the nameless man and woman in their bed as the water welled around them? Didn't you see Jack's companion before part of the ship crashed down onto him? Didn't you see the woman who was lulling her two children to sleep so they wouldn't be afraid when death came? Didn't you see? Are you that stupid? Are you that blind? How could you not care about them? The movie makes you cry for utter strangers that don't even exist. The movie was that amazing. <br /> <br />I'd give it a six out of five stars, if that was possible. <br /> <br />
B00005LK94|5.0|What makes FLY AWAY HOME such a wonderful family film is that it doesn't rely on sentimental or maudlin tearjerking scenes to deliver its powerful message.  Rather it asks the audience to join in the flight of these remarkable geese and the determination/courage of a young girl and her father to ensure that these sixteen birds migrate properly.  Based on true events, the film benefits from the wise direction of Carroll Ballard (Never Cry Wolf, Black Stallion) and the remarkable cinematography of Caleb Deschanel.  Jeff Daniels is very good as the inventor father who is reunited with his estranged daughter (a wonderful Anna Paquin) after her mother is killed in an automobile accident in New Zealand.  A sense of down-to-earthiness is provided by Terry Kinney as Daniels' humorous brother who assists in the cause and Emmy winner Dana Delaney as Daniels' current significant other.  Without any devastating crises or manipulation, FLY AWAY HOME tells a true story of wonderment and is a marvelous family film.
B000001GX8|2.0|I suggest that anyone looking for an ideal first recording to have read my review, because I've put a lot of research into the various Figaro recordings.  And I was once in that exact same spot: which recording is best? I didn't want to buy every single one!  I'm reviewing, in fact, to impart what I've learned from this unto someone else, so that they won't have to spend so much money searching for that perfect recording.<br /><br />Anyway, my friend and I had fallen in love with this opera not too long ago.  Back then, I was under the impression that, like most things, there would be an ideal standard.  Well, it wasn't that easy.  We discovered that looking for the best Figaro recording is very, very, difficult.  Every good review is countered by a bad one.  We read all reader reviews, professional reviews, and listened to previews.  Eventually, between the two of us, we got: this one (Bohm,) Giulini, and Jacobs (I also intend on buying Kleiber sometime in the future, but the Figaro is much too dark for my liking.)<br /><br />I don't quite know how to say this nicely... I do NOT like Bohm's.  Why?  Because it's so darn slow!  Listening to it, you just think \\"This is an Italian comic opera, not a requiem mass!\\"  It's honestly plodding.  Pieces that are supposed to be almost thrillingly fast, like \\"Tutto e disposto,\\" and \\"Aprite, presto, aprite\\" are sung fast, but the orchestration does not seem to keep up.  In fact, in the former it sounded like poor Hermann Prey was struggling with trying to keep so slow.  Slower, prettier pieces like \\"Sull'aria\\" and \\"Giunse alfin il momento... Deh vieni, non tardar\\" are downright plodding.<br /><br />Now, it's certainly pretty.  I'd bet that's why \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" used the Bohm version of \\"Sull'aria\\"--it's very, very pretty.  But IMO it does not keep with the spirit of the opera.  It's light.  It's happy.  It's not Puccini or Verdi or something.<br /><br />The singing is, of course, fantastic.  I wish that I could hear Hermann Prey on another recording which has a faster tempo, because I bet that he would wow me and could possibly even become one of my favorite Figaros.  He shows a great amount of character, which I love--to me, Figaro is all about the personality coming through.  Too bad, like I said, that he is featured on a recording which has conducting that does not allow him to truly shine.<br /><br />I would not recommend this for a first recording.  It is not something that someone unfamiliar with the opera should get.  I would wait until one has a good primary recording and/or is familiar with the opera.  The entire thing is worth listening to, I just wouldn't recommend owning it for that CD you pop in when you want to listen to the opera.  But, there are certain parts that are great.  It's good ear-candy, and I'm sure that one would find it the most amazing thing ever if not familiar with the opera... but those who are probably will find the conducting incredibly unfitting.  It just doesn't match the opera.  Even the unhappy moments should have energy.  If \\"Porgi, amor\\" is too slow, for example, it will just drag on and on forever.<br /><br />Also, the recits before arias are split into different tracks, which can get really annoying.<br /><br />Anyway, what recording would I recommend for a first copy?  Rene Jacobs, definitely.  If one finds the conducting on that one too fast, then Giulini.  Giulini is a happy medium between the two conducting, even though I found the recits ridiculously fast and hard to understand.  But, hey, this isn't a review of Giulini's.  So, yes, I suggest Jacobs for people who just want one good, solid recording to appease those Figaro cravings.  Or a first recording for Figaro nerds like myself.  Bohm should be something that is second or third.<br /><br />So, yes.  I don't recommend this for a primary album, because I just cannot stand the conducting.  Obviously, there are people who disagree (this recording is pretty legendary.)  But, this is what I've found, myself.But, this is what I've found, myself.
1590581814|3.0|First, know that this novella is very short; less than 40,000 words.  You can finish this book in a hurry. <br /> <br />That said, the book was pretty good.  The timeline jumped around all over the place, but the author kept you with it.  The action sequences were good.  The prose was straightforward, though the author tried to introduce some new themes toward the end, related to Driver's introspection, that lost me. <br /> <br />The story is focused more on the characters' actions rather than their thoughts and motivations.  Sallis put a lot of good scenes together in this book.  I'm only giving it three stars because the story and characters deserved more time than this very short book gave them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I remember the first episode of this on FOX. A bar brawl ensues in the opening sequence and someone gets thrown through a holographic window. I thought \\"a computer image of something that is already see-through...this show is too silly\\" and stopped watching. My friends stayed with it and insisted it was worth a friday night, and when it was wrongfully cancelled, they wept. Now I know why, and I too cried at the realization that there will be no more episodes of this delightful show. Shame on you, FOX! (mutters an angry oath in Chinese...)
B000002KCV|5.0|With COMES A TIME, Neil Young delivers his mellowest album since HARVEST, but this album is much, much better than its 1972 counterpart. Whereas the earlier album was mostly sentimental jingles (with the exception of the anti-racism \\"Alabama\\" and the cautionary \\"The Needle And The Damage Done\\", which in its studio version, and even more so in the live recording on LIVE RUST, made me realize I should look at pictures of pretty actresses before making certain decisions regarding food and drink), COMES A TIME seems to be an album of reflection on past mistakes, and speaks of a need for personal change. For example, \\"Goin' Back\\" (an original, not the Goffin-King song) and the title song describe, for me, why I let my hope of looking good for the young women from TV's BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER, as well as several other pretty actresses, lead to me skipping food-related functions at my old school. Even \\"Lotta Love\\" (later unctuously covered by Nicolette Larson) has more of a feeling of urgency than most of HARVEST. The fact that Young, like most rockers of his generation, believes that the young Australian tourist jailed in Indonesia on drug-smuggling charges was wrongfully convicted makes this CD/cassette an essential purchase for both your ears AND your conscience.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|This is, without a doubt, one of the best films of the Sci-fi genre that I have seen in a very long time. I haven't had this much fun watching a film since the Star Wars original trilogy.  <br /> <br />Serenity has heart, humor, drama, wit, and a cast that you quickly grow to love and care about. Forget the eye-popping special effects that so many Sci-Fi films depend upon to keep the audience's attention and the story from falling flat, Serenity is all about narrative and characters - and it does a stellar job at both. <br /> <br />Even if you aren't a fan of the Firefly TV series, Serenity will give you some insight as to why people are. <br /> <br /> <br />Dear Buddha. Please bring me a pony, and a plastic rocket, and....a sequel. <br />
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This is a horriblly overrated film. The first reason is because you can watch the film begging to end and ask yourself \\"What was this movie about again?\\" No joking either. There is no actual story or plot. There is not a single bit of sense. However, the soundtrack is good. But it doesn't fit in at all. You will hear complelling and excellent music to a speed addict walking down the street. Quite simply don't even rent this movie. The only reason people are saying this is a good movie is because it is a powerfull movie but...you will finish and wonder why it was powerfull. The writers and directors of this film are sadly mixing up the word art with the word hell. Because that is all this movie is, hell and utter confusion. One scene features the main character plunge a needle into some sort of infected scar type thing, for no reason except to be a retard. This is quite simply take pink floyd: the wall and get rid of the music and throw in some drug use and you have requiem of a dream
B0007Y4USW|5.0|I was never a BIG Mariah Carey fan, but when I got this album - WOW!  I agree with the other reviewers - there is not one song I DON'T like on this album.  While I was living in Rio de Janeiro, I would blast this CD on my car stereo back in April, driving down the street to school - and I didn't care if people were like \\"Who the hell is this foreigner!?\\" - because the beats were hot!  Great singng, great writing, great beats - it's one of those rare times where you get an album that is 'perfect'.  I may even go ahead and buy the special edition CD that just came out.  Circles, Get Your Number, We Belong Together, and Mine Again.   <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BEZPQE|5.0|Well, finally a live slipknot album! Woo hoo!!  All I have to say is that this album rocks!  Slipknot puts on a great show from what you can hear!  Hell ya!  Although I have never seen them perform live myself, I can tell that Corey and the rest of the group really  really love their fans and family.  The only thing that kind of made me a bit mad was that there was no DVD like they said there was going to be! I guess we'll have to wait for it ;) but its worth it.   I loved the cover when I first saw it, now that's a band that admires their fans.   So, in a couple years, you know i'm going to get their 5th album! Stay (sic)!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Was more than pleasantly surprised, bought the TV series \\"Firefly\\" as a result.  You'll enjoy both (but I'm probably preaching to the choir here.)
B00097DXZS|1.0|Don't buy this CD. How do we know it's not putting spyware on our PC's like Sony's discs currently are? I won't ever buy a copy protected CD. The reason being if I buy something, I own it - NOT the record company. I will copy it and put it on my iPod or PC, or not. It's not up to the music industry to decide. I don't want some music company telling me what I can and cannot do with my own property or installing spyware on my computer, which seems to be the current trend. The music industry has lost yet another customer.
B000AOENJA|2.0|This album is below average for what David Gray is capable of. It is too polished even when compared to A New Day at Midnight (which I enjoyed more than White Ladder ) - it seems every song has a string arrangement whether it is needed or not. I became a fan of David because of his emotional performance - his singing, and his playing style which is always on the verge of breaking his guitar strings. It's still there in this album although it is masked by the production. <br /> <br />If you are already a fan then this will not be a waste of money. You will get _some_ enjoyment though be prepared for disappiontment. For your own reference, A Century Ends is my favourite album of David's. <br /> <br />Dual disc speaks for itself, you either need it or you don't. It should work in most 'tray' style players. I have played the disc successfully in my car which is a slot load though your luck may vary as described in other reviews. <br /> <br />As for copy protection? I am dead-set against it. Fortunately, I was able to make a copy to archive on my computer from my LEGALLY purchased disc. Why do they do this to people who actually BUY music?
0439101336|5.0|Critiquing Dickens' Christmas Carol is a misnomer.  Rather, it is Dickens who critiques us with this masterwork.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol has burrowed into the very heart of our Western Culture to where few people would be confused if you referred to someone as a \\"Scrooge,\\" that is to say a skinflint, miser.<br /><br />Aside from presenting us with some of the most memorable images in literature as Scrooge is taken by the Ghosts of the Past, Present and Future to review his life and probable ending, we are brought along with his and given opportunity to review those elements in our own lives.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol was not just a nice story of the Christmas Season to give warmth and cheer.<br /><br />Far from it!<br /><br />Dickens had an agenda.  Just as in his other famous works, like Oliver Twist and David Copperfield, Dickens longed to make a social statement to draw attention to the poor in England, their plight and hardship.  A Christmas Carol is about Scrooge as a person, but also as representing a class of the wealthy whose abundance is wrested from the large working poor such as Cratchett and his family.  THEY are the point.  THEY are the ones Dickens sought to draw to public attention.<br /><br />Heaven help us is we simply see this book as nostalgia and fail to see the point Dickens had to make then and which still applies today!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Wow all I got to say is that the first time I popped American Idiot in my CD Player, it hasn't left it. This CD is one of the most addictive albums out on the market. You have classic Dookie sounding tracks like,\\"Letterbomb\\" and \\"She's a Rebel\\". The two operetta's, \\"Homecoming\\" and \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" combine a series of differant melodies and have some of the best lyrics in any song I have ever heard. Hits like \\"American Idiot\\", \\"Holiday\\",\\"Boulavard of Broken Dreams\\", and \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\". lyrics are so smart-A** it's awsome and the music is very strong. There is not one track on the album that is bad, they are all very good. If you passed up buying this album BUY IT! It is one of the best ever made.
B00097DXZS|2.0|You know, it is sometimes very difficult to read reviews of CDs and get an honest opinion. You have the diehard fans who will like anything an artist puts out, you have people who are just trolling around, looking to make others mad, and you have some people complaining about CD Copy Protection (I know it's stupid, let's move on with life, complaining on Amazon isn't going to change things). I however, am none of those, I'm familiar with Carlos' older works, I've heard his recent CDs, and I've heard this CD, and friends, let me tell you something, you don't need to purchase this disc. <br /> <br />When Mr. Santana came out with Supernatural lo those many years ago, I actually enjoyed it. I thought the Everlast song was excellent, I liked Smooth the first 400,000 times I heard it, it was a really interesting idea. Santana had been off the radar for a while, and it was a good way to get back in the spotlight. A couple years after that, we have Shaman, with again, duets, but this time with a lot less talented people.  Seriously, Michelle Branch? P.O.D.? Placido Domingo?!?!?! (not that Mr. Domingo isn't immensely talented, but this didn't work). So OK, now we have two CDs of duets, time to move on, start getting back to writing songs that aren't as poppy. Yes maybe you won't be as mainstream anymore, but you've made your money, time to move on. Now we have this disc, and I don't care for it. It's beating a good idea into the ground, and for what? The old fans have long since departed (most of them anyway), newer fans might latch on, but with the way music is so fickle, they'll only be there for a short time. What after that? We're left comparing Oye Como Va to a song with Steven Tyler (how long has it been since Aerosmith was relevant?). Or Samba Pa Ti to a song with Bo Bice (the American Idol guy? What's the matter, Bananarama wasn't available?) <br /> <br />This CD isn't all bad, the song with will.i.am is actually quite good, and the Los Lonely Boys tune is good as well, it's just not SANTANA. I know people do CDs like this later on in life, they try to remain \\"hip\\", look what performing a song with Run DMC did to Aerosmith, but I always thought Carlos was better than this. This seems like a complete money-grab situation, keep milking this same idea for 10 years, if I wanted that I could listen to Coldplay (seriously, do they have more than one song?). So give this disc a listen, form your own opinions, I just thought Carlos was this big spiritual guy, and this seems to be the exact opposite of what he stood for.
B000002U82|5.0|I'm not going to argue with Fed Up... I too like Madonna. <br /> <br />BUT THERE IS NO WAY SHE'S EVEN IN THE SAME REALM AS FLOYD!!! <br /> <br />Why must they mention a Madonna album in a Pink Floyd column? <br /> <br />And Madonna? Rock 'n' Roll? Ashlee Simpson? Rock 'n' Roll?  <br /> <br />WTMF-INGF? <br /> <br />But I have nothing bad to say about \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\",  other than it does sound better on vinyl, as all albums that are 30 years old or older do. \\"Brain Damage\\", \\"Eclipse\\", \\"Money\\", and \\"Time\\" are classic Floyd numbers, and although the remaster doesn't match the original, it still rocks even 32 years down the line.
B00097DXZS|5.0|Its amazing to me that somebody that was popular before the other acts on his albums were born, can still jam with them and sound so great! But I guess it does not surprise me because Carlos Santanas style of music is forever young. About the copy protection, The album is priced like a couple of slices of pizza..buy another one and get over it!
B0002IQKV8|5.0|These are two of my favorite movies, but this is a question more than a review - how is this 2-for-1 package rated PG-13?  All That Jazz was rated R.  Has it been edited, does anyone know?  Or did they soften the rating because times have changed since 1979 (and there was no PG-13 rating until a year or two later)...
0316172324|4.0|The greatest weakness of this book, in my opinion, is how useless it is in daily living for non-experts.    Gladwell offers numerous examples of how expert make decisions based on thin-slicing, but unlike the experts that Gladwell mentions, I have not spent 20 years analyzing behavior like some tennis expert, military expert or social psychologist. I suppose it does tell me that if I did spend those 20 years studying a field, I'd be good at making decisions.    Nonetheless, it is a fun read and a quick read and it's a good place to start thinking about the psychology of decision making.    The Main Point: The human unconscious tries very hard to find patterns. Sometimes these patterns result in wonderful success. Sometimes they result in miserable failure. However, if we find a good pattern, our mind can do amazing things.    People criticize him for arguing with himself. They also criticize him for presenting an unbalanced presentation. In my opinion, it seems like he's arguing with himself because he's presenting both sides of the issue. He seems like he's offering an unbalanced picture because he's sensationalist with the benefits of thin-slicing and consiliatory with the weaknesses of thin-slicing.    He's really more of a story teller than a theorist. Buy this if you want a series of good and interesting stories. Don't buy it expecting a good presentation of a psychological theory.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|Having enjoyed the brightness and light heartedness of films such as the 1990's Emma and Pride & Prejudice, I was not impressed by the initial dark and bleakness of North & South.  <br /> <br />But by the end of the first episode, my doubts at purchasing this DVD (without ever seeing or hearing of the movie/book) were banished and I was a goner. <br /> <br />No long descriptions from me just: OH MY GOSH. *sigh* I have never loved a movie as much as this. I have never been swept up by passion as strong as this. I wish for amnesia just so I can be mesmorised for the first time ... again! I know, what a nutter. <br /> <br />Thank you Elizabeth Gaskell for the story the movie is based on. Thank you Sandy Welch for a magnificent adaptation. <br />Thank you Brian Percival for your wonderful direction. Thank you to all the cast for taking my breath away. And thank you to the BBC for making it all possible.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Josh Groban found a way into the main stream music world with a fantastic Baritone voice. I think that that is pretty amazing.
B00097DXZS|5.0|My parents have been a fan of Santana for a long time now, so I've always been around his music. They bought this cd yesterday, and it hasn't been out of the stereo since. I love it too. I like \\"I Am Somebody\\" the best. The track with Mary and Big are great too.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Buble's voice is so elegent. I love this style of music and think it is timeless. I'm happy to hear someone with a trully gifted vocal talent making it so big.
B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles were always revolutionary. You really can't compare any album to Sgt.Peppers,The White Album, or Revolver and you can't compare any Beatles album to another Beatles Album after Rubber Soul. <br />This is one of the best records ever recorded and never sounds dated. Can you believe this was released in 1969?! <br />I can't think of another album that actaully used synthesisers before this one. <br />This was before The Who,Pink Floyd,and Genesis were using them. <br />Also Alan Parsons helped record this album so you can imagine it would be one of the first albums with synths. <br />I love in parts of the album how a bunch of short songs are slammed together into one song like a classical masterpiece. <br />Every Beatle contrubuted to this album like it really was their last album and put all their heart and soul into it. <br />The best songs on this album are most of them. I'm serious! Remember this is not comercial crap with cheezy teenie bopper hit singles. All the music is superb here. <br />If you buy any rock album in your lifetime make sure it is this one!
B00008S2VG|5.0|i don't understand how anyone can give such an excellent retrospective anything less than 5 stars!!!this is one of her best albums to date.at the time when i bought this album i was going through a whole lot in my short-lived 19 years on this earth.and when i popped this cd into my cd player from the first track until the end i was floored.so many things have happened to me in my life which result, i had to reduce myself to stoicism to prevent myself from ever getting hurt by anyone ever again but it was when i heard track number 7 on this album that i really released alot of tension it's just so emotion felt and it's how i had been feeling for a long time deep w/i the depths of my stoic facade. i recommednd that any and everyone  by this album.your cd collection would not be complete unless you have this album trust me!!!!
B0001CNRS4|5.0|YA THIS IS HIP HOP SO IS THE SOUNDTRACK IT HAS TWEET AND SEAN PAUL YA IT ROCKS. BUY THIS DVD RIGHT NOW.
B00002Z88D|5.0|this is just a little note from a friend. Please don't overlook this one. You will never see this this album sitting alongside the classic works of Therion, Rhapsody and the rest on the \\"best-of\\" lists, because the pig-headed latter-day heavy metal hardcore hate Metallica for changing their style. So they just ignore it.  <br />Don't be the same kind of fool. You'd only be cheating yourself out of hearing one of the greatest symphonic metal albums of all time, one right up there with \\"Theli\\" or \\"Power of the Dragonflame\\". This album is, by far, Metallica's greatest accomplishment, and I'm old enough that I got \\"Kill 'Em All\\" not long after it first came out. The fact that it was recorded live  just makes it all the more amazing.  <br />I mean, c'mon. It's still Metallica. You know, Metallica, the heaviest of the heavy. And here they've got a whole dang orchestra and everything backing them up. It \\"rules\\", as the kids   said in my day (do they still say that?) Just get it, and play it loud. You won't be sorry. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />A fellow symphonic metal fan
B000002LIM|5.0|The Batman soundtrack contains almost every bit of music from Danny Elfman's score. Some of the music is also done by other musicians. The songs by Prince are not included, but I'm okay with this since I don't really care much for their music. <br /> <br />From the first few seconds, I loved this CD. The first track is the \\"Batman Theme\\", which gives a strong opening. Following is \\"Roof Fight\\" and \\"Confrontation\\" two fast-paced action tracks which make good use of Batman's theme. <br /> <br />\\"Kitchen, Surgery, Face-Off\\" ends with a small part of the \\"Waltz to the Death\\" (which will be mentioned later. \\"Flowers\\" intrroduces us to the wonderful love theme while \\"Clown Attack\\" and \\"Batman to the Rescue\\" collect the music fromthe Joker's crime wave. <br /> <br />\\"Photos/Beautiful Dreamer\\" is another nice love track and \\"Descent into Mystery\\" gave me chills the first few times I heard it with its vocals and heroic theme. \\"The Batcave\\" is the only track that can get me a little bored. \\"The Joker's Poem\\" is the shortest track, lasting just less than a minute. <br /> <br />\\"Childhood Remembered\\" is a haunting and tragic piece of music. \\"Love Theme\\" is the lull before the storm, for the next track ont he list is \\"Charge of the Batmobile\\". \\"Attack of the Batwing\\" is one of the best things on this disc, followed by \\"Up the Cathedral\\" which is a litle boring on a first listen, but it becomes a great work of art. <br /> <br />\\"Waltz to the Death\\" is the number one track. It is a nice blend of evil and classical music. \\"Final Confrotnation\\" is a little mediocre at first, but it evolves into a wonderful requiem for the Joker. \\"Finale\\" is short, but awesome, and last is the \\"Batman Theme Reprise\\", which is basically a speeded up version of the first track. <br /> <br />You simply have to buy this amazing soundtrack!
B00097DXZS|5.0|I was so excited about this album, and really I'm so impressed with it. The songs are great, and so is the production. Carlos sounds better than ever. Even my kids like it.
B00005KHJR|5.0|First of all, yes, this film is highly recomended...more about that shortly...but please, PLEASE, don't support the upcoming american rmake of this unique film!! Why? Well, first of all, judging from america's recent remakes of other cult films from other countries, this film really has no chance of being anything but a BOMB. It seems hollywood just can't resist toying with perfection..they see a unique film with a great plot or idea, one that just screams \\"mass-market\\", and probably wonder why some genius at their studio never came up with the idea before some little, often independent writer or studio did. Then, they insult our intelligence with their belief that Americans are all stupid, uncultured sheep who wouldn't be able to handle the originality and intelligence of such \\"foreign\\" films, (or, come to think of it, even some of our own Hollywood classics from the bygone era...I need not start a list) so they \\"Americanize\\" or \\"update\\" the films plot, adjust it to please the masses, ruining the original director's unique vision, turning it into lifeless, cookie-cutter and (hopefully for the fat cat studio execs, highly profitable) hollywood product...and the unsuspecting victim goes out and rents or goes to see this inferior film, thinking that this is the one their friends have been telling them about. This is exactly the case with the wicker man, too, you can be sure...some will say that I should be fair, I haven't even seen the remake yet...well, the track recrd isn't good folks, and this new remake is going to take place in MAINE!!! So, gone will be the rich English and Scottish atmosphere that was such a huge part of the original unique film, as well as the painstaking research of pagan rituals and the rich heritage of remote island communites like the one in the original. There is also talk of an attack by a swarm of BEES!! Yes, you read right. Please, PLEASE people, prove to Hollywood that we are intelligent and can handle (in fact, we DEMAND) the original, highly superior versions of films like this one. Spending more money and putting pretty Hollywood faces on a poster will not make a better film. Prove to them we know better, and stop Hollywood from creating drivel like this by NOT GIVING THEM YOUR MONEY!!! Maybe then they will have to start using their brains more often and come up with more of their OWN ideas and make NEW films with NEW plots.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Cliche lyrics --- not very deep -- similar melodies to what we have heard on previous albums -- this one seems kind of like \\"hey guys we need to make another album and we have no new ideas, so let's just go into the studio and see what happens\\".
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce really proven herself fantastic without Destiny's Child. People have said that she was great with Destiny's Child but now with her solo damn she is FABULOUS!!! To tell you the truth I was expecting dance hits but she also shows her soft senstive side as well! <br /> <br />Crazy in Love- A crazy clubbangin song with trumpet samples and Jay-Z's rap makes it still have that hip-hop flava. Beyonce was really smart to make this song her first single. 10/10 <br /> <br />Naughty Girl- Shows her sexy side in this song. Not as good Donna Summer's original but still is a great single. 9/10 <br /> <br />Baby Boy- I love the reggae beat in this song. Sean Paul give it that reggae feel and Beyonce still has the R&b beat in it. Great single! 11/10 <br /> <br />Hip-Hop Star- When I first heard this I really didn't like it. Then like a few months after I decided to listen to hear it again then I really liked it. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Be With You- This song really shows her real voice and authentic. I really like this song when I am in a romantic mood. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Me, Myself, and I- I really loved the lyrics but I'm really not lovin the beat. I like kinda like the music video though HAHA 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Yes- Kinda like Me Myself and I. But I like this one better. Her voice and beat really collaborate with eachother. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Signs- To me this is probably the most disappointed song in the album I was really thinking that Missy and B would really doing some hot stuff but this was as great as I thought it would be. 6/10 <br /> <br />Speechless- Now this song is really hot! Really shows her sexy and lyrical talent. The beat is hot as well. 9/10 <br /> <br />That's How You Like It- Now I know some people really don't like this song but I really love this song! JayZ and B's lyrics and voices really style good together. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Closer I Get To You- OMG This is probably the best collaboration in the WHOLE cd(apart from Jay-Z) Beyonce's and LutherVandross's voice(R.I.P) really mix together. This would've have been perfect single for her. 11/10 <br /> <br />Dangerously in Love 2- Even this is kinda like the same like Destiny's Child SURVIVOR album I still LOVE this song. She kinda changes the beat and she soundz FANTASTIC on it. 11/10 <br /> <br />Beyonce's Interlude- I always like listenin to this kine of stuff cuz it shows them just actin themselves. She soundz pretty truthful 8/10 <br />Gift From Virgo- I'm simple LUVIN this song. It really shows a slow balled side but doesn't lose it's flavah as well. She really shows her emotion in this song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Daddy- I JUST LOVE THIS SONG!!!! It shows her love for her dad on all of the stuff he has done for her. It kinda reminds of my dad sometimes...11/10 <br />
B000B5XOY8|3.0|Until 2005's BATMAN BEGINS appeared on movie screens, 1989's BATMAN was considered the best of Dark Knight's cinematic entries...basically because the other sequels were so bad.<br /><br />Jack Nicholson's Joker and his nefarious plot may have been foiled by the end of this movie, but he gets away scot-free with stealing the movie from Batman and everyone else, for what it's worth.  It looks like they really jazzed up the Joker's scenes to attract Nicholson, but left Batman as a first draft.<br /><br />Originally, Sean Young was supposed to be cast as Vicki Vale and something went wrong.  I don't think the E! True Hollywood Story has even figured that one out.  But the role fell to Kim Basinger.  She's a great actress, but all wrong for this movie.  The reason: she's blonde.  It throws the entire color scheme of the movie off.  If they had gone with Sean Young's dark hair, then the only color in the movie would've been the Joker's crazy world.<br /><br />The major problem I had with this film was that Tim Burton, as quirky and gifted as he is, can't shoot an action sequence to save his life.  The film has no momentum.  The only thing slower is the next film, BATMAN RETURNS, which was a dark, indulgent mess.<br /><br />The set design of Gotham City was cool, the soundtrack worked.  But I was hoping Adam West would show up at some point to breath some life into the cowl.
B000002GYW|5.0|This is by far one of the finest of their albums.  Listen to it all the way through preferably with headphones on the first listening. <br />Their lineup would never be the same after this album.  This is pre Joe Walsh and Timothy Schmidt.
B000AOJ9X0|5.0|Bring Em In is one of the few albums worth buying today . It has a good set of songs for different people, all very well performed. Buddy Guy is a great singer, and can sing in a variety of styles. He's like six superstar guitarists rolled into one. Very talented. I'm still enjoying the album after listening to it for two weeks.
B000BBOUU4|5.0|I really enjoyed this version of the film a lot more then the original. I think its a lot closer to the book then the 1971 version. Not to mention that the original ompa lompas kind of creeped me out when I watched the original. The music was also a lot better in this movie. <br /> <br />I thought Johnny Depp did a really great job as Willy Wonka. I din't realize he was so good at being funny until I saw this. <br /> <br />Bottom line, I definitly perfer this version over the original any day and I would highly recomend buying the DVD as soon as possible.
B00097DXZS|2.0|If I wanted to hear all these guest stars, I'd buy their stuff. PLEASE make pure Santana music again. Sure, there are a few good songs, but this format is way overdue for the hook. Carlos, if you really are an artist and have enough of a fortune, make music memories that will stand the test of time....like you used to do.
B00005JO1G|4.0|I read more reviews that didn't like this film than those who did. I usually don't care what critics say (I loved SAW II) and they were wrong here as well. The acting is what makes this film. The three leads (Jake G, Peter S, and Jamie Foxx) are all outstanding here. The first half of Jarhead contains a lot of humor, while the second half is very serious in tone. It's like two different films, but they both mesh together nicely. This is not an action film by any means. I was fooled to believe so by the previews, so thanks to those pesky critics I read, I went into the theater expecting a drama with very little action. And because I knew what to expect, I got exactly what I wanted. Jarhead probably will never break into the list of best war films ever made, but it is one that should be respected for showing a different side of war, one where the main character never fires a single shot in combat.
B000002LGQ|5.0|If I had to be stuck with just one Madonna album, I would have to make it this one.  <br /> <br />Just about every song on the album is highly listenable, with my all-time faves being \\"Promise to Try,\\" \\"Oh Father,\\" and the album versions of \\"Like a Prayer\\" and \\"Express Yourself.\\" The last two were the main reasons I had for buying the album, and it's disgraceful the way Shep Pettibone defaced the remixes.  <br /> <br />It's just a shame she will never be this good again. And yes, I do not own anything Madonna made after \\"I'm Breathless.\\" Post-Pat Leonard Madonna material is absolute crap--with the possible exception of \\"Beautiful Stranger.\\"
B000BBOUU4|5.0|Tim Burton and his marketing team made this film look real bad by releasing some horrible teaser trailers (almost made me not want to see it), but he has actually turned in one of the best films of the year. I liked both versions of Willy Wonka, but Johnny Depp proves once again that he is great at acting out weird characters that you can't help but love. The 1971 version will always be a classic, but I have a feeling in time this one will be as well. The only complaint I have about the film are the songs, because they are more annoying than funny and it is hard to understand what the little actor, Deep Roy, is saying half the time. Other than that, this film proves the visual genius Tim Burton is. I will be buying the 2 Disc Deluxe DVD on November 8th.
B0000CNY27|5.0|After air force one is taken over and crashed by criminals, The president [The late great Donald Pleasance] is kidnapped in New York city which is now a maximum security prison. To get him back, The police enlist the help  of war hero gone bad named Snake Plissken [Kurt Russell in one of his best roles] who they promise to make a free man out of if he saves the president within 24 hours. A nice plot and some great acting as well as action make this one of my favorite films. This low-budget early-80s action flick is a really good movie. One frightening but very interesting thing is seriously true about this movie: The scene in the beginning where the president's plane hits the world trade center is frighteningly similar to the way the 2 planes hit the world trade center on 9/11 and this film was made a full 20 years before that tragic event even happened! Anyway, the acting was pretty good. Issac Hayes even makes a pretty convincing villain in this movie. This is a great film and i reccomend this to action fans, Young and old. Needless to say, We all know what will happen in the end before we even see it, But it's definitely worth watching over and over again. Even though it starts kinda slow, It never gets boring. Followed years later by Escape from L.A., Which was really just a bigger-budgeted remake of this film. Hope the review helped. Stay up, Be blessed.
B00097DXZS|3.0|This is similar to Santana's last 2 offerings. There are some fine tracks and some forgettable ones. Among the good stuff: Hermes, the track with Los Lonely Boys (a match made in heaven), the one with Anthony Hamilton (heard it last night live on Letterman), and Brown Skin Girl with Bo Bice. This is a very commercial, very savvy, very sellable collection. If they don't get at least 3 top 40 hits out of this, I'll be very surprised.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Thoroughy enjoyable movie with wonderful writing, acting and character development.  Even if you have never seen the show, you can appreciate this great film!
B00005QIPH|4.0|This album is great.  It's rockin', original, and fun.  The peppy bass line of the bemused first track, \\"Is This It\\" makes me laugh out loud every time I hear it, and at least half of the songs on the album seem perfect for Every Mix Tape Ever.  I like this album enough that when I lost my first copy, I had to go out and buy it again.<br /><br />That said, it's kind of forgettable--not as forgettable as anything by Coldplay, but let enough time pass, and you'll probably find \\"Is This It\\" isn't lodged in your mind and heart the way certain albums of The Smiths may be, or Soltero, or Wilco.  It's like a happy phase of your life that you love while you're in it, but don't think about too much after it's gone by.  It's great, but it's not timeless.
0553804367|4.0|I do not have a science background, and I did not read a Brief History of Time when it was originally published or thereafter.  So this review is written to a fairly small category of potential readers -- those like me with an interest in modern physics but without much background.    I thought the book was exceptionally well written, and it was outstanding in places.  It was certainly a very fun read, and I think it achieves a very lofty goal -- making liberal arts grads like me understand both the desirability and potential implications of reconciling general relativity and quantum physics.  But, overall, I thought it tried to walk too fine a tightrope between discussing complex subjects and at the same time attempting to be as conversational and accessible as possible.  That is a lofty goal -- hard to achieve I think.   The reality is that some of these concepts are very very difficult to the uninitiated, so the cursory treatment the authors sometimes give them, in their attempt to make the book accessible and to live up to the \\"briefER\\" in the title, actually at times makes the book harder to understand, not easier.  It is most acute in the book's introduction to uncertainty, quantum physics, and understanding the implications of interference experiments.  More detail, not less, was needed here to reach the authors' goal of accessibility.  Don't get me wrong, I wasn't seeking a text heavily laden with mathematics or equations.  I just think the overriding editorial doctrine with this book was to condense wherever possible, and that is just not always possible or desirable.    All that said, the book achieves it purpose: To take some of the amazing intelligence and insight of one of the world's most important thinkers, squeeze it into understandable packets, and give us ordinary folk some insight into the exciting times in which anyone interested in the Universe and its fundamental questions live.  But to steal a little from Einstein, I thought the authors didn'tquite follow the second half of his famous exhortation to make everything as simple as possible, but no simpler.
B000AU9UYM|3.0|When we say we had enough of super heroes movies, here comes \\"Batman Begins', to change our minds .Good script, a story well known ,Very good acting by Chritian BAle .
B000002OX7|5.0|This is my first amazon review, so I decided to review one of the greatest and most recognized albums in rock history, the Who's 1971 masterpiece, WHO'S NEXT. <br /> <br />The album opens with the synth driven classic \\"Baba O'Riley\\", which in itself an amazing rock song and one of Who's most beloved songs. Next is my personal favorite song on the album \\"Bargain\\" probebly my favorite Who song. I love how the chorus goes \\"I call it bargain, the best I ever had....the best I ever haaaaaad.\\" Songs like \\"The Song Is Over\\" and \\"Love Aint For Keeping\\" show the band's heartfull side, \\"The Song Is Over\\" has beautifull piano playing and some of the best vocals the Who ever recorded. \\"Wont Get Fooled Again\\" is probebly the Who's greatest song and itself became a live staple for the band. \\"My Wife\\" has phenomenal drum playing by Keith Moon, he's considered to be the greatest rock drummer. In fact, the whole album has excellent drum playing and the best Synth rock music I've ever heard. Every song on this album is memorable. 9 songs of pure Rock N Roll perfection. WHO'S NEXT is arguably the ultimate rock album of the 70s and will go down as an all-time classic.  <br /> <br />
B000BBOUU4|5.0|This will be diffrent from the 1971? movie. I hope there will be no singing. Johnny Depp wears gloves in the movie,but Gene Wilder did not. The kids are all cute.I'll ask for this on My birthday/christmas BTW: did you know Julie Dawn Cole[original Veruca Salt] that The shooting the scene with the Geese was shot on her birthday? It says so on the Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory DVD.
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Much of you are ragging about the weak story plot. What's there to say but you are right. BUT consider this, the movie was suppose to be a 20 minute aftermath review of Final Fantasy VII. Square kept on expanding it so much that it became a full length motion picture with it's own plot. They weren't really focusing too much on the plot as they were focusing more on the characters. They wanted you to see that Cloud hasn't fully recovered (people who played the game know what I'm talking about). We all can't just keep \\"dragging\\" around. I don't want to give too much of the movie away.  <br />   The graphics and fighting scenes were a bonus! And seeing old characters reunite was totally awesome. If you are have not beaten Final Fantasy VII or even played it, this movie is not for you. But even if you do want to see it, I would admit that all the Final Fantasy movies ever made (Spirits Within, FFX, and even the anime FF Unlimited), this has got to be the BEST ONE YET!!!
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I have been \\"playing the angel\\" for several days now... and I have come to love the album. It carries an overall dark feel and it reminds of the eighties sound of the band, with an ocasional blip of \\"Ultra\\" popping up. Nowhere around is there anything to bring back memories of the (boring) song structures they came up for their previous work, which makes me very happy. However, a band of the stature of Depeche Mode has a heavy handicap to compete against: their history. I will always hold them accountable and measure up their work versus classics such as \\"Violator\\". On that account, \\"Playing the Angel\\" falls a bit short, and where it succeeds, it still is not as good as \\"Ultra\\", an album that will always be in my list of \\"albums to take to a desert island (even if I have nowhere to play them)\\".<br /><br />At times, \\"Playing the Angel\\" becomes a bit repetitive in their rhythmic use and sampling of industrial-like sounds throughout the album. But they succeed at creating a fantastic atmosphere that makes it great music to listen to at nighttime. Definitely one of 2005's best works, and certainly the best work by the band since \\"Ultra\\", though a bit far from being Depeche Mode's best production.
B000089CJI|5.0|<br /> <br />This album is absolutely wonderful. None of the songs really have any glaring weaknesses, and there is at most one song that you may possibly want to skip on the whole CD. It is one of my personal favorite albums of all time. Perhaps its only flaw is, characteristic of the Postal Service, the songs tend to be a bit lengthy, and can become monotonous when the only songs being listened to on the way to work are these. Nevertheless, the album is entrancing in its entirety, and I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone remotely intrested in the pop-tronic genre of music. That is, if that's an actual genre. <br /> <br />The album begins with the slightly off-beat yet extremely catchy and quirky The District Sleeps Alone Tonight. Quite possibly the best song on the album, this single track encompases so much musical coordination, as highlighted in the bridge, my personal favorite part of the song.  <br /> <br />The album continues strong with a lyrically thought-provoking song, such great heights. The high point in this song is without a doubt the opening verse. The clever and unique usage of wording and slight overlap of words effectively creates an extremely catchy dual-vocals effect.  <br /> <br />There is a slight dip in quality with the third track, Sleeping In. While the song itself is solid, it becomes repetative toward the middle. As a result, I often find myself repeating \\"Don't wake me; I plan on sleeping / Don't wake me; I plan on sleeping in\\" over and over throughout the day after hearing said song.  <br /> <br />Whatever redundancy is in Sleeping In is completely negated by another absoloutly tremendous track, Nothing Better. The wonderful tune is just a ficade for this seemingly happy song, as it quickly shifts to the exchange of words of a lovestruck boy expressing his feelings, and the girl denying him, with the closing line \\"You've got a lure I can't deny, / But, you've had your chance so say goodbye. / Say goodbye.\\" It is unfortunate that it is the shortest song on the album, at 3:48. <br /> <br />There is then a change in moods as the CD switches to the fifth track on the CD, Recyled Air. This is the most relaxing song on the CD, with a well placed and unconventional electronic sound providing an interesting and soothing backbeat. <br /> <br />The sixth song on the album, Clark Gable, is a much quicker song, and it tells a story that is different to say the least about a man wanting \\"to believe that there is truth, that love is real\\". The song really is more upbeat, though not so much louder, than most of the other songs on the album, giving the CD a much-needed break in what might have otherwise become a lull of quieter songs. <br /> <br />The seventh song on the album, We Will Become Silhouettes, is my second favorite track of them all. The into alone is enough to carry the whole song, and yet the song continues with very uplifting verses, musically at least. The lyrics are somewhat confusing at first, but it honestly doesn't really matter. The song is just that good. <br /> <br />This Place Is a Prison is my personal least favorite track on the song. The very driving force of the song is not what I would call pleasing to the ears, and the song is somewhat a downer both musically and lyrically. I have had that opinion challenged by several of my friends, so it is very possible that this is a song you might enjoy. It seems more like a song that one might tend to skip, however. <br /> <br />There is no other word for the ninth track of the album but ingenious. The arcade-style entrance of Brand New Colony is quirky but addictive, and the snare drum driven drum beat is quite catchy, but during the times when it stops a few times during the song, the instrumental genious of the song is particularly accentuated. The glory of this track continues for a while even after the lyrics have been completed, and yet the song always ends with me wishing it hadn't. <br /> <br />The tenth and final track of the album is the most dynamic of the songs by far. It is also the longest, at 5:07. The repeating sound track during the beginning starts out very clear, then slowly trancends into organized chaos. So many instruments and electronics play at once, and yet it is amazing that each has its own specific purpose, and each contributes to the incredible sound attained only by the careful timing and great musical sense of the band itself. It is also unique in that it is strictly instrumental up until about four minutes into the song, when it first introduces actual words. The silence following the end of the song is truly heartbreaking. That is, until I hit \\"play\\" again on my CD player and the whole album repeats itself once more.
B00097DXZS|4.0|Going with the \\"If it isn't broke don't fix it\\" is Santana who is back with his third installment of his duets series entitled All That I Am. Santana has always been the best idea for collaboration because unlike such efforts in the last decade from singers like Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles, Santana is more of an instrumentalist who has always had a revolving door of singers, so why not just bring in high profile singers to accompany him. <br /> <br />For All That I Am, Santana brought back two artists who were responsible for his biggest hits off his last couple album. Michelle Branch once again gets the lead single honors with the upbeat I'm Feeling You that could be easily mistaken for her last collaboration with Santana, The Game of Love. Both songs were much more poppy than any of Santana's older stuff or Branch's music for that matter, but somehow overcome cheesy lyrics, this time replacing \\"A little bit of this and a little bit of that\\" with \\"I'm riding the highs and digging the lows,\\" and are able to make a extremely enjoyable song. The other returning face is Rob Thomas who wrote and sang the first song that made Santana relevant again, Smooth. This time around Thomas is relegated to just writing duties on the Mary J. Blige sung My Man. The song also features a very unnecessary rap from Big Boi of Outkast that takes away from the song. <br /> <br />Other guests include Steven Tyler of Aerosmith who is rescued from the rut his band has fallen recently with the onslaught of Diane Warren ballads and poorly veiled sophomoric lyrics. Just Feel Better is the best song Tyler has been apart of since the hey day of his band in the seventies. Los Lonely Boys make an argument against being one hit wonders with I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love which best reflects the Santana of old with its south of the border flavor and part of the lyrics sung in Spanish. Will.I.Am of the Black Eyed Peas also show up in an almost salsa type song I Am Special which would be great at any party, but the song could get old quickly. Things slow down with the arrival of the smooth Anthony Hamilton on Twisted. <br /> <br />There are also some head scratching pairing on the album too, some with better results than other. First is the generational guitarist showcase with the old guard, Santana, trading licks with the heavy metal veteran, Kirk Hammett of Metallica, and the new kid on the block Robert Randolph. It's fun as a music fan to sit and try to pick out who is who on the appropriately titled Trinity. Then there is the reggae singer Sean Paul along side the soulful Joss Stone on Cry Baby Cry which combination actually sounds good. What doesn't do as well is the inclusion of American Karaoke castoff Bo Bice on Brown Skin Girl who tries to channel the southern rock Gods of yesteryear, but comes off as exactly what he is, a pale karaoke imitation. <br /> <br />There are a few old Santana Mexican standards most notable Hermes that utilizes the organs, percussions, and horns just like every great Latin song. If would be hard for anyone not to dance when this comes on. In fact all of the songs without a name singer stands up to those that do on this album.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|Never in my life did I think anyone could accurately capture the things that go on in our heads. Now it has been done! I was moved to tears by this movie and continue to be every time I watch it. At first you are thinking, \\"This is strange. I'm not sure what's happening here.\\" Before you realize it, you are reminded of your own memories and dreams. <br /> <br />Of course, this is from the point of view of a man, but it is absolutely on the mark. You don't have to have the same memories as the characters in the film to feel the connection. It is so rare for a filmmaker/screenwriter to create characters and images that are so real. Jim Carrey is phenomenal as 'everyman'. I have never seen a better performance from him. Every nuance in this movie is realistic, even the surreal! <br /> <br />The special effects, done in-camera (the old-fashioned way), are mind-blowing. This movie deserved several Academy Awards. <br /> <br />I rank it in my top 5 of all time, and there hasn't been one of those since 1992 (Until the End of the World).
B00023BLXK|4.0|I have never seen the original Dirty Dancing -- never had a desire to.  I thoroughly enjoyed this story of Katie (an American girl) who falls for Javier (a young Cuban man played by delicious Mexican actor, Diego Luna).  It's a boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl story.  Lots of great dance music and great choreography in between.  Not a deep movie by any means, but definitely a fun one to watch and listen to.
0151003084|4.0|Edward Gorey's stories of the 1960s, pen-and-ink illustrations with seemingly innocuous one-liners full of droll humour under the surface, set in some vague Victorian or Edwardian times, have long been among my most entertaining reading. With THE GRASHLYCRUMB TINIES, however, Gorey turned to a very macabre sort of humour with a send-up of children's alphabet books.<br /><br />The book is a tale of the terrible fates of 26 children whose names range from A (\\"...for Amy who fell down the stairs\\") to Z (\\"...for Zillah who drank too much gin\\"). To describe the scenes in the drawings would be to risk spoiling the reader's enjoyment, but I must admit I like the scenes where the child's doom is clearly imminent, as in \\"T is for Titus who flew into bits\\" as a boy looks at a package that just arrived in the post, or the awful yet hilarious scene of \\"H is for Hector done in by a thug.\\" While some may protest at a work of entertainment based on the death of children, Gorey's drawings don't normally threaten any sensibilities, with the sole exception of \\"K is for Kate who was struck with an axe.\\"<br /><br />I enjoyed THE GASHLYCRUMB TINIES, but I would be hesitant to say it ranks among Gorey's best work. His more typical works of the 1960s, such as THE IRON TONIC or the magisterial THE OTHER STATUE, seem more satisfying. Still, if you are a fan of Gorey's work, you should read this somewhere along the way.
B00005QW4K|5.0|Sam Raimi's \\"Army of Darkness\\" is one of the best horror-comedy movies ever made. Bruce Campell is very funny in this movie and delivers some of the most memorable one-liners ever said.(Play Duke Nukem on the PC and you'll hear Bruce Campell's lines from this movie in the game.) The story is well written and paced very well. The acting is spotty but the main characters do the job nicely. I loved this movie and would recommend it to any one who loves an off the wall adventure. Get it on DVD.<br /><br />Like Sam Raimi (the director of AOD), I prefer the Theatrical Cut. The director's cut is interesting though, because we get to see more scenes with Evil Ash, a love scene between Shiela and Ash, more scenes with the Mini-Ash's, an alternate opening to the movie, an extended version of the final battle scene, and the original \\"apocalypse\\" ending.<br /><br />P.S. If you're looking for a commentary for this movie, check out the Director's Cut disc(s).
B00026WUBE|5.0|First of all Bob Dylan is certainly not for everyone. However, if his style is up your alley this is a classic. You can turn on the radio and hear all those classic songs of his like \\"lay lady lay\\" or \\"like a rolling stone\\" to name a couple. Planet Waves is the type of album where the sum of the songs come together wonderfully. This is probably my favorite Dylan album and I have all the \\"classics\\" like Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 revisited. ect. I'd recommend this to any Dylan fan.
6305841861|5.0|The first Evil Dead film was pure horror. The third is pure comedy. Sam Raimi's \\"Evil Dead II\\" is a mixture of both horror and comedy - which is why it works so well. The film manages to make you go \\"Urgh! Gross!\\" AND laugh at the same time. Here's an example: in one scene there's a zombie trying to get out of a cellar through a trap door. Two men try to keep the trap door closed by standing, lying and jumping on it. But the zombie's head sticks out at the same time they're jumping on it. Whaddya get? A squashed head. And whaddya get when that happens? An eyeball that pops out of the head - one that goes flying across the room and goes straight into a screaming woman's mouth!!! HAHAHAHA. This film is hilarious! And the \\"possessed hand\\" scene is awesome.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|I say that because this is the film that finally bumped \\"Last of the Mohicans\\" from my #2 spot. It is just a masterwork from beginning to end, one of those few films where, when the final credits roll, you're sitting there with your mouth open, wanting to cry because it's finished.  (Now I cry at almost every scene, happy or sad, and even when I listen to the soundtrack.)<br /><br />I've followed Peter Weir since his \\"The Last Wave\\" days, and I think that was my main motivation originally to see this film in the theater.  Every time I see this film I notice new things. I think the most overall enjoyable part for me is the intense character development, how you feel you really know all the men, and see them changing over time.<br /><br />M&C is sublime, superb, a true piece of artistry in every sense of the word.  Now, where's the danged sequel...?<br /><br />Course, even Weir's \\"worst\\" film (Mosquito Coast) stands head and shoulders above almost every other film in the genre. Mosquito Coast only failed to rise to his usual level of masterwork because it was saddled with an unlikeable \\"hero.\\"<br /><br />Did I mention I liked \\"Master and Commander\\"?
B00080ZG10|5.0|This is by far one of the best movies that Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese have done. The world hasn't seen such a great performance by DiCaprio since he was in \\"The Basketball Diaries\\" and \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape?\\". He really transformed himself in recent years, even though most people say he's just another pretty boy. Hopefully he'll keep doing extroadinary work like this, and I'm glad to see that he's working with Scorsese! I would never have thought that he would be capable of such a demanding role. He perfectly portrayed Howard Hughes' descent into insanity. He's not one of my favorite actors by any means, but I do think he gives great performances. Thanks to his performance, you could really see how it was possible that such a brilliant business man could be so mentally sick. Even Gwen Stefani's portrayal of Gene Harlow was great (though short). All of the characters were brought to life by the awesome performances and excellent direction by Martin Scorsese seen in this movie.
B00097DXZS|5.0|I cant say enough about this new album from Santana. While the format is familiar, the tunes sound fresh and Carlos's guitar playing is superb. The duets on this cd are better than the ones we've heard before, especially the track he does with Anthony Hamilton called \\"Twisted\\". I was not that familiar of Hamilton before I heard this tune, but now I am a fan. Congratulations Carlos on another great record. Please keep making 'em.
B000002KHH|5.0|If you're going to find any Black Sabbath album in somebody's CD collection, odds are this will be the one. What can be said about this album that hasn't already been said? War Pigs, Paranoid, Iron Man, Faeries Wear Boots...if you could look up Black Sabbath in a musical dictionary, it would play you these songs. Not only that, but the rest of the album is simply outstanding...Planet Caravan is a rather subdued bit, Electric Funeral is ominous and scary as hell, Hand of Doom is a great number about drug addiction (and musically engaging), Rat Salad is a great instrumental that features an awesome drum solo from Bill Ward...if you haven't bought this yet and you're a Sabbath or Ozzy fan, WHY NOT??? There is no excuse for anyone who likes any form of metal or even rock music not to own this.
B00097DXZS|4.0|I have 'every' Santana album.  This one is similar to the previous two, a lot of good songs and a couple of dogs.  The copy protection doesn't bother me, EXCEPT you can only copy it with the CD supplied software and the reproduction is only low quality 128kbps.  If I wanted crappy FM or iPod quality that would not be a problem, however I prefer the higher quality 800+kbps which my other recording software performs which actually reproduces depth of sound instead of tinny reverb.  What a shame.  iPods, et. al. have really screwed up music reproduction for those of us that actually care about such things.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|My wife and I are classically trained musicians, and I am a huge fan of Celtic music in general.  We were first introduced to Celtic Woman through their PBS special, and I knew that I had to see them if they came to our area.  My wife got online and ordered tickets far in advance for their show here in Cincinnati at the Aronoff Center for the Arts.  The concert was absolutely amazing, and possibly one of the best performances I have ever seen.  This CD is pretty close to, if not the exact set list, that we saw them perform here in Cincinnati.  Their voices are hauntingly beautiful and their performance is visually attractive without detracting from the music.  This is an amazingly talented group of women, and a great addition to any CD collection.  For lovers of Celtic music, this CD is a must have, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys world/new age to pop.
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|Everything about this dvd release seems to have been done well.  The picture is miraculous when compared to the VHS travesty from several years back.  The DTS soundtrack is what I cranked up and it sounded absolutely great.  The extra features are well done and add a lot of background info about the concert.  I think the part with Leon Russell doing Jumping Jack Flash and Youngblood is just flat out genious.  But George is in top form throughout and the title song which was the first benefit single of its kind is performed with much passion.  Heck, I even like the Indian music from Ravi.  I only wish Mr. Pete Ham had been given the chance to sing one of his songs, but at least he is featured instrumentally when he shares center stage with George for one of the best versions of \\"here comes the sun\\" ever recorded.
B00004Z459|5.0|i love this cd from the day it came out till today, i am a hardcore metal head and listen to children of bodom, lamb of god, opeth and in flames, but still i will not change my mind and say that this was a stupid album because it is a masterpiece and i love it, no matter what.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This is maybe the best tribute concert ever put on.  George's friends like Eric Clapton and Billy Preston and all the rest really did him proud.  I think it was Ravi who says at the beginning that George must be there with them that night, asking how he could not be with all the great music his assembled friends were creating for him.  Its pretty emotional when all is said and done, with Joe Brown's \\"I'll see you in my dreams\\" that closes the show being maybe the most emotional part.  <br /> <br />But the highlights are many - Billy doing \\"Isn't it a pity\\" is one of the greatest.  Sam Brown doing George's final song ever recorded \\"Horse to the water\\" is pretty stunning.  Paul's version of \\"All things must pass\\" is also a top highlight.  Oh yeah, and I wouldn't want to forget Jeff Lynne's \\"The inner light\\" which surprised the poop right out of me, practically. <br /> <br />Everyone on stage knew George and had worked with him before.  This isn't like Yoko's gag-worthy \\"tribute\\" shows to John, where people like Kylie Minogue embarrass themselves doing songs like \\"Help\\" in a techno-dance-pop version (oh yes, remember that?).  This is the classiest tribute ever paid to a departed artist.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|If you feel uncomfortable watching this film, it's because it is about you. Barry Lyndon is a film without a hero (you're not a hero, right?).  When first released it alienated audiences  who were expecting the surrogate melodrama usually served up as historical fiction on the screen. Set in the 18th century, with meticulous attention to period detail never seen before or since (one of the many ways Kubrick was a perfectionist), this film has swordfighting without a hint of swashbuckle.<br /><br />We enter this film through its landscape. What is depicted is a largely rural Irish and English countryside, one that has since been violently raped and murdered. Thanks to pioneering cinematographic techniques we are privledged to see that world much as its contemporaries saw it, and as no other film has shown it. We see and experience life as it once was: and the pace is much slower than we're used to. So MTV doesn't always rule, OK?<br /><br />Visually enchanting, musically sumptuous (with a little help from the Chieftains) and authentic in its depiction of dress, customs, speech and class distinctions as it is, Barry Lyndon is essentially the story of a life. It is, has to be, a common story, one we know often happened in the period: poor boy marries rich widow and squanders fortune. What Thackeray had in mind in his novel was to transcend period and plot, to show something more eternal about human nature. And if Thackeray knew anything at all, he knew man was bound to fail at anything he attempted, most of all when he thought he was succeeding.<br /><br />But Thackeray got stuck in the 19th century. His prose has faded, great writer though he still is, and lacks conviction to a 21st century reader looking for relevance to his own story. One genius has handed on the torch to another.<br /><br />You remember once being a better person. You had ideals. But life got in your way and ever since you've been on the run. So now you're not much better than a grifter. There's so much you want, and you know what will happen if you don't get it. Chances are your parents are good people who didn't get it. All it takes is some glibness, a few risks, a few lies, and keep grabbing those opportunities when they turn up. Sure you feel bad some of the time. In a better world you'd do better. But you always remember what happens to failures: and once you start the climb upward it's hard to stop, no matter how you're compromised.<br /><br />So we, and Barry Lyndon, feel. Enjoy the 18th century period trappings as you will: don't forget this story.<br /><br />Kubrick's film  though refrains from sermonising. There are many who find Kubrick's attitude in his films remote, cold, detached. In Barry Lyndon Kubrick monumentally refrains from judgment. The depiction of this average man on the make who succeeds then fails concentrates on his milieu and makes no comments at all on his rights and wrongs. \\"No man is a hero to his valet\\" said Madame Cornel in the 17th century: Barry Lyndon was no hero to either Thackeray or Kubrick. Just  one of us, mired with the same fate as us all. And from this viewpoint comes a gleam of satire: life really is too tragic to be taken seriously. It takes the perspective the film gives in looking back at the 18th century though to reveal the immense feeling Kubrick has for his characters, and for us all.<br /><br />Some have taken exception to the acting in the film. In some ways the best acting is on the part of the narrator, who has all the best lines. The film can be viewed as a morality play, whose point is precisely summed up in its epilog: good or bad, rich or poor, beautiful or ugly - they are all equal now.at will happen if you don't get it.

0812975219|5.0|Very well written and thoroughly thought through piece of work, research, and thinking. It was very refreshing to read some original insights away from the usual business cacophony that is rampant in majority of today's books. Highly recommended for the intellectually curious or inclined.
B00005JKOI|3.0|John Hughes made Molly Ringwald an 80's star with 16 Candles and The Breakfast Club, so working with the same formula he produced (but did not direct) Pretty in Pink. This time Molly plays a charactor named Andy (why Andy?). Anyway she is from the poor side of the tracks and while she does well in school, she also cares for her heart broken father.<br /><br />Andy does not trust \\"Richies\\", meaning kids with money, or actually kids with rich parents. But she meets a Richie played by Andrew McCarthy and well, love takes root. However 'Duckie' steals the movie away from Molly. He's an oddball type who marches to his own drummer. He loves Andy but can't tell her because he is too afraid. His charactor was perfectly parodied in 'Not Another Teen Movie'.<br /><br />Look for an early Andrew DICE Clay who plays the doorman/bouncer at the nightclub CATS. Also Annie Potts looks pretty hot as Molly's friend.<br /><br />This is an extremely barebones DVD. No commentary, no deleted/alternate scenes, not even a trailer. You get 'PLAY', 'SETUP', and 'SCENE SELECTION'. That's it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Molly Ringwald, 80's flicks, or John Hughes, this will be a welcome addition to your home DVD library.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|...what the heck, why can't I at least sort of like this movie?   <br /> <br />The first time that I saw it (yep, bought it before I saw it) I wasn't so sure.  I think in part because I didn't have the volume turned up very loud, and I missed a lot of what was being said.  Also, I've never read the comic book(s?) that the movie is based off of, which made me even more confused.  This past time that I watched it I turned on the closed caption so that I wouldn't miss anything, and that helped out quite a bit.   <br /> <br />As other reviewers have noted, the storyline is simple enough: John Constantine is trying to help prevent the Devil's son from being born on earth and terrifying all of it's inhabitents.  The special effects are incredible, and I really enjoyed the many visual aspects of the movie.   <br /> <br />The acting is, well, not the best.  I get a kick out of Keanu Reeves, but not so much because I think he's a good actor - more just because it's sort of entertaining watching him make sort of a stooge out of himself trying to look all tough (he was perfect in the Matrix - he was supposed to be the confused guy).  Rachel Weisz (Angela/Isabel Dodson) was by far (in my opinion) the best actor in the whole movie, and the only one who came off as believable for the whole movie.  Gavin Rossdale (Balthazar) is flat out laughable.  He tried to be all mysterious and evil, but he comes across more as seeming like he's in a stand-up routine in which he's trying to convince Barbie that he's far cooler than Ken doll.  It's unfortunate, because his character could have been so much more sinister.  Peter Stormare (Satan/Lucifer), on the other hand, did have the subtleness of his evil played out perfectly and he really came across as terrifying; in a charming way.  Tilda Swinton (Gabriel) was a mixture of good and bad acting: she was fine intially, but the very last scene where she's telling Constantine just how 'well he's doing' is just pathetic.   <br /> <br />I think that I can understand why this movie has had so many poor reviews - many parts of it are awkward and too long, with other parts not being explained well enough for someone unfamiliar with the story.  But I think this movie is alright, in the best sense of the world. <br /> <br />Theologically, the movie is strong at parts and weak at others.  Suicide as always damning is not biblical, and the whole half-breed thing is also a stretch - I found the way that Gabriel, one of the Archangels in the bible, was portrayed as basically evil was unfortunate.  However, Angela is right - you can't buy your way into heaven!  Let it be clear though that I'm not trying to say these are really negative marks against the movie - this movie isn't about theology, it's about entertainment...enjoy!  <br />
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I did not watch Firefly when it was on TV.  I was not a fan of anything Joss Whedon did before (e.g. Buffy the Vampire Slayer).  I point this out because gushing fans can muddy the waters when trying to figure out if something new you haven't heard of is really \\"good\\" or not. <br /> <br />Serenity is a fantastic sci-fi movie.  In fact, it is fantastic entertainment, period.  And I don't say that lightly.  I mean, let's be honest with ourselves, most sci-fi movies are either utter garbage, or nerd fodder with a very narrow appeal.   <br /> <br />This is not the case with Serenity.  It is, quite simply, a great adventure movie, that just happens to be in a futuristic setting.  There is NOT alot of dorky techo-babble being thrown around, you aren't subjected to mock-philosophical babbling, there isn't any magical bullcrap, and there are no goofy aliens geeking things up.  It has good actors portraying fun characters in exciting situations.  There is humor, action, horror, and just a little bit of romance.  All the basics for exciting, entertaining cinema.

0151008116|5.0|My heavens! Mr. Martel shows his intelligence level through the bright and fascinating character 'Pi'. The passages were so thought provoking that the character had almost changed my mind about animals 'being better off in zoos than in the wild'. I wasn't completely convinced, but the argument was so stunning and brilliant that it gave me pause. I found myself considering many passages. Quite a few were paragraphs of wisdom that people feel compelled to paste to their refridgerators. The symbolism through-out the book will certainly keep the students of literature busy. Very well done Yann Martel! This novel is on my 'read it twice' list...<br />Chrissy K. McVay<br />'Souls of the North Wind'
B000050FEN|3.0|Cannot believe so many people think this a \\"masterpiece\\". In what way? You must be out of your screwed-up mind. Overall an very average movie, plot, performance, anything you name it. I don't see much of an intelligence out of this movie. You are drunk, buy it and watch. Otherwise, find something better to watch.
B000B7BRMM|3.0|Krall, fresh from her great \\"departure\\" album \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\", has returned to her jazz roots with this Christmas album... an uneven but overall enjoyable collection. She shines on ballads, of course, such as \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\", but perhaps because the song is so overdone, Krall performs bizarre phrasing on \\"The Christmas Song\\" (ie: E-ehhh vrr-reee buhhhhd-eee knoooooows a turkey and some mistletoe...\\") but recovers to sing some real swing on \\"Let it Snow\\". The orchestra is first rate, but she doesn't always sync up with the band, for some reason.  <br /> <br />The cover photo is about as \\"un-Christmas\\" as you can get, with our \\"girl in another room\\" draped over an old rattan bucket chair with legs spread out and wearing a dress that looks like it was thrown in a clothes dryer after being soaked in rain puddle. Who is responsible for this \\"art direction\\"? It certainly doesn't speak of the Diana Krall I remember of a couple of years ago who was the personification of \\"class\\".
B00005JO1G|4.0|The film 'Jarhead' is based on a book of the same name by by Anthony Swofford; both the book and the film are bound to make some people angry. A Marine sniper (STA) during Desert Storm I in the early 1990s, he recounted his experiences there with vivid emotion, weaving in his experiences of boot camp, adolescence, and civilian life after the Corps in the process. This is now a major motion picture chronicling many aspects of his story, with significant differences.<br /><br />It was apparent in the book, and carries over to the film that Swofford has a chip on his shoulder - something he'll most likely readily admit. He has a 'bad attitude', and in fact revels in it. One wonders if this is a product of his war experiences, his Marine Corps training, or his upbringing. At one point his mother, who never really liked the idea of her son being in the Marines, but who wouldn't stand in her son's way, said 'I lost my baby boy when you went to war.' She described Swofford as being sweet and gentle prior to that, and angry and unhappy afterwards. One wonders how much of a change is there - if one can take the stories at face value, this is the same boy who had a fist-fight with his father over going in the Corps at the age of 17, and who had Marine Corps decals put on his shirts as a child. One of his drill instructors even gave Swofford what he considered a great compliment - 'you'll be a great killer someday.'<br /><br />I make the caveat that one might not be able to take all of this at face value, because like many men in this kind of situation, Swofford is likely to exaggerate - making some pieces more dramatic and other pieces less so. Swofford recounts many tales of men in his sniper platoon who had adjustment problems after the war; one can but wonder if that is true for Swofford, too. Also, Swofford admits to being willing and able to lie if the cause is, in some internal sense, justified - his dealings with brother, in the Army in Germany who later died of cancer, is a case in point.  Then we have the 'made in Hollywood' aspects of the film that mean this can be no documentary, but has to be dramatised.  In fact, truth is probably stranger (not necessarily better or worse) than what is portrayed on the screen.<br /><br />Regardless of the details which may or may not be completely true (and, as with many autobiographical pennings, some of the details are necessarily changed), the emotion certainly is. Perhaps the strongest point that comes across is a sense of disappointment and cynicism - that Swofford has ideals and goals is not at issue, although he does downplay these (he doth protest too much sometimes); but his experiences in the Corps and in the war were not what he dreamed. He mentions at various time the recruiting posters and campaigns - while it is true that Marine Corps never promises an easy life (quite the opposite), rarely does one learn prior to entry that one might end up being on the stirring end of the latrine clean-up detail; of human-refuse dump ablaze and blowing all over the place.<br /><br />Just as in the book, the film gives one a sense of some of the problems that the 'average' grunt faces in combat situations. This war was very different from Vietnam, of course, but some of the issues are the same - interminable waiting, equipment malfunctions (if it isn't just plain missing), fear and bravado in a strange mix, questioning and ambiguity as to the value of the war, the cause, and even their own lives. The Desert Shield/Desert Storm situation is reflected in the page numbers of Swofford's book and the timing of this film - a lot deals with the Desert Shield portion, the hurry-up-and-wait aspect; surprisingly little time is spent with Desert Storm itself, as it was on and over so quickly, relatively speaking.  There is a lot of psychological drama in this film in the waiting aspect; there's also a strong undertone of the absurdity of war.<br /><br />Stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Anthony 'Swoff' Swofford,Jamie Foxx as Sgt. Siek and Peter Sarsgaard as Troy do an excellent job in their respective roles.  Foxx turns in a really good performance, and this must be the year for Gyllenhaal.  Director Sam Mendes (American Beauty, Road to Perdition) takes a tough book and turns it into a tough film, which is not going to replace a film such as 'Full Metal Jacket' or 'The D.I.' for quintessential Marine film, but will most likely in get top billing among many for the portrayals and situations, especially some of the more bizarre and incomprehensible bits.<br /><br />Again, while there is undoubtedly exaggeration here, and one must take some of Swofford's tales with a grain of salt (or, perhaps sand), there is realism and truth in the feelings these situations engendered. I can understand the anger of Marines and other military who read the book and will see the film and feel a sense of betrayal, but I can also understand those who feel that Swofford is saying what others can't or won't say. This is a tough product.  While I would never want the Marine Corps or military to be judged by this one thing, it is a perspective worth including in the overall mix. Snipers have a reputation for being a bit on the fringes anyway, and Swofford's story in that regard is very true to form.f' Swofford, Jamie Foxx as Sgt.

B00097DXZS|1.0|Personally I really enjoyed this album very much, though I do think Santana should do some more of his own work, and get away from the 'guest' albums that have become a regular feature. Musical content gets 4* (its enjoyable but not there with his best). <br /> <br />The copyright protection stinks, and IMHO is probably illegal in most countries (tantamount to virus infection or at least cyber vandalism - if someone did this to Sony's corporate computers there would be a hell of a stink!). For that reason this CD should get less than 0 stars .... DO NOT BUY IT. <br /> <br />Amazon - be brave - refuse to stock these protected albums - it's the only way Sony will learn! <br /> <br />My advice - buy the album from iTunes. You get two bonus tracks, it can be burned to CD and then has no copy protection ... so you can transfer them to your MP3 player (or iPod if you are rich and silly).
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Seems reviewers are picking on Francis Lawrence, blaming him for the flaws, (and in my opinion, this film has none), of Constantine.  But for a high octaine action/horror flick like this, Francis Lawrence did extreamly well.  Not only did he have a good eye for the visuals, (Hell as a twisted mirror image of our own world, brilliant), but he even got a great performance out of Bush lead singer Gavin Rosdale.  Francis Lawrence also did a good job holding onto the intricate plot, letting loose the surprises at just the right times. <br />In the end, if this film has an fault at all, it's that it was released a few years too late.  With Keanu Reeves in the lead, and filled to the brim with computer generated effects, it's inevitable that Constantine will be compared to The Matrix, all though I believe Constantine, and I know I'm in the minority here, is better.
0804106304|3.0|I don't claim to know whether this is an accurate representation of Chinese people or Chinese-Americans, but the book is brilliantly written.  <br />As a daughter, I resonated with the young women's accounts of their relationships, heartaches, strains, and fierce love for their mothers. Mother/daughter relationships are shown to be complicated, and in reality, they are and always have been. To listen to the voices of the mothers- to be invited to share in their pasts was honoring. Amy Tan captures their lives in small, defining moments, which is a talent I don't come by often in my reading life.  <br />As I read Tan's novel, I thought about my mother's relationship with me and her relationship with her mother and knew that there must have been defining moments in my mom's relationship with her mom that directed how the relationship between my mother and I would be. To know my mom has a past, memories, and moments so wrought with emotion which I was never a part of, but because of her, have become a piece of who I am, is really stunning. Tan shows this same realization in the daughters of JLC. Each daughter has a moment where she realizes how much her mother is a part of her and how important that is.  <br />I don't believe Tan wrote the novel to show men, white or Asian, to be chauvinist and horrific people or to dispel or reaffirm stereotypes about Asians. It is a novel about mothers and daughters. The other things merely give this context. In each sequence where a woman is subjected to cruelty by a man, a mother's love or memory shows itself and strengthens the love and bond between the mother and daughter. It brings about new beginnings, new understandings, and new trusts of one to the other.  <br />If Amy Tan lacked the accuracy and reality of Chinese relationships and people, as some believe it did, she made it up in the depth of the mother/daughter relationships she created for her readers.  <br />
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I had never heard of APC before, but I heard \\"Passive\\" (Emotive) on the film Constantine and went looking for the album. I ended up buying 13th Step instead, and I am seriously glad of it. <br />The range this album covers is impressive, varying from the soothing yet haunting lilt of The Nurse Who Loved Me right to the heavy chorus of Pet. <br />The instrumentals add breaks to get your breath back before plunging back in, and people who own or have listened to Emotive will probably smile slightly at the chorus of Pet, blasting out a previous song title and linking the two albums. <br />A wonderful album that, unlike soem of my others, will not fall to the back of my pile after a few weeks. <br />It's wicked.
B000001A3H|4.0|Blues for the Red Sun is definitely the best Kyuss release out of the three available.  This CD is definitely a must have for anyone who closely follows Josh Homme's music.  This CD also has Nick Oliveri playing bass which is always cool.  Though Kyuss is not quite as innovative in its musical sound as Queens of the Stoneage it is still a very solid rock album and one to be proud to have blasting in your car or stereo at home.  So if you sick of MTV \\"pop\\" rock, and like queens of the stoneage, or are a fan of the older style of rock, then pick up Blues for the Red Sun and see how rock is done in the Arizona desert.
B0008ISM40|5.0|its got teeth sharp to hold on to you for a while...not as a good as the previous NIN albums but still pretty strong. <br /> <br />All the songs have their own personality and it's more of a amalgamation of all their previous work, but in a more mature stature coming from Trent(who is now 40yrs old). The hate, the sexuality and the fierce violent antisocial mood is still there within the context of the songs. <br /> <br />Can't deny the great drum roll from Dave Grohl in some songs(you can feel it in the collector)...above all, as an avid listener of NIN and fan, this albums gets me up, down, sad, nostalgic and in the mood to listen to all of their halos(in no particular order).  <br /> <br />highly recommended and NIN's teeth won't bite your head off, but will sure leave a good mark on you.  <br /> <br />

0061015725|5.0|Wow, what a great book.  It was suspenseful from the first page through the last page.  The scary part is wondering what is really true about nanotechnolgy as told in the book compared to reality.  Michael Crichton unabridged is the only way to go, love the book and waiting for the next book to listen (state of fear). <br />
B0002IQHY8|5.0|Being a long time AAP fan this was a very welcome release.  From the get go this CD grabbed me with \\"Return to Tunguska\\".  The tie ins back to previous CD's with \\"Mammagamma\\" and the \\"Return to a Dream Within A Dream\\" are good for nostalgia's sake.  \\"Chomolungma\\" is a great way to end the CD. <br /> <br />To AAP - Thanks for this release.  I hope to see more from you.

B00097DXZS|5.0|I grew up listening to Santana and \\"All That I Am\\" will become \\"classic\\" Santana. Carlos Santana has earned the right to create the music he wants to make and to collaborate with whom he pleases. Long time fans will just sit back and enjoy his magic. He shares his gift with us and the people he \\"teams\\" with on this CD. All the comments like \\"what was he thinking when...\\", \\"why did he choose that person...\\" and \\"this work doesn't compare to...\\" just seem a bit snobbish and jaded to me. Let's just celebrate the fact that Santana is still making great music.
1400032717|5.0|Mark Haddon's debut novel is a funny and brilliant journey into the the autistic mind of Christopher Boone - it is a murder mystery, an alternate world view and a social drama all wrapped up and seen through a \\"different\\" 15 year old's eyes.<br /><br />Christopher is mathematically brilliant (and often solves complex equations or computes higher powers of 2 to entertain himself and improve concentration) but is a social misfit - he hates being touched and often finds it difficult to understand others and communicate. Christopher's investigations to find the murderer of a neighbor's dog leads him to other things in his life...<br /><br />Mark Haddon's style is extremely visual in nature and his skillful potrayal of Christopher helps you connect with the autistic as well as the normal side of yourself simultaneously. It makes (at least the more mathematical amongst us) see how close they are to being like Christopher. Christopher's collection of Factoids about prime numbers, science and nature is impressive too.<br /><br />Thoroughly enjoyable.
B0009S2T0M|5.0|I don't even want to analyze or write anything about the plot since I see a whole lot of helpful reviews already on this site that makes most major reviewers to same. Thanks for the great reviews!<br /><br />But I want to say that \\"Oldboy\\" is one of the best shocking films I've ever seen, and I watch a lot of movies. Trust me when everyone writes about 'what a great ending' one must be curious of the ending and maybe for that reason one should buy or rent this movie to atleast experience the buzz. This movie could be watched many times and each time the viewer will discover new clues and messages and foreshadowing.  This isn't the type of movie an American viewer should wait for the Hollywood to remake, because this isn't the type of movie hollywood will ever have the guts to make or remake. So watch this Asian movie (Asian movies are good people and subtitles aren't a taboo) and the dvd also have english language dubbed. I really don't see the fuss about the movie being short for American release because it did read 120 minutes as the original is supposed to run, so don't buy into those comments that this is a cut version (because I'm surprised they even got a R-rating and they haven't cut anything or I wouldn't be surprised, right).
B000286RNY|5.0|I remember seeing this on a movie channel down in BC. I thought it was OK, but then I rented the DVD, watched the chinese version (112 minutes) and it was wayyyyy better.<br /><br />STORY: A man named Sing (Chow) is a kung-fu master. He meets a soccer coach, who is not satisfied by his Kung-fu techniques. Then, Sing meets a girl, and gets his relatives together to play a game of kung-fu soccer!<br /><br />THOUGHTS: I really loved the film. Excellent, exciting, fun, and it makes \\"Slap Shot\\" look like the worst movie ever. I loved it!<br /><br />So if you like Kung-fu and sports, or if you liked Kung-Fu Hustle, You'll love this movie!
0394818237|5.0|I received this book when I was probably 6 or 7 years old, and have loved it ever since.  I thought I had lost it or left it at my parents home, and was all set to buy another one when I realized I still had it. I was so happy!  :)  I would have been sick having to buy the abridged version.  Why they would abridge this book is beyond me, so needless to say, mine is now a classic!  Richard  Scarry's Please and Thank You book is a classic as well.
B000BW7QWW|1.0|Serenity is a movie that apeals to the geekiest of geeks.  The dialogue is lame and the storyline whilst having potential is ruined by corny and cheesy attempts at comedy, not to mention the substandard acting. <br />Considering the fact that the firefly series was a failure on Fox, it is no suprise at all that Serenity was also a failure at the box office. The only suprise is how bad Serenity actually was even compared to the failed firefly series.
B000008LOU|5.0|The top 50 reviewer who gave this a 3 needs to go review some more toasters and see if he can get in the top 10 or something.  This is the Wilburys!  They could sit around and pick their noses and belch and still deserve 4 stars.   <br /> <br />While this CD is not as good as Volume 1, you have to consider this one in light of the fact that Volume 1 is at least a 12 on a scale of 5 so it is possible for Volume 3 to be less than Volume 1 and still be a 5. <br /> <br />Other supergroups with similar levels of talent, like Crosby, Stills, Nash, & Young, were riddled with strife because of competing talents.  The Wilburys, on the other hand, were all so good that they didn't have to compete with each other or to even use their real names.  One of the biggest sorrows in rock and roll is that they never toured as The Travelling Wilburys.  That would have probably been the top concert tour in rock and roll history even to this day. <br /> <br />These guys are great and The Traveling Wilburys, Volume 3 only gets a 5 because that's all the stars Amazon will allow.

B000002GFT|5.0|Liege and Lief, recorded in 1969, continued the work of Cecil Sharp (1859-1924) in the documentation and revival of British folk music. The band members were Sandy Denny on vocals, Dave Mattacks on drums, Ashley Hutchings on bass guitar, Simon Nicol on guitars, Dave Swarbrick on violin and viola, and Richard Thompson on guitars. Two other Fairport Convention albums released in 1969, Unhalfbricking and What We Did On Our Holidays, also have Sandy Denny on vocals.<br /><br />Some excerpts of the song lyrics:<br />\\"Come All Ye\\" - \\"Come all ye rolling minstrels, And together we will try; To rouse the spirit of the earth, And move the rolling sky.\\"<br />\\"Reynardine\\" - \\"Your beauty so enticed me, I could not pass it by; So it's with my gun I'll guard you, All on the mountains high.\\"  {the \\"sly old Reynardine\\" sequesters a young woman},<br />\\"Matty Groves\\" - \\"I'd rather kiss from dead Matty's lips than you or your finery.\\" {Lord Donald slays his cheating wife and her lover, whom she met at church.}<br />\\"Farewell,Farewell\\" - \\"The cold north wind will blow again, The winding road does call.\\"<br />\\"The Deserter\\" - \\"Court martial, court martial, then quickly was got, And the sentence passed upon me, that I was to be shot.\\"<br />\\"Medley: The Lark In The Morning/Rakish Paddy/Fox-Hunter's Jig/Toss The Feathers\\" - (instrumental)<br />\\"Tam Lin\\" - \\"But tonight is Halloween, and the faery folk ride, Those that would their true love win at Miles Cross they must buy.\\" {a Scottish tale with many versions}<br />\\"Crazy Man Michael\\" - \\"Michael he whistles the simplest of tunes, And asks the wild woods their pardon; For his true love is flown into every flower grown, And he must be keeper of the garden.\\"
B00005JNJV|4.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" is the best of the franchise, beating Tim Burton's first film, which was better than his sequel; both were certainly better than the last two directed by Joel Schumacher. All were bound by comic book fantasy, full of superheroes battling bogeymen. Writer-director Christopher Nolan chucks that formula and gives us a real man in a real city up against his own insecurities and, to be sure, real villains. The script returns to the beginning, when Bruce Wayne was a boy, and the missing seven years before the young man dons cape and cowl.    Burton showcased Jack Nicholson's sideshow mugging; the other films also focused on outlandish bad guys and gals, almost sidelining The Caped Crusader. Here the villains are life-size; it is Batman who looms large. It is he in whom we invest our understanding and emotion. Nolan and his production staff owe a debt to Ridley Scott's futuristic Los Angeles (\\"Blade Runner.\\") But the success of his movie rests on the shoulders of its star, Christian Bale, who now owns the role if he wants it.    Bale gets boffo support from Linus Roache as the do-gooder father; Liam Neeson as his Ninja trainer and mentor; Rutger Hauer and Morgan Freeman, who run his father's financial empire; Michael Caine as his butler and conscience; Tom Wilkinson as the city's crime boss; Cilian Murphy as a creepy asylum keeper; and Gary Oldman as a cop, his first good guy role. Even Katie Holmes is passable as an assistant DA, a damsel able to handle any distress. But the resourceful Bale, physically and emotionally, is the whole show.    Well, maybe not the whole show. The locations, the plethora of bats, and detailed sets are a marvel, especially the batcave. CG imagining is used sparingly, so real environments interface impressively with the actors. The fight sequences could have been edited better and the menus on this two-disc DVD are a challenge. Although there is no commentary tract, there are enough extras to satisfy any Batman fan. Thanks to \\"Batman Begins,\\" there may be a lot more of them than before.
B000051VWW|4.0|Sade. What a voice . So smooth. The real hit song on this CD is Track 1 By your side. Sade has a voice which is very relaxable to listen to. That`s for sure. To listen to here is a fine cure for depression. Here voice has a certain mood over it, that realy makes you shiver in a good way. Some other trax are a mixed bag, but anyway the Cd shines quality all trough. The best thing about Sade is that she knows here roots. There are no hiss,rumble, and creative blip blop that some call music on this Cd. There are not to much tempo up beat songs on this CD, but why ? Track 4  Somebody already broke my heart is also a winner track with hit potential, with a very effective synthesier sound in the background which realy lift the musical picture all trough. There also some light reggea rythm on Track 6 Slave Song, for a change. Great song. Anyway. This album is solid enough to cure depression and make youre mind in better shape all trough the day.
B0006A9FMI|4.0|Pros: This anime makes you think, a lot.  There are lots of philosophical mumbo-jumbo here, enough that even the average Japanese have to see the movie multiple times to understand the dialogues.  The English translation actually simplies the dialogs a  bit so it helps us non-japanese speakers to understand this film better.      The movie looks good.  This would mean that the characters are designed very well and some of the CGI scenes are simply gorgeous.   The sound effects blend well into the movie.  The movie soundtrack is lovely.      Cons: On the bonus section of the movie the Director explains that he created this as an Anime Drama for adults.  At times I feel that the anime is taking itself too seriously with all of the quotes and philosophies.  Some dialogues feel like they are forced and superficial, which other thought provoking dialogues go by too fast without a break for the viewers to think about what was just said.  I had to pause the anime a few times to discuss the dialogues/plot with my wife, who happens to be Japanese.  Hmm.. very useful.      As many reviewers pointed out already, the subtitles are not always accurate.  Mrs.flyingaho points out that some of the dialogues could not be translated literally.  She thinks that the anime is a great love story.  yeah.  I have a feeling Dreamworks could of done a better job at translating.      Overall, I really enjoyed the movie.  It's unfortunate that many people, myself included, won't fully \\"get\\" the movie.  There are definitely moments in this anime which inspired or influenced other good movies such as Matrix and I Robot.  Anyway, Man vs Machine, Man becomes machine, Man loves machine type of topics which this anime raises make good lunch topic to discuss with your geek friends.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|After I heard so many geeks out there rave about Firefly I figured I'd check out Serenity. I enjoyed every minute of the movie. The character development is top notch. None of the usual drivel you get from most sci-fi movies. You fall in love with the characters, they are humanized, brought alive. You care about them. You embrace them and root for them.<br /><br />After I saw the movie I jumped online and ordered the Firefly boxed set. I just finished watching the set this evening. Naturally it didn't have the budget of Serenity but I found the same emotions and enjoyment.<br /><br />Joss Whedon's world of Firefly/Serenity is wonderfully constructed. Don't miss out on seeing this movie.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Fans expecting DM's music to be poppy and catchy like it was in the eighties will be disappointed by this CD, although \\"Lilian\\" and \\"Precious\\" are catchy throw back-type songs from the bygone era.  DM's music since SOFAD has been more raw and packed with more emotion.  Perhaps it's not as easy to listen to but it doesn't  mean the music is any less relevant or meaningful.  \\"The Pain I'm used to,\\" \\"John the Revelator,\\" and \\"Suffer Well\\" go toe to toe with any DM song throughout their history.
B00000JPYD|5.0|Trower has the deepest reverb sound ever heard. He sounds like he's a half-mile away from you, playing through a big steel pipe! That, coupled with his seasick, warbling uni-vibe on all the time, and you feel stoned just listening to him. It's a brilliant sound-style that I'm still addicted to, after all these years... Is it a shameless Hendrix-cop? Sure it is, and I love it. You do too- go on and admit it... The songs? Well, you know them all by heart. In all of their seasick, warbling glory. The lyrics? Well, it aint' Lennon/McCartney but you won't find inspired guitar playing such as this on any Beatles album. Is it the greatest guitar album of all time? Yes, because \\"Electric Lady Land\\" is too un-even and does not hypnotize with it's sound the way that this album does. Buy the re-master and play it loudly, and fall under it's beautiful magical spell...
B00097DXZS|3.0|The collabolations with various guests vocalists did not create real Santana magic I wanted.  I expected more charged feeling that they feed to each other by playing together.  I love the catchy 'Brown Skin Girl' with Bo Bice, 'Just Feel Better' with Steven Tyler, & \\"I Don't Wanna Lose Your Love' with Los Lonely Boys.  Michelle Branch and Mary J. Blige songs and other Hip-Pop tunes put me off, and it's a shame they come at the beginning.  By the time I got to track 11 & 12, I was already bored.  I want more fire like Santana & his band had on Webcast on his release party in New York.
B000002GKT|4.0|...And Marshall Plexis' turned up to \\"eleven\\". This is a great live album done in a style that is long gone. I make it a point to play this album for my kids and their friends (being working-class white people, we ALL play electric guitar)to expose them to a sound and vibe that they missed out on. If for no other reason, this album is important. It also ROCKS in a major-ly way!!! Played back to back with \\"Frampton comes alive!\\" it shows itself to be the blueprint for the biggest live album of the 70's... Peter Frampton is the master of the hard-rock turnaround, and every other guitar cliche'. He has inspired more kids to pick up an electric guitar than anyone else including Hendrix. Steve Marriot is the proto-typical white-boy blues rocker and Jerry Shirley/Greg Ridley were the BEST rhythm section in any band at the time. This is an album that should be enshrined in the Smithsonian and shot into space on those probes going to other galaxies... Other life forms are fortunate if they have musicians this inspired, and concerts this great. PLAY IT LOUD...

I won gold in 6 events and set the world record in the \\"How high can you count?\\". <br />This album is ok, but Genius? Come on Raymond!

B000002JR8|5.0|This is the album that singularly changed my opinion on Pantera. Up to this point I was not really a fan of the band. I bought Cowboys From Hell and I thought `ehhhhh'.<br /><br />I bought Vulgar Display of Power and was immediately impressed that Pantera was heavier than on CFH. But something didn't quite click for me. Even still - I like Vulgar but I skip through songs and I don't hold it up to this masterpiece.<br /><br />Far Beyond Driven is freaking tremendous. Dimebag reaches new heights on his riffery - and it's hard to comprehend how good some of these songs are. Phil becomes the man - a screaming, growling entity that lays his mind bare with some of the most intense self-examining lyrics around. Phil stops trying to sing and in doing so, he scream himselfs into one of the best vocalists in metal.<br /><br />The first time I heard `Shedding Skin' my brain exploded. To this day, that song breeds something primal in me and makes me want to destroy. That's the beauty of Pantera - you cannot deny their power and their energy.<br /><br />The band simply gels as one complete pulse of metal - and they make it seem easy!

So why did I feel like my paycheck was always shrinking? The responsibilties of my coporate career grew as fast as my tax obligations! I was feeling so financially strained, friends started teasing me for being \\"cheap\\". They all thought I made a lot of money and by most people's standards, I did. I really couldn't explain what was happening to me until I read this book. Be warned! If you had parents who encouraged you to get good grades, so you can get a good job, you might be a little upset with them after reading this book. Robert Kiyosaki is a wonderful story teller. He explains the financial path we're taught in school and by our parents and then presents a different option. He doesn't teach get quick schemes or any one method. His goal is to change your outlook on personal wealth and he's very effective. I highly recommend this book.

B000BB1MIC|1.0|Season 4 of Gilmore ended on very dramatic notes: adultery, Luke and Lorelai getting together, Emily leaving Richard so as not to lose Lorelai, Digger's lawsuit which could cost Richard all his money (and thus Rory's education), and the development of secondary characters like Lane and Kirk. <br /> <br />Within 8 episodes of Season 5, I realized none of these plots would be resolved.  Yes, maybe one or two resolved in a superficial manner, but not in any emotional, reality-based way.  <br /> <br />BEWARE - the rest of this post has spoilers! <br /> <br />You will not see any repercussions for Rory committing adultery with Dean, helping to end his marriage.  None.  Where were the incredibly gossipy townies condemning Rory as she walked hand in hand with Dean, only days after his wife publicly kicked him out of the marriage?  Nowhere to be heard.  Rory suffered no consequences, and when Dean, the \\"love of her life\\", left her, she shed a single tear, and one hour later was in a limo of packed rich kids, laughing drunk, and wearing $100,000 worth of jewelry. <br /> <br />But enough of that.  What was more atrocious was the complete ruination of Richard and Emily's characters.  They immediately team up to sabotage Luke.  Why would Emily want to hurt Lorelai (even if it's \\"for her own good\\") when last year she did everything possible to be back with her?  She left Richard for her!  Absolutely ridiculous.  Instead of mature scenes where Emily explains her actions and love to Lorelai, we get re-dredging of 4 years of acrimony.  <br /> <br />So many obvious plot points,  You can see the writers thinking: how can we throw troubles into Luke and Lorelai's relationship?  I know, let's bring back Christopher!!  Obvious, dull, and ridiculous.  And we have to watch these confrontations during an inane 2nd wedding for the elder Gilmores (who cares?).  After enjoying this show for 4 years, I gave up at this point, though kept watching to see how worse it would get. <br /> <br />Rorydevolved from an independent, intelligent, plucky girl, to a weak-willed party-girl hanging around a rich, superficial frat boy.  Oh, and we're such a quirky show, she steals a boat! <br /> <br />So many other things were done just for quirkiness this season, and which were patently ridiculous.  Jackson's forced vasectomy!  Ha Ha! (Why not a forced tube tying for Sookie?  Because the advertisers would have all bailed on the show).  Drunken Paris begging for money! (that was the extent of her character arc this year).  Lorelai's 15 minute pregnancy scare. <br /> <br />And Lorelai and Luke together?  Barely any affection shown at all - he builds her an ice skating rink (!!) and she doesn't even kiss or hug him.  Did either say \\"I love you\\"? - I've forgotten.  Enough.  And don't expect any better for Season 6 - it degenerates further. And I once enjoyed this show.  Ughh.
B0007CNXUU|4.0|Finding Neverland is a beautiful family film about playwright James Barrie (played by Johnny Depp). Barrie, who has unfortunately just weathered the commercial failure of his latest play, happens upon a fatherless family in the park. Sylvia Llewelyn Davies' husband has passed away, and she has been left to care for four very rambunctious boys: Peter, Jack, George, and Michael. Barrie falls in love with the young boys, and to an extent with their mother, because he discovers they stoke his own child-like imagination. Together, Barrie and the boys are pirates, cowboys, circus performers, and more. Inspired by the little family, and particularly by Peter Davies (played with aching accuracy by Freddie Highmore), Barrie pens the stage play Peter Pan, which is a resounding commerical and critical success for him.<br /><br />This movie is a beautiful story about imagination, renewal, and growing up. Young Peter is scarred by the death of his father, and he observes his mother's illness with growing trepidation. He is an old soul in a young body, which seems to be why Barrie names his own primary character after him. Barrie hopes that Peter can feel young again, can rediscover the carefree life of childhood. Of course, there are complications. Barrie's wife, Mary (played by Radha Mitchell), doesn't appreciate all of the time he spends with the Davies family, nor of the affection he feels for Sylvia. As well, Sylvia's mother disapproves of Barrie's presence in her daughter's life. However, our protagonist overcomes both obstacles, and the resulting story is both hopeful and triumphant.<br /><br />The performances in the film were particularly good. Depp is subtle and endearing as Barrie, playing a character much more true-to-life than his turns as fantastical Jack Sparrow, Willy Wonka, and Edward Scissorhands. Winslet is also excellent. Some of the scenes in which she revealed and dealt with Sylvia's illness were wonderful little gems in the film. She makes Sylvia such a likable character that it is difficult not to root for her whole-heartedly. Also, Freddie Highmore was astonishing as young Peter. I loved him in the scenes at the premiere of the play. A surprising new talent.<br /><br />I also enjoyed the way the film invited the viewer into Barrie's imagination. During some scenes, flashes of what Barrie imagines (flying children, a ship tossed on rough seas, a dancing bear) are interspersed with dull reality. It was a very effective technique.likable character that it is difficult not to root for her whole-heartedly. Also, Freddie Highmore was astonishing as young Peter.

B000AU9UYC|3.0|After watching Batman Begins on DVD, I really wish I had seen it in the theatre, on the big screen! To be honest, I was a little wary upon hearing that ANOTHER Batman movie was going to be made, but this film does the legend justice.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the movie starts rather haltingly, with the viewer seeing images of a young Bruce Wayne trapped in a cave, terrified of the bats that live there, juxtaposed with scenes of an older Wayne (played by Christian Bale) in a foreign prison. Viewers then witness more scenes from Wayne's childhood, interspersed with his odd (and slightly insane) journey to martial arts mastery. However, once Wayne leaves the \\"League of Shadows\\" (corny, but that's the name), the story begins to pick up. Fortified by his newly-minted combat skills, he returns to Gotham, where he vows to clean up the city's crime problem.<br /><br />Of course, adventure ensues! Viewers are treated to \\"the making of Batman,\\" including the wit and heart of such characters as devoted butler Alfred Pennyworth (played perfectly by Michael Cain) and cunning scientist Lucius Fox (played by Morgan Freeman). I cannot say enough about the impact of both Cain and Freeman on this film. They both offer an experience and a mastery of their craft that is a pleasure to watch. Cain gives the film some of its most emotional moments, but he is never too maudlin or sentimental. Freeman, though not the father figure that Cain is, is a cunning friend to the young billionaire, and he provides lots of chuckles and smiles by the virtue of his excellent line delivery and facial expressions. I thoroughly enjoyed both of their performances. (Gary Oldman, as Lt. Gordon, isn't shabby, either. He makes a great cop and a great \\"good guy.\\") Bale was good in the film, but it is difficult for me to see him as an actor, cloaked as he is in the whole Batman mystique. (So much of it is the cape and the ears, right?) Katie Holmes played Wayne's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, now a young lawyer with Gotham's D.A. office. Though her role wasn't large, I thought she turned in a solid performance.<br /><br />This was a fun action film, and I didn't think it was too violent for young families. However, if you are planning on buying the DVD in order to get extras such as deleted scenes, interviews with the actors or technicians, or other goodies, think twice!! Our DVD contained nothing except the movie and its trailer. We found this VERY DISAPPOINTING. Shame on you, Warner!!awyer with Gotham's D.A. office.

B000BB1MI2|1.0|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of my favourite books that I practically grew up with. And like all ardent fans of the book, I felt irked and disgusted when Burton tweaked and changed many details that were lovingly crafted by Dahl in my much-loved tome. Mike Teevee is a TV addict for goodness' sake. The book is a timeless classic and it does not need to be \\"updated\\" by turning him into a video game addict. Also, the changes made to Violet are just, well...not very amusing. What irked me most is the fact that Burton threw in that \\"Wonka-dysfuntional family-dentist-father-reconciliation\\" storyline nonsense thingummyjig. What was that about? The movie was turned into your typical Hollywood fare with just the right amount of mush to make terry-cloth sweatsuit clad fat housewives and their minions go \\"Awwwwwwww, Willy Wonka is just misunderstood due to the relationship with his father.\\" Johnny Depp gave his most banal performance ever with none of the spark and zest of the character that Dahl had created as the owner of the factory. Alas. The movie shouldn't have strayed from the novel, methinks. I was NOT amused.
1400032717|4.0|I got this book after I won a contest. I initally thought after reading the title blurb that it would be a boring yarn about an autistic boy and did not read this for about 2 months. Later as I ran out of good books to read , I started reading it & I couldnt put it down. Personally I prefer thrillers and whodunits but this book really hooked me in. The character development is fantastic. The way the book goes on through the perspective of the boy is great. I also read the Rule Of Four which tries to kill time by writing loads of rubbish about the characters. The authors of \\"Rule Of Four\\" should read this book to understand what character development is.  <br />This book would make a fantastic movie too. Not a Hallmark channel one but an actual feature film.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Just a great movie with great dialouge, effects, story and most importantly heart. Just watch it, that's all I can say, it's an amazing experience.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you haven't seen the series, you might think of this as just some corny space cowboy movie, and it's far from it. Taking each point the detractors have made, here we go  <br /> <br />1. Weak special effects  <br />Anyone who's seen the series and heard Joss Whedon talk about this film (or knows his past work), knows his shows are not about special effects. If you're into sci-fi for special effects, then Serenity's not for you. If you like story and character development - then you''ll love this. <br /> <br />2. Corny dialog -  <br />At first, I'm tempted to say \\"it's sci-fi, since when has there been good dialog in sci-fi\\" but that's not the right in this case. The dialog is how real people talk, it's not sexy or well thought out five minutes in advance. It's not like watching Friends where everyone is \\"on\\" all the time. Some jokes hit the mark and some don't, it's human nature. <br /> <br />Also, if you think the dialog is corny - go back and watch the original Star Wars. Or Empire, or Revenge of the Jedi. C'mon, those things are corn-fests. <br /> <br />3. Poor acting -  <br />I don't buy that for a minute, I think people's judgement of the acting is clouded by the fact that there are no big names in the film. However, they are all good actors. And a heck of a lot better than some of those $20 million a movie actors.  <br /> <br />If you're looking for a sci fi movie written with more intelligence and character, and less focused on epic spaceship battles and Death Stars, this is where it's at. If you want a summer blockbuster, then go elsewhere.
0671015206|4.0|Good combination of both strict reporting about their findings of typical millionaires and action plans to imitate.  It's definitely got a good bit of academic flair about it -- especially early on -- and as such is a bit tedious at times, but at the same time it is written for someone with an IQ above 80 -- unlike many personal finance books. <br /> <br />It was a bit contradictory in places -- most millionaires spend so much time managing their investments; but yet, most millionaires don't touch their investments -- and most millionaires are their own financial advisors, but yet most millionaires pay lots of money for good financial advisors. <br /> <br />It is humorously ironic that the typical millionaire would not have purchased this book, he'd borrow it from the library. I did too, so I guess I'm destined to be a millionaire!
B00001OH7U|4.0|1976 was not a banner year for rock and roll. Few artists were at the top of their game, and most were wallowing in some type of pre-disco morass, searching out the next trend to enhance their style. Bowie was no different, really. He had abandoned Ziggy for the Thin White Duke, but knew that the off-the-rack image he was promoting needed to be tweaked somewhat. Station to Station exemplifies \\"the return of the thin white duke\\" (It's actually the very first lyric that Bowie sings here, on the title song) but with a radical return to his artful tendencies.<br /><br />Every song on this album (there are only six) is remarkable in its own way. The leadoff title track takes forever to build up, then launches into overdrive trance rock, as if it were carrying you to another place. \\"Golden Years\\" and \\"Word On a Wing\\" are both exquisitely arranged, with the former being the most suggestive of Bowie's Young Americans phase. \\"TVC15\\" is perhaps the album's best track, though, with a wavery piano riff that sounds as futuristic as the novel extra-sensory device suggested by the title. It's pure fun and fantasy, and it segues beautifully into the robust, hearty funk riff of \\"Stay\\" To end the album, Bowie is brave enough to cover a ballad that was once made famous by Johnny Mathis. He reinvents \\"Wild Is the Wind\\" until it becomes his own, proving that in 1976, Bowie was less concerned with what everyone was doing, and he was creating a futuristic, spatial niche that would become a perfect fit with pre-punk experimentalism.  A- Tom Ryan
B000AYEIZY|5.0|If you are a Cream or a bluesy Clapton fan then you will regret not getting this CD.  I always liked Cream but this CD made me truly appreciate the excitement of many of non-radio songs (Spoonful, Politician, etc.), which actually come off much better live than the radio staples.  This is definitely a concert by three equals:  Clapton is in terrific form in the role of a guitar player and occasional singer; Jack Bruce kills on the bass and lends his distinctive lead vocals; Ginger beats the hell out the drums and occasionally chimes in with his distinctive Cockney voice.  I find myself listening tracks repeatedly just to follow what one of them is doing throughout the song without getting distracted by the better known licks!  Would have been awesome to see live.  Can't wait to check out the DVD. <br /> <br />Come on, go for it!
B00005JO1G|5.0|Most war movies are obviously categorized as \\"action\\" movies, but this is slightly different. The men have gone through their Marine bootcamp training, where they've gained the confidence and pride necessary to do their jobs, thanks to their somewhat sterotypical monsterish drill sergeant (think of Louis Gossett in AN OFFICER AND A GENTLEMAN). Jake Gyllenhaal plays the real life Anthony Swofford, who is further tormented and molded into an elite sniper by Jamie Foxx as Sergeant Sykes (Foxx is excellent). Swofford adds to the differences found in this movie - he is set off from the others by his detached personality (he reads Camus, for one thing). When the first Irag War breaks out they are ready and gung-ho for action.<br /><br />But here where the war movie action would typically begin, inaction comes to dominate. The men don't fight, but wait to fight (as the days tick by, their numbers are flashed on the screen). Talk comes to replace action - Foxx spiels about his great love for the Marines, the men fantasize about well, what men fantasize about, old movie images of war (such as APOCALYPSE NOW) take over for the real thing. Sometimes crazy things take place - a football game played wearing gas masks, for example.<br /><br />Sometimes the men are shown under great stress, weeping and cracking up, though it's hard to see exactly why, as if director Mendes was just trying to show us these guys have emotions after all. Mendes is also not above making cheap shots: \\"We never have to come back [here] again,\\" says one Marine at war's end - sharp elbow in ribs just in case we didn't get the irony.<br /><br />But the acting is excellent, and the camaraderie among the men rings true. And the bleak desert landscape is rendered starkly and well by Roger Deakins. The fact that things are over before you know it and it's the training and the waiting that weighs the heaviest comes across pointedly in this movie.
B000009FJL|5.0|If they had just made this one album and dropped off the face of the Earth, it would stand as an obscure classic of folk-prog that would command hundreds of dollars at record fairs.  As it stands, they first became Progressive Rock standard-bearers and then later took over the world commercially, so this album kind of gets overlooked as a signpost on their career trajectory, largely because it is the last not to feature the drummer and guitarist whom they would recruit in the months following its release, and who would solidify what many if not most feel is the \\"classic\\" lineup of this legendary group. <br /> <br />That said, this is a magnificent album.  The elaborate song structures they would become known for, with the challenge always present of how to cohesively marry disparate sections of contrasting melodic and rhythmic content, begin to come to the fore here.  All 6 tunes have charms all their own, particularly Visions of Angels (perhaps about the disorienting ecstasy of the Divine?), Stagnation (about a man who uses his innumerable riches to bury himself in a vast subterranean bunker to await Armageddon), Dusk (a serene meditation on mortality with a gorgeous flute solo) and the first of the signature epics for which they would garner their reputation, The Knife, with its refrain of \\"Some of you are going to die...martyrs, of course to the Freedom I shall provide!\\" could truly be torn from today's headlines, be they about Bin Laden or Bush or both.  Amazing to think that the incredibly emotional and urgent vocals in these songs are handled by someone barely 20 years old at the time... they bear the imprint of someone much older, somehow.  But then, that's why PG is a household name after 3 and a half decades, right? <br /> <br />Another thing: make sure you get the European version that is the Definitive Edition remaster, it is sonically eons ahead of the muddier US version available on MCA.  Overall, this is a must have for Progressive Rock fans in particular and lovers of good music in general. <br />
B00005JNJV|4.0|I've submitted this review twice - I deleted the first one - and each time, within hours, it gets a slew of \\"not helpful\\" votes.  Why?  I gave it 4 stars fer Pete's sake!  And I pointed out a genuine problem with the formatting that I think might be of value to potential buyers. But NOOOO ... any review that doesn't say \\"Oooh, what a great movie!\\" gets voted \\"not helpful\\" by its fans.  This certainly undermines my faith in Amazon's ratings, as apparently only THE MOST FAVORABLE reviews get high marks.  Readers beware!<br /><br />Anyhow, \\"Batman Begins\\" certainly contains some spectacular moments (e.g. the \\"Tibet\\" sequence, actually filmed in Iceland) and the plot contains enough twists to keep you guessing -- but Christian Bale never really brings The Batman to life, and the Grand Finale is all too predictable. Except for the surprise identity of the Evil Mastermind, there's little to distinguish the last half-hour of the movie; it's the same old chase/fight mix we've come to expect in movies of this genre.<br /><br />Also, although the DVD I rented is described as \\"Widescreen,\\" on my wide-aspect TV the image shows up with bars on the top and bottom, as well as on both sides. Instead of filling the whole screen, it floats in the center, a shrunken version of what it should be. I was able to enlarge it by going to \\"panorama\\" mode, but this creates distortion at the edges.<br /><br />So, overall, 4 stars -- above average, but hardly the masterpiece some have proclaimed it to be.
B000ASDFJU|3.0|Let me just start out by saying that I love Sex and The City. LOVE IT. However, I am so disappointed with the new set. I waited to have this one and am not thrilled with cheap cardboard slots that the precious discs are stored in. With repeated ins and outs, they will get scratched and no matter how careful you are, it will be inevitable. And the PAPER?? Come on!!! There is alot of good stuff, but overall, I wish I'd gotten the other one a month ago and had all this time to enjoy it.
B00011V8CW|3.0|For the first time in his career, Bowie has made an album that relies as much on his sax playing as it does on his vocals, and the results are promising. At its release, Black Tie, White Noise comes on the heels of Bowie's most uninspired work in decades, perhaps ever, so this collection is notable in that it marks a rather obvious turn towards something more inspired. It's still odd, though, even for Bowie, especially since it contains a great deal of funk-based instrumentals. Bowie shares production duties here with Nile Rodgers, his able assistant for the highly successful \\"Let's Dance\\" album, but they do not lean on any of their techniques from that album, instead creating something entirely different. As expected, Rodgers brings the funk, which serves as the fundamental basis for the entire album. That leaves Bowie to provide the flavoring, so he adds plenty of Middle Eastern spice, along with some skewed, contemporary sounding riffs.<br /><br />Bowie stretches out on Black Tie White Noise, allowing his sax to take center stage on many of the album's arrangements. Bowie's saxophone playing has been both underutilized and under-appreciated, but this album corrects any misperceptions about his playing. His tone is clear, and his riffing is both imaginative and enjoyable. Granted, he is no jazz master, but his playing does surpass the typical honking associated with most rock and roll sax playing.<br /><br />Although the album never quite gels into anything cohesive, it does contain some interesting moments. At the top of that list is a searing, funky cover of Cream's \\"I Feel Free,\\" where Bowie provides the song with a solid rhythm that the original version lacked. \\"Miracle Goodnight\\" is built around a simple but engaging hook that playfully toys with the dance rhythm that percolates underneath, suggesting `no-wave' pop/jazz at its finest. Also notable is \\"Looking For Lester,\\" a reference to trumpeter Lester Bowie (no relation), who is prominently featured here, but it may also be a sly reference to saxophonist Lester Young, since Bowie wails unabashedly and coaxes some very interesting (sonically treated) tones from his instrument in the process. The biggest problem here, though, is a lack of variety. The dance-based rhythms are relentless and start to wear down, especially since the production is extremely dense and heavy, suggesting the most annoying aspects of Rodgers' affiliation with Robert Palmer and Duran Duran. The solution is to excerpt the best songs for a personal mix tape, since most will spring to life when removed from the context of the entire album.

B00008BXJ6|5.0|Released in 1976 as a compilation of AC/DC's first two Australian releases, T.N.T. and High Voltage, High Voltage does a very good job of introducing AC/DC to the US. From start to finish, High Voltage is a solid soundtrack filled with Angus and Malcolm's excellent guitar playing, Bon Scott's shrill yet powerful singing, and Phil Rudd's awesome drumming. There is not a dull track off of the album, and it can easily be played from the beginning with out pressing the skip button once. Though High Voltage is missing several tracks from the Australian releases, most of them are available on AC/DC's 1984 release, \\"'74 Jailbreak\\". Some definate classics from the CD are, Rock N' Roll Singer, Live Wire, She's Got Balls, and High Voltage. Though not their best album, Back in Black holds that award, High Voltage is a definate buy, and a necessary record for any AC/DC fan or rock music fan for that matter.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Having not watched Firefly before seeing Serenity, going into the theatre I expected yet-another-scifi-movie. Boy was I wrong. I got Serenity - the best movie ever made. <br /> <br />The writing is stellar and the acting sublime, the directing is top-notch (naturally) and the plot pure genius. And that was the most shocking thing - Serenity surprised me. The characters are funny and spontaneous, neither overdone nor contrived. They are not drawn from stereotypes or cliches - they are entirely original, entirely new. The many plot twists are novel, and will catch you off your guard. Even the action sequences are original - they ooze with a style and elegance never before seen. <br /> <br />Most of all, however, Serenity is pure fun from start to finish. Despite the deep and relevant themes explored in the movie, there is no Star Trek-style pretension. Rather, it is a moviegoer's movie, like a fun old western with actual (amazing) plot and dynamic, round characters. <br /> <br />If my words don't resound with you, prospective buyer, then hear the math: an average review of 5 stars from 45 reviewers (and counting) is outrageously high. We can't all be wrong. <br />
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Almost a year ago, I bought this CD because I heard \\"Take Me Out\\" on the radio. Now Franz is one of my favorite bands. The lyrics are catchy, and it's very hard not to tap your foot while listening to most of the songs. I would have to say there is only one song (\\"Auf Achse\\") that I do not like as much as the rest, but I can still tolerate it.  <br /> <br />I seriously have no idea how some people can give this CD less than 4 stars. Reading through some of the low rated reviews, I have to wonder if you even took the time to listen to the CD, or did you just give it a low rating because of something you heard on the radio? <br /> <br />Also, if you ever have the chance, see Franz live. They are awesome...even though they sucked on SNL (but then again almost every band sucks on SNL...)
B0006A9FKA|3.0|I'm American, but I enjoy a lot of British humor - Monty Python, Black Adder, Red Dwarf, etc. - and I was hoping that \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" would be up to that level of wit. It isn't.  Yes, there are some funny moments. And the notion that most people lurch through life so bored and oblivious that they wouldn't even notice if their city were overrun by zombies is given a thorough workout. But once you get past that, there's not a lot going for \\"Shaun.\\" The first half is dreadfully slow, and the ending is too gore-filled for an alleged comedy.<br /><br />For the most part,  \\"Shaun\\" is just another zombie movie, patterned on George Romero's \\"Living Dead\\" series, but set in London. It does a good job of showing how ordinary - even stupid - people might try to cope with an onslaught of the living dead, but it doesn't really bring much new to the genre.  It reminded me, occasionally, of \\"The Young Ones,\\" but it's not nearly as funny.  If you want horror mixed with comedy, try Bruce Campell's \\"Evil Dead\\"  movies or \\"Bubba Ho-Tep.\\"
B00001OH7V|4.0|Strange, dense and mysterious, \\"Heroes\\" is the album that solidified Bowie's image as a post-modern master of minimalism and complexity. Like its predecessor, the stunningly original Low, \\"Heroes\\" combines mystifying wordplay with layers and layers of sound, only to shift gears for the album's second half by utilizing tonal ideas as brilliant mood pieces. The influence of Brian Eno is apparent mostly on the album's second half, while the first half is indebted to the roaring guitar work of Robert Fripp, whose lead guitar work provides that foundation upon which most of the songs are built.<br /><br />The album's title track is a masterpiece by any definition of the word, built on a repetitive base that chugs along and drones endlessly while Bowie's vocal builds and builds to an astounding climax. Although nothing else here comes close to the power of that track, there is never a dull moment on \\"Heroes\\". \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" \\"Joe the Lion\\" and \\"Blackout\\" are as lyrically engaging as Bowie has ever been, thick with an attitude that conveys difficult, strangely complex moods that do not reveal themselves until you allow yourself to be immersed in their murky imagery.<br /><br />As dense and complex as the `song' side is, the instrumental side is equally adept at conveying the exact opposite. With the exception of the exotically structured \\"The Secret Life of Arabia,\\" which closes the album, side two presents an ascetic style of music that is at once rare and refreshing from a pop star of Bowie's status. Just as ascetic is the packaging, with its black and white cover photo and back with nothing other than basic information regarding song titles and musicians. \\"Heroes\\" is an album that communicates well beyond its release date, reverberating into the 21st century with a vision that shuns formula and embraces individuality in a contradictory manner that perhaps only David Bowie was (or is) capable.

B000063JDE|5.0|In the early moments of \\"Blue Velvet\\" we see idealized small town images - blooming red roses and immaculate white picket fences - accompanied by the sounds of the gentle Bobby Vinton pop tune that gives the film its title. If you sense something unsettling about this perfection, that's only appropriate. \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a David Lynch film, you see, and it won't be long at all before a clean-cut college student comes across a rotting ear in an open field. <br /> <br />Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) is the boy who finds the ear, and Sandy Williams (Laura Dern) is the blonde policeman's daughter who assists Jeffrey when he decides to investigate the truth about his disturbing discovery. Sandy and Jeffrey link the ear to night club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) and later, a deranged man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper). <br /> <br />\\"I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert,\\" Sandy tells Jeffrey when he decides to sneak into Dorothy's apartment. As Jeffrey becomes sexually entangled with Dorothy, we can only cast similar doubt. <br /> <br />It's true that \\"Blue Velvet\\"'s dark mysteries have the power to repulse. Voyeurism, rape, torture, and murder are all key to the plot. Yet the film is also spellbinding in its beauty. Vibrant colors and ominous shadows offer gorgeous contrast - call it Technicolor noir - and the film is rife with unforgettable imagery. Moments big and small, from MacLachlan playing with a child's birthday hat to Dean Stockwell's show-stopping lip-synch of Roy Orbison's \\"In Dreams\\", are as haunting as anything you will see at the movies anywhere. <br /> <br />The acting is top-notch. MacLachlan is just right as the lost innocent Jeffrey, and Hopper shreds the screen as his depraved counterpoint Frank. Rossellini's performance as Dorothy is devastating and extremely courageous: this is her defining moment as an actress. <br /> <br />\\"Blue Velvet\\" is perhaps the quintesstential David Lynch film. His strange humor and painterly gift for creating stunning images are prominently on display, and the film illustrates Lynch's contradictory impulses toward unbridled nastiness and aw-shucks sweetness like no other has. After all these years, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is still a shocker, and deciding how one feels about it is still a challenge. It is a film to be considered and then reconsidered, visited and revisited, the kind of film that will never fade away. For serious cinephiles, then, \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a film to be cherished.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Let's make this quick and to the point.  The show is excellent, I want to move there, please get season 2 on DVD.
B000068FY0|4.0|Before the blockbuster pop album \\"Breakfast in America\\" Supertramp was considered to be a progressive rock group.  The group's first two albums were very progressive, and given the general lack of salability of progressive rock in any era neither album was very successful.  The group retooled their sound and tried again with \\"Crime of the Century,\\" which many people consider one of Supertramp's best albums.  The music was still progressive, but with a distinctive pop flavor that would become increasingly evident in the next several albums.  Fans of Supertramp and early progressive rock will need this album for their collection.<br /><br />Richard Davies introduces the song \\"School\\" with a haunting harmonica solo.  This melancholy song has progressive elements as it ponders the conflict between tradition and conformity and the reality of life.<br /><br />In a pop style with a hard edge is \\"Bloody Well Right.\\"  The lyrics are relatively simple and ironic, more so because of the placement after \\"School.\\"  The song appears to be about the accuracy of complaints, but then you realize that the singer is agreeing without agreeing.  In one portion of the song the singer says that he agrees that you can complain about school and you must be right, but there is right from one person's point of view and then there is a more universal accuracy.  I sense this song makes fun of complainers.<br /><br />The song \\"Hide in Your Shell\\" is an excellent mix of progressive and pop.  This song contains complex lyrics and wonderfully constructed music.  At nearly seven minutes in length this song is the second longest on this CD, and is one of the most artistic songs in Supertramp's repertoire.  Almost as long, \\"Asylum\\" follows and is another complex and artistic song, though it is also more progressive than \\"Hide in Your Shell.\\"  There are sufficient vocal elements to complement the theme of insanity, and the final part of the lyrics in the accompanying booklet trail off with the end of the lyrics; quite a nice touch.  This song also acquires harder elements as the song progresses, with wailing guitars, yells, and layered instruments.<br /><br />\\"Dreamer\\" moves back into progressive pop territory.  However, the theme stays in the range of \\"Asylum\\" by implying that there is a borderline area between dreaming and insanity.  Even the vocals have an edge that implies a bit of craziness.<br /><br />\\"Rudy\\" is the longest song on this CD.  This progressive song is sad.  Rudy leads a humdrum life looking for something and not finding it.  This song reminds me of Supertramp's early music rather than the pop direction they were heading.  The music is complex and follows the story of the lyrics, which are neither catchy nor easy to remember.  However, progressive fans may prefer this kind of music over the songs with pop features.<br /><br />The song \\"If Everyone Is Listening\\" retains a few progressive elements, but there are pop features as well.  This song has a very catchy hook and the lyrics are quite listenable.  I think this song could have been a single.  This song continues the theme of the previous song in that the previous song is about how a life can be mundane and meaningless, while this song implies that we are actors in our own play, and things happen that can be changed if only people were listening.  The lyrics are good and the music is very good.<br /><br />Staying progressive and with social consciousness is \\"Crime of the Century.\\"  The song asks not-so-subtly who is responsible for the problems we see in the world today.  Rip off the mask and you see you and me; sobering for anyone who still pays attention to the ills in the world in this supposedly enlightened era.<br /><br />I prefer progressive rock over most forms of music.  It goes without saying that good progressive rock is preferred.  Because of my preference I enjoy Supertramp's progressive and progressive pop music more than their pop music.  Conversely, others like the pop and dislike the progressive, sometimes calling it noise.  \\"Crime of the Century\\" contains both styles, and may be a difficult purchase for some listeners.  However, some believe that \\"Crime of the Century\\" was an artistic peak for Supertramp, including at least one member of Supertramp, though their commercial peak was yet to come.  As usual, it comes down to taste.  I have a preference for this music because it is different and requires you to pay attention to the lyrics and the music to enjoy the more challenging works.  If music is something you hum along to you may want to move on to something a bit lighter than this album.the pop and dislike the progressive, sometimes calling it noise.  \\"Crime of the Century\\" contains both styles, and may be a difficult purchase for some listeners.

B000005H4F|5.0|A friend of mine who's a jazz fanatic turned me on to this recording about twenty years ago, and it remains one of my favorite jazz albums from the late `50s. Recorded on one day in March 1958, this session brought together some of the greatest improvisers of jazz. Just a look at the names says virtually all that you need to know; Cannonball Adderley on alto sax, Miles Davis on trumpet, Hank Jones on piano, Sam Jones on bass, and Art Blakey on drums. \\"Somethin' Else\\" finds all players in a relaxed mood, trading riffs on three standards, and (if you include the CD bonus track) three original numbers. The session is noteworthy not only because of the remarkable lineup, but because of the warmth that such disparate stylists were capable of generating. Their instinctive trade-offs are subtle and yet intricate, performed with a poise that that contradicts the energy permeating throughout each track. It is low-key and hot at the same time.<br /><br /> Adderley was in charge of this session, so the tracks here are accredited to him as bandleader, but they could just as easily have been credited to Miles. Davis plays a major role here, and in fact, he is credited with writing the title track.  For all the world, \\"Somethin' Else\\" sounds like the missing link between Miles Davis' straightforward Prestige recordings and his later, ambitious material for Columbia. Any fan of quality jazz music should put this album on their short list of things to own.  A Tom Ryan
B00005MAM2|5.0|Visually Astonishing, Dark and Original is what best describes Katshuiro Otomo's Masterpiece `AKIRA'. Now here is an animated film that is way ahead of his time, the film was released in 1988 even before Disney created computer FX's in their animated features. AKIRA is one of my favorite movies of all time it has beautiful visuals, great animation, an extraordinary story and a stunning soundtrack. I have read the entire AKIRA manga comics and yes it makes the movie that much easier to understand but with the new DVD edition which contains the correct dubbed version that allows the viewer to understand the film a little easier. I first saw AKIRA when I was 17 years old and ever since then I have collected great anime, at first I was confused but yet intrigued and consumed by the plot, I wanted to know what the story was about. Finally after 4 times viewing the film I understood the plot and the message Otomo wanted to deliver in this feature. The story is fascinating it takes place in the future in the city of NEO-TOKYO were citizens live in a constant chaos of an urban revolution, while the youth lives reckless on the dark streets gathering in bike gangs the government proceeds with the so called `akira project'; a mayor step in scientific discovery based on human energy. <br /> <br />AKIRA is a movie about betrayal, love, loyalty, anger, and fiction. For those who do not understand it is a movie about the universe and how us humans connect with it,they say we use about 11% of our brains but what if we were able to use 40% or even 100% of it, what then? And what if some of that percentage was damaged by hate, depression, or anger, this is the case of TETSUO who is the center character of this film. The possibilities are far from anything we can imagine, `AKIRA' provides a fictional possibility that self energy exists within all of us and that is just as delicate as it is powerful. <br /> <br />This is an epic proportion animated feature, the action sequences are creatively amazing, the plot is very intriguing, dark and character driven like no other film. It is one of a kind and even after 14 years we have yet to see anything like it whether is an animated or a feature film.  <br /> <br />
B00000DG1R|5.0|Forget the lightweights Pink Floyd, Queen, and Rush.  England's fab five is where it's at, and this is a brilliant collection of their earth-shattering hits.  You'd be a fool to skip it, and those who do have NO taste in music.
B00004Z459|3.0|Or at least that's what I think. It seems that for most people, when they realized that the minimally talented Limp Bizkit was going to rock bottom (the twin embarrassments \\"Chocolate Starfish...\\" and \\"Results\\") and heard Linkin Park, it connected to many as a good alternative to that. And for others, well there's lots of sounds that connected. For many people it was a good soundtrack to teenage angst. I still am, but I prefer a band called Violent Femmes for that. I don't mind the album or anything, but I don't actually think it's perfect or anything. <br /> <br />That's not to say there isn't any good songs here; many of them are decent. And it really could be worse. While they are arguably the most mainstream band of their contemporaries, they also can make songs that are structured musically and make sense, which connects to people. It sold so many copies, and when not played to death, I really do enjoy \\"Crawling\\" and \\"In the End\\". Both show a great Depeche Mode influence as well as being pretty decent songs. Even I don't really like the tracks where Chester screams that much. Don't get me wrong, the Dillinger Escape Plan is one of my favorite bands and screams in like all of their songs. It's just the way it is done, it sounds so pubescent or something to me. It makes it sound like a teenybop version of what they're doing. <br /> <br />As for the rest of the band, what stands out is what Mr. Hahn does in tracks like \\"Cure for the Itch\\", although it's pretty much just made to show off his skills. He has some pretty good ideas; unfortunately they rarely go throughout the songs. \\"Papercut\\" is fairly good, even though Chester sounds a lot like Fred Durst, but does it quite decently for being in a bad comparison. So, while it's not perfect you could do a lot worse. I had to check it out because of some NIN/DM influence, and those are some of my favorite artists. But it's also very probable that you will like it.
B00005176F|2.0|I have absolutely no problem understanding why these guys have had such a hard time breaking the American market. First of all, they write lyrics that don't translate to Americans. Second, they sound as if they couldn't care less anyway. Now, is that any way to impress the nice Americans?<br /><br />Blur represent everything that Americans don't get about English pop. They perform guitar rawk without much to provide any sense of cohesive unity, or even originality. In order to survive the extraordinarily fickle English music market, they have changed their style every two albums or so. This helped them survive on their side of the puddle, but it didn't do them any good over here. It didn't help that all of these `stylistic' changes hardly affected the band's sound at all, with each incarnation leaving them sounding like any other second-rate guitar-based pop band.<br /><br />I've listened to this disk five times in a row, and yet I have absolutely no idea what the hell they are going on about.  Some attitude creeps through, but it never seems particularly clever (or particularly literate). Some examples - \\"This is the next century. The universal is free. You can find it anywhere.\\"  \\"When I feel heavy metal, and I'm on pins and needles, Well, I lie and I'm easy...\\" A track like \\"Tender\\" features a gospel-sized chorus and is pleasant musically but is so lyrically inept that it becomes grating. Here's its chorus; \\"Oh my baby, oh my baby, Oh, why. Oh, my,\\" repeated ad infinitum. Who needs this gobbledygook?<br /><br />Some songs are good, but not particularly noteworthy. \\"Boys and Girls\\" is a bit of disco fun. \\"The Universal\\" features some interesting orchestration, and \\"Park Life\\" is a lively stomper. \\"This Is a Low\\" sinks in a bit after repeated listenings, but not enough to warrant the attention I paid it. A trifle like \\"To the End\\" combines bits of Burt Bacharach and Serge Gainsbourg, but results only in a mediocre lift of the \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" theme.<br /><br />Elsewhere, the music and lyrics are so English that it's almost alienating. \\"Beetlebum,\\" for instance, is ludicrous; \\"Beetlebum, because you're young, she's a gun. Now what you've done, Beetlebum......\\" What the heck is that supposed to mean? Do they get this in England?  The extra live disk that comes with this set helps to explain things a bit, especially when you hear the English crowd going crazy and singing along, but Americans will probably continue to scratch their heads. \\"This Is a Low\\" is even less clear - \\"On the Malin head, Blackpool looks blue and red, and the Queen, she's gone `round the bend. Jumped off Lands End.\\" It is no wonder that these guys lost their battle with Oasis for supremacy.

6304493681|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is a visually stunning animated masterpiece. Japanese animation has always been in a class of its own, so I won't even attempt to describe the incredible attention to detail and beautiful imagery in this movie. In this case the animation is merely icing for what is one of the most important works of science fiction in recent years. <br /> <br />Every generation has had books and movies that have contributed to our collective understanding of reality. Prior to World War II this included books like Yevgeny Zamyatin's \\"We\\" and Huxley's \\"Brave New World\\", and later Orwell's \\"1984\\". Today most warnings about the future fall into the category of science fiction. Science fiction began to fill this role when Arthur C. Clarke's \\"2001\\" warned us of the potential for humanity to create intelligent, even sentient computers that could murder their human creators. \\"2001\\" envisioned computer intelligence imprisoned in the physical body of a computer. Where \\"2001\\" left off, Ghost in the Shell begins. <br /> <br />Ghost in the Shell tells the story of a future in which a computer program, Project 2501, becomes self-aware and begins a quest to fill basic needs it feels are qualifiers of being alive by controlling computers and people to achieve its ultimate goals. Whereas the HAL-9000 computer was relatively harmless, owing to its confinement in the Odyssey space ship, Project 2501 is a recognition that the global internet could have dire consequences for all of us. By comparison, this new villain is virtually invincible. But is Project 2501 a villain? <br /> <br />Most people who have told me that they didn't like this move said that they didn't understand it. Indeed, the story and concepts are very complicated. I have watched it several times and still get new things out of it every time. Roger Ebert called Ghost in the Shell, \\"Unusually intelligent and challenging science fiction, aimed at smart audiences\\". <br /> <br />Ghost in the Shell is full of fascinatingdialog, such as this diatribe about the cycle of life and death by Project 2501. \\"A copy is just an identical image. There is the possibility that a single virus could destroy an entire set of systems, and copies do not give rise to variety and originality. Life perpetuates itself through diversity, and this includes the ability to sacrifice itself when necessary. Cells repeat the process of degeneration and regeneration until one day they die, obliterating an entire set of memory and information. Only genes remain. Why continually repeat this cycle? Simply to survive by avoiding the weaknesses of an unchanging system.\\" <br /> <br />Thus Ghost in the Shell goes beyond simply a prediction or warning for the future: it attempts to contribute to our understanding of reality by breaking existence down into biological terms and making us question, along with the characters in the movie, whether or not any of us has a soul. The characters in Ghost in the Shell are unusually deep and are a refreshing change from the one-dimensional stereotypes we've become numbed by in modern media. Ghost in the Shell would be required reading in many high school and university courses if it weren't for the fortuitous fact that it can be enjoyed in this beautifully animated feature film. This is one of the few movies ever made that everyone should watch at least once.  <br /> <br />
B0001AVZA8|5.0|I've read most of the reviews here because I wanted to get a general idea of the feelings about this film before posting mine and I was surprised to see so many negative ones.<br /><br />I recommend you and all those who put down this movie that you should first think about what you expect from a romantic comedy, because within its genre it's among the best I've ever seen!<br /><br />Before watching it I wasn't a fan of either Diane or Jack though I liked some of their previous work. Now I'm crazy about them!<br /><br />Diane Keaton shines like never before, her performance can only be compared to those she gave in Marvin's Room and Annie Hall, but even better! I'm sure I'll want to see more of her in the future. Together with Jack Nicholson they are definitely the stars of the show and I can't help but wonder why it took so long to discover the wonderful chemistry that works between the two and get them together finally for a movie. Hats off to Nancy Meyers for doing that and writing such a clever and witty script for them.<br /><br />The only thing that stops this from being a perfect film is the ending. The movie goes on a bit too long and that's a mistake from the artistic point of view. However, when I was watching it I really did not want it to end because it was so good and I for one could have watched these two incredible actors for 2 more hours!<br /><br />So I truly recommend this movie to those who are fond of talents and funny dialogues and do not let the \\"for the more mature crowd\\" remarks distract you: I'm 19 and watched it 3 times so far but still can't get enough of it! Fabulous!
B00006JJ51|4.0|And it's not only in hip-hop that this happened. In this kind of sense, N.W.A. can be seen as sort of the Sex Pistols of hip-hop. But whereas the Pistols were known more about with stage antics and whatnot, it was what was actually on the record what most people mentioned of with N.W.A. The first album, \\"N.W.A. and the Posse\\", was not anywhere as notorious as this album, and I haven't heard it, but while I feel like they try to be seen as more sincere and hardcore than they really are, what stands out is the overall message of the songs. (I'd really give it 3 1/2, but given the usual current garbage out now, I'm gonna have to round it up). It's known for the tracks which are unapologetic about the violence put on to others. While I personally prefer others, like Ice-T to these guys, the album has very little filler, so its strengths are outweighed by the weaknesses. <br /> <br />It's catchy enough for casual listeners to sink into basically admittedly. People who haven't heard it probably do at least know who Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, and Eazy-E are. The others are relatively talented too (in fact, MC Ren here is on par with Ice Cube). The production here isn't as good as, say, the Bomb Squad, but there's great beats on songs like \\"Dopeman\\". I like songs like \\"Express Yourself\\" and \\"Gangsta Gangsta\\", because those tend to stand out. While some may mention the \\"whining\\" of the record, to me, if an artist has a REAL reason to do so, why not just go ahead. It does talk about the ghetto life and whatnot, and while they know that they do things that are seen as irresponsible, they do not care (or at least according to the album, they don't). I don't buy into that this got people to say what they wanted to or whatever, but what I care more about is SONGS. And plenty of them are good. <br /> <br />While ultimately there are views, etc., I disagree about, there are records that I can listen to that express those views, most notably in A Tribe Called Quest.
B00005NWRS|4.0|Oops. After struggling with Adams' previous album, Heartbreaker, and eventually giving up on it, I presumed that his solo career was going to hold little interest for me. Well, based on Gold, I'm going to have to re-evaluate that presumption. Where Heartbreaker was lackluster and dull, Gold is ambitious and intriguing. Heartbreaker lulled me to sleep with an endless series of lullaby-like dirges, but this new collection sets the pace with a bit more energy, resulting in an album that is downright stimulating, or at least interesting. The full collection features a rather generous twenty-one songs, five of which appear on a second disk entitled `Side 4'.<br /><br />Most of the songs here are chord-driven, mid-tempo rockers with appealing melodies. The overall feel remains earthy, but Adams isn't afraid to use flourishes as required, so arrangements are sometimes ornamental, using orchestration and choruses to full effect. It's no wonder that Elton John took a liking to Adams, since the arrangements here suggest those found on Tumbleweed Connection and his own first album. At other times, Adam sounds like he could have been writing for the 1974-era Faces; a song like \\"Rescue Blues\\" could have been an outtake from the \\"Ooh La La\\" sessions. At first, \\"New York\\" sounds like a love letter to Manhattan, but it is really directed to a female resident. In retrospect, the video that accompanied this track is relatively creepy, since it featured Adams singing with the World Trade Center as his backdrop, filmed just days before 9/11.<br /><br />As the disk progresses, the songs build upon one another. \\"Firecracker\\" is a pleasant, rootsy, mid-tempo rocker that is typical of the album, as is \\"Answering Bell, which also features a fine melody but adds a nice organ break for flavor. The best songs arrive mid-disk, though, with the melancholy reflection of<br /><br />\\"Somehow, Someday\\" surpassed only by the gorgeously wrought melody of \\"When the Stars Go Blue,\\" a song that might qualify as Adams' best to date. \\"Sylvia Plath\\" could have been equally intriguing, but a line like \\"Maybe she'd give me a bath\\" wrecks the mood, since it strikes me as a rather obvious and artless reach for a rhyme with the subject's name. The overall mood here is both sad and beautiful, although things start to slack off towards disk's end. The bonus tracks add some fun to the equation, and although Gold still has its share of filler, there is plenty here to recommend it.<br /><br />Afternote - In the wake of Gold, Adams seemed poised to hit a home run with his next record. Instead, he opted to bunt, releasing a collection of uneven demo tracks. Far be it from me to give career advice, though. For me, the bottom line is that there is one great Ryan Adams solo record, and this is it.

B00000K19E|5.0|The story of a reluctant Christ-like protagonist set against a baroque, MTV backdrop, The Matrix is the definitive hybrid of technical wizardry and contextual excellence that should be the benchmark for all sci-fi films to come. <br /> <br />Hollywood has had some problems combining form and matter in the sci-fi genre. There have been a lot of visually stunning works but nobody cared about the hero. (Or nobody simply cared about anything.) There a few, though, which aroused interest and intellect but nobody 'ooh'-ed or 'aah'-ed at the special effects. With The Matrix, both elements are perfectly en sync. Not only did we want to cheer on the heroes to victory, we wanted them to bludgeon the opposition. Not only did we sit in awe as Neo evaded those bullets in limbo-rock fashion, we salivated. <br /> <br />But what makes The Matrix several cuts above the rest of the films in its genre is that there are simply no loopholes. The script, written by the Wachowski brothers is intelligent but carefully not geeky. The kung-fu sequences were deftly shot -- something even Bruce Lee would've been proud of. The photography was breathtaking. (I bet if you had to cut every frame on the reel and had it developed and printed, every single frame would stand on its own.) And the acting? Maybe not the best Keanu Reeves but name me an actor who has box-office appeal but could portray the uneasy and vulnerable protagonist, Neo, to a T the way Reeves did. But, come to think of it, if you pit any actor beside Laurence Fishburne, you're bound to confuse that actor for bad acting. As Morpheus, Mr. Fishburne is simply wicked! Shades of his mentor-role in Higher Learning, nobody exudes that aura of quiet intensity than Mr. Fishburne. His character, battle-scarred but always composed Morpheus, is given an extra dose of mortality (He loves Neo to a fault.) only Mr. Fishburne can flesh out. <br /> <br />People will say what they want to say about how good The Matrix is but the bottomline is this:finally there's a philosophical film that has cut through this generation. My generation. The Wachowski brothers probably scribbled a little P.S. note when they finished the script saying: THINK FOR A MOMENT ABOUT YOUR EXISTENCE. What is the Matrix, you ask? Something that's closer to reality than you think. <br /> <br />
B0000630BT|5.0|Following the poor record sales of 1988's attempted but largely unsuccessful comeback, \\"Ram It Down,\\" Judas Priest tried to win their fans back with their twelfth studio effort, 1990's \\"Painkiller.\\" Frontman Rob Halford, axemen K.K. Downing and Glenn Tipton, bassist Ian Hill, and drummer Scott Travis went about this task by returning to their classic, 1970's style of metal while simultaneously intermixing some techniques from modern, contemporary speed metal bands. The result was a masterful new disc, the heaviest and most musically complex of Judas Priest's career, which successfully won all of the band's fans back, and even gained them many new fans. \\"Painkiller\\" is not only the definition of a Nineties' classic; it's a truly wonderful comeback, and easily the best release of Priest's long and storied career. Plus--since it's saturated with fast riffs, scorching leads, extended, technical solos, quick drumming, and Rob's shrieking vocals--many music fans think (justifably so) that \\"Painkiller\\" is the epitome of speed metal. It's also one of the most famous and important albums on heavy metal's timeline. Motorhead may have given birth to speed metal, but \\"Painkiller\\" has spawned a generation of imitators, so it's equally as influential as anything by, well, any other band. The opening title track sets the mood well for the rest of the songs. It has a fast drum beat and fast churning riffs, as well as Rob's standard, very high pitched vocals, and two sweet guitar solos (the first of which is well over a minute long!) The appropriately titled \\"All Guns Blazing,\\" has a spectacular, wailing solo which has several different parts to it. The next song, \\"Leather Rebel,\\" is a very speedy track with an almost buzzsaw rhythm, and track five (\\"Metal Meltdown\\") features three back-to-back guitar solos. Other highlights include the memorable chug and churn guitars and thumping drums of \\"Night Crawler,\\" \\"Between The Hammer & The Anvil,\\" which is highlighted by yet another lengthy, winding, mazey, three part solo, and, the catchy, mid-paced, stop-start rhythm behind \\"A Touch Of Evil.\\" Finally, if you buy the remastered version of this album, you get two bonus tracks--\\"Living Bad Dreams,\\" and a rare, live version of \\"Leather Rebel\\"--which are both excellent inclusions in your collection. \\"Painkiller\\" is, from front to back, an eargasm. If you're a speed/thrash/classical metal fan, there's almost no record you need more than this one, and if you weren't a Judas Priest fan before, you'll definitely be one now!

B000B2YQX4|2.0|I am 35, father of two who was a die hard DM fan in the 80's. What a wonderful ride that was! Then they changed after the \\"Violator\\". Started exploring some weird sounds a lot of noise but no catchy tunes. This album is one of them. Precious is a good song, reminds me \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" but not a song that I would wanna listen over and over again. Lilian is a catchy tune but again it will never be a hit.      They say a band should adapt to new times and generations (i.e Rolling Stones). Call me boring or old fashioned but never wanted DM change or explore new sounds. I think if they stuck with their original new wave style they would have sold more records thanks to their loyal fans. I buy every new DM album anyway with some hope that they would take me back to those days again, even though I know it will never be the same...
B00070DK5K|1.0|No less an expert on bad live albums than Mick Jagger once stated that David Live was one of the worst live albums he had ever heard. For the record, he voiced this opinion before the Rolling Stones released their own quite appalling disaster of a live record, the ¾ unlistenable \\"Love You Live\\" (I say ¾ because the side recorded in a Canadian nightclub is actually quite good. As for the rest, peee-yuuu). That said, I must admit that Jagger was spot on in his assessment of David Live. This is truly a miserable live album, with virtually none of the excitement or stage appeal that made Bowie famous in the first place.<br /><br />The album's worst fault is its timing. The album documents a period of transition in Bowie's career that betrays a serious lack of focus in his direction. Coming on the heels of \\"Diamond Dogs\\" and just before \\"Young Americans\\", the album attempts to straddle a line between the two, but instead falls gracelessly on its face. Face it, few people would claim \\"Diamond Dogs\\" to be one of Bowie's most focused albums, and even fewer would claim his \\"Young Americans\\" phase to be his most provocative, and yet this live album relies on these, the worst features of these two records.<br /><br />A very common mistake that most artists make when releasing a live album is relying too heavily on their previous studio effort, filling it up with less convincing versions of songs that the record-buying audience has barely been acclimated with. David Live includes no less than six tracks from \\"Diamond Dogs\\" - virtually the whole album (snore). Songs like \\"Rock and Roll With Me\\" and \\"Big Brother\\" weren't so good the first time around, and here, they are rendered into something miserable. Even worse is the way that this quasi-funk band completely disassembles classic material like \\"Jean Genie\\" and \\"Moonage Daydream\\", and then forgets to reassemble it into something recognizable, or even good. These reworked versions are beyond bad, they are disastrous.<br /><br />Perhaps the shortcomings of this album are due to the fact that Bowie changed horses midstream, opting to strip down his futuristic showcase for the Philadelphia cheese of his next project smack dab in the middle of his tour. Confusion was the outcome, with a band that played a proficient (if unremarkable) version of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\" but absolutely butchered Bowie's own \\"Aladdin Sane\\". In summary, David Live is barely passable as pseudo-funk, and absolutely terrible as a glitter memento, making it perhaps the second worst live album by a superstar rock act in the seventies (sorry, Mick).<br /><br />  C-  Tom Ryanortcomings of this album are due to the fact that Bowie changed horses midstream, opting to strip down his futuristic showcase for the Philadelphia cheese of his next project smack dab in the middle of his tour.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Just to set the record straight. They're from California and not the UK.    Anyway, to my surprise, they've pulled off the whole \\"punk opera\\" quite well. Its not very political, contrary to the media's portrayal. There are only two truely political songs on this album. Old school Green Day fans should enjoy Jesus of Suburbia, Give Me Novacaine, St. Jimmy, She's a Rebel, and Letterbomb. A few track , like Homecoming, We Are The Waiting, and Jesus of Suburbia, show hints of Pink Floyd like influences thanks to a similar sense of bombastic angst, a la The Wall.    As I said above, its not a very political album. Its a modern coming of age album really. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is about Billy Joe's father having died in September of 200(3or4), Jesus of Suburbia is the main character, St. Jimmy is his rebelious shadey friend, and Whatshername is Jesus of Suburbia's girl friend (or his crush, its not very clear). It just so happens that the war in Iraq is a very real part of growing up today (I'll atest to this). The two political songs happen to be Holiday and American Idiot, which are also the two poppiest songs on the album. Undoubtably the band did this on purpose =P .    Its an all round solid album.   -If you like old Green Day you'll like this (but you'll have some gripes about some of the poppier songs like American Idiot).   -If you like The Clash, you'll love the punk twist to the comments on the war, and modern American culture (like the lack of parenting, the \\"experimentation\\" teens have with drugs, and just growing up American).  -If you're not a long time Green Day fan but their recent hits have got you hooked, then you'll probably enjoy this album. Every song has \\"possible chart topper\\" written all over it, and they only just got started with Wake Me Up When September Ends. The first three singles weren't the best on the album. They're the poppiest and at times (particularly American Idiot) kind of cheesey sounding.     I bought this over a year ago, on the day it came out, and its still one of my top five most listened to albums (No small feat, seeing how I have 11 GBs filled up on my 20 GB iRiver H10). The only Green Day album that can completely top this one has to be Dookie. Nimrod isn't too far off from doins so either, but I guess it comes down to personal taste. Being a Pink Floyd fan as well as a Green Day fan, I guess I'm naturally inclined to prefer this over Nimrod.
B000050FEN|5.0|Se7en is a taunt and relentlessly intense thriller that will have you talking about it for days.<br /><br />It tells the story of two inner-city police officers, Detective Mills (Brad Pitt) and Detective Sommerset (Morgan Freeman). Mills in a young, inexperienced detective who is starving for come real action.  Detective Sommerset is ready to retire, until a case comes along that changes his plans.  Soon, both are working together to find a killer who kills his victims according to the seven deadly skills (gluttony, greed, sloth, lust, pride, envy, wrath).  Each crime scene gets more grousome, and each time they come closer to catching the real killer.  I would of course never reveal the ending, but let me just say that it will shock and impress you with its intelligence.<br /><br />It is the second film under the direction of David Fincher, but his first was Aliens 3, so I prefer to consider it his first.  And what a debut.  The whole film seems to have a sinister atmosphere, and one that leaves a foul taste in your mouth (it's a good thing, believe me).  Each scene is well angeled.  Despite how gory the deaths are, most of the blood and bodies are kept off screen, which shows maturity on Fincher's part (sloth is pretty hard to watch, though).  Unfortunately, one thing that brings the film down is that it has a few scenes that seem to linger and have little to do with the main part, and that might take an anxious filmgoer out of the movie.  But remember to be patient, because it will all be worth it.<br /><br />The acting is very memorable, especially on the villian's part ( I won't reveal the actor).  Freeman and Pitt also do great jobs, and demonstrate why they are where they are.  Gwyneth Paltrow also has a small role in the film, and she does a decend job, but is mostly on auto-drive.<br /><br />Overall, Se7en is one of the most memorable thrillers for its intensity, acting, and of course, the ending.  A must-see for anyone interested in seeing how to make a sophisticated thriller.ake a sophisticated thriller.  <br /> <br /> <br />

B00001QGPR|3.0|Hours? It's more like years since David Bowie finished an album that was something other than conceptual in its nature. Almost all of his recent album projects have been defined by the styles incorporated, or by a storyline concept (the convoluted but clever Outside, the techno-influenced Earthling, et. al.), but unless I'm missing something, Hours is Bowie's most unencumbered work in quite a while. It's almost like old times, actually, containing a batch of songs that could be heard either together or separately, with no repercussions. As such, it is also some of Bowie's best work in a long time, since the songs coexist snugly without leaning on one another.<br /><br />Whether it's due to the impending millennium and all of the implications that it brings with it, or personal experiences that have altered his perspective is unclear, but the songs on Hours are anything but opaque. Throughout this album, Bowie is emotionally direct, confronting love and loss with a vulnerability that might surprise those who have him pigeonholed as an artistic poseur. On \\"Survive\\", he sings with emotional candor to an estranged (or possibly deceased) lover or friend, \\"You're the great mistake I never made. I never lied to you, I hated when you lied, and I'll survive your naked eyes...I love you\\". That in itself is a revelation, since I cannot recall previously hearing Bowie sing the words \\"I love you\\". This direct vulnerability expands as the disk continues, with self-searching, emotionally wrought lines like \\"If I'm dreaming my life, was she ever here\\" (from \\"If I'm Dreaming My Life\\") and \\"Hold my face before you. Still my trembling heart. Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die (from \\"Seven\\").<br /><br />This liberation of self-expression has opened new vistas for Bowie, who seems resigned to accept the nature of a fickle music business that looks to artists less than half his age to provide new revelations for a new generation. He is no longer making a play for commerciality. He is satisfied to communicate with those who are genuinely interested, and his fan base remains adequate to provide him this luxury. Very, very few artists on the top of the charts have more to say than Bowie, and almost none are as eloquent. As Bowie sings in \\"The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell,\\" \\"I'm reaching the very edge y'know. I'm going to the other side this time.\\" I for one would rather follow him over the edge than wait around for a younger bard to fight his way through the morass, only to possibly end up a loser. Bowie was there first, and he survived, with class, style and grace. Will any of the new breed be able to say the same? A-  Tom Ryaniality.

B000007T2Z|5.0|I've had this CD for a couple of years now, and it is just now starting to seep in and demand recognition for its brilliance.  <br /> <br />To sum up the disc, a quote from the Gilbert and Sullivan operetta \\"Patience\\":   <br />     Bunthorne--\\"there is more innocent fun within me than a casual spectator would imagine....if you are fond of touch-and-go jocularity--this is the shop for it!\\" <br /> <br />KIDDING! Ha ha.  This is music to listen to while standing on a high bridge on a grey and cloudy day while watching your local industry belch filth into the sky--or it would be a good soundtrack for viewing our government in action on TV with the sound off.  But if there is one part of that quote that is appropriate--there is more than a casual spectator would imagine.  This isn't for driving to the market and bouncing along to a catchy tune.  This is for that long road-trip in the wastelands of Indiana in the dead of night.   <br /> <br />To me, GYBE have represented a face of humanity that is beyond words.  They take us to a window of the Western soul that is all too often swept under the rug and makes you stare, contemplate, consider, and envelope yourself.
0553270435|5.0|A few years back I was at a familiar all-time low. Depressed, angry, frustrated, temperamental, spiteful, prejudiced, envious, hateful, and several more none too commendable traits constituted my mental state. Burdened and wearied by seemingly never ending physical, mental, and emotional  problems I thought myself doomed from the start. I always believed then that a dark cloud hung over me, that my life would never get to a proper, more positive and fulfilling path. Peace of mind, satisfaction and fulfillment that come with a succesful life I thought were for others more fortunate and never for me. Then one day my mother lent me a book which offered to change one's life for the better.<br /><br />This was that book. At first I was suspicious, the book stating very clearly that one's life is determined by one's thoughts and it can be altered to one's desire all dependent on what one truly believes. Really? I've always heard about the power of the mind and all that brouhaha but at my deeply ingrained negativity and depression at the time it seemed like a con to further my distress. When I started reading the book I was stunned by the light which the words so wonderfully and eloquently conveyed. I couldn't believe that life could be so simple and so good. And have one's life controlled by no one else but ONE'S SELF, by one's power. Halfway into the book I pushed the book aside, thinking it was too good to be true, the author may have meant well, but it was really unreal. Looking back I could see how bad my condition was to think that way.<br /><br />I thought I was done and over with the book, and about a month passed. Yet I couldn't get it off my mind, as if some inner entity in me kept saying, \\"Try it, give it a chance. You have nothing to lose\\". And considering my situation then it would have been criminal to ignore such words. So I returned to the book like a wayward child, read it, and had my life changed.<br /><br />\\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind\\" is a philosophy of man's hidden power to change and maintain his/her life and that of others for the better. The book simply and marvelously elucidates through simple exercises how one can heal oneself and others; think positively to elevate one's life to peace and tranquility; visualize what one wants to attain and have it; and how to get rid of negative thoughts and bad habits which serve as obstacles to a person's dreams and right to have peace. Most important, it describes what the subconscious mind is, how it functions, how to treat it, and the wonders it can do for you.<br /><br />Ever since I followed the exercises of this divinely-imparted book my life has changed so much for the better that the person I was prior to reading Dr. Joseph Murphy's gift is so distant, so alien to me that I could barely relate to myself then and regret that I hadn't had the good fortune to discover this book much earlier in life. It would have kept me away from a lot of unnecessary thoughts and actions which led to much unfortunate events. But better late than never.

B0000029AP|3.0|Never in the history of rock and roll has there been a band whose reputation has so far outstripped its ability to deliver. Considering that they have enjoyed a thirty-plus year run, the quality (and consistency) of their output has been abysmal. As far as I'm concerned, I could count Aerosmith's best material on my digits while wearing mittens and never taking my socks off, and yet half of the free world treats this band as if they are America's answer to the Rolling Stones. History has proven that it is more appropriate to label them as America's answer to Status Quo, but still their reputation precedes them, and they sell millions. Why? The answer lies with this album. Toys in the Attic is the record that initially promised greatness. It never arrived, but there are enough clues here to recognize the lost potential. In a nutshell, it contains just about everything that I care to know about Aerosmith.<br /><br />Virtually every other Aerosmith album contains more padding than an overstuffed chair. Even their `Greatest Hits' album is relatively weak, since it is watered down with less compelling tracks from lesser albums, not to mention a reprehensible cover of the Beatles' \\"Come Together.\\" Even this album has its dull moments, but it also has its fair share of high points - inarguably the highest (figuratively speaking) that they ever got. The title song, \\"Walk This Way,\\" and \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is as good as Aerosmith gets, with flailing guitars, entrancing arrangements and attitude to spare. \\"Uncle Salty\\" and \\"No More No More\\" also rock hard, in that classic-rock sort of way that Aerosmith is best known for. Granted, \\"Big Ten Inch\\" makes me want to gag (if you get my drift), but the balance of the record represents an Aerosmith that ceased to exist almost immediately after Toys in the Attic was released. If you want to spend your hard-earned cash buying up Aerosmith's catalog of fair-to-middling rock and roll albums, be my guest.  Meanwhile, I'll satisfy myself with the four or five good tracks on Toys in the Attic, smug in the knowledge that it never really got any better than this.

B00005JL7Q|5.0|I had heard of this for quite some time, and someone in one of my english classes did a novel to film presentation about it maybe 3 years ago.  I just watched it yesterday, and found it quite humorous.  Sure it deals with some depressing topics, but it shows very well aspects of life that we will all recognize - being rejected, etc.  A very good film, and one that actually portrays how people act, and how they can change. <br /> <br />I really enjoyed this, more so than some of Hugh Grant's other films, even though I generally like them all.
B000002TYX|4.0|What you have here are songs that are outakes or unfinished in one way or another. <br />Several are historical songs of the Beatles very early on that were recorded on Tape Recorders and do not have the sound quality. <br />What is interesting is that you get to hear them do songs by their idols, such as Buddy Holly and others. <br />The songs on the CD are from the early parts of their career. <br />Most of the songs with minor changes are very much like they appeared on their perspective albums. <br />Freebird is also on here and along with Real Love is the first new Beatles recording in 26 years. That alone is worth the price of the CD. <br />Another song of note is the recording of One After 909. <br />This version in my opinion is actually better than the one that appeared later on Let It Be. <br />There are some live recordings as well. <br />If you are into the historical aspects of music this is a must for any Beatles collector.

B00000AFHM|4.0|Considering this band's penchant for mystery and a determined lack of publicity, it's no surprise that most people think of Belle and Sebastian as a male/female duo. Rather, they are a seven-piece band from Scotland, making music that is very typical of their homeland; reflective and well-structured, with a strong emphasis on poppish melodies (`pop' in the classic sense, NOT in the contemporary boy-band sense).<br /><br />Of course, Nick Drake comes to mind. And their Scottish predecessors, Pre-Fab Sprout. Maybe a bit of Aztec Camera, too. That's not a bad hybrid. Boy With the Arab Strap consists of fragile, whispered melodies that convey innocence, although the lyrics suggest something else entirely (the opening lyric is \\"He had a stroke at the age of 24...\\", for God's sake!). The dichotomy of gorgeous, wispy music that sidesteps insouciance for self-analysis could be overbearingly precious if it were any less artful, but the album maintains a sense of balance that keeps it from capsizing into a sea of narcissism.<br /><br />\\"It Could Have Been a Brilliant Career,\\" \\"Sleep the Clock Around,\\" and the title track are some of the most melodious songs I've heard in quite a while. A strange, recited song called \\"Space Boy Dream\\", with a TV-theme-type jazz-rock workout provides a bizarre but welcome mid-point, and it segues so beautifully into the Motown stomp of \\"Dirty Dream Number Two\\" that it can generate goosebumps. This is not music for nightclubs. It is better suited to library lounges and bookstores - private moments rather than public ones - but the confidence of each song's performance belies alienation. Is it a natural ease that informs each song, or is it ennui? Is the band enjoying a pastoral simplicity, or is somebody going to end up at the end of a dangling rope? This much sensitivity indicates an equal amount of vulnerability, which is exactly why these songs cannot be taken as lightly as the gently loping musical approach suggests.<br /><br />Even with the suggestion of such weightiness, the songs are a genuine pleasure to hear, flowing by as calmly as a country stream. Each arrangement suggests an attention to detail and generally upbeat sensibility that would (or should) transcend any unreasonable pathos that lies beneath, making Boy With the Arab Strap an evocative and subtly moving work of art.

B000002UAX|4.0|What we have here is a CD that is essentially in two phases. <br />The Beatles at this point were starting their break up. <br />They had been trying to work on songs as a group and wrote some wonderful songs such as Back In The USSR with Mike Love from the Beach Boys assisting and they also wrote Birthday. <br />George Harrison also contributed While My Guitar Gently Weeps, and with the help of Eric Clapton you hear what could be his finest song. <br />What happened is that a deadline had to be met, so they started recording separately. What you get here are also some very fine songs. Blackbird, Piggies, Rocky Racoon, I Will and Julia. <br />This has some of their finest songs. A must for any Beatles fan.

'Cuz that's all Bridget does in this movie-obsess and babble inside and out of her head. <br /> <br />Zellweger does a fine zoftig but beyond that, this is a chick flick only for devoted fans of the genre.

B000002G26|3.0|There are a number of critics who would lead you to believe that this disk could cause you to throw rocks at your CD player. I know that his near-namesake RYAN Adams would, but I just cannot agree. Now, I'll admit that the coolness factor here is dangerously low, if it exists at all, but still in all, the music on this disk just isn't as bad as most would lead you to believe. In fact, it's probably not half so bad. Bryan Adams is not the kind of guy who I would go out of my way to hear, and I doubt I'll ever buy another CD by him, but this greatest hits collection makes a good argument for at least granting him the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />The ratio between good songs and bad songs is about evenly split here, from my perspective. On the good side (relatively speaking - when talking about Bryan Adams, everything is relative), there's \\"Summer of `69\\" and \\"Run to You\\". On the bad side, there's \\"Do I Have to Say the Words\\" and \\"Kids Wanna Rock\\". The fact is that virtually everything Adams does reeks of formula, and I don't deny that even his best material sounds as if it came out of a can. So does tuna, though, and I don't mind canned tuna. Sometimes, if I'm in the mood, I like it. My point here is that `canned' music isn't bad per se, it's only limited in how good it can be.<br /><br />...and the best bits here are not works of genius. They are simply pleasant, and they certainly transcend the overt hostility of most music freaks. Forgive me if it's uncool, but I think \\"Please Forgive Me\\" is a pretty fine piece of work. I guess it's a matter of whether or not you like tuna with good taste or tuna that tastes good. B+ Tom Ryan

Anyway, be prepared for a considerably lower body count than Vol.1-The Bride basically finishes off her list after being shot with rock salt, buried alive, and drugged.

B00004Y6TQ|4.0|Selmasongs is an extended e.p. (in other words, a little bit shorter than your standard 70-minute cd) containing seven songs, all inspired by a movie in which Bjork played the starring role (Selma). The movie was called \\"Dancer in the Dark\\", and it was reported to be a painful and difficult experience for her, despite rave reviews and accolades. The experience of acting may have been a nightmare, but Bjork found use for it by allowing it to push her to a new level of emotional creativity. Throughout, Bjork connotes the playful, but portrays the dramatic.<br /><br />Bjork apparently has access to a bottomless pit of creative ideas. Her vistas appear to be boundless, using virtually everything to aid her vision - synchronized factory noises, onomatopoeia, trains, orchestras - who else could claim Catherine Deneuve and Thom Yorke as guest vocalists on the same album? Bjork is contemplative, but she remains somebody who makes lemonade out of lemons. I haven't seen the movie...yet...so it's still difficult for me to understand the lyrical significance of a song titled \\"107 Steps\\". While the movie will clarify this further, I'm sure, I'm interested in Selmasongs solely as a listening experience. Its atmospherics are as visual as any projected image, so you can almost see each song as presentations of an image. Purportedly, Bjork's character was blind, so it's significant that this music is so visual in its presentation. The song \\"Scatterheart\\" is a focal point - lush, gorgeous, expressive - along with the dreamily optimistic \\"In the Musicals.\\" The orchestration is remarkable throughout, too. It provides brilliant colors for the odd melodies of the album's opening and closing theme (\\"Overture\\", \\"New World\\"). Based on this soundtrack, I can't wait to see the movie. A-  Tom Ryan
0345440900|4.0|I gave this four stars because the book accomplishes what I bought it for and what the title suggests-a practical guide to understanding and interpreting baby language.  The other sections on breastfeeding and sleeping with your baby are not as well written or even correct. <br /> <br />This book has been a HUGE help in educating about what the title says-communicating with your baby.  I found this to be an invaluable aid in interpretating our baby's language.  Ms. Hogg talks about baby's signs and noises as an actual language (which it really is).  Ms. Hogg was absolutely right on in all of her descriptions of what baby is really saying.  She gives accurate descriptions of  body language and verbal cues along with a thoughtful way of approaching listening that help tremendously in figuring out what the baby is really saying.  She also portrayed the world from a baby's perspective quite well. <br /> <br />It's easy for many parents to think that  every time the baby cries she is hungry or needs to be changed  (Us with our first!).  This book talked about all of the other myriad reasons that a baby fusses (overstimulation, attention, change of scenery to name a few) and gave practical, easy to do actions that meet baby's needs BEFORE she gets into a full blown cry.  By listening to your baby, watching her body language and taking note of the environment before acting, it is possible to have a happy more relaxed baby. <br /> <br />That said, I agree with some of the other comments  about the short shrift that Ms. Hogg gives breastfeeding.  She seems to be trying to to make a very strong case for accepting formula feeding.  Breastfeeding IS better for the baby-better for boosting the immune system, better for overall nutrition, WAY more convenient (no bottles, bags, mixes, etc. to bring along), and it's always the right temperature.  There are also benefits to the mother as well which I won't go into here.  Suffice it to say that the breastfeeding advice leaves a lot to be desired. <br /> <br />The \\"family bed\\" issue is also a bit misinformed. There are different styles for different families and we have experienced the upside of letting the baby sleep in your bed.  We also had a crib with my older daughter in the room with us and currently a bassinet for our newborn also beside the bed.  This does not seem to be an option in her book.  Why is it always the extremes that are discussed-total coziness in the bed with mom and dad or total separation in another room?  We do the best of both worlds.  The baby is close enough and can easily snuggle and do convenient night feedings and comfortings but we can also put her in her own bed quite easily without fuss when the bed is just a few feet away. <br /> <br />We did the same thing with my older daughter, who is now eight years old, and she never had any problems switching to her own room or sleeping in other places (grandma and grandpa's house).  I feel that this is because sleeping for her was always a safe and comforting affair both in her crib near us and with us in our bed.  She grew up without hang ups about sleeping.  She never had to wait to be comforted and she could hear us nearby so sleep was never a stress filled event. <br /> <br />I would highly recommend this book for the communication aspect.  Supplement the breastfeeding and co-sleeping sections with Dr. Sears' Baby Book. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00001OH80|2.0|Artistically speaking, the phenomenal commercial success of Let's Dance provided more problems than solutions for David Bowie. In a sense, Bowie had danced himself into a corner, and Tonight provides the soundtrack for an artist struggling between artistic integrity and commercial success. Everybody loses.<br /><br />More than anything else, Tonight lacks a distinct perspective, which is extremely disappointing for an artist of Bowie's caliber. Hearing him walk his way through the faux-reggae of \\"Don't Look Down\\" and \\"Tonight\\" is almost depressing, since it sounds so uninspired and, well, ordinary. Previously, `ordinary' is a word that never could have applied to Bowie. Here, it is unavoidable.<br /><br />Bowie records no less than five songs here that were written by or with Iggy Pop. It's almost as if the album was intended to be a tribute to his friend, but the versions here are so muted that they aren't even distinguishable as Iggy Pop songs. The sexy dependency of Pop's \\"China Girl\\" was a highlight on \\"Let's Dance\\", but nothing here comes even close to that level of successful interpretation. While I'm on the subject, there are few songs in this world that are more beautiful than Brian Wilson's \\"God Only Knows\\". That being said, Bowie's recording as it appears here only ensures that the Beach Boys' version will retain its stature as a masterpiece. The same can be said for Leiber and Stoller's \\"I Keep Forgetting,\\" which was a soulful hit for Chuck Jackson in the sixties. Then, it was revelatory. Here, it is pabulum.<br /><br />Considering how great of a writer Bowie is, why would he expend so much effort on other people's songs? Without question, the best songs on Tonight are his own, but there are only two that he wrote alone. \\"Loving the Alien\\" is somber without being morose, and \\"Blue Jean\\" is nearly ecstatic, especially when compared to its surroundings. It's a pity such a great song is buried in such a dull album. B-  Tom Ryan

B00097DXZS|3.0|Alright, I've given this album a few more listens and the album has sunk in abit more.... <br /> <br />This is the 3rd in a series of albums that Carlos has basically been more in the background. The problem is that with each installment Carlos appears to get more and more distant from the singers he is working with.... Which means that Carlos is starting to sound as if he's throwing some guitar work ontop of the songs. <br /> <br />Some of the songs still come out alright.... His duet with The Los Lonely Boys, (where the guy earlier called them a boy band? WTF?)and his duets with Steven Tyler, Mary J, Robert Randolph <br />and Anthony Hamilton are all good... However, Cry Baby Cry, I Am Somebody, and Brown Skin Girl are mediocre..... And of course we have the mediocre Michelle Branch song. <br /> <br />There are about 6 songs on this entire album that are pretty good and I will give some repeated listens... But there are no truly standout tracks, and Carlos heart just doesn't seem to be in it this time. In final, the musicians here are good enough to make some of the songs sound good despite being alittle inspired.. But honestly there is too much repetitive guitar work here. <br /> <br />Remember back on Supernatural you could tell the difference between Smooth and Maria Maria... Now, on this album Santana just sounds bored and repetitive... <br /> <br />2 1/2 stars

B0001LYH9S|3.0|When I was kid, about 8 or 9 years old, the song \\"They're Coming To Take Me Away\\" by Napoleon XIV would induce some type of sickness in me. Every time it came on the radio, it would upset me to the point where I'd get physically ill. It was so bad that I would sometimes vomit when I heard it (this happened on three separate occasions, much to my own embarrassment and consternation). I presume that it had something to do with the way that the pitch rolled around, making me feel seasick, while the subject matter scared me to death. Well, thank God this album wasn't around back then, or I might have done a lot worse than just lose my lunch. Outside concerns itself with the saga of Baby Grace, a female child raised in captivity for the sole purpose of sensual deprivation, torture and eventually, her ritual murder, dissection, and dismemberment, and subsequent display of her body parts as a work of art; \\"(Her) intestines (were) removed, disentangled and reknitted as it were, into a small net or web and hung between the pillars of the murder-location\\". Do you want to vomit yet?<br /><br />Talk about tough love. With subject matter like this, Outside qualifies as `tough like'. The tone of the album could hardly be more dark and grisly, and it is therefore difficult to say that the album is `enjoyable' on any level, and yet Bowie somehow manages to pull it together. Outside is more of a storyboard album than a `rock opera' (an absurd term for almost anything, but it's especially ludicrous here). Bowie illustrates the story by portraying the various characters through dialogue and through a musical mosaic that is almost as disturbing as the gruesome storyline. At times, the music borders on cacophonous insanity, atonal and relentlessly driving (as any depiction of art-based ritual murder should be, I suppose). Melodies are minimal, often working against the chord structure as a means of depicting mental imbalance.<br /><br />Musically, Outside is excellent, with tight, ominous arrangements that could seep the oxygen right out of the room. In particular, the off-kilter piano work of Mike Garson is exceptional throughout. If nothing else, this album proves that Bowie's creative imagination is still intact, albeit commercially challenged. In that sense, Outside is the polar opposite of Never Let Me Down (released only two years previously), an album that bent over backwards to please everybody but failed artistically. Artistically, Outside is a triumph. Commercially, it is doomed. There are no hit singles here, believe me, but there is plenty for you to mull over; just don't do it on a full stomach.

B00008S2VG|2.0|Sure, she put the M in MTV, but the mercurial and exhilarating thing about Madonna hasn't really been her visual...her most prodigious talent has been as a bitingly on-the-mark songwriter - infectious melodies, aesthetic lyrics - altering the very core of the texture with every new release. And while American Life is crammed with interesting twists and unpredictable turns, the over all mood is detachment - individually we have a few terrific cuts, but as a thread, it seems frayed.<br /><br />Lyrically, the album could have been sub-titled, Madonna Don't Preach. Where Ray Of Light sort-of resurrected a personal diary not seen since her masterpiece, Like A Prayer almost a decade before, and Music delved further into her inherent disco queen muse, American Life feels didactic, as if, now in her 40s, married and with children, she has the right to tell us how shallow life is and what we should do about it. It's self-absorbed and rings false - and not very convincing from the most famous woman in the world.<br /><br />But, within those finely drawn lines, there are a few stand out tracks...Nothing Fails, with it's switch from blips to acoustics to a Prayer-like chorus, and Mother And Father, which is not as sappy as one might expect, and especially the underrated and demiurgic Die Another Day, one of the guiltiest of all the Bond pleasures.<br /><br />American Life may fall behind her finest works, but still far ahead of all the copycats she spawned.

B00001OH7T|3.0|This was just too weird. After me spending most of my high school years trying to appropriate the look of David Bowie as best as I could without violating my Catholic, all-boys high school dress code, things came full circle and Bowie started to dress like me. What fun was there in that? Gone were the outrageous glam duds. In their place was a little Lord Fauntleroy version of a Sears shopper. How could this be Bowie? After the lame and very disappointing \\"Diamond Dogs\\", I had already abandoned Bowie, so Young Americans seemed totally extraneous to me at the time, and wrongheaded to boot.<br /><br />I had jumped to conclusions. While the hit singles from this album (\\"Fame\\", co-written with John Lennon, and the title track) still sound a bit stilted to me, there is a sense of purpose here that flies in the face of convention, a characteristic that I had originally missed completely. By co-opting `ordinary' dress and borrowing heavily from a well-known musical style (Philly soul, the real precursor to disco), Bowie launched himself light years away from his Ziggy persona. That in itself was worth a fortune, especially to Bowie, who knew he'd be doomed to the typical shelf life of a `genre representative' if he didn't break out. Young Americans moved Bowie about as far away from that persona as he could have gotten at that time, and although it was an extraordinarily awkward transition, it worked, but it didn't work as a change in style as much as it worked as a musical change.<br /><br />Futuristic references and alien poses were transposed into a middle American, lowbrow ideal, causing an entirely new frame of reference for Bowie's music. As a result, tales of backseat romance and relationships in transition take the front seat. Names of bandmembers that had become second nature to Bowie fans (Mick Ronson, et al) were nowhere to be found here, either, replaced with slick studio musicians and backing vocalists. The best tunes weren't the ones getting the airplay, either. Radio fans might have drawn conclusions from hearing \\"Fame\\" and \\"Young Americans\\", but the real story for this album was told in emotionally direct songs such as \\"Win\\", \\"Somebody Up There Likes Me\\" and \\"Can You Hear Me\\". Each of these three recordings marked something brand new for Bowie, proving that he could stretch his boundaries beyond the already broad territory that he had covered, with very moving compositions about (to paraphrase Jimi Hendrix) love and confusion. In retrospect, Young Americans still doesn't stand out as one of Bowie's most cohesive efforts, but isn't half-bad, either, especially if you're willing to listen past the hits.

B000B2YQX4|3.0|The last, good-from-start-to-finish album was Songs of Faith and Devotion.  Granted, I personally didn't care much for it when it came out.  I discovered DM with Violator, and SOFAD was light years away from that.  Plus, I just felt like they were trying to cash in on the Seattle grunge rock movement that was hot at the time.  Still, I can acknowledge that it was a solid album.<br /><br />Nowadays, like most fans, I can only hope that each new release will have at least a couple of good tracks to justify the expense.  Call me and others cynical, but Depeche Mode just doesn't have it in them to create a genre-defining album anymore.  Hell, Violator is now 15 years old.  That was slightly more than half my lifetime ago!<br /><br />Playing the Angel starts promisingly.  Take the first five tracks, and you have something that can stand toe-to-toe with Songs of Faith and Devotion.  A Pain that I'm Used To is bombastic, edgy, and features Dave Gahan's trademark vocal delivery.  I think the Nine Inch Nails comparison is a little much, but it makes sense.  Next on the list is John the Revelator.  The lyrics are a bit suspect, but the song itself is great- a real foot stomper, with Dave's aggressive vocals.  Suffer Well keeps the momentum going.  It's a high-octane track that takes you in right away, and the bitterness of the verse yields to the despair of the chorus, heightened by a switch in Dave's singing register.  The Sinner in Me slows things down just a bit.  It comes dangerously close to being dull, that is until you hear the chorus, which pulls it all together.  Say what you will, but no other group makes religious angst sound sexy, like Depeche Mode.  The Sinner in Me darkly pulsates. Plus, it has an interesting \\"coda\\" at the end.<br /><br />After the bombast of the first four songs, we are treated to Precious, which is the Depeche Mode we knew and loved pre-SOFAD.  There have been a million comparisons to Enjoy the Silence, and I think that's false.  Don't get me wrong; Precious is a still a great tune.  Dave sings like he did in the eighties, before he got hooked on Nirvana.  This is the smooth, polished vocal delivery that made thousands of teenage girls fall in love with him.<br /><br />So far, DM is five-for-five.  I rate the first four tracks at 4.5 stars.  Unfortunately, things begin to ravel with the awful Macro.  What was Martin Gone thinking when he laid down the embarassing vocals, when he penned the cringe-inducing lyrics?  I can't bring myself to listen to the whole song, not even one time.  I Want It All follows, and as much as I want to like the song, it sounds like a train to nowhere.  In terms of being a dreamy, introspective ballad, I can't help but compare it to the sublime Waiting for the Night.  That was a masterpiece.  I Want it All sounds like some lost transmission in outer space.  And we're not talking the Bjork variety (apologies to the fan who tried to compare it to the superlative All is Full of Love).<br /><br />Okay, a couple of less-than-stellar clunkers.  The rest of the album has to be awesome, right?  Wrong.  Nothing's Impossible fails to get off the ground, mostly due to Dave's monotone singing that gets stale after the first verse or two.  Introspectre is a boring instrumental track.  Damaged People improves a little on Macro, but still comes off as an exercise in histrionic excess.<br /><br />Finally, after so much disappointment, we arrive at Lilian.  My only complaint is that they should not have dry-treated Dave's vocals so much.  Aside from that, it's a winner, that harkens back to the Black Celebration era.  As a matter of fact, it reminds me a lot of But Not Tonight, which is a personal favorite.<br /><br />The album ends with Darkest Star, which should be renamed Lost in Space Two.  Another train to nowhere, which tries hard to be poignant.  As an album closer, it has nothing on Clean, from Violator, or Insight, from Ultra.<br /><br />So, there you have it.  Any fool can see that they packed the good songs at the beginning, and stuck Lilian towards the end as a distraction to fool you into thinking that the rest of the album is as good.  If Lilian had followed Precious, you could almost write off the rest of the album.  The fact that Depeche Mode couldn't fill out an entire album with good material is a sad reminder of how far their glory days are behind them.towards the end as a distraction to fool you into thinking that the rest of the album is as good.

B00001OH7O|4.0|With Hunky Dory, David Bowie reached artistic heights that were barely suggested by his previous work. In one album, Bowie manages to combine virtually every aspect of his multi-faceted musical personas, presenting himself as a Dylan-influenced folkie (\\"Eight Line Poem\\", \\"Quicksand\\"), an Anthony Newley-influenced showman (\\"Fill Your Heart\\"), an androgynous rocker (\\"Queen Bitch\\", \\"Oh! You Pretty Things\\"), a self-analytical singer/songwriter (\\"Changes\\") and a space case (the incredible \\"Life On Mars?\\"). By drawing from each of his musical wells, Bowie had assembled his first musical masterpiece, one that was as unique as it was stunning. This is especially true having come on the heels of his hard-rock effort, The Man Who Sold the World, which was much more limited in its artistic scope.<br /><br />All over Hunky Dory, the mood and style shifts relentlessly, with hardly two tracks sounding as though they were written by the same person. Bowie name-drops Bob Dylan and Andy Warhol (in the song titles, no less!), but placates neither of them. On Hunky Dory, Bowie emulates no one so much as himself, and he does this brilliantly. \\"Changes\\" is most commercially successful composition since \\"Space Oddity\\", and yet, with lyrics like \\"I watch the ripples change their size, but never leave the stream of warm impermanence...\\", it hardly sounds anything at all like a pop song. Speaking of \\"Space Oddity\\", \\"Life On Mars\\" redresses the simplicity of his earlier hit with dense, oblique lyrics that go light years beyond the facile vision of his earliest hit record. Add the accompaniment of full orchestration to this marvelous melody, and you have a composition that will stand as an all-time classic example of mid-seventies rock-and-roll pretension, made all the more credible by the lustrous piano work of none other than Rick Wakeman (of Yes fame). \\"Kooks\\" presents yet another side of Bowie that is rarely visible, that of the autobiographical, sensitive and romantic father figure. \\"Queen Bitch\\" is the only song on this collection that even suggests Bowie's metamorphosis into Ziggy Stardust and by then, the glam-rock fans would find much of Hunky Dory to be anachronistic. It was their loss. Few artists have the diversity to assemble anything that even resembles the artistry of Hunky Dory, which is only made more apparent with the passing of time.

My favorites being My Immortal (of course, how do you not love that song), Going Under, Tournaquet, Haunted and of course Bring Me to Life (what an amazing song).

B00027LCRG|3.0|Hours? It's more like years since David Bowie finished an album that was something other than conceptual in its nature. Almost all of his recent album projects have been defined by the styles incorporated, or by a storyline concept (the convoluted but clever Outside, the techno-influenced Earthling, et. al.), but unless I'm missing something, Hours is Bowie's most unencumbered work in quite a while. It's almost like old times, actually, containing a batch of songs that could be heard either together or separately, with no repercussions. As such, it is also some of Bowie's best work in a long time, since the songs coexist snugly without leaning on one another.<br /><br />Whether it's due to the impending millennium and all of the implications that it brings with it, or personal experiences that have altered his perspective is unclear, but the songs on Hours are anything but opaque. Throughout this album, Bowie is emotionally direct, confronting love and loss with a vulnerability that might surprise those who have him pigeonholed as an artistic poseur. On \\"Survive\\", he sings with emotional candor to an estranged (or possibly deceased) lover or friend, \\"You're the great mistake I never made. I never lied to you, I hated when you lied, and I'll survive your naked eyes...I love you\\". That in itself is a revelation, since I cannot recall previously hearing Bowie sing the words \\"I love you\\". This direct vulnerability expands as the disk continues, with self-searching, emotionally wrought lines like \\"If I'm dreaming my life, was she ever here\\" (from \\"If I'm Dreaming My Life\\") and \\"Hold my face before you. Still my trembling heart. Seven days to live my life or seven ways to die (from \\"Seven\\").<br /><br />This liberation of self-expression has opened new vistas for Bowie, who seems resigned to accept the nature of a fickle music business that looks to artists less than half his age to provide new revelations for a new generation. He is no longer making a play for commerciality. He is satisfied to communicate with those who are genuinely interested, and his fan base remains adequate to provide him this luxury. Very, very few artists on the top of the charts have more to say than Bowie, and almost none are as eloquent. As Bowie sings in \\"The Pretty Things Are Going to Hell,\\" \\"I'm reaching the very edge y'know. I'm going to the other side this time.\\" I for one would rather follow him over the edge than wait around for a younger bard to fight his way through the morass, only to possibly end up a loser.

Throughout The Joy Luck Club food is used to symbolize numerous things. Food is used to represent the actual Joy Luck Club, to symbolize Chinese culture and tradition, and to signify relationships. When the Joy Luck Club meets, the members are only allowed to think cheerful thoughts and say positive things while playing a rousing game of mah-jongg. All of the women need this club because they have had horrible pasts with incredibly tragic things happening to each of them. The women agree to bring food to each of their meetings and, at the beginning, it is merely rotten oranges and flavorless dumplings. Though the food may be unappetizing, the women in the Joy Luck Club don't acknowledge it and declare the food to be magnificent. This is because the point of the Joy Luck Club is only to think sanguinely and not worry about what you do not have or the terrible things going on in the world. Food also wonderfully symbolizes Chinese culture and tradition.  <br /> <br />What a wonderful message this books gives. There are many horrible things that happen in life, spending time with friends and having fun should be cherished. For many these times are what is best in life.

Friends can also be made everyday, although most of use don't take the opportunity to meet new people everyday. Cherish what you have... <br />
B000002HPV|4.0|Bjork is one of the most difficult of all contemporary musicians to criticize, because she always seems to be one step ahead of the criticism. She is so thoroughly unique that any negative opinion would almost certainly be subject to review, since it is hard to imagine a reviewer who would be capable of claiming that he or she understands the work well enough to bring it down a peg or two. Much of Bjork's work seems foreign simply because she is; it is rare for a woman from Iceland to conquer the world market. Her unusual style can certainly be attributed to her Scandinavian upbringing, and I believe (uh-oh, here I go) that this is most likely because she was fairly isolated from `standard' (i.e., American, indigenous, blues-based) music structures. In addition, though, there can be little doubt that Bjork is one of the most willful artists of this era.<br /><br />Her songwriting is opaque and mysterious, but not unpleasant, kind of like night swimming. It is something that can be appreciated solely for the textures, for the aesthetic experience, even if you cannot make out exactly what it is that you are basking in. Bjork is intelligent enough to reach into unknown territory, but what she brings back is so personal and unusual that it is hard for most others to follow her. If you hang on, it should eventually pay off, but an open mind is essential to finding the key to her work. Homogenic is rich with string arrangements and kinetic percussion programming, both of which supply the musical backbone to her melodic flights of fancy. Occasionally, repetition stands in the way (\\"Joga\\" had my sons laughing at seemingly endless the chorus melody) but she is off on a path of her own, and I for one am willing to follow her.<br /><br />It seems as though females are much more inclined to break down melodic barriers and search for a truly unique means of expression than most men are. Joni Mitchell, Kate Bush, Tori Amos, Sophie B. Hawkins and Jane Siberry are but a few who have taken melody into their own hands and attempted to transform it beyond typically recognizable boundaries. Since Joni Mitchell, Bjork has been the most successful at this game, putting an unpredictable spin on almost everything she touches. Make no mistake - these are Bjork's songs, and they aren't meant to be performed by anyone else (although it isn't impossible, just unlikely). Nobody else could do justice to work that is so personal. Rather than criticize what I cannot understand, I will just bask in it and let it wash over me.

006072448X|5.0|Lionel Shriver's adeptness in addressing an issue as ghastly as a Columbine-like incident and the implications therein is nothing short of brilliant.  The presentation is unique, the writing flawless, and the commentary relevant.  Be forewarned, however, the writing is somewhat grandiloquent at times and can detract from the message & theme of the book, albeit the protagonist in the book, Eva, being the sophisticated character she is, would not have shyed away from such language.
B00001OH7N|3.0|When this album was initially released at the start of the seventies, it was difficult to say if David Bowie was a chameleon or a lost soul. There was virtually no continuity from project to project, making it impossible for fans to get a hold on him. For this reason, The Man Who Sold the World disappeared from record store shelves rather quickly, sending it to cutout bins, at least until his Ziggy Stardust persona renewed interest in his previous careers and forced the reissue of this album. From a contemporary perspective, it's not at all hard to hear the `classic' elements of Bowie's style emerge in various places on this album, but at the time, it must have been a bit of a hoot.<br /><br />Can you imagine a Bowie album that, stylistically speaking, would attempt to compete with Black Sabbath? Well, that pretty much explains the musical thrust of The Man Who Sold the World. With songs like \\"Running Gun Blues\\" (\\"I'll slash them cold, I'll kill them dead, I broke the gooks I cracked their heads, I'll slice them till they're running red...\\") and \\"She Shook Me Cold\\" (\\"I had no time to spare. I grabbed her golden hair and threw her to the ground. Father, she caved. Oh Lord, the things she said...\\"), Bowie manages to cover every early seventies heavy metal clich&eacute; without ever sounding quite so ordinary. \\"All the Madmen\\" enriches the stereotypical mix, by celebrating insanity as a means of uniqueness, something that Ozzy could have written a book about (OK, maybe somebody could have ghost-written it for him).<br /><br />Still in all, The Man Who Sold the World rises above its most pedestrian pursuits with some songs that are not only artistically credible, but have since proven to have shelf-lives well beyond even their creator's expectations. Nirvana's cover of the title song is fine, but not any better than Bowie's original, and Width of a Circle is an eight minute travelogue of heavy rock weirdness, aided and abetted by the intense guitar and rhythm work of Mick Ronson, Woody Woodmansey and Tony Visconti (the producer took the role of bass player for this record). For the most part, it's a solid four-piece unit that portrays these songs, and it is one of Bowie's most direct musical presentations ever. In coming years, Bowie would revisit this side of his creativity, albeit in a different manner, with his band Tin Machine. Much earlier, though, it is The Man Who Sold the World which captures Bowie and his bandmates helping to invent `hard' rock.

B0000AZAUM|5.0|The best characteristic about Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars is also its major weakness, which is Bowie's innate talent at knowing his audience. There was a generation of kids who were waiting, practically frothing at the mouth, for something as liberating and exciting as this Ziggy Stardust character to come along.

By appealing so grandly to contemporary youth, it meant that Bowie's `Stardust' character was doomed to become little more than a charming memory. He's so damned accurate in capturing the shock appeal of an early `70s teenager's aspirations that much of the record sounds a bit juvenile now.

B00001OH7M|3.0|Somewhere between the Summer of Love and the reign of Ziggy Stardust, a lad named David Jones was breaking away from stage-driven theatrical music and trying to define a new image for himself. In 1969, he finally hit, with a strangely naïve but engrossing song entitle \\"Space Oddity\\". The lyrics showed very little in the knowledge of space travel, but spoke volumes about the inherent loneliness of an age when such a thing was accomplished and blithely accepted by the public at large. David Bowie (as he has dubbed himself) was `on the map', so to speak. America would need to wait a few more years before Bowie would conquer our shores in the guise of Lady Stardust, but his imprint was profound enough for this late 60's timepiece to see the light of day some time in 1972.<br /><br />At the time, Space Oddity (the album, not the song) seemed to suffer a bit from its lack of timeliness. The album betrayed Bowie's affinity toward Dylan, if not openly, than certainly in subtler ways. The wordplay of \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\" and \\"Cygnet Committee\\" simply could not have existed without Dylan's influence. For fans of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars, this was an anachronism of the worst kind, a songwriting foible that Bowie had yet to overcome. Seen from today's perspective, however, this album has managed to survive quite nicely. Besides the title track, songs like \\"Janine\\" and \\"God Knows I'm Good\\" hold up as pleasant, if not particularly significant pop music. Believe it or not, the album even contains a blues-based jam (the afore-mentioned \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\") that sounds more contemporary now than it did then!<br /><br />Throughout his career, Bowie has toyed with his image, thus forcing his audience to think, or at least react, to his changes. \\"Space Oddity\\" presents an opportunity for fans to hear Bowie as an `unwashed' young man, searching for his first truly successful identity. It might not appeal to everyone, but anybody who has an appreciation for Bowie's ability to morph himself into various shapes will certainly find themselves fascinated by his first attempts at becoming a rock star.

B000000WCX|3.0|If I were a cynical little bugger, I might be inclined to say that Earthling finds Bowie in reactionary mode, hopping onto a trend instead of culling one of his own. I am not, however, a cynical little bugger. I fancy myself an open-minded, fair individual who judges things on their actual merit instead of first impressions. Therefore, being the wonderfully insightful person that I am, I am willing to accept that Bowie came about his obsession with the drums-and-bass branch of techno in a less than cynical manner, immersing himself in this style because he genuinely liked it, and not because it was perceived by other critics (much more cynical than myself) as the latest and greatest, bound to be next-big-thing.<br /><br />Needless to say, `drums `n' bass' never was the next big thing. In reality, it barely got off the ground, since it appealed only to club-fiends with dilated pupils, who liked their music to be as underground as possible. That's quite a shame for them, though, because Earthling just might be one of the best drum-and-bass-style techno albums ever made. Unlike the huge majority of artists who dabble in the blips, bleeps and hyperkinetic rhythms that define this style, Bowie does not choose to neglect other more fundamentally sound ingredients, such as a real `song', or a genuine `melody'. In the rush to be the hippest DJ on the block, most purveyors of drums and bass don't even try to create `songs' or melodies, with the end result sounding as though it was created by some kid who forgot to take his Ritalin. Bowie was and always will be primarily a songwriter, and this album is all the richer for it.<br /><br />More than half of Earthling consists of near spastic syncopations, all of which are imaginatively constructed under some very good songs. `Under' is the key word here, since the songs could exist without the production and still sound pretty damn good. The arrangements here are genuinely fun, though, with sounds panning left and right, stopping and starting on the head of a pin, all in service to the song. To hear what this could sound like without the context of a talent like Bowie at the helm, check out just about anything by, say, Aphex Twin. There, the rhythmic skeleton exists for its own sake. Here, Bowie provides meat for the bones, giving you something to hum and think about while contorting yourself. A song like \\"Little Wonder\\" is a little wonder of its own devices, as is \\"Dead Man Walking\\". The songs that aren't so kinetically inclined are just as interesting; \\"I'm Afraid of Americans\\" is a humorous depiction of paranoia, with Bowie recoiling from a culture that inspires instant gratification and consumerism (as well as a free pass to the next big thing). Of course, Bowie's tongue is buried deep in his cheek here, especially considering that he remains one of the best purveyors of contemporary culture that we have. God bless him.

B00001OH7X|5.0|With a career as varied as Bowie's, it is all but impossible to pick a favorite album, especially since he's assumed so many guises and toyed with his sound as much as his image. If you are talking about social impact, Ziggy Stardust would be the likely winner. If you're talking about scraunching rock and roll performed with an attitude that transcends mere mortals, then Aladdin Sane might cop the prize. For inventiveness, Low could win. It all depends what you are looking for, but if it is possible to judge Bowie's work objectively (a ridiculous thought, actually) then what album contains the best of all his virtues? Probably Lodger.<br /><br />Lodger hits upon so many touchstones that it is practically impossible to categorize, even for Bowie. Everything that it does, it does with elan. World music, atmospherics, driving rock and roll, pensive ballads, phenomenal musicianship and stunning lyrics flow from this album with such grace and ease that it is almost easy to overlook just how creative it all is, especially as a package. The `hits' are among Bowie's best, from the smarmy, sarcastic 1-2 punch of \\"D.J.\\" to the tongue-in-cheek mannerisms of \\"Boys Keep Swinging,\\" they are flawless in their execution. Adrian Belew's guitar work on the latter song is so over-the-top loony that it inspires fits of laughter and admiration.<br /><br />Bowie's palette is so broad on Lodger that it overwhelms. It is hard to fathom what sort of imagination could conjure the stream of consciousness reverie of \\"African Night Flight\\" as well as the dream-state playfulness of \\"Red Sails\\", only to accurately capture the mental state of a frustrated wife-beater with \\"Repetition\\" and reflections on mortality suggested by the beautiful \\"Fantastic Voyage.\\" Throw in a Turkish-inspired melody (\\"Yassassin\\") and what might be one of his hardest-rocking songs ever (\\"Look Back in Anger\\") and you've got a full-blown masterpiece. This point is only driven home by the fact that it sounds just as futuristic/contemporary today as it did in 1979. If Bowie is a genius, then the evidence lies herein.

B0000VZEGE|4.0|This Roald Dahl book picks up where \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" left off.  Willy Wonka, Charlie, Charlie's parents and both sets of Charlie's grandparents (Grandpa Joe, Grandma Josephine, Grandpa George, and Grandma Georgina) along with their big bed all go for a ride in the great glass elevator right after Mr. Wonka has just told Charlie that he is going to give him the Chocolate Factory.  The book is split up into two parts, the first of which is where they take a trip out into space in the elevator to visit a new space hotel that is just opening up and have to fight off some space aliens called the \\"Vermicious Knids\\" that can twist their bodies into letters and like to eat people.  While they are in space they are mistaken for aliens themselves when they are scene by the \\"commuter capsule\\" that is on it's way to the hotel to drop off the hotel staff.  (The book was written in 1972 so they didn't use the term \\"space shuttle\\" as of yet).  Shuckworth, Shanks, and Showler are the names of the three astronauts flying the commuter capsule (they sound like a law firm), and when they see the great glass elevator docking with the hotel ahead of them they report this to the president.  The president is portrayed as a big kid who can't do anything unless he has his nurse's permission.  Mrs. Tibbs was the president's nurse/nanny when he was growing up and he had made her his vice-president.  There were some funny scenes here with the astronauts and president, but this first part seemed a little dated for the most part.  It was also a little annoying in the beginning when all of the four grandparents were in the elevator, and Dahl felt compelled to provide them all with one or two word lines anytime one of them spoke.  While the first part was slightly amusing but seemed a little dated at times, the second part however was excellent.  In the second part they return to the wonderful Chocolate Factory and Mr. Wonka does some experimenting with drugs that will either make you older or younger.  After having experimented on volunteer Oompa-Loompas for years he eventually had invented Wonka-vite that makes you twenty years younger, and Vita-Wonk that makes you twenty years older.  Some problems occur however when Wonka tries to use these on Charlie's grandparents and they can't remember exactly how old they currently are.  When Grandma Georgina takes too much Wonka-vite she is turned into a minus and Mr. Wonka and Charlie have to go to Minusland in the glass elevator to rescue her.  Along the way they see some other marvelous parts of the factory, including a rock candy mountain.  I'd love to see someone make a movie sequel to \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\" by expounding upon the second part of this book.  This was another great book by Roald Dahl, and as usual Quentin Blake's illustrations are excellent and added immensely to the story.ke you older or younger.

B00001OH7Y|4.0|If awards were given out for `Most Remarkable Opening Track,\\" then the first track from Scary Monsters would have destroyed all comers. The rhythm barely establishes itself when out of nowhere a vocalist named Michi Hirota starts ranting in Japanese, sounding as if she's about to attack YOU, the listener. It's disconcerting as hell, but also amusing, although many listeners are probably put off by the absurd risk Bowie takes with such a maneuver. As the song progresses, the guitar of Robert Fripp falls into an arpeggiated walk that is 99 ¾% pure, glorious noise, until finally, at track's end, Bowie screams loudly, \\"SHUT UP!!!!\\" It's all so weird and deliberately artful, which just about sums up Bowie's intentions with this record.<br /><br />Scary Monsters marks the final entry in Bowie's mid-period spout of genius. Coming on the heels of Low, `Heroes', and Lodger, it serves as a summary of his artistic intentions from that period. The cover art playfully references this, too, since artwork from all three of these albums is displayed in distressed form on the back cover. Interestingly, the album's most popular single also references Bowie's past, although a bit older. \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" updates us on the whereabouts of Major Tom, the character who was last seen lost in space in Bowie's first hit, \\"Space Oddity.\\" Well, somehow Tom found his way home, but from the sound of things, he might have been better off if he kept on drifting, as Bowie informs us, \\"Ashes to ashes, funk to funky, we know Major Tom's a junkie, strung out in heaven's high, hitting an all-time low.\\"<br /><br />The shave-and-a-haircut, two-bits, Bo Diddley rhythm of \\"Up the Hill Backwards\\" adequately displays just how original Bowie was at this time, since the rather conventional rhythm is put through paces that were never even suggested by previous rock-and-rollers. \\"Scary Monsters\\" raises the ante even further, with a screaming, rollicking riff that lives up to the song title. \\"Fashion\\" is a brilliant poke at the fashion industry, and Bowie sounds as if he genuinely enjoys biting the hand that has fed his career.<br /><br />If the album continued at this pace, it would be almost miraculous, but alas, side two lacks the virtuosity and vision of the album's first half. The low point is Bowie's cover of a wobbly Tom Verlaine (ex-Television) melody called \\"Kingdom Come\\" that never solidifies into anything cohesive. The rest of this side is fine if not brilliant; as can be best conveyed by comparing the tamer version of \\"It's No Game\\" that closes the album with that crazy Japanese rant version. It's very good, and compelling lyrically, but only the opening version sounds as though the safety is off of the trigger.

B00005QY5Y|4.0|Oops. After struggling with Adams' previous album, Heartbreaker, and eventually giving up on it, I presumed that his solo career was going to hold little interest for me. Well, based on Gold, I'm going to have to re-evaluate that presumption. Where Heartbreaker was lackluster and dull, Gold is ambitious and intriguing. Heartbreaker lulled me to sleep with an endless series of lullaby-like dirges, but this new collection sets the pace with a bit more energy, resulting in an album that is downright stimulating, or at least interesting. The full collection features a rather generous twenty-one songs, five of which appear on a second disk entitled `Side 4'.<br /><br />Most of the songs here are chord-driven, mid-tempo rockers with appealing melodies. The overall feel remains earthy, but Adams isn't afraid to use flourishes as required, so arrangements are sometimes ornamental, using orchestration and choruses to full effect. It's no wonder that Elton John took a liking to Adams, since the arrangements here suggest those found on Tumbleweed Connection and his own first album. At other times, Adam sounds like he could have been writing for the 1974-era Faces; a song like \\"Rescue Blues\\" could have been an outtake from the \\"Ooh La La\\" sessions. At first, \\"New York\\" sounds like a love letter to Manhattan, but it is really directed to a female resident. In retrospect, the video that accompanied this track is relatively creepy, since it featured Adams singing with the World Trade Center as his backdrop, filmed just days before 9/11.<br /><br />As the disk progresses, the songs build upon one another. \\"Firecracker\\" is a pleasant, rootsy, mid-tempo rocker that is typical of the album, as is \\"Answering Bell, which also features a fine melody but adds a nice organ break for flavor. The best songs arrive mid-disk, though, with the melancholy reflection of<br /><br />\\"Somehow, Someday\\" surpassed only by the gorgeously wrought melody of \\"When the Stars Go Blue,\\" a song that might qualify as Adams' best to date. \\"Sylvia Plath\\" could have been equally intriguing, but a line like \\"Maybe she'd give me a bath\\" wrecks the mood, since it strikes me as a rather obvious and artless reach for a rhyme with the subject's name. The overall mood here is both sad and beautiful, although things start to slack off towards disk's end. The bonus tracks add some fun to the equation, and although Gold still has its share of filler, there is plenty here to recommend it.<br /><br />Afternote - In the wake of Gold, Adams seemed poised to hit a home run with his next record. Instead, he opted to bunt, releasing a collection of uneven demo tracks. Far be it from me to give career advice, though.

B000B0WODA|1.0|This CD installed trojan-horse spyware on my Windows-based computer, without informing me.  My company had to reinstall Windows, after erroneously purchasing a new optical drive, thinking that was the problem.    SONY/BMG releases contain spyware.  This is not rumor, it is now reported in the mainstream news (...)    YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO RIP MP3s OF THESE SONGS, and play them on more than one device, as the CD is currently formatted.  Think on that.  Plus, you will have your Windows permanantly altered with tracking software.    I would avoid this and all other Sony/BMG releases until this issue is settled.  In the meantime, perhaps artists could stick up for their fans and demand that the record company do better.

0307263118|5.0|As expected, I found The Sea to be another beautifully written gem from a modern master of prose. I find much of the criticism of Banville's latest more or less sour grapes over the Booker Prize rather than an actual opinion of the book on its own. I suppose you'll see this at times when you have such worthy competition.
B00097DXZS|1.0|This disc does not comply with the \\"Red Book\\" standard for \\"Compact Disc Digital Audio\\", of which Sony was a co-author. These standards were developed so that media and devices could be developed independently of each other, and still \\"play nice\\" with one another. Sony has decided, on it's own accord, to violate the standard in order to advance their own anti-consumer agenda.     Be forwarned...the technology used by Sony on this disc requires anyone who wants to listen to this disc on their Windows computer to install Sony's special malware software, which cannot be removed by the owner of the computer system. In otherwords, Sony hijacks a portion of your computer to play their product. Personally, I think that _I_ should be in control of my own computer system, and that my computer system should not have control over ME.     Think before you buy.
B000063DGC|5.0|I say that because there is and never will be anyone who can reach the level of Randy Rhoads. Alot of people who listen to the studio albums will say that we way overate Randy, but once you listen to this album all other guitar players will seem like babies with broken fingers. This is the greatest live album I have ever heard and possibly the best album ever next Use Your Illusion II.<br />If you do not believe me listen to Mr. Crowley or Suicide Solution on this album, they are the most inhuman guitar work ever. Suicide Solution is like Machine Gun and Eruption together, except exponentially more amazing.<br /><br />Ozzy album ranking:<br />How can you even rate the other albums next to this one!?! WTF! DO you think I'm a f#$%ed up retard? Screw You! The other albums don't even deserve to be in the same league or building with Tribute!

0060934913|4.0|It was a great read-- as a vet in the restaurant biz, all the sour grape reviews you read-- are people jealous they didn't write the book themself.  Its accurate and to those who freak-- get over it.  Did you really expect staff to put up with long hours, and your whining etc etc?  Did you die?  I only cook for family and friends now, and they freak when I cut or burn myself.  But its a perspective, you work with knives, you work with ovens, you get cut and burned.  I have worked in a lot of industries, and above all, the restaurant biz is not for whiners.  I have never seen the show, but the book is great fun.
3257229534|5.0|Winner of the Boston Review's Fisk Fiction Prize, this thematically complex story is written in clear, simple, lucid prose. It is a straightforward telling of an encounter that was to mark fifteen year old Michael Berg for life. The book, written as if it were a memoir, is divided into three parts. The first part of the book deals with that encounter.<br /><br />While on his way home from school one day in post-war Germany, Michael becomes ill. He is aided by a beautiful and buxom, thirty six year old blonde named Hanna Schmitz. When he recovers from his illness, he goes to Frau Schmitz's home to thank her and eventually finds himself seduced by her and engaged in a sexual encounter. They become lovers for a period of time, and a component of their relationship was that Michael would read aloud to her. Michael romanticizes their affair, which is a cornerstone of his young life. They even go away on a trip together. Then, one day, as suddenly as she appeared in his life, she disappears, having inexplicably moved with no forwarding address.<br /><br />The second part of the book deals with Michael's chance encounter with Hanna again. He is now a law student in a seminar that is focused on Germany's Nazi past and the related war trials. The students are young and eager to condemn all who, after the end of the war, had tolerated the Nazis in their midst. Even Michael's parents do not escape his personal condemnation. The seminar is to be an exploration of the collective guilt of the German people, and Michael embraces the opportunity, as do others of his generation, to philosophically condemn the older generation for having sat silently by. Then, he is assigned to take notes on a trial of some camp guards.<br /><br />To his total amazement, one of the accused is Hanna, his Hanna. He stoically remains throughout the trial, realizing as he hears the evidence that she is refusing to divulge the one piece of evidence that could possibly absolve her or, at least, mitigate her complicity in the crimes with which she is charged. It is as if she considers her secret, that of her inability to read and write, more shameful than that of which she is accused. Yet, Michael, too, remains mute on the fact that would throw her legal, if not her moral, guilt into question. Consequently, Hanna finds herself bearing the legal guilt of all those involved in the crime of which she is accused and is condemned accordingly.<br /><br />The third part of the book is really the way Michael deals with having found Hanna, again. He removes himself from further demonstration and discussion on the issue of Germany's Nazi past. It affects his decisions as to his career in the law, eventually choosing a legal career that is isolating. He marries and has a child but finds that he cannot be free of Hanna. He cannot be free of the pain of having loved Hanna. It is as if Hanna has marked him for life. He divorces and never remarries. It is as if he cannot love another, as he loved Hanna. Michael then reaches out to Hanna in prison, indirectly, through the secret they share of what she seems to be most ashamed. Yet, he carefully never personalizes the contact. The end, when it comes, is almost anti-climatic.<br /><br />The relationship between Michael and Hanna really seems to be analogous to the relationship between the generations of Germans in post-war Germany. The affair between Michael and Hanna is representational of the affair that Germany had with the Nazi movement. The eroticism of the book is a necessary component for the collective guilt and shame that the Germans bear for the Holocaust, as well as for the moral divide that seemingly exists between the generations. Yet, the book also shows that such is not always a black and white issue, that there are sometimes gray areas when one discusses one's actions in the context of the forces of good and evil. There is also the issue of legal and moral responsibility. One would think that the two are synonymous, butthey are not always so. It also philosophizes on the ability to love another/a nation who/that was complicit in war crimes. This is the German text edition of \\"The Reader\\", an insightful, allegorical book that defies categorizing. It is also a book that is a wonderful selection for a reading circle, as it has a wealth of issues that are ripe for discussion. This is simply a superlative book. Bravo!they are not always so.

0689865384|5.0|I bought this book because I had purchased the authors previous novels, both being in the \\"Midnighters\\" trilogy and enjoying them both very much. This was an amazing novel, you start off thinking that society has finally gotten its stuff together and created harmony. At the age of 16 you are given an operation that turns you from an \\"ugly\\" to a \\"pretty\\" and all the uglies want to to be one of the pretties.  <br /> <br />Makes sense, I would hate having to be called \\"ugly\\" for my life. Then everything fall around the greatness of being a pretty. Tally the main character of the book runs into a person who becomes here best fried. Shay want to never have the pretty operation and runs a way to this place where everyone is ugly and lives like they did in the old times, which the people of that time are called \\"Rusties\\" as all the stuff they created has turned to rust or rubble.  <br /> <br />Shay does run away to the \\"Smoke\\" and Tally is upset that she did not go along with her(a little), but then she is forced to go to the Smoke because of the other breed of people thata round besides the Pretties and Uglies, they are the \\"Specials\\" or Special Circumstances and they want to destroy the smoke and all places similar to it. Tally complies, because they say they will make her stay ugly forever, which is the most devastating thing possible in her mind, so she goes to spy and reveal the location of the Smoke. <br /> <br />Then she learns to love it, but eventually she does some tings which bring down the Smoke and lead her to becoming a pretty only as a chance to help the problem with a Pretties mind, which is VERY severe. Which leads directly into the second book \\"Pretties\\".
B00005QAPH|2.0|Overrated nonsense.  I love arty films, and there are plenty to choose from, but this one is nothing.  A director doesn't know what to do with his movie.  Alright already.  He's boring the hell out of me.  For a masterpiece of film, this emperor is in his underwear.  This hodgepodge of nonsense just gets on my nerves and wears out my patience.  It shouldn't have been over two hours.  It should have been 15 minutes.<br /><br />It took three sittings before I could get through it.  By the end, as the DVD clock said it was 2:12 into it, I felt betrayed because it was only supposed to be 2:10.  It lasted another few stupid minutes.  The best moment in the film is when I knew it was finally over.  God be praised.  This idiocy is over.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Images and Words, Dream Theater's second album and their breakthrough recording (including the megahit \\"Pull me Under\\")was one of the top 5 progressive rock albums of all time.  There was no difficulty deciding whether DT was a metal band or a progressive rock band.  It was definitely prog.  However, as they have attempted fruitlessly to recreate the AOR success of Pull me Under, they have become more and more watered down. <br /> <br />I'm sorry, DT is not Metallica.  They aren't even the prog metal of Shadow Gallery.  All you need to confirm this is to listen to LaBrie's voice, which is a great instrument-but he just can't get a growling or gruff tone and its embarassing to hear him try.  They need to quit the attempt to seek a wider niche and just satisfy their core prog-rock fans. <br /> <br />Most of this album is throwaway. However, Sacrificed Sons and Octovarium are wonderful.  It's not just that they are more progressive than the other songs.  It's that DT is clearly more excited and interested in performing this type of music.  That's why the other songs sound flat. <br /> <br />I still don't know what's going on with Petrucci.  Anyone that heard his live album with Jordan Rudess or either of the Liquid Tension Experiment albums knows that John can weave dazzling shredding pyrotechnics with melody at the highest level.  However, the solos on this album are almost as bad as those on Train of Thought, basically motifs repeated endlessly at a speed not many other guitars can reach.  Maybe shred really is dead. <br /> <br />DT needs to focus on their core sound.  Challenge themselves and their listeners.  It will work out much better in the end.
B000000W5N|5.0|Sticky Fingers(1971). The Rolling Stones' Eleventh Studio Album.<br /><br />In 1971, The Rolling Stones were fresh off the sucess of Let It Bleed, but were slowly succumbing to various drug addictions and relationship problems. Sticky Fingers turns out to be one of The Stones' most personal and darkest releases, yet it still rocks as hard as anything before it. Although guitarist Mick Taylor was used sparingly on Let It Bleed, on Sticky Fingers he took a lead role in the production of the album. Pieced together from many hard-labored outtakes and full-length tracks, Sticky Fingers took an unusually long time to record, but upon its release it was a worldwide smash hit. Although \\"Brown Sugar\\" and \\"Wild Horses\\" were the only hits off Sticky Fingers, it is widely regarded as The Rolling Stones' greatest achievement, an album where every song is just as important as its singles. What did I think of Sticky Fingers? Read on to find out.<br /><br />Track Ratings-<br /><br />BROWN SUGAR - The Rolling Stones classic opener \\"Brown Sugar\\" deals explicitly with interracial sex, losing your virginity, and even drug use. Did that stop it from becoming a huge hit? No way. \\"Brown Sugar\\" happens to be The Rolling Stones' finest hit, sporting a truly classic Keith Richards' riff and Mick Jaggers' vocals at their most cocky and energetic. Perfect way to start an album!<br /><br />SWAY - The Rolling Stones finest moment, \\"Sway\\" is a heavy, emotional rocker that never fails to impress. A fine work of emotional guitar and vocal harmonies, \\"Sway\\" builds up to a frantic guitar solo, which perfectly caps off The Rolling Stones greatest achievement. Imagine The Rolling Stones with Joe Perry, and you have an idea of what it might sound like. Perfect.<br /><br />WILD HORSES - The Rolling Stones first serious country song, \\"Wild Horses\\" stands as a heart-tugging emotional masterpiece. Mick Jagger's heartbroken vocals blend seamlessly with a tearful acoustic guitar melody to create an emotional tour-de-force. A truly beautiful and amazing track.<br /><br />CAN'T YOU HEAR ME KNOCKING - The Rolling Stones keep the great tracks coming, and next is \\"Can't You Hear Me Knocking\\". A hard rocking, in-your-face song blasts out of your stereo, with Jagger's seething vocals and Richard's punchy electric riff, before the track transforms into a funky jam session. Can you believe it? Another perfect track.<br /><br />YOU GOTTA MOVE - Sticky Fingers' weakest track, \\"You Gotta Move\\" is a amusing and brief country tune. Much like most of The Rolling Stones country material, \\"You Gotta Move\\" finds Jagger and Richards overexaggerating country cliches with funny results. Doesn't really take away from the album - I enjoyed it!<br /><br />BITCH - The Rolling Stones mean-spirited rocker \\"Bitch\\" is another fabulous effort, mixing in Mick Jagger's seething and pouting singing with a brazen mix of hard rock guitar and trumpets. A fun rocker that doesn't fail to please.<br /><br />I GOT THE BLUES - The Rolling Stones song that inspired Bon Jovi to be a musician, \\"I Got The Blues\\" is The Rolling Stones' finest take on pure blues. Jaggers' brooding blues vocals bond with Keith Richards and Mick Taylor's searing blues guitar work to create a masterful blues-rock track.<br /><br />SISTER MORPHINE - The Rolling Stones' most personal and revealing track, \\"Sister Morphine\\" was written by Marianne Faithfull, Mick Jagger's girlfriend. A truthful and depressing ballad about the dangers of drug abuse, \\"Sister Morphine\\" turns out to be The Rolling Stones most revealing moment of their career. Truly beautiful in an offhand way.<br /><br />DEAD FLOWERS - The Rolling Stones' brighten up for \\"Dead Flowers\\", and although the lyrics are still depressing and desolate, The Stones play a serious, yet funky little rocker. The Rolling Stones are excellent at dark rockers, and this is no exception. It reminds me a little of \\"Stupid Girl\\".<br /><br />MOONLIGHT MILE - A dark stirring ballad to close the album, \\"Moonlight Mile\\" finds Mick Jagger soulfully letting his sorrows out behind a string arrangement and a crying acoustic guitar. Sticky Fingers couldn't have ended any better.<br /><br />Sticky Fingers, without a doubt, is a classic rock masterpiece. While I've always liked The Rolling Stones, Sticky Fingers introduced me to a new side of them, a darker side that faces up more to the realities of life than the happy-go-lucky rock of \\"Satisfaction\\" or \\"It's Only Rock And Roll.\\" Sticky Fingers truly is a perfect album, where each song blends into the next, and there is never a dull moment, something many Rolling Stones albums suffer from. While the Rolling Stones had many other good albums (Aftermath, Beggar's Banquet), they could never quite equal Sticky Fingers, and they probably never will.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR FANS OF CLASSIC ROCK AND THE ROLLING STONES!

0380018179|5.0|This book is a raw, compelling and oftentimes tragic portrayl of generations of flawed people. I read from another review that the desciptions of Australia dragged on..but they were some of my favorite parts! Colleen McCullough paints a beautiful picture in the reader's mind. I really love this book, but there are some rough patches. The characters seem real in all of weaknesses and, because the books spans such a long period of time, you can see their mistakes resonate within future generations and in the end comes redemption. You feel like you are there! I just can't praise this literary marvel enough!
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Demigod is beautiful, crushing death metal. The drumming is some of the best I've ever heard. Fast and incredible. I was put off by the vocals at first, but then I fell in love with them almost immediately after that. Listen to the samples to make sure you'll like the vocals. The riffs are cool, catchy.  <br /> <br />The only problem I have with this CD is the ridiculous lyrics. And the insistence to say \\"ov\\" instead of \\"of\\". That reminds me of all the crap Otep was doing with spelling just to look artsy. It's stupid. The lyrics are pretty much all about calling out to different gods. Or they're about how there are no gods, humans are gods. So I don't know what's up with that slight contradiction. Incantations to gods, then no, there aren't any gods, we are gods. The only thing I can figure is that maybe the vocalist uses incantations instead of the telephone. Har har har. <br /> <br />Anyway, it's not like you can really understand the lyrics. The vocals are still incredible. The music is beautiful. The lyrics don't even matter through all that.
B00005JO1G|5.0|This motto of is uttered three time in the duration of Sam Mendes' brilliant war drama/comedy \\"Jarhead.\\" <br /> <br />When it comes to the war, we sometimes forget one of its major victims and how the are scared from its wrath-the soldiers. In Mendes film, he studies the impact of war on an American squadron of marines and there experiences in the Gulf War. <br /> <br />Anthony \\"Swoff\\" Swofford (Jake Gyllenhhal) is a recent enlistee who is \\"hooked\\" to the marine way of life. He is soon in Staff Sgt. Sykes' (Jaime Foxx) squad, and is given the position of sniper. His spotter, Troy, played by Peter Sarsgaard, becomes his close buddy while training to make the final cut in Sykes' group. <br /> <br />The men are soon shipped out to the desert in preparation for the forthcoming Gulf War. There in an unfamiliar place, with enemies they can't see, for a reason unknown to them.  <br /> <br />Mendes and his actors keep us absorbed in the lives of these characters and what they go through physically and mentally. Gyllenhhal proves he's truly capable of a strong leading performance. Foxx is terrific as the hard-ass Sykes. Sarsgaard is a powerful presence as always. Chris Cooper makes two nice appearances as Lt. Col. Kazinski. The supporting soldiers are all wonderful and effective. <br /> <br />The film is beautifully shot, making the audiences feel hot and sticky, like the soldiers, just by watching those coarse, dry shots of the miles and miles of sand in the horizon.  <br /> <br />The film is funny in its first half, and hard hitting in its second. The comedy is to make the film go down easy with us, until we feel comfortable and connected with the characters and their lives. And that makes the second half heart tugging because we see the transformation and what war does to the lives of these young men. We are with them. We feel their pain. We see through their eyes the true tragedy of war on the human psyche. <br /> <br />That motto up top is one I would never use to describe this film. What I can say is this-Welcome to Oscar season at the movies! <br />
B0000931QA|5.0|I was first introduced to Operation : Mindcrime following its release.  My friend let me borrow his copy, and advised me to \\"listen to it with the lights off, it will scare the hell out of you\\".  So I did.<br /><br />To this day, whenever I recommend this album to someone, that is the same advice that I give to them, as his suggestion holds true.  This is an album that is far more than just background noise; it needs to be listened to in order to be not just appreciated, but truly absorbed.<br /><br />In this reviewer's opinion, this is the best concept album ever recorded.  Ever.  In a word, it's a masterpiece.  The album's dark themes, piercing musicianship, and brilliant lyrical work make this album stand out in a way that no other album from the time it was released does.<br /><br />The story revolves around Nikki, a young man who was born to lose, being recruited by the evil Dr. X to execute a series of religious and political assassinations.  Nikki falls in love with a young nun named Mary, who hails from a similar background.  The story unfold from there, song for song.  The story is interesting, complex, and full of enough intrigue (not to mention the music is fantastic) to keep the listener hanging on every lyric until the final note fades.<br /><br />I would go as far as to label the latter half of the album (from \\"Electric Requiem\\" to \\"Eyes of a Stranger\\") as nothing less than a tour de force.  Presented with a relentless machine-gun pace, its fluidity keeps the story flowing perfectly.  It's song-to-song succession is not unlike the latter half of the Beatles' Abbey Road, in regards to its flow.  Yes, really.  It's that good.<br /><br />In the 80s, Queensryche had the misfortune (or good fortune, depending on who you ask) of being lumped into categories with hair metal acts that were popular at the time this record was released, and this album may never receive the appreciation that it truly deserves because of that.  If so, that is truly a shame, because this is an album that belongs in every music lover's collection.  I wish I could give it more than five stars.  This album is as close to perfect as it gets.lbum that belongs in every music lover's collection.   I wish I could give it more than five stars.   This album is as close to perfect as it gets.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Alright, i live in Hong Kong and this movie was never put on the widescreen here. I bought this DVD just out of its cast. From reading the description at the sleeve of the DVD, i do not expect to get much out of it, assuming just another killer-among-the-group-in-a-contained-place sort of movie. But as it turns out, it makes my jaw drops. <br /> <br />Going through the review before writing this one down, i do not understand why some of the folks are so mean and critical about the film. If you have a habbit of reading review before making your purchase, you probably won't find one film without a 1-star rating, whether deemed helpful or not.  <br /> <br />The point is, if you really have to be so picky, you can always find things to critize. But just do not forget one thing, what you are watching is just a story, and there is one thing in film called the \\"suspension of disbelief\\". Not even in reality that you can find all things explainable or logical or even sensible!!! And please do not compare this film with Hitchcock's, for his reputation in psychological thriller has already convinced some part of you to believe his film is great even before the title sequence ends.  <br /> <br />Back to the film itself, i am not going to prasie once again for what others did. What i wanted to add is that when the final mystery unfolds, it reallys makes my jaw drops. Surpirse at the same time but also an anti-climax. Beacuse what seems to be the reality is now just a twisted imagination of a convicted murderer, so why cares more what happens in the motel afterthat anyway? With all the suspense gone, i am just waiting to see how the film is going to wrap up without further expectation.  <br /> <br />However, i do want to give a merit to the director for his attention to details of the plot. Seldom you will see this kind of film without any contraction in its plot (at least i have found none) Throughout the film, you will see very very subtle evidence hinting towards a more supernatural ending rather than just some fxxp-up psycho who happens to kill people for fun. One point to note is with all these killing, there is hardly any gore at all, so the horror is convinced to you psychologically rather than through some cheap visual violence.
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|All hail the Crane Kick, liberator of useless wimps over bullies, redeemer of lost causes, winner of Elisabeth Shue's heart.  <br />  <br />The arms-raised-left-knee-arched-jump-kick-flashbulb-combo at the climax of 'The Karate Kid' is one of cinema's sterling images, along with Arnie killing the Predator at the end of Predator, when optimus Prime dies and 1 hour, 12 mins, 37 secs into the Crying Game. <br />  <br />Strike the pose anywhere in the film-watching world and you'll get a laugh or nod of affirmation, the auto-acknowledgment triggered by a giddy memory of the underdog movie that has the tendency to be trivialised and dismissed. Never mind the film earned more than $90 million at the box office and was followed by three (shoddy) sequels, a video game and a Saturday-morning cartoon.  <br />  <br />Maybe the uneasiness in fully embracing 'The Karate Kid' comes from the fact that it emerged in 1980s' synth-rock cheesiness, and its broad, bold outlines overshadow its quiet tenderness. Its over-the-top fight scenes and blatant emotional manipulation have a way of tricking your brain into thinking it was a trifle you enjoyed at the time but has no persevering significance. Pop it into the DVD player and the film will prove otherwise.  <br />  <br />'The Karate Kid' channels an ancient power, its called nostalgia, with the resonance of a folk tale and the beauty of a daydream. It's inspirational without being condescending. Truthful but not heavy handed.  <br />  <br />The story is of Daniel (Ralph Macchio), a weakling boy who is forced to move across the country with his mother, only to be bullied by a gang of karate thugs (Heil Sensie Kreese!). At rock bottom, Daniel finds himself and escapes a personal hell through the help of a supportive girlfriend, Ali (Elisabeth Shue) and a wise mentor, Miyagi (Noriyuki \\"Pat\\" Morita). Daniel, referred to as \\"Daniel-san\\" by Miyagi, trains for a karate tournament in which he will face his cruel tormenter, Johnny (William Zabka), who also happens to be Ali's controlling ex.  <br />  <br />For such a predictable story, 'The Karate Kid' yields surprises on repeat viewings. It raises the eyebrows to re-experience Miyagi's distant, rough-English wisdom, which rings true with a red-letter import. It gladdens the heart to treasure the film's unorthodox tendency to dally in small, quiet texture. And most invigorating is the acting, which is uniformly superb. Director John G. Avildsen (\\"Rocky\\") has a way of extracting naturalistic performances, fleshed out with tiny, significant details.  <br />  <br />The sagely Morita is the standout, in the role that would define him, and the first American-born Asian to be nominated for a best-supporting actor Oscar.  <br />  <br />Macchio, 22 at the time, is 'convincing' as a spindly 16-year-old, not only for his boyish looks, but also his studied demeanor, teeming with adolescent testoteroned uncertainty.  <br />  <br />Both actors completely sold themselves into roles, at the price of being forever typecast, with the reward of crafting everlasting characters that become ingrained into society. If there's any doubt about what the parts continue to mean to Morita and Macchio, take a stroll to 8225 W. Sunset Blvd. in West Hollywood, Calif., where you'll find the restaurant Morita started, called Miyagi's. And look up Macchio's biography, where you'll see his son is named Daniel.  <br />  <br />The father-son rapport between the Miyagi and Daniel is palpable, as Miyagi, the Okinawan handyman (or ex-Japanese POW)in Daniel's apartment complex, takes him under his wing. Johnny, jealous of Ali's romantic interest, bitch slaps Daniel daily. The boys' first fight, at a beach in front of Daniel's new friends, ends so badly that Daniel is mockingly named \\"The Karate Kid.\\"  <br />  <br />Miyagi rescues Daniel from a Halloween-night beating by Johnny's skeleton-suited Cobra Kais, and makes a deal with the bullies' brutish Sensei that the boys are not allowed to fightDaniel until he's finished training. Then commences Daniel's learning, which begins with the iconic 'wax on, wax HOFF' demands.  <br />  <br />Daniel bristles at what appears to be busywork, as he waxes Miyagi's cars and paints his fences. Just as the boy is about to quit in frustration, Miyagi shows Daniel that the chores have been teaching him motor skills useful for karate blocks. Daniel wants to learn to punch, but that must come later.  <br />  <br />First learn stand, then learn fly. Nature rule, Daniel-san, not mine.  <br />  <br />Miyagi's lessons of balance, study and nonviolence are a harsh contrast to those of the Cobra Kai, in which students chant, \\"Strike first, strike hard, no mercy!\\" 'Heil Sensie Kreese!'  <br />  <br />Daniel eventually finds that he must learn to fight so he doesn't have to fight. And that self-discipline and dedication are musts.  <br />  <br />Daniel-san, must talk. Man walk on road. Walk left side, safe. Walk right side, safe. Walk down middle, sooner or later, get knocked down. Same here. You karate do yes or karate do no. You karate do guess so.  <br />  <br />There's no doubt that this is a melodrama. There's a villain, a damsel and a hero, although often in this movie the hero is more of a damsel and the damsel more of a hero. By movie's end we're assured that Daniel-san's combat skills are superior to those of Johnny, but not at all that he could take firebrand Ali, who unlike her scrawny new boyfriend, never runs from the big bully, and even pops Johnny with a loud slap.  <br />  <br />Looming is the crowd-pleasing showdown with Johnny. The story redeems its obviousness with the glowing message that it's insignificant whether Daniel wins the tournament. What matters is he's found the courage to enter the fray, and the drive to work hard and long enough to deserve to win. Daniel has learned to stand. The Crane Kick is just a bonus.

B00008OLIC|4.0|Dr. Feelgood was a new era for our heroes.  At the time he was doing Dr. Feelgood Nikki Sixx has sober up and, once and still a living illustration of rock n'roll lifestyle, was affraid than the fact to being clean and sober will make him uncool for the fans.  Fortunately he was wrong!  Dr. Feelgood was their greatest selling album ever.  A huge mainstream success, Motley Crue was everywhere!  It was so good!<br /><br />These rock and roll icons allegedly sober up became role models to look up to.  For me it was that!  Dr. Feelgood is a sight of the time.  It showed me than you don't need to be drugged-up and alcoholic to be cool.<br /><br />Motley Crue are cool and will forever be cool.  Sober or not!  That's the bottom line!
B000001G5H|5.0|In reading these various reviews, let's say that everyone has their own opinion.  However, wheter one sees Pollini's Chopin as cold and indifferent (someone calls him a \\"calculator\\") or as one of the greats of this generation, I simply invite you to listen.  I will give you a specific, towards the end of the powerful Etude nos 12 op.10, starting at the 2'12\\" mark, listen to the way Pollini handles the left hand arpeggios, the accompaniment.  With anyone else, this is just that, but with Pollini, this becomes- for me- a meditative, masterpiece of stillness, juxtaposed with the thunder that flashes at at 2'30\\".  No one else plays it like this.      Another aspect of Pollini's unique style of interpretation can be heard in the nos7 op.25, the greatest of the Etudes.  This is usually played as an overtly Romantic, love-sick tune, done to the point of smaltz.  Pollini plays the notes as Chopin writes them.  No more, no less.      Is Romantic music such as Chopin's to be interpreted from performer to performer, from generation to generation as the reviewer below says?  I think not.  If Chopin wanted something to be played with extra sadness or expression, he would have indicated so.  George Sand documentated famously how Frederick would tear his hair out getting a single bar of music just right, taking days behind a closed door.  A single bar!!  The great composers were aboslutely meticulous in their dynamic markings, they knew what they were doing... let's hear the music as they meant them to be heard.    This is one of the greatest Chopin recordings in the repertoire.
B000002MIY|5.0|I just started listening to this album again after a few years break. It's really held its own and it's maybe even better than I thought back in the early nineties. <br />   I remember so many critics slamming it then, and now my reaction is simply this; it's so, so, much better than anything else that's come along in the last 10 years and far superior to anything currently being made. <br />   Fagen's arrangements, depth of sound, and his ability to swing cannot be dismissed as sterile,  or devoid of feeling or whatever. This, and all his records, are just examples of great muscianship, and a passion for the music. <br />    I think many just happen to micro analyze Steely Dan and Donald Fagen because they've set the bar so high, it's easy to overlook just how far ahead of everyone they really are. <br />Fagen is an important part of one of the most influential pop songwriting duo's of the last 40 years. Certainly in the same company as Lennon and McCartney and equally as gifted. <br />    Buy this and all Steely Albums and enjoy.
B0000009TJ|5.0|I agree with some reviewers that Frank is \\"over the top\\" in some of his more commercial music - and I do not mean that as a compliment .... I'll go a step further:  Frank is making fun of his audience a great many times, and they seem to relish being the butt of his jokes. <br /> <br />   That said ... the first disk, from track 7 to the end is about as good a musical ride as you'll ever take.  Move over Beethoven.  The first six songs are for band warm up, and most of the second the disk is fodder for Frank to smirk in his dreams at his goofy followers, but the seven in the middle -- flat out fun, creative, beautiful, inspiring music.  Buy this only for this second half of the first set - but cherish the pearl in the swine.
0385335482|1.0|This book was frustrating to read at times because the main character is unbelievably stupid and not realistic. <br />from a literary view, this book wasn't that great; and forgettable.
0679416781|4.0|Michael Ondaatje's The English Patient is worth your time because it's beautiful. Ondaatje's writes like a Renaissance painter - eclectic voices like Herodotus, Kipling, even the Book of David in the Old Testament are artfully woven with entirely fictional narrators into this story of what comes after war within and without a human being. Four main characters cross paths after the end of World War II in an Italian Villa, their bodies and souls twisted and maimed from their experiences with violence, their stories brought to life by Ondaatje's quasi-mystical language. \\"They were,\\" as one of the characters states, \\"what had been left behind.\\" This eddy also collects David Caravaggio, the thumb less ex-thief, Kirphal Singh, a coldly analytical sapper, and the English Patient. The body of this last perhaps represents the souls of the others - charred and fragile, \\"like a burned animal\\", from conflagrations of a world beyond control. His constant companion, Herodotus' Histories, is a reliquary for scraps of memories, stories, poems, and Biblical scripture, pasted onto the book's pages so that the Histories in the end belongs more to English Patient than to Herodotus. The writing throughout The English Patient is intriguing and sometimes overpowering, like a strong perfume: traces of its tone curl into the corners of your mind and linger long after you've finished reading.  <br /> <br />
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien Rice's debut cd is incredible. It has so much of what I love in other albumns and yet is still very unique. His songwritting and storytelling are supurb. His songs transpose emotion into a sonic experience that pulls you in. You find yourself both sympathizing and empathizing with the feelings and experiences of Rice and the personas he creates. It is definitely not a \\"feel good\\" albumn, but the feeling are as honest as they are srtong. <br /> <br /> The songs are built with Rice's voice and acoustic guitar as the centerpiece, but there is also cello, clarinet, bass, drums, percussion, and beautiful harmonies. The arrangments have elements, of jazz, classical, folk, and rock, but trully defy a simple catagorization. I suggest you just light some candles, pour a glass of red wine and find out for yourself.
B0007GADZO|5.0|It took me a long time to realise the scope of this work. As several other reviewers have commented, this is very demanding music. But the effort of listening rewards. This is a real great rock album.  It's been a long journey for Steve Vai, starting out as a guitar wizard, and now composing and recording music beyond comprehension.  The centerpiece of this album is \\"Dying For Your Love\\" (Track 2). This piece is amazing. The bass booms hauntingly. The rhythm guitar does a clip-clip, which together with the bolero-like drums drives the piece. The lead guitar does stuff that sounds Turkish (or Lydian, as another reviewer has commented), but is unlike anything else that I've heard. Steve sings out his soul on this one. He makes interval leaps that are unusual and very expressive. In the refrain, an angelic choir emerges, rising to the heavens, in stark opposition to the bass and vocals. Excruciating - and beautiful.  Other pieces that I particulary enjoy are:   Freak Show Excess - Vai got the title from a derogatory review. Well, he turned it round and used it as an inspiration to make a fabulous piece. If that's what it means to be a freak, then I'll gladly join the show.   Building The Church is a spiritual powerhouse and a great warmup to Dying For Your Love.   When I hear Under It All, the word that comes to my mind is \\"montage\\". There are so many voices coming in and out. But he manages to keep the whole thing together. Quite an experience.   He plays beautifully on the 7th song Lotus Feet.  For Glorious he has invented a new instrument: electric cat.   Nobody has extended the range of musical expression within rock as has Steve Vai. You go through all the human emotions in turn: laughter, sorrow, amazement, awe, and simply grooving.   Two other great musicians have helped him put this masterpiece together. Billy Sheehan is Vai's true match on bass. Jeremy Colson does amazing stuff on his drums. The rhythm section is precise and punchy.   Giving this album five stars is an understatement.
B000002UAR|5.0|While I believe this record is not as revolutionary or as sophisticated as Abbey Road or Sgt Peppers it is the one I admit I have listened to more than the others in the last 10 years. <br />While Rubber Soul was the begining of what was to come this is the album enhances it a bit further. The transformation of the Beatles is much more present here and late Beatles are much more in the making. It is not as diverse as the White Album but the music does change in a few places really big. Some of the songs sound like early and late Beatles combined. I admit there are simularities to this and Rubber Soul but this album has many differences that are nowhere comparable.   <br />I like the style used in this album and it is one of the most listenable over and over and never gets old Beatle albums.  <br />Nothing else like this album in 1966 and about every band would copy after as well as Sgt. Peppers right after.
B000AARKOO|2.0|This  movie  is  ready  for  Pesntch. He'll love it  because  it  has  no plot,  poor  character  development and a frustrating story line- what the heck is going on??? Sure I understand the Crusades and  this would make an interesting backdrop for a movie. But Ridley Scott has given us a convoluted heap of bologna. Maybe Roger Ebert can eat the bologna since he reccomended this chit. Pesntch will probably love this since his taste is for bologna. SIN FIN
B000002UAX|5.0|There is no rock album like it! There is no Beatles album like it! And even the songs on the album don't sound anything like each other. This is the most obscure, original, and intellegent Beatle albums ever recorded. The album changes all through the album from one type of musical format to another and never goes back. You would think the only setback of this album would be the short departure of Ringo and many solo efforts on the album where other Beatles were not included. But yet all the songs are great. Paul McCartney is playing on Blackbird all by himself and made the airplane noises with his mouth in the mirophone to make the airplane noises on the first track. And Ringo really did have blisters on his fingers while playing the drums. John Lennon was at his most very experimental on this album. And George Harrisons guitar playing gently weeps and really rocks when he teams up with Clapton. The songs on this album create the ultimate recipe when thrown together! <br />If anyone else tried to make an album like this........ Well it hasn't happend yet! <br />One of the best albums ever and the Beatles were not even entirely focused when they recorded it. But yet it dwarfs almost every other album when you compare them to this one!
B000002Q7Y|4.0|After the decidedly un-Kansas \\"Drastic Measures\\", Kansas called it a day. <br /> <br />For a while, Steve Walsh played side-stage keyboards for Cheap Trick after the split-up of his under-rated band, Streets, who were more straight-ahead rock than Kansas. <br /> <br />When this album came out, I was sceptical since I didn't care much for the final Kansas 1982-83 output. <br /> <br />However, after hearing the album, I was very pleasantly surprised. The songs are written well, former Streets bassist Billy Greer (a Walsh sidekick to this day) slotted nicely into Dave Hope's bass position, and Richard Williams and Phil Ehart were back. A real treat was former Dixie Dregs and current Deep Purple virtuoso Steve Morse on guitar. <br /> <br />There were excellent songs like \\"Silhouettes In Disguise\\", \\"Dust In The Wind\\" soundalike \\"Taking In The View\\" and \\"Tomb 19\\". These were more akin to Streets than classic Kansas, however. On the negative side, \\"All I Wanted\\" and \\"Can't Cry Anymore\\" sounded too slickly tailor-made for mid-80's US radio play. Deduct half a star. <br /> <br />Mostly good to this point. But there was something missing... <br /> <br />NO VIOLIN. Robby Steinhardt was glaringly absent for both \\"Power\\" and \\"In The Spirit Of Things\\", though David Ragsdale came aboard for live dates and later recording and did an admirable job before Steinhardt rejoined in the late '90s. For a band whose distinctive sound depended so much on the violin/keyboard/guitar interplay, the lack of violin left a definite void. Deduct another half-star. <br /> <br />Don't let that stop you from buying this, though. As I've said, the songs are mostly very good, and without the tension between Walsh and Kerry Livgren, the sound is quite cohesive. <br /> <br />I've seen the band live three times since this reformation, and they've never disappointed. These songs sound even better live than in the studio, as later live discs will attest.
B00000K3D4|4.0|When you watch the extras on the DVD and understand what it took to create the puppets and perilous labyrinth, you may gain a new respect for this classic puppet fantasy. This movie alternates between childlike scenes with puppets and very grown-up Cinderella fantasy sequences that will unearth your long-forgotten wishes to be a princess.<br /><br />Sarah is leaving the world of toys to become a woman. She retains the belief that no one can have power over her mind and she plays out her fantasy by at first being a spoiled brat and then realizing her responsibilities.<br /><br />When she wishes for her brother to disappear, her wish is granted. She must then navigate through an \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" style Labyrinth paradise filled with fantastical creatures and helpful puppets. There are scenes where we believe Sarah has met with certain doom, however the puppets lead her back to safety.<br /><br />David Bowie is featured as the Goblin King and his playful taunting enhances the lighthearted aspect of his relationship with Sarah. When they are dancing in the \\"bubble fantasy\\" she still seems too young to be his love interest, but there is a definite chemistry to the connection. It seems to be a story of a woman emerging and yet still holding onto her love of fantasy and magic.<br /><br />Throughout the movie we find David Bowie singing and the scenes of the staircases are quite fascinating because you never know where he will appear from next. There is a true sense of danger as Sarah tries to save her brother.<br /><br />Enjoyable if you can become a child again while viewing this movie. The English humor is quite funny in places and I especially loved the knight on his horse who protected the bridge.<br /><br />If you have any interest in puppets, David Bowie's music or fantasy castles, then this may amuse you. The costumes are beyond amazing and yes: \\"I want that dress.\\" ~&lt;:) Princess dreams.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Star Wars or Lord of the Rings, this is a much more playful movie. If you have read Alice in Wonderland, many of the nonsensical scenes will make complete sense.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Reviewrland, many of the nonsensical scenes will make complete sense.     ~The Rebecca Review
B000002H6C|5.0|When I first got into Metallica I started with Ride The Lightning. The album was amazing and full of twists and turns, but also some emotion. Not quite their musical masterpiece, but a d*** good CD. I next bought Master of Puppets (this one was the masterpiece)and Kill 'em All. I pretty much steered clear of this CD because I knew Cliff wasn't on it and I knew that they used this album to haze Jason Newstead (personally I think thats, funny, but you really have to turn the bass up to hear him at all pretty much). The reviews all said it was a great album, but I couldn't stomach the new bass player. I finally bought it and I am sorry I took so long to come around to it. The sounds are blended and there is even a tribute to Cliff on the album (you can actually hear Jason on that song). The CD flows well and is full of different sounds and also has several things on the tracks that kind of stick it to the man. The things that annoy me about it are just the bass thing and that is easy to get over. The best tracks on that album are ...And Justice for All, The Frayed Ends of Sanity, and To Live Is To Die. Give this album a chance and I promise you won't be dissapointed.
B000BEZQ18|5.0|A fine collection of C&W songs performed by some great artists, with some evocative instrumental interludes from the film.  The highlights are the moving A Love That Will Never Grow Old (next year's Oscar-winning song?) and I Don't Want to Say Goodbye, songs written by Gustavo Santaolalla and Bernie Taupin and performed by, respectively, the reknowned Emmylou Harris and Teddy Thompson, a talented young artist (check out his excellent self-entitled debut on Virgin Records).  These songs do a great job of conveying the love of the two main characters in the film, but can be enjoyed by anyone.  They are wonderful country ballads.  Santaolalla's other songs are excellent too. No One's Going to Love You Like Me is a nice twangy Patsy Cline-y piece, while I Will Never Let You Go is a strong, more fast-tempo song.  These songs are performed by more talented up-and-comers, Mary McBride and Jackie Greene.  Rufus Wainwright's own The Maker Makes is tremendously desolate and moving.  Wainwright and Thompson also team for an immensely enjoyable cover of King of the Road, their voices alternately blending and contrasting quite pleasingly.  I think the Willie Nelson cover of \\"He Was a Friend of Mine\\" is fine.  It is more uptempo, but Willie's vocal treatment is very touching.  There's a nice, frantic fiddle piece too, \\"An Angel Went Up in Flames.\\"
B000058T5E|5.0|You have got to love Dirty Mind and Loose Cannon; totally wild. It's amazing how a well established artist can put together a new sound and just rock into the future.........it does sound like Beck has been spending some time under the hood of his car.
B000B5XZLU|5.0|Jamiroquai has done it again with their sixth full release of \\"acid jazz\\"/club grooves! \\"Dynamite\\" is a return to form after a disappointing \\"Funk Odyssey\\"--at least to me anyway-- although, its record sells will tell otherwise! But then, this group never really puts out a bad CD. That being said, Jamiroquai front man Jay Kay still belts out tell-it-like-it-is lyrics with that rich Stevie Wonderness that I dig so much ('cept I like Jay Kay's style 100xs better than Stevie's!). The boys in the band bring 70s influenced beats and edgey dance floor grooves as usual with live instruments and tight productions. Standout tracks include Talullah, Feels Just Like It Should, Dynamite, Electric Mistress, Don't Give Hate a Chance and Seven Days. Another instanst classic from the boys in the U.K. that's--to steal the hook from that popular '70s sitcom--DY-NO-MITE!!!!!!!!!  <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />  <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|3.0|If this was an EP, it would have been ONE of their best.<br /><br />This CD starts off extremely strong... very reminiscent of early Depeche Mode. A PAIN THAT I'M USED TO with an extended intro could have easily started off `101' to get the crowd really going. JOHN THE REVELATOR is as close to a revival hymn as your going to get and it is the closest song that comes to rivaling anything pre-Violator. Best song on here period. It dips a little on the third track but THE SINNER AND ME followed by PRECIOUS bring the level back up.<br /><br />It starts to go downhill from there. Maybe I shouldn't say downhill because they are ok songs. They just don't measure up to the first 5 tracks. If this were issued as an EP then it would have been brilliant. As it is, it's no better OR worse than their recent releases. I would advise anyone wanting to buy this to just download the first half from iTunes and pretend the other half doesn't exist.<br /><br />3.5 Stars
B00097DXZS|5.0|I made an inquiry to Sony and was directed to their website where I found this: <br /> <br />[...] <br /> <br />They then sent me instructions how to get this CD onto my iPod.  <br /> <br />This album is great - don't let the copy protection issues prevent you from listening on your iPod!! <br /> <br /> <br />
B0007GAEW6|5.0|About a year before this album came out, a friend of mine played me Deloused in the Comatorium.  He is a big ATDI fan, and I've never really been that fond of them (even now I only still mildly like them).  But as soon as Deloused started, I knew that I was being introduced to something special.  I was captivated from beginning to end.  Over the course of the next year, I listened to that album relentlessly.  When I heard that they were set to release a new one, I was very excited.  Another friend of mine downloaded the early leak which was very oddly mixed and fairly low quality.  I listened to it for a while, and I kinda liked it, but at first I definately thought that it was a drop in quality after Deloused.  When the album came out in March, I bought it the first day it came out.  The improved mix and quality certainly helped, but still I was a little weary of it.  Then, all of a sudden, one day it clicked.  I was listening to it and loving the absolute crap out of it.  Now I think that it's even superior to Deloused.  This album certainly took a while to grow on me.  It requires the listener to listen to it from beginning to end without interuption or distraction.  With repeated listening, the songs (which at first seem like a big jumble of riffs) start to reveal their underlying structure and meaning.  Then the album as a whole starts to reveal its underlying struture and meaning.  The flow of the album is nothing short of perfect.  I too was not to fond of the long noisescapes at first, but now I see them as essential parts of the album.  Just as a (good) movie doesn't always have constant action and excitement, a good album needs to just cool down and let the listener relax for a few minutes.  Cassandra Gemini (probably the best song on the album, though I think it kinda sucks that they cut it up into eight parts) is just not the same if you don't hear the segue (or lack thereof) from Miranda into Cassandra.  When that awesome jam from the end of Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus gets reprised and its really quiet and you're lightly grooving on it and then, all of a sudden it jumps (might I say even \\"smashes\\") into Cassandra at an odd beat.  It totally catches the listener off guard.  Even after listening to the album so many times, I still can't pinpoint exactly when it's coming.  It still makes me jump a little.  I love when a piece of music can have such a primal effect on the listener.  This awesome effect is totally lost if you skip directly to Cassandra to avoid the slow and ambient Miranda.  The plot of the album is also incredibly moving.  Anybody interested should try to find a synopsis somewhere on the interent.  Even if it's not exactly what the band meant by it, it's still interesting to read what other people have interpreted about the lyrics.  Also, the albums title track (included only as the B-side to The Widow single) also explains a lot, as well as being an amazing track which anyone who loves this album should definately check out.  All in all, Mars Volta are a group of extremely talented musicians and composers who I feel will be looked upon as some of the greatest and (hopefully) most influential of all current rock acts.  Can't wait for their next one!!!
B00005JNEI|1.0|This is absolutely the worst movie ever made. The acting is terrible. The political arguements are unsophisticated and biased. This film is full of quotes that Bush never said and it is a perfectly good example of all the garbage people hear from the biased liberal media every day. I wish I could give this film 0 stars. <br /> <br />     First of all, Moore begins by ranting about Al Gore losing the election (the same thing he does in \\"Stupid White Men\\"). He blames Bush for September 11, and he thinks we were sent to Iraq for the wrong reason. Don't be fooled by what this overstuffed hot air balloon says. The 9/11 comission report contradicts everything Michael Moore says in this film about September 11. In the issue on Iraq, Moore goes on to claim that Saddam Hussein was a perfectly innocent man, yet he never tells of his record of genocide and torture, even though Moore knows he used chemical weapons (a WEAPON OF MASS DESTRUCTION) to kill 100,000 Kurds. Saddam also launched 50 SCUD missiles against Israel during the Gulf War, which were chemical warheads and he was also believed to be behind the plot to assasinate George H.W Bush in Kuwait in 1993. Remember when Saddam said he apologized for invading Kuwait, and then he started firing SCUD missiles at Kuwait during the recent Iraq war? Get real here! Quit listening to this guy. Moore has defintelely given in to the liberal socialist agenda. He will not admit that socialism is a failure. Moore wants Bush out of office because he wants to make America a socialist country. Take my advice and don't waste your money on this trashy movie. It is a perfectly good waste of DVDs, film, and a brain.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I bought this album the very first day that it came out, with high expectations (although I question the title:). It was not much of a disappointment. True, her voice is a little less than it used to be. However, in respect to others, she is still in the top .5% of vocalists, and has certainly retained more power that some unfortunate divas. <br /> <br />The music itself is very fun. Unlike Charmbracelet, she does not lean on emotion to carry the album, but, instead, goes for the fast-pace love songs. There is still emotion, but there is far less boredom. The worst thing that I can say about the album is that she seems to be trying too hard. It is as if she went into the studio bent of proving that she still had the power, and as I said, for the most part, she does. It's just that she sometimes borderlines of screaming. But nothing that ruins any particular song. <br /> <br />As far as the songs go, I would have to say that the best ones are definitely, to me, Say Something, Get Your Number, Circles, and, the best, a hidden gem, Stay the Night. I think this song is indicative of the album's overall mood - power, emotion, but pulse. Mariah fans will, and are, eating this up, and with the re-release only a week or so away, I think sales will skyrocket again. Not her best album (Daydream, Music Box, Butterfly), but, perhaps, her most enjoyable to date.
B000001E21|5.0|Wow! I am completely blown away by this album. How I ever missed is it till now I'll never know. It is really, really good. It's one of those albums you put in and right away you know you've got a classic. If your a fan of the Pre-Hysteria Def Leppard you will be thanking yourself for picking this up.<br /><br />A half a dozen of the tracks rock as hard as any of the music they have ever released. Don't miss it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I had never seen the show before going to see the movie, and let me tell you, it made absolutely no difference. This is one of the best movies that I have seen in many years. The originality is stunning (western in space!). Also, the characters are so believable, not stiff like in the Star Wars movies (new ones). The battle between Summer (River) and the cannibals is totally brilliant. It is brutal art, a monstrous dance. Bravo to Joss for casting a dancer. However, perhaps most impressive, like on Slayer, is Joss's ability to make the viewer care for these \\"far-out\\" characters. He somehow makes them seem like the people next door. Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful!!! <br /> <br />Go see it now!!
B00097DXZS|5.0|It's a shame that many reviewers here want to compare Carlos' new album to previous efforts. This record is fresh, hip and very pop. The skill which Carlos displayed in the 70s still shines like a beacon more than 30 years later. That's alot more than one can say about his contemporaries. Carlos is making music and that's what counts. This CD has varied styles, each one enjoyable with their own flavor and direction. TImes have changed - so expect a Carlos of today. All that I Am delivers all that Carlos Santana can be! Great disc!
6304765231|5.0|Create a dark, foreboding urban wasteland, shroud it in an ambience of depression and hopelessness and then add a cutting edge rock/goth soundtrack and what do you get? Answer, a cult classic that has captured the angst of a generation and given us the quintessencial anti-hero of the twentieth century. Not bad for a small budget movie with a cast of unknowns.<br /><br />Eric Draven (Brandon Lee) and his fiancee Shelly (Sophia Shinas) are brutally murdered on the night before Halloween, the Devil's Night. However their love for each other proves to be so strong that even death cannot prevent Eric from seeking revenge against the four men responsible for the homicides. With the help of an animal familiar, the crow, he digs his way out of the grave a year later and returns to the scene of the crime. As another Halloween approaches the Devil's Night is about to take on a whole new meaning.<br /><br />'The Crow' is without a doubt the ultimate gothic/romance movie of all-time and quite likely the most revered film adaptation of a comic book hero. This is an amazing work of cinematography coupled with a deeply touching story. Despite the high degree of death and brutality in this film it's first and foremost a love story. Now eleven years since its release we can see in retrospect the profound effect this '94 movie has had in influencing the Goth Movement so prevalent today. A true classic to be enjoyed over and over again!<br /><br />Cast: Brandon Lee (Eric Draven), Sophia Shinas (Shelly),  Rochelle Davis (Sarah), Ernie Hudson (Sergeant Albrecht), Michael Wincott (Top Dollar) and Ling Bai (Myca).
0307276902|3.0|<br />Even though A Million Little Pieces is a colorful, first hand account of an addict undergoing treatment and recovery, to me it still carries the stereotype of addicts: grim, little hope of recovery. For a different, hopeful view of life after addiction, I recommend Sandpaper Sisters, which captures the voices of women \\"on the streets\\", during and after recovery. Sandpaper Sisters is about the success stories of former addicts helped through a residential faith-based treatment program. the first of its kind in the U.S. and the model for others.  <br />  <br />Reading Sandpaper Sisters encouraged me because I had heard, \\"once an addict, always an addict\\".In this book I found addicts who gained hope and confidence, were able to change, and went on to become community builders. Miracles do happen! <br />  <br />
0689853637|5.0|Everytime I see a Sabuda Pop-up book I am constantly amazed at the skill and intricate detail that goes into creating these masterpieces.  A beautiful winter landscape filled with wildlife is the subject of Winter's Tale, a beautiful and serene book.  There's a wonderful snow owl flying off the pages,  bear catching fish with a waterfall in the background, a Family of deer, and my favorite, a house or cabin, neslted in the snow covered woods with a little snowman standing in front of the house.<br /><br />Keep looking close or you will miss something.  The test is light and just a moderate accompaniment to the pop-ups.  The colors are gorgeous!  This is another winner from Sabuda.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I have recently gotten hooked on Firefly thanks to the Sci-Fi channel's recent marathon of the episodes.  I fell in love with the characters and the whole world that Joss Whedon created.  Then I had to see Serenity.  And wow!  For fans of Firefly it was amazing to see those characters we love on the big screen!  For those who haven't been initiated into the Firefly 'verse it is still an awsome example of a sci-fi flick. Plenty of action and fights, strange creatures and intrigue, complex characters, superb acting, gorgeous sets, a little love and a lot of heart, and determination and strength.  This one will keep you at the edge of your seat till the last and then you can't wait to see it over and over.  You can't stop the signal!

B00005JNJV|5.0|Having no idea what to expect from \\"Batman Begins\\", it was with some skepticism that I saw this film. If any other prequels were anything to go on, the expectation was not too high. \\"Batman Begins\\" removed all doubts and proved to be an excellent movie.<br /><br />The plot basically delves in detail into the formative life of Bruce Wayne and his development of the alter-ego that would be Batman. The movie covers this is a fair amount of detail, giving you insight as to how he met important people such as Gordon, and where he got his fighting abilities, his gadgets and even symbolic animal. As an underlying thread, Wayne's principles are also developed throughout the movie.<br /><br />Unlike one or two other superhero movies, \\"Batman Begins\\" keeps a fair amount of the action and pace present while it deals with the troubling issues that a budding crime-fighter of this kind faces. There is a fair balance between self-reflection and visual action that has been absent in other movies of this kind.<br /><br />Another aspect of the movie that is lacking in the earlier Batman movies is the brooding seriousness of it. Rather than an almost over-the-top, comic book feel, the movie presents a darkly serious characterisation. Even the villains share in this forboding seriousness, and lack some of the light exuberance of Jack Nicholson's Joker, or Tommy Lee Jones' Two Face. While neither good or bad, this does mark \\"Batman Begins\\" as different in an important way. For me, this was an excellent difference.<br /><br />All in all, I enjoyed this movie much more than the earlier movies from the Batman franchise. It looks very different from the other movies, for obvious reasons, and I feel that it adds a deeper element to the Batman saga on film. This is a great film, and really has a lot going for it.
B00000613T|4.0|Boulez's basic instinct with Mahler is to be accurate and restrained. One can't say he goes by the letter of the score, for Mahler frequently asks the music to be wild, anguished, impassioned, and desolate. This Mahler Ninth is never those things. The CSO is a brash Mahler orchestra, especially under Solti in their Seventies recordings, but Boulez the anti-Solti  has tamed them. The fortissimos here, though powerful, remain controlled, and almost the second they are over, Boulez pulls back on the tempo.<br /><br />His refusal to let the music off its leash drives some listeners crazy--I find his Sixth and Seventh Sym. much too slack. The Ninth holds up better to a calm hand and a clear eye. By concentrating on orchestral blend and diminishing the Dionysiac frenzy, Boulez comes up with a reading which at the very lest is beautiful (although I did find the louder music a bit shrill as recorded).<br /><br />Overall, Boulez takes 79 min., easily capable of fitting on a single CD. The final Adagio is probably your best touchstone. It flows at a moderate gait compared to Bernstein or Karajan: at 21 min. it falls well outside the usual range of 24-26 min. It is songful where others are sad or even desolate. The time boulez shaves off this movement goes into a slower than usual first movement.<br /><br />I can't carp about this Ninth, and I can't love it, either. On its own terms, Boulez's Mahler shouldn't be condemned as clinical or x-rayed. But you can't help noticing the restraint he shows throughout--luckily, he allows the great climaxes to be volcanic in their civilized way.<br /><br />P.S. 2013 - A recent listen makes me choose \\"soulless\\" as the best description. I would take away a star if I wrote the review today.

B00003CXAE|5.0|John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John star in this campy musical about the romance between the greaser, Danny, and the good girl, Sandy, in a nostalgic 1950s world of malt shops, drive-ins, and drag races.  \\"Grease\\" is the very definition of a good time at the movies: light-weight story buoyed by terrific songs and energetic performances.  It may not hold up to critical analysis as well as many other films, but I can't deny that production numbers such as \\"Summer Nights\\" and \\"Sandy\\" make me unreasonably happy.  What more can I ask from a musical?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|The earth that was is gone, it was used up. You don't dwell because you don't have time. You have to make a living 'cause the alternative is short and mighty unpleasant. Simply, you deal. <br /> <br />Imagine, a place where towns and cities are few and VERY far between.  Then imagine an equally far away government obsessive about order and less interested in helping it's people provide for themselves. Most people earn a hard living from the land, growing the food they need to live. Imagine the journey of seven souls who travel from town to town trying to make a living.  If you can get work, you take it. All of Serenity's crew have a past, but two have a past that rubbed the government the wrong way. <br /> <br />But this ain't no chuck wagon, cause chuck wagons arn't worried about burning up \\"goin atmo\\" (atmospheric entry).  <br /> <br />Based on Joss Whedon's \\"Firefly\\", Serenity takes flight following nine souls who happened to cross each other's path in the 26 Century.  But Serenity is written so that you can just hop into the story without knowing the TV series.  With smart and not so smart dialog, the two-hour movie is a guilt free look into a harsh future where people do what they have to get by.  You may even recycle more after seeing it.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|This movie is put together so beautifully and is realistic. I realize it's still Hollywood, but it really captured the lifestyle of how it would have been. Russell Crowe was amazing in this movie. It's one of those movies where it's nice to have at home, so you don't have to keep re-renting it from the local Bockbuster.
0385513755|5.0|Not a reader of best-sellers, nor a fan of fallacy-maker kind of pseudo-historian writer so \\"en vogue\\" nowadays, I could not put down this book from the first page.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code is a great piece of fun! Ok, not everything the book says is worth to be taken seriously, but that's why fiction is called fiction. The story is smart, the characters are not brilliant creations but work fine, and the descriptions and research work of the author are good enough to make you imagine the places and situation even if you know well the actual places described in the novel.<br /><br />Forget the discussions and ENJOY the original. Let yourself to be trapped into the story, look later for material about the places of the book if you want so, get SERIOUS (not \\"the da vinci code blah blah storys) material and read it. But do not forget that, above all, this book is one of the smartest mass-market novels of the last years. Something well worth to look at just for the joy of reading.<br /><br />If you can, I recommend buyng this illustrated edition. Hard-Cover, not expensive, very informative. A good value for money in a nice book for any home library. And a good first step and reference for your own research on the subject, if you want.
0307276902|5.0|The first thing that will jump out at you about this really, really, really riveting memoir/horror tale is the crisp, cool style of James Frey. The style fits perfectly with the themes of abuse and rehab.  Harrowing for those of us who've never been through it, and probably even more so for those poor souls who've gotten over their addictions, this will keep you glued to the page.  No, it's not a short book, but it is worthwhile.  You must also check out A. Burrough's book RUNNING WITH SCISSORS which is not QUITE as bizarre, but deals with dysfunction and its environs.
B00008PX8P|5.0|In the 1970's, Zeppelin listeners first became fans as a result of the breathtaking virtuosity and energy demonstrated in the studio albums that sent nearly all of them to #1. But, even more than the other great bands of the time,  we knew that somehow what was electric in the studio could become EXPLOSIVE if we could get the chance to hear it live. As a result, particularly after the repertoire from Physical Graffiti was added, tickets to Zeppelin concerts became the dream chased by millions;the legend culminated in the April 1977 concert at the Pontiac Silverdome, the first time that a musical act earned $1 million for a single performance.    The other part of the dream, of course, was the chance to own an album from one of those concerts. Not a nightmare exactly but not enough to wake us up was The Song Remains the Same. What I think made that unfulfilling were the LONG segments with stuff like \\"No Quarter\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\". The excitement from a live album is supposed to come from the whole band playing balls out, not one guy doing everything while all the others are smoking cigarettes.    Well, WAKE UP EVERYBODY! We finally have what we're waiting for.  This DVD is all live and is probably matched in sheer quantity only by the Springsteen 75-85 package. While the whole thing provides enormous entertainment value, the part that really immortalizes them is the Knebworth concert. That performance demonstrates their unique ability to produce 100% power with 0% noise; no matter how loud I play it, it always seems right.    If you like Zeppelin a little bit, this will make you like them a lot; if you like them a lot, you will think you've gone to heaven.

B0000AK7AG|5.0|The critical acclaim for this movie was unlike any given to a G-rated attraction in many, many years. Kenneth Turan described it as \\"the closest to perfection ever achieved in the making of a movie\\". Dozens of other reviewers believed that it was the first time a film had matched the charm and inspiration of the first Walt Disney movies (Snow White, Pinocchio, etc.)    This attention is wholeheartedly justified. This is a remarkable movie which should take its place with The Wizard of Oz and other family perennials. What is truly marvelous is that the filmmakers have enough confidence in their story that they believe it can stand alone without the \\"wacky sidekicks\\" and phony Broadway type musical numbers that plague today's children's films. This story concludes in a way so touching that it left tears in my eyes in a theater for the first time  in my adult life.    It was wonderful that it received a special effects Oscar, but it was a crime that one was not awarded to Chris Noonan. His direction resulted in the staging of scenes of such charm and visual poetry that they, in their own sentimental way, leave images as memorable as those from Ford, Hitchcock and Scorcese.     This is the first movie that my wife and I saw together, and I really think it is that once in a generation movie that can create an atmosphere of love for anyone seeing it together.

B0009I7NNA|4.0|Besides having one of the all time coolest band names ever, Avenged Sevenfold makes some realy cool music as well. City Of Evil is the bands best album to date, Waking The Fallen was a good one but this is much better! The band seems to be closer then ever and worker more like a team then ever before. M. Shadows vocals are nice and powerfull here and his lyrics seem to be getting better. Johnny Christ's bass and The Rev's Drums keep rythym nice and steady here, and Rev's drumming is out of this world on this record. Zacky Vengence's rythym guitar playing seems to be getting stronger. But Synyster Gates' lead playing absolutly blows me away this time. His leads are sharper, his riffs tighter, and his guitar solos are out of this world, I wish all bands now a days knew how to play guitar as good as this guy.<br /><br />This albums song selectiong is much better then the last. The songs are heavier and faster, and overall better. 'Blinded By Chains' and 'Trashed And Scattered' are my two favorite songs on the album. 'Trashed And Scattered' has a really cool guitar riff/solo and the whole song is just so awesome! This time around the band managed to get a hit single on the record, 'Bat Country' a song written about Hunter S. Thompson, the guy from Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. It is a really good song and actually one of the best tracks the band has ever made. The guitar solo is easily one of Gates' best ever. 'The Wicked End' is another really good song. The guitar riff is one of the best Ive heard in quite a few years.<br /><br />'Betrayed' is a tribute to the late and oh so great Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Damageplan. Dimebag was one of the worlds greatest guitarists and niceiest people ever, and he was killed by a fan who said he betrayed him, what a loser! This songs was only fitting as Pantera is one of the bands biggest influences, especially Zacky's. The song is amazing and if I was Dimebag I would be honored to have this song written in my tribute. R.I.P Dimebag!<br /><br />So while this might not be the best album to come along this year it is certainly one of the better ones, and I think every guitar player should do themselfs a favor and run out an pick up this amazing bands album..I.P Dimebag! <br /> <br />So while this might not be the best album to come along this year it is certainly one of the better ones, and I think every guitar player should do themselfs a favor and run out an pick up this amazing bands album.

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Conclusive or Elusive?  Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children gives viewers everything they've ever wanted.  Starting with the return of all our coveted characters.  Cloud Strife is searching for an answer to his existance, \\"Yeah, I want to be forgiven.\\"  A wonderfully animated piece of CG perfection, Advent Children really showcases the pride these animators and Mr. Nomoura have in their characters.  All aspects of this movie are animated brilliantly with lush vegetation and suprisingly well designed particle effects. <br /> <br />   A few things returning fans might notice is right off the bat we realize that Mr. Nomoura decided to make Tifa look HER AGE in this film.  It was brilliant and now we have a reason above the chest to stare!  That is of course excluding her converse which look awesome as they slam into Loz's face!  Then of course all of us returning fans must get a load of what I like to call  the Buster Sword 2.0.1!  Sword Fusion is officially the coolest form of combat since the original Buster back in 97'.  Fans won't be dissapointed with the subtleties either because a full Limit Break system is in effect!  We the viewer don't just see random acts of Awesomeness, they are truly achieved through kicking butt and getting whooped up on.  It's all accurate and truly amazing to watch.  Can we say Omni Slash: Kingdom Hearts Style, and then my personal favorite, the Clim hazard. <br /> <br />   In short, support this movie, even if you've been fortunate enough to see it already!  It's worth every penny and them some.  The PG-13 Rating is for the stylized violence and some language, but hey, we've all played the game and know that Cloud is Barret's......or rather.....the other way around.

Just imagine that style of filmmaking in Jarhead and you should know its going to be one of the best war movies in a long time and of all time. Sam Mendes is behind the helm in this huge film and he brings a nice unique feel to it. You know its going to be good if this guys first film was American Beauty. Road to Perdition was his second film, not as mind-blowing as American Beauty, but I'm telling you Jarhead is a great turn for him. It's a film the movie world really needs, a good unique war triumph like Jarhead. Even the trailer should grab you already. So go and watch this movie, and then own it, because it's a great freakin' flick. Best war movie in years, I'm telling you. Academy Award winning director of American Beauty, an Outstanding film, brings you a movie you will want to watch and own for years to come, Jarhead!! But, beware there actually is no fighting, doesn't mean you shouldn't watch it.<br /><br />Based on Anthony Swofford's best selling book in 2003.<br /><br />A true story of his experiences before Desert Storm.<br /><br />The look of the movie is very impressive.<br /><br />Watch it, Buy it, Breath it, Remember it!
B00005JMYI|4.0|After seeing such harch critiscm of Anchorman, my expectations of this comedy were mighty low. But it is exactly those low expectations that led me to enjoy this movie. <br /> <br />Sure...a lot of the jokes most any dunce could understand, but that's one of the points that makes Anchorman so enojyable and accesible. While it's not a comdey classic, it is a entertaining time to spend when you have a few hours to spare. <br /> <br />The plot focuses around the Channel 4 News studio and the hijinks that occur after a woman is hired as a correspondant. The leading News Anchor Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell) is quickly smitten with the new newswoman. And hilarity ensues. <br /> <br />The character that produces the biggest laughs would have to be Brick, played by Steve Carrell. Will Ferrell deffinitly has his moments as well. <br /> <br />While a few of the jokes are lame and don't get across, most of it is simple, harmless, and fun. If you are looking for something with a little more depth, this probably is not for you. Though, if you are looking for a light movie to raise your spirits, this is worth a try.
B000002N3N|5.0|This has to be Enya's most saddest album.  Every time I hear the first opening chords of the title track, I can't help but burst right into tears.  There's a reason she titled the song (and the album) \\"The Memory of Trees,\\" and while listening to that opening song you actually understand how and why she did this.  This probably isn't a very easy listen to those that are not already fans, but ... it does offer a bit of everything.  Aside from the emotional title track, there's the poppy \\"Anywhere Is\\"; the dark, somewhat scary, \\"Pax Deorum\\"; the beautiful ballad \\"China Roses\\"; and the fun \\"Tea House Moon.\\"  Other Enya fans will know what I mean when I say this album has variety. <br /> <br />My favorite Enya album to date is \\"A Day Without Rain,\\" but this one is right up there, too.  It's good music to listen to during dinner or when you're laying in bed, or just trying to relax.  At my house, Enya is always playing no matter what.  And that's the way I like it.  :)
B000002A46|5.0|In 1994, after releasing the multiplatiniun 'Mariah Carey', her weak R&B sophomore 'Emotion' and the MTV Unplugged 'EP'. She start takin' the holidays a little beat more seriously and bringin' gospel on her 'Merry Christmas' album. She never get along with her voice so well like this album, she made look some previous record so uninteresting with this one. Mariah Carey was known at those times for her pop tunes sang by some Aretha Franklin style. Mariah also developed some pop tunes that help her goin' through her career. A Christmas Album wasn't a little bit too hurry, it was on the righ moment. <br /> <br />Reunited again with former producer Walter Affanasielf, they re-start the writtin' process on create new Christmas songs. That's how came the powerful ballad 'Miss You Most (At Christmas Time) which was a single of the album and classic pop Mariah used to sing at the time. The song that take place on a couple that split a time ago, tries to show Mariah big voice on the track and produce a pop single. The song is great but it was overshadowed by another Mariah's invention 'All I Want For Christmas Is You' her perfect single of christmas cheering and love make the single really popular on holidays season. Mariah Carey will keep on memories year after year coz of this song. The classic song is also in company of kiddy gospel 'Jesus Born On This Day' another new Mariah - Walter tune.  <br /> <br />On classic side, we can hear the classic 'Silent Night'performed in her voice sounds amazing, better than any versions heard before. The 'Oh Holy Night' with her acrobatic voice sounds like some dish you can eat anytime you want without gettin' any fat. There's also the 'Christmas (Baby,Please Come Home) which make the album a high profile single and it's also a winner on hands of Ms. Carey. <br /> <br />Gettin' along with another gospel powerful song comes the 'Santa Claus Comin' To Town' that sounds cheerfull and beatiful. Now I'm overwhelmed by Hark! version which deserves an award for being so well singin' by any artist. The song respects traditional version and make it sound like good. The outstanding Jesus Oh What A Wonderful Child shakes the move on some Gospel more center version and the R&B 'Joy To The World' some style (let's remember that at the time Mariah was forbidden to explore more off her limits by Columbia) shooks really cheerful and complete perfect her style.  <br /> <br />
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I noticed that it says that the special edition DVD is only 174 minutes long, whereas the other DVD and even the VHS are both 194 minutes. I was wondering if anyone can tell me why that is; did they really delete 20 minutes from the special edition, or am i missing something? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.
B00003OO3O|5.0|With the 1975 release of their 4th studio album, UFO finally hit their stride. To a great extent, it was also their high water mark. For the rest of their turbulent career, they would produce excellent albums, but none of them were as consistent or as focused as Force It. From the wailing sustain intro of Let It Roll to the album closer This Kid's, the band are firing on all cylinders. Heavier and much more aggressive than anything they'd ever recorded, it also shows the rapidly growing maturity of their writing skills. The key to the album is the sheer diversity of the material, which for the most part is hard rock, but covering the wide spectrum of that genre better than 99% of their peers. Force It is the one truly essential UFO album, although I would have to strongly recommend its predecessor, 1974's Phenomenon. It covers a much wider range of musical styles and is as close to Force It's equal as anything in their catalog. However, Force It edges it out for the top spot through sheer, balls out energy. After Force It, the rest of the Schenker era albums were very inconsistent, with top notch songs balanced out with equal numbers of average to filler quality material. For the beginning UFO fan, start with 1974's Phenomenon and buy them chronologically. If you just want one UFO album though, buy Force It. There are better known songs on 1977's Lights Out and 1978's Obsession, but those both suffer from some really weak songs. Force It is perfect from start to finish. Enjoy!
B00005J6UP|5.0|Aaarrgghh!! So, ye be wantin' a story full of action, suspence, swash bucklin', thievin' bad guys, foul-mouthed kids, and the worst pirate of em all eh? Well mateys ye've come to the right place. O.K., I'm done with the bad pirate talk now. The Goonies is another blast from the past that will keep you in stitches. They're a group of kids: Mikey, Brand, Mouth, Chunk, Data, and the two girl Goonies Andy and Stef who have to save their town from being destroyed and turned into a golf course. Luckily they stumble apon an old treasure map and the fun begins there. They have to find the treasure thus saving their town, all the while solving an age old local myth about a pirate captain named \\"One-Eyed\\" Willie and the disappearance of a man named Chester Copperpot and out running a family of criminals called the Fratellis. Aside from all the cussing and swearing, and one of the worst blue screen shots in motion picture history, This is a good side splitter for the whole family. It also has a cool theme song called \\"The Goonies 'R' Good Enough\\" performed by Cyndi Lauper who was one of the most impressive and daring female singers of her time. And remember \\"Goonies Never Say Die!\\".
B000BUYP4Q|5.0|Sorry I love the Tim Burton movies, but this is the best Batman film. The story, actors, music, all make this a really good movie. Christopher Nolan (Memento) and David S. Goyer (Blade) reinvent Batman and make the movie more about him than what was shown in Burton's films. Their are villians, they just don't steal screen time from the hero. Michael Caine is great as Alfred he brings a warmth to the role. Gary Oldman is phenominal as Jim Gordon, I was happy at the way he played the character. Cillian Murphy is menacing as the Scarcrow and Liam Neeson is also great as Batman's mentor. Really good movie and from the end of it, I'm waiting for a sequel. Highly Highly Recommended.
0679422714|4.0|Mao Zedong is still worshipped widely in China as the greatest leader of modern times, admired as a powerful ruler who stood up to Confucian tradition and foreign domination, and heralded as a champion of the poor farmers who remain the majority of the nation's 1.3 billion people. In the years since Mao's death in 1976, many Chinese and even some Westerners have clung to the notion that he was a noble patriot, an acceptable kind of tyrant. <br /> <br />In \\"Mao: The Unknown Story,\\" Jung Chang and Jon Halliday bring a wrecking ball to the towering myths surrounding Mao: that he was a voice for China's peasants, a military genius who masterminded the \\"Long March\\" of his Red Army to safety then led it in a war to repel Japan. Instead, Chang and Halliday portray Mao as a conniving, backstabbing, relentless schemer who was motivated solely by a will to power. It drips with tales of betrayal and treachery on an almost unimaginable scale. It also is a powerful narrative about China's sorrow, about a country wrecked by his malevolent methods.  <br /> <br />Chang is the author of \\"Wild Swans\\" (1991), a best-selling history of her family that also lyrically rendered China's beguiling culture and violent past. For \\"Mao,\\" Chang and her husband Halliday conducted a decade of exhaustive research, interviewing members of Mao's inner circle and hundreds of others. Mao emerges in these pages as a restless rebel in Hunan with a passion for literature who rose to power by outfoxing countless rivals to rule the Communist Party. He engaged in spectacular political fights, was responsible for a famine that killed more than 30 million and led a \\"Great Purge,\\" the authors' name for Mao's Cultural Revolution of the 1960s that devastated Chinese society. It's a book full of juicy characters. Lin Biao, who was so afraid of water that he didn't bathe, promoted Mao as a god and the Little Red Book of Mao quotations as a Bible, only to consider assassinating him and then, once discovered, was killed trying to escape to the Soviet Union. Chou En-lai, the polished diplomat who covered up decades of Mao's worst acts, was betrayed by Mao in the end. Jiang Qing, Mao's fourth wife and shrill attack dog, said at her trial, \\"Whoever Chairman Mao asked me to bite, I bit.\\"  <br />  <br />The myths that fall are numerous. One is that Mao's empathy with China's farmers put him at the helm of an agrarian-led revolution. In fact, the authors demonstrate, the \\"peasant uprisings\\" Mao claimed to have led were actually sophisticated power-grabs, in which he relied on bandits and used elaborate trickery to gain access to soldiers and power. Another is that the Red Army won the people's support by being upright, never looting or taxing the poor. The book shows persuasively that he stole aggressively from the rich, the poor and the in-between, and always insisted on luxuries for himself - eating delicacies, residing in palaces, bedding young women - even in the direst moments of war.  <br /> <br />Chang and Halliday portray the Long March as a series of make-shift steps, each intended to further Mao's own ascension, and they contend that his climactic battle at the Dadu River, intricately told in Edgar Snow's classic book \\"Red Star Over China,\\" was entirely made-up. They describe his treatment of his wives and children, whom he cast aside when they became inconventient, and of his enemies, whom he exiled, poisoned or executed. The authors use newly-available Soviet documents to that illuminate Mao's complex relationship with Stalin, how Mao begged for and depended on Stalin's aid in the 1940s, and may not have been able to defeat Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist army without it. They cite cable traffic between the two men to show how eagerly Mao welcomed the Korean War and sent millions of Chinese soldiers to death to serve his other purposes.  <br /> <br />In some places, Chung and Halliday go too far, effectively diluting the force of their argument: that Mao was a sophisticatedthug who bullied his way to the top and stopped at nothing to hold power. They allege that he was responsible for more than 70 million deaths, but their calculations are rife with guesses and worst-case suppositions. Many of their \\"revelations\\" have been published in bits and pieces in a recent gush of Chinese-language histories and memoirs. Some items are unreliable, others implausible.  <br /> <br />But the authors seem so set on demolishing Mao's reputation that they overreach. In one place, they imply that Mao's comments precipitated the erecting of the Berlin Wall. In another, they suggest that Mao caused Stalin's death because of a document found at Stalin's bedside about Tito, the troublesome Yugoslavian communist leader whom Stalin once compared to Mao - as if the mere thought of Mao were enough to trigger a stroke. The authors also have an annoying habit of portraying Mao's rivals as compassionate humanitarians, evidently to make Mao look more evil. Peng Dehuai, a war hero and defense minister purged by Mao, is described as someone who \\"cared about the poor and downtrodden.\\"  The authors' haphazard method of spelling Chinese names seems to reflect a disregard for accuracy. Most readers won't care, but anyone familiar with Chinese history will find it strange that Mao's third wife, He Zizhen, is referred to only by a nickname, Gui-yuan.  <br /> <br />In their efforts to demonize Mao, the authors fail to reflect on why Mao is still so admired in China today. Part of that phenomenon is an intense nostalgia that rests on Mao's perceived victories, his cleverness, his unpredictability. Even though information about Mao's sordid past is emerging, many Chinese insist on seeing him as the founding father of Communist China, as the embattled winner of its civil war and fight against Japan, the rough equivalent of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt wrapped into one. At the same time, Mao clearly stood for poverty and totalitarian control, nowcompletely discredited in China. Mao also went against many so Chinese ideals - respect for authority, concern for appearances - that he seems to represent everything that Chinese people ordinarily despise. In a repressive culture, it may be that the Chinese people yearn for a hero who rebels against all the traditional restrictions that they themselves willingly suffer. The authors do not mull over this possibility. Their epilogue is two sentences long, noting that Mao's portrait still hangs alone at the main gate of Tiananmen Square and that the Party \\"fiercely perpetuates the myth of Mao.\\" They miss the complexity and subtlety of today's China, and fail to explain why Mao still has such a hold on its people.
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side Of The Moon is Pink Floyd's most popular recording, and for good reason. From start to finish, this album exhibits technical and instrumental excellence. Not since the Beatles' \\"Revolver\\" or the Beach Boys' \\"Pet Sounds\\" has one recording been so influential for musicians and studio engineers alike. It is also their first true concept album, centered around two of Roger Waters' favorite subjects - despair and insanity. The songs seamlessly tie together, giving the illusion of one magnum opus, which it is. Memorable cuts include 'Breathe', 'Time', 'Money', and 'Us And Them', though each one is tremendous in its own right. But unlike most of Pink Floyd's albums, the guitar doesn't play a big part, though it doesn't seem to take away from the experience one bit. Not only is this required for all Floyd fans, it is essential for all fans of rock 'n' roll...period. Dark Side Of The Moon didn't remain on Billboard's charts nearly 15 years by accident. This is one of rock's most triumphant moments, and it got me, like many other people, into the band. They are now my second favorite band (The Beatles being my absolute favorite), and \\"Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" is my favorite PF album.<br /><br />So, do yourself a favor, and buy this album, or download it. Just get it. It's awesome. They DEFINITELY don't make music like this anymore, sadly.<br /><br />- Zack, 16 years old

B00005QDW5|3.0|If you are interested in Pink Floyd, you should buy the albums, starting with Dark Side of the Moon, Wish You Were Here, The Wall, and Meddle, then continue on from there. This has a 17 minute version of \\"Echoes\\". The actual song (which can be found on the \\"Meddle\\" album) is 23 minutes long. Also, it only contains the first 7 parts of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\". This compilation also contains several \\"jumps\\" and \\"edits\\", so that the songs synch with one another, due to the fact that most of the songs are from concept albums. Casual fans may want to pick this up, but die hard Floyd fans will want to stick with the albums.

B000AXSN5G|5.0|I am listening to the CD right now, again. This CD is truly amazing. It captures the best Neil Young has to offer. Very moving. The first track, Painter, is an especially beautiful song, as are many other tracks. It's a Dream is \\"off the charts\\" amazing. Melodic, soulful and sweet. Once of his best balads ever. Can't stop listening to this one. When God Made Me is truly a spiritual experience. BUY this album, you WILL NOT be disappointed. In fact, buy one for your mother, friends, and kids. Excellent production quality. Top notch musicians. IT IS REALLY REALLY GOOD.
0670033375|5.0|Only a couple of ship skeletons and swords were left of the Vikings , the pyramids of the Mayas with their surroundings have become deserted and no-one knows how to handle the statues on the Easter Islands. Therefore one gets into brooding whether, one day, this could happen to the \\"White House\\" in Washington or, either, to the \\"Reichstag\\" in Berlin as well. Jared Diamond tries to comfort us: If one goodly does not allow any climate reversal (Hello Kyoto), and fends off enemies of the outside (Islam or communism? Of Mars or out of UFOs? Bird flu or AIDS)? and if mankind does not increase too rapidly, the case perhaps still could turn out all right. He mustn't more pessimistically speak either, otherwise he would be boycotted. No-one would like to imagine Los Angeles in a Pompeii design (therefore one further builds in this area like also in the again and again flooded New Orleans) - or having to look for New York Broadway like a sunken Troja or to give lost in Rwanda ethnic groups or others in Turkey (as already Armenian or Kurdish). The geography professor Jared Diamond at least finds out (pleasantly interdisciplinary for his guild), that less material factors (comet elements, earthquakes or floods) are extinguishing populations (to endure of necessity passively) , but on the other hand more cultural, active political processes of decision are reasons of collapses: (1) racialist (or also religiously?) hostilities, (2) naive carelessness regarding the population growth in connection with the inadequately economy capacity of a country, (3) unpunished environmental destruction by shortsighted industry concepts, (4) incompetent (egocentric, lobbyists dependent?) reaction ways of the political leadership groups elected for 4 years. What Mayas, Viking or Easter Island residents (I add the missed Indians of North America) had to suffer, was, however, comparatively a small little problem, if one looks at the irreparable, cancerous growth of industries in all countries. By adding the application of modern weapon technologies (what about the defoliation of Vietnam? Are there reparations payments?) and the increasing populations a condition of indissolubility could harden, that one sees moving up the \\"latest day\\" -- also without being Bible faithful. Jared Diamond switches on small rescue lights for little boys at the end of a time tunnel seeming dark, leading downwards: Japan's woods protection (we better do not talk about the whaling quota); the clever Inuit survived up to today, concentrated on a little fishing undemandingly, but, in the contrary, the Vikings operated boldly with war and agriculture; should we become like the Inuit, not building more highly than an igloo and not moving with a Boeing but better with a canoe - or should we use (compliment to China ) only a bicycle? No, Jared Diamond is not quite that type of forbears, he really modernistically takes towns like London or Tokyo as an example, that technical intelligence used sensibly could be saving. Yes, perhaps the present squabble on oil, gas and water will soon be a thing of the past -- by application of ingenious wind power and solar technologies. Maybe Americans and Europeans do surprisingly reasonably abstain on 50% of their energy consumption, so that the billions of Chinese can finally catch up...adding the application of modern weapon technologies (what about the defoliation of Vietnam?

B000A7DVR2|2.0|I bought the \\"collectors edition\\" only to feel completely ripped off! There is nothing new on this DVD! It is essentially the same as the original DVD. The documentary on the making of the movie is the same documentary that is on the old DVD! There are previously unreleased \\"still\\" images (big deal!) and a new \\"Introduction\\" that is kinda funny, but overall there is nothing new on this disc. The picture has been \\"digitally remastered\\", but that is it! There are even fricking previews!!!!! After I bought the DVD, I found out about the \\"Achievers edition\\" which has multiple discs, etc. I could not find it in any stores. I'm sure that the \\"Achievers Edition\\" is the \\"real\\" Collectors Edition. Overall, very misleading! Dissappointing!! Big time!

B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling is without question one of the most innovative and genre defining records of all time.  I'm 45 now and still have this in my CD player at least once a week.  That and Los Angeles by X have to be in every music fan's top 10.  Let's get back to London Calling..I was a sophmore at Chico State in CA and had just purchased the recently released album based on a review in Rolling Stone claiming this was a must have.  I had heard of The Clash and picked the record up at Sundance Records in downtown Chico.  Needless to say, I was amazed.  Just as I was amazed a year later when I heard \\"I Will Follow\\" off the debut album by a band called U2.  So after a month or so of pure Clash (including purchase of the first two lp's), I discover they are coming to the Bay Area and playing the Warfield Theater in SF.  I bought tickets and my girlfriend and I drove the three hours down to the Bay Area for the show.  The Clash came out dressed totally in black.  Black jeans, black short sleeve shirts, red scarves.  I forget which of these was the opening song but basically the first three were \\"London Calling\\", and then off the first record, \\"I'm So Bored w/the USA\\" and \\"Clash City Rockers\\".  I will never forget this, but the hair on the back of my neck was standing at attention.  I literally had chills running through me as the crowd up front in the pit were smashing each other, pogoing up and down, and hurling themselves at a snarling Joe Strummer.  Mick was staring down at his guitar and Paul was modeling for the crowd looking cooler than anyone in the whole theater.  I really don't remember the entire show or what the set list was but when we left the show, my girlfriend and I could literally not hear each other talking.  And I knew that I had witnessed something that could never be repeated.  I saw The Clash two or three times later in their brief career as a group, including the end when Strummer had a mohawk and \\"Rock the Casbah\\" was most everyone's first intro to thisgreat band.  If only they could have seen them back on the London Calling tour...
B00003CXCT|2.0|Just a rumour, but if it's true a criterion version of the \\"original\\" Star Wars might be out. Some disadvantages would be that only 'A New Hope' would come out; this is because it's was one of the most important films for too many reasons to comment here, but that I'm sure every fan will know anyway. Also, some people know Criterion version is a bit more costly (it will propably cost as much as  the entire star wars dvd trilogy.)keep your fingers crossed and hopefully Mr. Lucas will fight the dark side and make it happen.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I just bought and watched Titanic again (Twice) once with actor commentary, I have to say that the special edition is worthy for DVD collectors. <br />Of the deleted scenes I found only two enjoyable. One where Rose has a mental breakdown in her suite, where she trashes it and breaks things before running out on deck to where she would meet Jack for the first time. The second where Molly Brown is at the dinner table and asks a waiter for some ice as she holds up an empty glass. (You see the iceberg drift past the windows behind her) <br />Though the extended and alternate endings were a treat as well. Such as Old Rose letting Brock 'hold' the Heart of the Ocean in his palm just before she chucks it over her shoulder into the water. <br />The movie is just as enjoyable though every time you see it. <br />Of the commentary, its interesting in that Kate Winslet came up with the idea to spit in Cal's face as Jack had taught Rose to spit, as it was written in the script that she stabs Cal with a hair pin. Cameron praised Kate on this idea.
B000AL730Y|5.0|Paul McCartney, never at a loss for creating extraordiary songs does not disappoint on this collection either.  The music is pure McCartney; the lyrics nonpareil.  Paul McCartney is a song writer in a class by himself.  He has definitely raised the musical bar once again.<br /><br />\\"Fine Line\\" is of extraordinary caliber and \\"Jenny Wren\\" is noted for its beautiful acoustic and Paul's singing.  \\"English Tea\\" brings to mind the Beatle years; in listening to this, one can imagine Paul in 1967 singing this and it would be as wonderful and outstanding as it is as a recent work.  Indeed, this one does hearken back to Beatle days; one can indeed hear the unique influence as only Paul McCartney can provide.<br /><br />\\"Too Much Rain\\" and \\"Riding to Vanity Fair\\" are excellent songs that work as \\"counterpoint\\" or contradictory pieces.  The songs both show Paul at his cutting edge best.<br /><br />This is the kind of thing I hope we'll hear more of over time.  Paul McCartney has indeed shown a musical renaissance as well as his musical roots which are with the Beatles.  He deftly combines these and the result is nothing short of brilliant.  In effect, one can liken this to Gestalt - the sum being greater than the whole of its parts.  In this case, the parts being Paul's musical background with the Beatles and later with Wings and his more current solo works.  This is indeed a beautifully done Gestalt listening experience.<br /><br />No Beatle fan and/or Paul McCartney fan should be without this one.  The song writing is just spectactular.  You also get a DVD with a very nice doumentary about the creation of this CD.  You also get some animated footage as well.  Be sure to get this one and get ready for some high caliber music!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Rage Against The Machine are seen as one of the pioneers of rap-metal, and they certainly do it right. I've always respected their intensity in their music, and although not all the time I agree with their messages, I thoroughly enjoy the music. <br /> <br />1.Testify 9/10...This used to be one of my favorites, but I unfortunately wore it out. Very fast paced and good. <br />2.Guerilla Radio 8.5/10...Another RATM classic, and probably their biggest hit. Alot like Testify, this is a fast paced rocker and I like the lyrics to this one. <br />3.Calm Like A Bomb 9.5/10...Best bass on the cd probably, this song is great. The verses are slow and rappy, while the chorus picks up and rocks. <br />4.Mic Check 8.5/10...This is an all out funk rap piece. But one can't argue with how cool Tom's guitar effect on this song sounds. <br />5.Sleep Now In The Fire 10/10...One of my favorite Rage songs of all time. Fast paced guitar intro with the thumping bass/snare drum combination. Very cool. <br />6.Born Of A Broken Man 10/10...Another one of my favorites. This song is very dark, and is probably the heaviest on the cd. The ending is very cool. <br />7.Born As Ghosts 8/10...Another darker weird song, the verses are rather forgettable while the chorus saves the song. <br />8.Maria 8/10...I've never really gotten into this song, it's not bad by any means, there's just not a component that grabs my attention. <br />9.Voice Of The Voiceless 8/10...As you can see, this is where the cd loses a bit of momentum, this track is a basic fast paced rocker, nothing too special. <br />10.New Millenium Homes 8/10...Alot like the previous, a bit boring still a good song. <br />11.Ashes In The Fall 9/10...Ah yes, now we're back with Ashes In The Fall. The beginning of this song sounds like the Halloween theme. This is another darker song, and the ending makes it. <br />12.War Within A Breath 9.5/10...What a way to end this cd. The beginning feels alot like Mic Check where you think it's going to beanother just rap song, when the heavy guitar kicks in and it rocks. The best part is without a doubt the bridge. <br /> <br />Rage give you a thrill every time you listen to them, and this being their most commercially accesible album, doesn't mean it's their best. I strongly recommend their selt-titled, Evil Empire, and Renegades.
B0007MWZEK|3.0|I bought one of these to do quick cleaning when I don't feel like pulling out the upright vac and fighting with the cord.  Works pretty much as advertised, although don't expect it to do more than light removal of loose dirt, crumbs, etc.  It's not going to get up pet fur or ground in dirt. Very light weight and easy to carry up and down the stairs.  Works much better on carpet than bare floors.  It will pick up on hard floors but takes a few passes to get all the dirt.  If you have carpeted stairs, you will find it handy to quickly clean up the steps.  The Swivel Sweeper is simply made and has a dirt tray on the bottom that is easy to snap out and dump.  The battery is easily removable and fits into a wall charger for recharge.  It seems like a well designed product, but I can't comment on reliability because I just purchased it. (The warranty is 90 days.) I would it have rated it at maybe four stars if it were a little less expensive, say about  $25.00. (I think the pretty hefty little rechargeable battery and wall charger is responsible for the higher cost).
B00000J2KX|4.0|After having read the first page of the reviews for \\"The Shining\\", I'm sorry to say I find \\"none\\" of them  manage to describe this film. I saw this film last night and I quite liked a few things about the film which I will share with you.<br /><br />The Shining is about a big hotel and a three member family that moves into live there as caretakers. Jack Nicholson is an aspiring writer who finds that the big empty(cause of unfavourable weather) hotel is where he will give writing a book a shot. Things start happening and ultimately the family is left in absolute horror at the incidents that take place. The reason the film manages to have a huge effect on me was because of the big mansion the film was shot in. There are a hundred plus rooms and I really think the camerawork was quite awe-inspiring. Some very solid performances by the kid called Danny.<br /><br />Please Read-<br /><br />The reason the shining manages to hold the gravity and an everlasting fright mixed with entertainment impact on my mind is because of how non self-conscious it was. There is nothing in the film that the director seems to do just out of pleasing the audience. There are many things rather unexplained in the movie which keeps you thinking for quite a while. During the 2hours and 20minutes of this film I was almost completely absolved in the film.<br /><br />I would most definitely like to watch the movie again so I consider it worth purchasing if you have the money to.<br /><br />Also check out \\"Thinner\\" if you like this film. Although it's not one of those films that make you jump out of your seat it manages to entertain nonetheless. \\"The Others\\" is also another worthy recommendation.
B00003003R|4.0|For six years, between 1987 and 1993, Guns N' Roses ruled the rock world. It was six years of accusations of being racist, riots, tempter tantrums, swearing on live TV, urinating on planes, very public feuds with other bands, and of course, unbelievably great rock n' roll. From the days of when GN'R brought authenticity back to rock n' roll, when Bon Jovi were considered the premier rock band, to surviving the onslaught of grunge, GN'R were rock gods. In 1999, five years after the semi-original Guns N' Roses rocked an arena for the last time, the posthumous \\"Live Era '87-'93\\" hit the stores.<br /><br />While \\"Live Era\\" is quite good, it could have been better. Guns N' Roses was a great band, and put on an exciting live show, there's no denying that. \\"Live Era\\" is filled with classics, from each release, minus \\"The Spaghetti Incident\\" (1993). The band sounds great and performance on each track is top-notch. That said, \\"Live Era\\" is flawed in two ways-its chronology and production.<br /><br />As the back of the CD states, the songs on this CD were \\"recorded across the universe between 1987 and 1993.\\" For some bands, like Nirvana or Motley Crue, it wouldn't be any problem to compile a live album with songs from different years. With Guns N' Roses, however, it doesn't quite work. That's because the original Guns N' Roses went through four distinct phases:<br /><br />Phase I: 1986-1990: Axl Rose- vocals, Slash- lead guitar, Izzy Stradlin- rhythm guitar, Duff McKagan- Bass, Steven Adler- Drums. This lineup, generally regarded as the definitive one, recorded \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" (1987) and \\"GN'R Lies\\" (1998). This lineup was basically Aerosmith on speed, with an element of punk and the Rolling Stones.<br /><br />Phase II: 1991: Axl Rose- vocals, Slash- lead guitar, Izzy Stradlin- rhythm guitar, Duff McKagan- Bass, Matt Sorum- Drums, Dizzy Reed- Keyboards. The addition of the very proficient, yet slightly bombastic Matt Sorum and keyboard player Dizzy Reed made GN'R's sound slicker, less rough-around the edges. With this lineup, the band ventured out and experimented considerably, with the very ambitious epic \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" and \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" (1991).<br /><br />Phase III: 1992: Axl Rose- vocals, Slash- lead guitar, Gilby Clarke- rhythm guitar, Duff McKagan- Bass, Matt Sorum- Drums, Dizzy Reed- Keyboards. In addition, many backup musicians, such as female backup singers and a horn section were added. GN'R purists often regarded this period as the weakest link in the bands career. It is said that GN'R became very bloated during this leg of the tour and all the horns and added singers watered down the bands sound. I tend to disagree with that assessment. It was an interesting phase in the band's career and many of the songs, like \\"Move to the City\\" and \\"November Rain\\" sound enhanced with the extra musicians. Unfortunately, in 1992, when compared to the stripped down, unadulterated rock n' roll of Nirvana and Pearl Jam, Guns N' Roses huge backup entourage seemed excessive and bloated. Still, it was just an experimental phase, something that people often forget. As a live guitarist, Gilby Clarke outshined Stradlin.<br /><br />Phase IV: 1993: Axl Rose- vocals, Slash- lead guitar, Gilby Clarke- rhythm guitar, Duff McKagan- Bass, Matt Sorum- Drums, Dizzy Reed- Keyboards. All the excess musicians are gone. While not as raunchy as the early days, GN'R comes full circle and goes back to playing pure rock n' roll. Many of the songs are played even more stripped down, acoustically.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Live Era\\" is that there will be one song from the AFD/Lies era, then one song from the horn era, then back to the AFD/Lies era, and then will leap into '93, before going back to '91 and so on. While the songs are great, no doubt, the album overall is a little disjointed. It would have been better if disc 1 were strictly from the '87-'90 AFD/Lies era,, and disc II were from the experimental, '92 horn era.<br /><br />The other problem with \\"Live Era\\" is it sounds overproduced. The songs sound tampered with. There is some speculation that Axl Rose even re-recorded his vocals (although this is just speculation). They should have just left the songs as is, without trying to touch them up.<br /><br />While this list of criticisms seems long, it is not meant to imply that \\"Live Era\\" is a bad album. Indeed, the songs are still classics and if you are a fan of the band \\"Live Era\\" is well worth owning.rproduced. The songs sound tampered with.

B000088E6D|5.0|I first discovered this singer when I was downloading random music from Napster. I listened to his song entitled \\"Sway\\" and was flat-out BLOWN AWAY. After listening to his voice for probably only thirty seconds, I finally know what it means to \\"go weak at the knees.\\" He has a voice that is similar to Frank Sinatra's and when combined with his mildy modern touch on the classic crooner style, Michael Bubl is a vocal prodigy and an essential element to just about anyone's music collection. I especially recommend him to anyone who has a special place in their heart for Frank Sinatra's \\"Come Fly With Me\\" and/or Harry Connick Jr.'s \\"A Wink and a Smile,\\" since Bubl's music sounds somewhat similar to both of these but is also a little more jazzed up (which is a good thing). <br /> <br />In short, Bubl's style is classic enough to appeal to older generations and is modern and catchy enough to attract younger audiences. <br /> <br />I definitely recommend this CD, especially since it is my favorite out of all his CDs.
B000002VCO|5.0|Great album! <br />It's one of thoes few that I enjoy all the songs on the album and can listen to it over and over again without getting jaded. <br />Wish they would remaster this this CD, the digital CD transfer is not the greatest and could benefit greatly from an overhaul. <br />
0060090383|5.0|i'm currently reading \\"the other side of the story\\" and with lily wright visiting amazon.com so many times throughout the book, i decided to check in and leave some comments. i love marian keyes' books - and rachel's holiday was the first one i read back in ninth grade. i was going through a rough time around then and this may sound a bit too dramatic but it's true - reading the book was a turning point in my life; it veered me out of a several-months old depression. i had never before read a writer who can write about something so dark as addiction with so much humour. kudos to marian keyes! read the book; you won't regret it!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Serenity's a rare movie. It gives popcorn-movie fun without insulting your intelligence. It also avoids the cynical game of \\"plot tweeking by the studio marketing department\\". The wisecracking crew of lost boys and girls trying to outmanuever the creepy-polite operative is entertaining, and good comedy. <br /> <br />The real magic is taking wild twists on familiar ground. Cliches are turned inside-out, but this cleverness never sterilizes its emotional core, the characters. Each one is presented with their failings in the foreground. The heros don't have infinite confidence and neat certainties. And that's the point of the story, trying to engineer people into an idea of perfection is a very bad thing. (German transcendentalists be warned: this is the opposition's arguement, with spaceships.) But noodling out underlying meanings isn't required, it's perfectly enjoyable at face value. <br /> <br />Serenity suffered from being released in the midst of the post summer movie hangover of late September, so it's box office gross doesn't reflect it's quality. This DVD's December release makes it a perfect antidote to the emotionally saccharine, Oscar-wannabe holiday fare.
B000696PWC|4.0|Ok, this one is quite good. Some of the music is good, but the others are... not too good. But overall, she has chosen the right songs.  These are my reviews for some 'Chosen' songs:     -I Believe In You: (5 stars)  This songs has a good beat, very enjoyable. And in this song, Kylie's voice heard very good. I enjoy most of this song. Except for the 7 seconds in the end, her sound heard very bad. And the lyrics, too much repeat for the sentence \\"I Believe In You...\\", but I still love it.    -Can't Get You Out Of My Head (5 stars)  This song reminds me for the Rich Girl (by Gwen Stefani). Both of them has an excellent beat and tempo. The lyrics is quite short, but with much repeats, expecially for the lalalalalala...    -Slow (5 stars)  This one is quite good, the beat is quite slow, but it's really good. You can really enjoy this one. The sound effects make this one's very good. It will be good if you try to dance with this song.    -Red Blooded Woman (5 stars)  This songs is very very good,the lyrics are very good, the beat is quite slow, but it's very enjoyable and danceable. Her voice in this song is very good, she sings very good, especially for the reff.    -Kids feat. Robbie William  (4 stars)  The collaboration with Robbie William made a good song. But I don't really like the beat. They sings very good. I like their voice when they sing together. It's really \\"mix\\". For the first time, I don't think they could sing as good as this.     -Spinning Around    (1 star)  WOW, what is this? You're kidding me! Slow, and 90's music feeling. I don't like this!    -(Can't start) Giving You Out  Oh My Goshh... this one also has 90's feeling and I don't like this one like Spinning Around. This is the worst from this CD.    -Chocolate    (5 stars)  This 5 minutes (almost) song is slow, good, and unique. The beat is slow, and really 'chocolate'. The vocal sounds heard very 'soft'. At first time, I didn't hope much from this song, but the best thing from this song is Kylie raps! The last 1-2 minutes, she raps, and it's very good! This rap give this song extra 2 stars.    Overall, this 2 CDs from Kylie is recommended. Especially for Gwen Stefani lovers, this is recommended.
B000A2RRF4|4.0|my friend watched it and said its the greatest show of all dangerous tours. so i bought it. but oh, the sound really really sucks. seriously i cant stand it. other than that. its a great show. if u dont have a complete version of any of MJ's concerts, u should buy it.

B000AL730O|3.0|Starting a new world tour lends itself to a high profile opportunity to having your music presented to a great number of people, fans and critics alike. That being said however, with all the talk of this being his best solo work ever, one would believe all the hype and that something of the caliber of some of his greatest works would be presented on the new album and maybe for a lot of people this would be the first time in long time, the opportunity to solidly say \\"Paul is back\\". But, unfortunately that certainly doesn't happen here.  <br /> <br />But keep in mind the desire to say that comes more from his fans and critics, not from Paul. So it would be nice if the almost tearful references of a great talent finally making something worthy of his legacy to stop and see the album for what it is;  a snapshot of how Paul uses his talents and expresses himself at any given moment in time, critics & fans be damned! And if you're Paul McCartney you can say that. This seems to be Sir Pauls method and he's alluded to it himself in interviews. If another \\"Penny Lane\\" or \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" pops up then so be it. If not, oh well. <br /> <br />In all the reviews I've read, one word pops up in my mind; justification. Everyone seems to be justifying his work. And in Paul's case based on past (and in most cases WAY PAST accomplishments...)this is a man who certainly has nothing to prove although many of us, myself included that would like see him come up with one more blockbuster that would turn the world on it's head and if that was going to happen, this would have been it. But again, it hasn't and maybe wasn't supposed to happen. <br /> <br />The album itself has nice little gems, Jenny Wren (cousin to Blackbird and English Tea (can you say Penny Lane lite...?)but all in all it's McCartney doing what he's being doing for the past 25 years and that's trying to please himself.  <br /> <br />The saving grace of the album is Nigel Godrich who had the unenviable task of trying to rein in the McCartney Ego and force him to forego the banalities, corniness and incompleteness that have plagued his work for too long. It's not a job I would have wanted. So here it is, critics be damned.... <br /> <br />Here's the good....solid production, interesting melodies and chord structure, spiffy arrangements, complete ideas and the elusive quality of some of the tunes attaching themselves to your brain (takes a few listens though) <br /> <br />The not so good... Paul's voice is showing signs of age (although not live in concert interestingly enough) and if I had to fault someone for this it's Nigel in allowing Paul to be so \\"up front\\" and \\"dry\\" in the mix and not be able to shore up or color an obvious weakness. (maybe a battle lost by Nigel) <br /> <br />The album has a lack of energy probably due to it less than spontaneous approach. <br /> <br />Awful last song, Anyway, which is a blatant \\"nick\\" of Get Ready done by Jeff Beck and Rod Stewart.... unlistenable. I can't imagine no one not pointing that out to Sir Paul! (or again, maybe he did not listen or care) <br /> <br />So all in all, just buy the album, sit back and enjoy it. It's not his best by far but an interesting and engaging piece of work and a worthy but mild chapter in the McCartney scrapbook. Keep the pieces you like and ignore the ones you don't but be sure to dismiss them with a nod of the respect he deserves. After all, it's Paul. <br />

B00005JNQS|5.0|I love this movie. Do not listen to the *bad revies.* This  movie is GREAT!!!!!
B0000046KM|5.0|The songs and arrangements on this album are true treasures. <br />The title track is sweet and nostalgic, setting the tone for the album.  \\"Where Do You Start\\" is one of the great ballads of all time, with a lyric that touches deeply.  This is Shirley Horn at her peak, with an album that should've received even greater recognition that it did.  Share this album with someone you love. <br />Ms. Horn, your music will live on forever!
B000084T18|5.0|The fact that people give this masterpiece 1 star reviews cause 50 cent has been shot 9 times is a joke. This is the ULTIMATE hip-hop album by the ULTIMATE hip-hop artist. You should get this album ( and anything that gets played on MTV) and avoid anything by so called \\"music\\" bands like the who, beetles and stone. GET RICH OR DIE TRYING is pop music at its best.
B00001U0DP|5.0|I saw this movie for the first time some years ago. Up to now, I think there hasn't been any other movie that I had enjoyed more. Not only for its wonderful story but also for the great performances on it... Roberto Benigni and Nicoletta Braschi plays are really breathtaking... but how to forget that wonderful kid called Giorgio Cantarini (Giosue on the movie) <br /> <br />This story tells the nice and quite life of a Jewish man (Guido) who falls in love with a beautiful school teacher (Dora). His permanent and occurrent humor sense and persistence gets Dora's heart... movie goes softly with many humoristic scenes and situations. Some years later, Giosue appears in scene, having Guido and Dora already married. The unexpected comes with a Nazi guard arrives to this happy family. Guido and his very young child are taken by the force to a Nazi death camp. Dora's love is stronger than anything and she leaves everything to join her family at the same hell. <br /> <br />Then, the most dramatic (and unforgettable) situations are shown. Guido makes everything to make Giosue believe they are part of a game which will give to the winner a tank car. Even when Guido finishes his extremely-hard working days, he's still smily and full of imagination to make this white lie bigger. Although Guido's duties, he manages to get his sweetheart a love message, an operah play that Dora attented when they weren't together. <br /> <br />After many situations, Guido knows the war is finishing and hides his little boy from Nazis soldiers. He tries to rescue his wife but he's caught by a soldier... who has no mercy with him. After some silent moments, Giosue comes out and he realizes is in front of the game winner's price... a real tank car. An American soldier rescues him and during the way home he sees his mum... who had also escaped from that nightmare. <br /> <br />This movie has become a real classic of the film history, it's not a marketing product... it's a real masterpiece. For much, the best movie I've seen in many, many years... my all time favourite movie? I'd probably say: YES. <br /> <br />Now, you just should... Enjoy it!
B0002F7I9Y|1.0|What a joke. They shoulda awarded those grammies to talented musical genuses like 50 cent and Jessica Simpson. Ray Charles was a great singer, no doubt but compare him to 50 cent? dont even go there. Buy The Massacre instead.
0316168815|5.0|This was a very unusual book, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact I couldnt put it down.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is one of the greatest albums EVER! Timeless classics like the title track are terrefic. Buy this album punk masterpiece and avoid anything by old bands like the beetles, stones and beach bums. Ohh and make sure you buy Avril Lavigne's new album, it's another masterpiece.
B000002L9J|5.0|*********best of the smiths...top 3 album in 1986...perfect pop songs expert arrangements, vocals and precision instruments....\\"sweetness, sweetness , i was only joking\\"........take care of your head.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|This is it, the masterpiece that changed punk music forever. You should buy this classic masterpiece and forget any punk album from the 70s or 80s by poser bands like the sex pistols or the clash. Not only avril is probebly the greatest guitarist ever (Yes, she's better than Jimi Hendrix) but she's unquestionably one of the best female vocalists around. This album is just a masterpiece, I can't explain enough. Just buy this album, oh and the video of \\"Dont tell me\\" peaked at #1 in MTV videos, that should speak enought about the quality of this classic punk rebellioun masterpiece.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I've never been looking forward to seeing a movie so badly! 20 more days until it would have been shown in Switzerland... and suddenly it vanished from the cinema schedule. Appartently there weren't enough viewers in the French part of Switzerland, so they are not going to show it in the German part. <br /> <br />So this is my chance to finally see the movie, I've waited for sooooo long! As I haven't seen it yet, I cannot really comment on it myself. But from what I've read: it must be spectacular! <br /> <br />I would have preferred Firefly (the TV show) getting a lot more seasons over a movie. But the world isn't perfect and I guess this is the closest to perfection we'll ever get in the Fireflyverse... I'm still hoping for many sequels though! <br /> <br />Keep on flying Serenity! You can't stop the Signal!
B00005ASHM|1.0|Come on, there's a reason why people werent buying this album in the 60s (it's the beach boys least successfull album todate) it just wasnt good. There are no great guitar solos like on good charlotte or Simple plan. All I hear is Brian Wilson whining about love for 50 minutes backed by background music you would feel embarrased to listen to. This isn't real talent, real musical talent is 50 cent, Jessica Simpson, Good Charlotte, that's real music. This? I dont know what it is.
B00003CX9E|2.0|I bought this DVD thinking the Re-master would be good.<br /><br />Unfortunately it's NOT.<br /><br />There are scenes where debris (string, hair, something?) shows up at the bottom of the picture (usually lower left).<br /><br />I bought this from Borders so I'm pretty sure it's legit. You would think that people in charge of re-mastering Citizen Kane would take  better care in the transfer. If I could notice it, well anybody could.<br /><br />On top of that it seems cloudy throughout the picture.<br /><br />As I understand it Lowry (Now owned by Dolby Digital) did the transfer.<br /><br />For what many belive the greatest picture of the 20th century I'm greatly dissapointed.<br /><br />Citizen Kane is a GREAT film. Too bad they did'nt take the time to actually WATCH what they produced and make sure crap did'nt show up in the film
B000AADYRQ|2.0|I'm disappointed, but not as much as I would've been if they'd stuck with Barsuk records and still put \\"Plans\\" out. I was warned ahead of time, when they announced the switch of labels, that there was a 50/50 chance I wouldn't like the new stuff. Sure, it may be cliche to think that major label= crap, but it's usually true. A switch to a major label can't make a great band like Death Cab totally awful, and there's some good moments on \\"Plans\\", but there aren't enough, and I don't think that is so much the fault of Atlantic records as the \\"fault\\" of the band wanting to move into a more mainstream direction. In \\"Plans\\", it's pretty clear to discern two things: they're trying to recreate the popular songs from \\"Transatlanticism\\", which was already a more commercial album than they'd ever done before, and they're trying to borrow a lot from Gibbard's side project \\"The Postal Service\\", which has had much better commercial and radio success than any Death Cab record. I think it's clear to see that Death Cab want to broaden their fanbase, and it's the first thing I hear on \\"Plans\\". To be fair, it would have most likely happened regardless of what label they were on, but I'm sad that it did because Plans is the poorest release they've come out with, ever. The only good songs to me are \\"Summer Skin\\" and \\"Soul Meets Body\\", which Atlantic pays every station so much money to play HOURLY that I can't even stand the opening chords anymore- way overplayed. <br /> <br />I guess all in all, Death Cab has put out more great albums in a row than most bands do in their whole career, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and wait for the next one. In the meantime, I won't be buying this one- I'm not paying 20 bucks to feed the greed of The Man. Giving money to Barsuk was my pleasure, giving 10 cents to Death Cab and the rest to Atlantic isn't my idea of a good investment.
B00002MZ4W|4.0|I can't say I'm the biggest Fiona Apple fan in the world, because she is a bit of an acquired taste for some, but her second album really impresses much as her debut record did. When you see her on t.v you don't expect the deep husky, soulful and sometimes angry voice to spring forth from such a slender young woman, but Fiona's talent will assure her a record deal as long as she wants to keep making records. Her music may not be typical \\"radio\\" friendly music, but for music lovers who appreciate good lyrics,good vocals and carefully crafted arrangements and songs, this artist is one to keep an ear out for!
B000B7BRMM|4.0|Christmas discs are often funny things. Many holiday offerings sound as though the artist hurridly thew together twelve or thirteen Christmas classics, put a pedestrian arrangement behind them and put it all together just in time for that artists loyal fan base to purchase en masse. Sadly, most Christmas releases sound somehwat contrived and present little more then an opportunity for us to seperate ourselves from our hard-earned dollar. There's many of these ill-conceived discs out there but I'll let you, dear music lover, decide which ones make the grade or not.    As to Diana Krall's holiday disc \\" Christmas Songs \\" I, for one, am convinced that while its not exactly the classic in the mode of Nat King Cole's magical holidays discs or even the Carpenters exquisite X-Mas offerings this still equates into one fine listening experience and one that will stay in my stereo through-out the upcoming Christmas season. If you, like I, thoroughly enjoyed Diana's \\" When I Look Into Your Eyes \\" then you are in for one immensely pleasurable listening experience. The same smooth, sultry vocals that graced that wonderful cd are the very same that will be found here. Ms. Krall's vocals, always languid and as supple as a fine glass of wine, are in rare form and she manages to carress many of these tracks to absolute perfection. Her sexy rendition of \\" The Christmas Song \\" may be worth the price of admission alone but there are other treasures to be found here. \\" I'll Be Home For Christmas \\" and \\" Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas \\" are all done in a rather sumptuous, relaxed manner that while many might find a little too slow is for this listener simply devine and excrutiatingly soulfull. Indeed when Diana sings \\" What Are You Doing News Years Eve? \\" I truly wanted to yell at my stereo, \\" Nothing! Call me!! \\" but I was on my best behavior and I suspect the Mrs. may not have seen the humour in that particular moment. Anyway, this truly is a wonderful disc and if your as traditional about Christmas music as I am and feel that listening to a beautiful woman sing beautiful songs never go out of style then this is a cd with you in mind. Adding of course to the fact that Tommy Li Puma, who produced this treasure, more then knows his way around a studio and is able to bring out the best that Ms. Krall has to offer. So pour two glasses of wine, light the fireplace, and take the phone off the hook. A wonderful, intimate way to spend the evening with a good friend.    By the way I am curious as to many previous reviewers claim of the cover of this fine disc to be inappropriate. As for me I truly do not understand their concerns. The cover, with Ms. Krall laying languidly in a chair, wearing what looks to be an evening gown and legs partially spread, I feel, completely represents what type of music can be found when purchasing this cd. I feel the cover photo is truly gorgeous, tastefully done and in fact rather alluring. In fact the back photograph of Ms. Krall wearing a red evening gown, staring back coyly at the camera is absolutely mesmorizing and shows what a stunning woman she truly is. Sorry folks but I simply cannot find fault with any of the afore-mentioned pictures of Ms. Krall and her 'come hither' poses. This, for me, is one of those times when the cover of the disc and the contents inside co-incide exactly. I suspect some would prefer a parental advisory sticker on the cover. Hve a glass of egg nog, relax and enjoy the disc.
0451156447|5.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's, a book by Truman Capote, is a short novel that is very well-written.  The book consists of four short stories, and although the plot of the four stories have nothing in common with one another, they are tied together by a central theme.  Capote also demonstrates superb use of symbolism throughout his book.<br /><br /> The main idea of each short story revolves around the loss of someone or something loved.  The first story, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's,\\" is about two close friends, but after a series of dramatic events are forced to leave each other forever.  \\"House of Flowers\\" tells of Ottilie, a girl who chooses to leave her rich, easy life and marries to a poor boy who works in the fields.  In \\"A Diamond Guitar,\\" one friend betrays the other, leaving Mr. Schaeffer watching \\"the face of his friend, suspended above him...it was so distant, judging.\\"  And finally, \\"A Christmas Memory,\\" is perhaps the saddest of all four stories.  Here, two lifelong friends who have spent every Christmas together, eventually grow apart due to a sudden change in lifestyles.  Capote says that loss is something all must endure, and the only way to deal with a loss is to grow from it.<br /><br /> The author relies on symbolism to bring more life to his stories, and no doubt he uses this element well.  For example, the Houngan in \\"House of Flowers\\" explains to Ottilie that if she catches a wild bee and it \\"does not sting, then [she] will know [she has] found love.\\"  The bee represents Ottilie's heart, something wild and free.  Yet if she allows herself to be tamed, then she will find true love.  It is instances like this that make Capote's stories timeless.<br /><br /> Capote engages the reader's attention in each story.  His language is simple, and the reader never becomes bored with what he has to tell. But perhaps what brings his book together is the message he communicates: loss of love is unavoidable, and by overcoming it comes learning and knowledge that love willcome again.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I still can't believe this movie was even made.  After all, Serenity is the follow-up to a failed TV show from 2002 that lasted only 11 episodes on FOX.  Sure the DVD sales for the complete series of Firefly have been amazing, but that is no indicator of how a movie will do.  Yet, Universal Pictures took a chance and bought the movie rights from FOX.  Reassembling the original cast and creator, they made the hopes and dreams of Browncoats (Firefly fans) everywhere.  The series left many questions unanswered (supposedly, creator Joss Whedon planned out seven years of storylines for the show), and fans saw this movie as not only a way to get answers for their questions, but it was a way to revisit the Firefly universe and its beloved characters.  You see, it's not just the stories that made Firefly a great show, it was also the amazing cast.  People genuinely cared for the characters, and being able to see them again was, as I said, a dream come true.  Six months after the series finale of Firefly, things have only gotten worse on the firefly-class transport ship Serenity.  Due to the overbearing government, known as the Alliance, work is becoming harder and harder to come by for petty thieves like Capt. Malcolm \\"Mal\\" Reynolds (Nathan Fillion) and his crew.  This is causing the ship to fall into further disrepair, despite the best efforts of their gifted mechanic, Kaylee Frye (Jewel Staite), and makes flying the ship more and more difficult for skilled pilot Hoban \\"Wash\\" Washburn (Alan Tudyk).  Meanwhile, former crew members Inara Serra (Morena Baccarin), a registered companion (read: prostitute), and Sheperd Deria Book (Ron Glass) have left the ship for reasons that, while differnt, both involve Mal.  Furthermore, fugitive siblings Simon (Sean Maher) and River Tam (Summer Glau) are still wanted by the Alliance, and the government is getting desperate.  They have recently enlisted one of their nameless, rankless officers, known only as The Operative (Chiwetel Ejiofor)to bring in River Tam.  The Operative is simultaneously a ruthless killing machine, skilled in all types of combat and strategy, and an articulate orator who deeply believes in the possibility of a world without sin.  While The Operative hunts down Serenity, Mal has decided to take River along with himself, Zoe Warren (Gina Torres), his first mate and wife to Wash, and Jayne Cobb (Adam Baldwin) on their missions/jobs due to her ability to psychically read the thoughts of others.  Simon disapproves of this, fearing that she will somehow get hurt or caught.  Despite a good performance by River, Simon becomes enraged after the crew narrowly escapes an attack by Reavers (cannibalistic madmen) while on the mission, and decides that he and River are going to leave the ship and find a new transport.  Of course, things don't always go as planned on Serenity, and when the crew discovers one of River's latent abilities, they are forced to keep her onboard.  Everything about this movie, in my opinion, goes well above and beyond any expectations I may have had prior to seeing it.  As usual, Joss Whedon delivers his trademark witty dialogue and (more importantly) an amazing plot.  A good amount of our questions from the series are not only answered, but answered superbly.  I never would have guessed at what really happened, and yet it makes sense and is truly a revelation.  Other questions were left unanswered, to be addressed in later movies (which unfortunately, as of right, now doesn't look like a possibility).  And while the level of character development isn't as good as it was in the series, this is a two-hour movie; there is only so much time to devote to each aspect (such as plot, action, and development).  Whedon has said that the film is pretty much season 2 of the series crammed into two hours.  He had to take out a lot of character stuff (such as a relationship between Mal and Inara) in order to tell us River's story.  Furthermore, the actors all do phenominal jobs.No one in the movie is on Hollywood's A-list, but I almost prefer it that way.  The original cast obviously have great chemistry together, and it is clear that they are all happy to be back.  Meanwhile, newcomers like Ejiofor and David Krumholtz give very solid performances as well (although Krumholtz's Mr. Universe is a bit of a silly character).  For a film that was only made for about $40 million, the special effects look great.  With few exceptions (such as few shots in the chase scene near the beginning), the effects look seamless.  The ending battle is one of my favorite space battles in movie history, and yes, I have seen the original Star Wars trilogy.  All in all, this is an amazing film.  I can't understand how it didn't take off.  It was supposed to be a sleeper hit, with word-of-mouth as its primary proponent.  For some reason, despite rave reviews from both mainstream and non-mainstream critics in addition to support from both old and new fans, the general movie-going public was very apathetic towards Serenity.  Sadly, a lot of people missed out on one of the year's best films.  Hopefully, the DVD* will win over all those people who didn't want to pay $10 for a ticket (so worth it).  Find Serenity, for there is no place that you can be once you find it.  They'll never take the skies from us.    *Speaking of DVDs, I'm really afraid that Universal is going to release a multi-disc super special edition sometime down the line.  While I'd love one, I'd prefer for them to release it now.
B0007XT87G|2.0|This was the worst peace of plastic i have ever bought. The first time I listened to it , I only heard the first track...which at the time sounded promising. Now that i had to erase it off my computer (every time it came on i was wondering, \\"what is this crap\\") I feel robbed. Makes me almost wish I downloaded music as opposed to buying it. <br /> <br />It's pretty sad when I have such an appreciation for music and this can't find a place to in my collection. Please carefully consider reviews before you support this group. It seems like this band has some fairly good support @ amazon, maybe I am just too old that i still enjoy for depth and musicianship in my music.

B000AADYRQ|3.0|Okay, Transatlanticism was poppy, and it was good. But Plans goes a little too far. It sounds like they are maturing as adults with their music or just selling out to a popular sound. I do enjoy songs like \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\", \\"Soul Meets Body\\", \\"Summer Skin\\", \\"Different Names for the Same Thing\\", \\"I'll Follow You Into The Dark\\", \\"Your Heart Is An Empty Room\\", \\"What Sarah Said\\", \\"Brothers on a Hotel Bed\\", \\"Stable Song\\", which is basically all the songs but \\"Crooked Teeth\\" and \\"Someday You Will Be Loved\\" which are two songs that really crossed the line into Pop. <br /> <br />The songs on this album are a lot less creative effect wise, and sticks to the more traditional Acoustic Guitar, Bass, Drums, And Piano. Of course they still have some neat stuff to listen for hidden under music in the album, but I still go back to taking the Pop thing too far. <br /> <br />The song \\"Stable Song\\" is actually one of their old songs \\"Stability\\", but just popified. I do enjoy Stable Song but I recommend going out and buying the Stability EP and hearing what Death Cab used to be like a couple years ago. Still isn't \\"Something About Airplanes\\" material, but good. <br /> <br />Overall this album is fair, it is more or less an everyday GOOD pop album. That's all.
B00065MDSG|5.0|Once again, King Crimson shifted lineups, only this time it was far more dramatic-- after having toured without lyricist Peter Sinfield, the entire band left, leaving Fripp on his own. A blessing in disguise, the band that assembled for this recording was full of such musical muscle and subtlety that they were able to turn out what may be the best of the King Crimson material (its a tough call, there's a number of stunning albums by them). This is also the first Crimson formation not to feature a saxaphone. Joining Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron) are David Cross (violin, viola, mellotron), John Wetton (bass, vocals), Bill Bruford (drum kit), and Jamie Muir (percussion). Lyrics this time were handled by Richard Palmer-James-- getting away from the imagery of Peter Sinfield allowed the band's songs to flourish in different fashions. <br /> <br />But also allowing the band to flourish is the delicate balance they created-- Muir as a percussionist would play everything from mouth harps, thumb pianos, and chains slamming against gongs created his own dynamics without the influence of everyone else, likewise Bill Bruford at the kit could manage both power and subtlety, whereas Cross' violin and Wetton's bass were in opposition, both in register and in expressiveness-- Wetton is a brutally aggressive bass player. Fripp somehow counterbalanced all of this. <br /> <br />In many ways, this is also the band shedding their progressive rock leanings in terms of the traditional \\"prog\\" sound-- there's not the emphasis on harmonied instruments, mellotrons, etc. The approach is a lot cleaner and in many ways far less limiting. <br /> <br />A couple of the tracks here have their origins in the past-- the album opener, \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\\" (themes of which showed up in Crimson improvs from Fripp's guitar in '71/'72), is a signal of the future, from its delicate intro percussion, aggressive violin lines, and explosive guitar riffing, this clearly illustrates something else is happening here. Dynamically challenging, musically complex, and capable of both directness and subtlety, the piece is a sign of brilliance to unfold, both on this and throughout the album. Structurally, its looser than any of the previous instrumental Crimson material, when you want a musician to explode, he does. Also developed from older material is \\"Exiles\\"-- the opening theme was originally performed by the '69 band live as \\"Mantra\\". Both this and \\"Book of Saturday\\" are the ballads on the record-- \\"Book of Saturday\\" illustrates the softer side of the band, pretty violin figures and delicate guitar are the highlights of this piece. \\"Exiles\\", having its old origins, has a slightly older feel to it, almost similar in content to \\"Epitaph\\" or \\"The Court of the Crimson King\\", the piece has a more timeless quality to it brought about by the use of the mellotron as a highlight rather than a driving force. Wetton's voice is full of passion that was too often missing in the earlier band. <br /> <br />The second half of the album, as though to underplay the dynamic complexity and delicacy of the first half, is aggressive-- the band assumes a muscular stance right away with the obnoxious and stunning riff on \\"Easy Money\\"-- Wetton sings largely unaccompanied but the band falls upon themselves with a furious nature. A laughing box fades and \\"The Talking Drum\\" begins-- quiet a first, then building a repeated bass figure under which percussion work thrives, a soaring, aggressive, almost insistent violin lead bleeds into sustained guitar phrases from Fripp until almost like the train hitting the breaks-- the squeal arrives, and the piece transforms into the mighty \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\\". Probably the highlight of the album, Larks 2 is a driving and insistent guitar riff in 9, phrases that turn each other around, and an explosive bridge, the piece boils over and is pure magic. <br /> <br />For fans of unique and powerful music, look no further, this album is genius. Probably difficult to get into if you're not ready for it, but without a doubt some of the most stunning rock music ever recorded.

B00065MDSQ|5.0|\\"Red\\", in many ways, is the definitive King Crimson album and statement, the song itself as much as the album. The closing statement by the '70s Crimson, \\"Red\\", came after much struggle and turmoil within the band, and the recording sessions would be the straw that broke the camel's back-- the band, by this point consisting only of Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), John Wetton (bass, vocals), and Bill Bruford (percussion), further augmented by another melody player on most tracks, fell apart compeletely.<br /><br />The album opens on a dark note-- the title track, an instrumental masterpiece composed by Fripp and generally regarded as one of the great statements of the band, lives up its reputation. Powerful, dark, and with a haunting bridge, it grabs hold and pulls the listener with it. Unlike previous Crimson albums, when the mood evolved, a state of darkness remains on this one-- \\"Fallen Angel\\", alternating between ballad form verses (featuring some totally stunning guitar work from Fripp) melts into a dark chorus (featuring a riff Fripp first tossed around in an improv when this band first came together) where several layers of guitars are added together with a positively haunting cornet solo by Mark Charig on top of all of it. The piece shows how far this band has come-- the musicians are pretty much psychic in their playing, and Wetton's vocal resonates a condidence he's never displayed.<br /><br />Speaking of confident delivery, on \\"One More Red Nightmare\\", Wetton sings the piece, which runs at a breakneck pace, flawlessly. One of my complaints on the previous record was that his vocal sounded rushed, here again completely self-assured, there's no rushing. The piece also features jaw-dropping drumming from Bill Bruford and a monster sax solo courtesy of former band member Ian McDonald. The track that follows, \\"Providence\\", is actually a live improv from the city of the same name and as such, David Cross performs on violin. Remarkably, its the closest thing to a light moment on the album, which is to say it isn't as dark as the rest of the album. It still has an air of mystery about it and builds, but to my ears, never quite amounts to much.<br /><br />The album's closer is probably the most stunning, \\"Starless\\", a piece in two movements. The first is a mellotron-string driven ballad with brilliant liquid-tone guitar playing from Fripp, a lovely soprano sax solo from former Crim Mel Collins, and a passioned vocal from John Wetton. This melts into a building section, highlighting Bruford's percussion again as Fripp plays repeated figures over and over again until the guitar and distorted bass echo each other and the piece explodes-- McDonald plays another brilliant alto solo, full of fire and passion before the two saxes restate the theme and the piece erupts like never before and comes to a conclusion. Its one of those magic moments on record, definitely a moment of pure brilliance.<br /><br />This was unfortunately the last work of the '70s band-- McDonald was supposed to rejoin, but in a surprising move (given band history), Fripp left, which effectively ended Crimson for a further six years.<br /><br />This album is another candidate for \\"the\\" Crimson masterpiece-- I don't think its quite as good as \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\", but it is much more digestable.

B0002VKZL6|5.0|I agree with many reviewers that it takes some listening to really appreciate this album (only 2 or 3 times in my case, though). I find it great, soothing but not superficial...easy listening but not cheap... <br />And I think \\"Postcards from Paraguay\\" is simply delicious! It seems Mark Knopfler is having fun, and it shows. <br />
B00064WSNW|5.0|Several years after the band broke up, Robert Fripp resurrected King Crimson, but in a way no one would have expected. Returning was drummer Bill Bruford, and joining was bassist/stickist/backing vocalist Tony Levin and one of the few who could stand next to Robert Fripp holding his chosen instrument and not look inept, guitarist/vocalist Adrian Belew. Originally a band called Discipline, Fripp realized this was King Crimson and renamed the band. Wrapped in a red sleeve with a Celtic knot on the cover, this album is in many ways as the cover implies-- intertwining and interlocking-- Fripp and Belew's guitars play complex lines that live with each other and don't stand without each other, supported by Levin's thunderous bass and melody vs. countermelody playing on the stick. Below all of this, Bruford is easily holding it all together. The album is one of the true greats of its era, and is certainly among the best Crimson has ever recorded. <br /> <br />From the opener, \\"Elephant Talk\\", you know you're in for something different-- Levin's melody/countermelody intro overlayed with two intertwined guitars, elephant squeals on guitar, a half-spoken vocal, and two bizarre guitar solos. Five minutes later, you're overwhelmed, what's amazing is that its got a groove, its a great rhythm, its just plain amazing. <br /> <br />The rest of the album pretty much follows suit in terms of being brilliant to the point of overwhelming while the environment and the mood changes-- interlocking guitars rule several of the songs (the breathtaking \\"Frame By Frame\\", with impassioned vocals and some of the fastest guitar licks you'll ever hear, the frantic \\"Thela Hun Ginjeet\\", and the title track-- an instrumental where you can really hear Fripp and Belew get into a groove). These are offset by a couple great ballads (\\"Matte Kudasai\\", with its beautiful slide guitar seagulls and an almost lazy feel to the vocal, \\"The Sheltering Sky\\", featuring a horn-toned Fripp guitar melody). In the middle of all of this is a piece that sounds like it would fit the last generation of Crimson better-- \\"Indiscipline\\". Building tension until the release-- an explosion of guitar pyrotechnics and a blazing solo that almost seems out of place here, but works. <br /> <br />Something of note-- this is NOT a progressive rock album (in terms of the genre)-- in fact, its got more in common with new wave acts like the Talking Heads and the Police than it does with Yes and early Genesis. One of the reasons why I love Crimson so much is unlike many of those other progressive rock bands, they didn't stand still, they grew and changed and became something else over time. <br /> <br />Bottom line though-- this is one of the greats, highly recommended.

B00064WSNM|3.0|After an album as brilliant as the stunning \\"Larks' Tongues in Aspic\\", the pressure was on Crimson to turn out something else of that level of quality. Having toured for quite a while after the departure of percussionist Jamie Muir, Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), David Cross (violin, viola, mellotron), John Wetton (bass, vocal), and Bill Bruford (drums, percussion) were a tight unit. Specializing live in improvization, this album was in fact largely culled from a live show-- in fact, five of the tracks on here were culled from a live show from '73, then edited to remove crowd noise and overdubbed as necessary. What's amazing is that you'd be hard pressed to tell whats improv and whats composed, what was recorded soley in the studio, what was live. <br /> <br />Opening with blazing rock number, \\"The Great Deceiver\\", a great vocal piece which churns and spins in a circular figure before melting into the verses and coming back again. Really, its one of the more unique Crimson pieces, features some great playing, in paticular from Fripp and Bruford. This cuts off after a Fripp guitar figure and \\"Lament\\" begins, soft, melodic, then explosive, although somewhat flawed in my ears-- Wetton's vocal, while passionate during the slower sections, feels a bit rushed during the faster ones. Still, during the slower portions, there's a delicate beauty, interplya between Cross and Fripp with some really great bass figures below it. Its interesting to note that this one got its start as part of improvs by Fripp in '71/'72 touring with the previous Crimson band. While discussing vocal tracks, I'll also now bring up \\"The Night Watch\\", a really amazing ballad, in many ways the \\"Exiles\\" of this album, although it stands on its own. A piece of delicate beauty, again I feel Wetton's vocals are a bit rushed at times, but its a really beautiful song featuring one of the most mangificant and beautiful solos of Fripp's career. The final vocal piece, \\"The Mincer\\", is one I've never gotten into-- it starts off decent enough, a churning instrumental with a driving beat, but like \\"We'll Let You Know\\", it just seems to end too abruptly. <br /> <br />Of the instrumental tracks, all but \\"Fracture\\" are improvs, although only \\"We'll Let You Know\\" feels like it-- featuring a more fusiony feel-- Fripp pulls in sounds and directions that his contemporaries working with Miles Davis were moving-- his playing is also totally liberating from virtually any expectation of guitar playing, its really stunning, but there's a general feeling of disunity in the song that keeps it from holding together-- Fripp and Wetton never seem to actually sync up to my ears until the piece basically ends abruptly.. \\"Trio\\" is the exact opposite, however-- an improv with Bruford choosing to sit out, the three remaining Crims turn out a delicate, soft little piece-- Wetton sticks in the upper register of his instrument, Fripp and Cross keep things sweet, its really an amazing piece. \\"Starless and Bible Black\\" (NOT to be confused with the song \\"Starless\\" that features that phrase in its lyrics) is overlong and slow to develop-- as improvs go, its good enough, but on record, it drags a bit. <br /> <br />Finally, there's the closing instrumental, \\"Fracture\\". A guitar player's nightmare, this one features the most complicated and stunning guitar playing from Fripp-- its roughly as it was played live, with no noticable overdubs, yet it sounds at times as though there's three guitar lines moving at once. Its certainly one of the high points in Fripp's catalog in terms of guitar work. <br /> <br />\\"Starless and Bible Black\\" is a good album, but it was made in a hurry and it shows.
015626224X|5.0|`Down and Out in Paris and London' by the noted English essayist and political writer, George Orwell is possibly his third best known work, overshadowed by his much more famous two fictional works, `1984' and `Animal Farm'. For the three readers who may not be familiar with the celebrity of these two works, they are among the few books which budding high school intellectuals feel compelled to read entirely on their own, independent of any class assignments. Since both are fictional, nigh onto fantastical treatments of Marxism and Marxists in the Soviet Union, and since I have not been in contact with high scholars in many a year, I'm not sure if these books are still `must reading' along with `Lord of the Flies', `Catch-22', and `Catcher in the Rye', but I suspect they are still powerful influences on any intellectuals over 35 years old.<br /><br />This work gives little insight into what lead Orwell to write his two greatest works. Instead, it gives great insight into at least two currently interesting subjects.<br /><br />The first is an accurate picture of the life of people who have no money. It is especially telling on the fact that having no money means, among other things, that your chances of getting any work whatsoever, let alone something paying a decent wage, are practically nil. And, while the book was written in the early 1930s, the author's observations about this state of affairs is probably as true today in the United States as is was seventy years ago in Europe.<br /><br />The second is a picture of life and work behind the scenes at a major Paris hotel and restaurant. While I have known of this long essay ever since high school, I was never prompted to read it until recently when my reading of culinary literature brought me to a reference to Orwell's work as a really different take on behind-the-scenes culinary life.<br /><br />It is probably worth tempering Orwell's observations on culinary establishments with the fact that they were made during the early days of the worldwide economic depression and before the great interest in fine dining in France pioneered by Ferdinand Point in the 1930s and fuelled by the change in the Michelin guide to French restaurants in 1933 to reporting stars on quality of food and service rather than on only price. But, for the culinary historian, the look behind the scenes at the filth and total disregard for sanitation just beyond the swinging doors leading into the kitchen is an eye opener. Actually, filth, insects, and disease among the poor is the most common theme running through all of Orwell's narrative.<br /><br />The author says little about what put him in these circumstances and what it was which lifted him out of his poverty at the end. I am certain he did not put himself there simply to gather material for this book. Rather, the experience lent itself so well to the long essay that you almost think the experience was self-inflicted. George Orwell (a pseudonym for Eric Blair) was being paid a small amount for newspaper columns at the time this period of poverty. He survived it for a few months in Paris by gaining work as a `plongeur', the very lowest cast of French restaurant worker, roughly comparable to busboy, and even lower, if that is possible, than dishwasher.<br /><br />It is impossible to better summarize Orwell's experiences than to quote his own last paragraph:<br /><br />`...I can point to one or two things I have definitely learned by being hard up. I shall never again think that all tramps are drunken scoundrels, nor expect a beggar to be grateful when I give him a penny, nor be surprised if men out of work lack energy, nor subscribe to the Salvation Army, nor pawn my clothes, nor refuse a handbill, nor enjoy a meal in a smart restaurant.'<br /><br />I am very happy to have read this, and recommend it to anyone who has a taste for culinary lore. And, I will seek out Orwell's other writings, especially those relating to the Spanish Civil War.he early days of the worldwide economic depression and before the great interest in fine dining in France pioneered by Ferdinand Point in the 1930s and fuelled by the change in the Michelin guide to French restaurants in 1933 to reporting stars on quality of food and service rather than on only price.

B00065MDS6|1.0|Of all the Crimson albums, \\"Lizard\\" is in my assessment, the worst. I may not be the best judge for the record, I'm not a huge fan of the \\"progressive rock\\" sound, and all of all the Crimson albums, this one comes closest to that, at least in form. I'm not entirely certain why this album is generally so well received, I've never been able to enjoy it. <br /> <br />Robert Fripp (guitar, mellotron), now abandoned by all the other band founders except lyricist Peter Sinfield, was building a band from the ground up. Reedman Mel Collins had joined the band last album, and joining this album was bassist/vocalist Gordon Haskell and drummer Andy McCulloch. This would be the shortest lived of Crimson bands-- the recording sessions were evidentally a nightmare and Haskell and McCulloch left shortly afterwards. <br /> <br />But for the recordings, augmented by monster pianist Keith Tippett and several members of his band (double reed player Robin Miller, cornetist Mark Cherig, trombonist Nick Evans) and Yes' Jon Anderson on vocals for one piece, this was the ensemble. The album itself is really so well constructed that it fails miserably-- Fripp appears to have meticulously orchestrated everything, and thi time included a long-form suite on the second side that fails to sustain any interest. <br /> <br />The first side is actually decent enough, opening with a loud/soft jaunty piece called \\"Cirkus\\" with quite a bit of unusual transitions, some brilliant acoustic guitar playing from Fripp, a delicate soprano sax solo from Collins, Michael Giles-clone drumming from McCulloch, but unfortunately a lifeless and flat vocal delivery from Haskell. \\"Indoor Games\\" and \\"Happy FamilY\\" (the latter about the Beatles) are both somewhat dull and uninspired, in both composition and performance, but they show progress in a fresh direction, a sort of off-kilter pop music, and \\"Indoor Games\\" begins to illustrate the sort of disjoint guitar playing Fripp would come to excel at. \\"Lady of the Dancing Water\\", the latest in a series of Crimson ballads is a pretty enough song, but the form is growing tired from my perspective for the band-- they've tread the sort of ground this song covers a number of times. It doesn't help that the production on this one is totally bizarre-- the vocal sounds like its in a different room than the rest of the song. <br /> <br />The second side is one of those long, self-indulgent progressive rock suites you hear about. The opening section, featuring Jon Anderson on vocals, alternates between a sort of neoclassical with pop vocals and overdone folk. \\"Bolero\\", the second movement, is actually quite nice-- featuring great horn playing, its really a superb piece, if somewhat out of place in Crimson's catalog. It actually has both the sound and feel of a Mingus composition in my ears, with some great swinging horns and that sort of chamber meets jazz feel Mingus excelled at. The suite completely turns at this point-- Haskell's vocal delivery on the third movement is just awful, and eventually the song turns into a horn workout which is decent enough. But overall, the piece is overlong and feels it-- it just doesn't work and Fripp wisely abandoned the suite form. <br /> <br />For Crimson fans, completionists, and maybe the occasional prog fan who likes this kind of stuff.
B0000A12BL|1.0|yeah, its true about the extra fade out minute ending on \\"package\\", but the import version is also copy protected. this cd cannot be played on real media player, real juke box, real player, or itunes. WHICH MEANS THIS CD CANNOT BE PUT INTO YOUR IPOD. the cd and the cd case has copy contoled logo stamps all over it too... cd only recomended to people who listen to their music using a cd player or stereo. also, the extra minute isnt worth the extra $20 you should rather be spending supporting a artist/record label that doesn't put anti-computer playback on there cd's.

0743265289|5.0|The Kaplan GMAT 800 book is a great study guide in tandem with the 11th Edition (or 10th) Official GMAT Guide.  DO NOT RELY SOLELY on this book. The GMAT 800 book does indeed do what it promises to - offer more difficult level questions. However, don't be mistaken into thinking that practicing and getting all hard level questions right automatically means getting a 700+ on the real GMAT.  The GMAT format is ADAPTIVE, which means that you start out with medium (and easy) level questions which progress if you continue to improve.   <br /> <br />Although working on GMAT 800 questions trains your brain to work through more challenging questions on the real GMAT, students might start to miss the short cuts that are available to many answers near the beginning of the real GMAT. Additionally, students who have an issue with consistency will face great problems if they only work with hard questions. Hard questions force you to double-check, easy questions is a killer for many test-takers because they forget to double-check the most simplest of questions (which causes them to get questions wrong in the beginning of the test - subsequently, they won't even get to the more difficult questions no matter how much they prepared for them). <br /> <br /> <br />This book should be for students who consistently get 80-90% above accuracy in the Official Guide. The Official Guide is definitely easier than the real test for 600+ scorers. So if you practice the Official book for accuracy and timing, and the GMAT 800 book for challenge sets, you will be in a good position to do well on the test.   Additionally, if you are self-preparing (which I assume many of the readers here are), you want to get one of the more \\"normal\\" level guides from either Kaplan or Princeton Review to lay the foundation for the basic strategy.   <br /> <br />Full Disclaimer:  <br />I oversee a test preparation center located in Hong Kong (Capstone Prep), and part of our job is to make sure our courses are updatedand presented to the best and most stringet of standards.  To that effect, I filter through nearly all test prep books in the market (for the SAT, GMAT, LSAT, GRE and TOEFL).  We have on affiliations with Kaplan or Princeton Review, in fact, they are our competitors here. However, their guides are great resources for those that wish to go at the exams alone. <br /> <br />

B00000255F|5.0|1975 is without a doubt in my opinion the most pivotal and watershed year in Rock and Roll history. It was a year the genre turned the corner just while the disco era was about to emerge that same year. It was also the year old artists from the 60's (The Four Seasons and Manfred Mann) and new artists that came out that year (Fleetwood Mac, Patti Smith, Heart) combined to create new blood on the airwaves. But there was only one artist from that year that stood from all others: That man was Bruce Springsteen. His album: BORN TO RUN.<br /><br /> There is no question his album defied the year just like Dylan's albums \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\" and \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" defied 1965, The Beatles' \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" defied 1967, The Who's \\"Tommy\\" defied 1969, Carole King's \\"Tapesty\\" defied 1971, Fleetwood Mac's \\"Rumours\\" defied 1977, Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\" defied 1983, and Nirvana's \\"Nevermind\\" defied 1991. I listened to the entire album of \\"Born to Run\\" a while ago and even though there are only eight songs, it feels like twenty (which is want The Boss did when he recorded \\"The River\\" five years later).<br /><br /> To close it out, Springsteen appeared on the covers of Newsweek and Time in the same week. How many artists from that year can make that same claim? (Unless you consider Elton John; who did appear on the cover of Time that year, but never on Newsweek) When I saw the photos of The Boss in those magazines, I shook my head and said to myself, 'Yes, this is what greatness is all about.' \\"Born to Run\\" is one of those one-in-a-lifetime deals.
0671027344|3.0|Even though I have a bit of a penchant for the coming-of-age genre, it's unlikely I would have picked this debut novel up had it not been selected for my book club to read. That said, it's one of those paradoxical books that isn't objectively all that great, and yet managed to provoke fairly strong reaction in everyone I know who read it, and was a great springboard for conversation. As I later discovered, it's a very controversial book in that it's made its way onto assigned reading lists at high schools around the country, while also being one of perennially the most \\"challenged\\", according to the American Library Association. The story is told by Charlie, a 15-year-old boy starting his freshman year of high school in some medium-sized Pennsylvania city. From the very beginning, the reader learns he's got a whole host of issues, including the recent suicide of his only friend, and a recent spell at a mental facility following the death of a beloved aunt. The book takes the form of letters he writes to an unnamed person as a form of self-therapy. Presumably the format is intended to draw the reader into Charlie's world, to make the reader the confidante, but it's somewhat clumsily executed. From a stylistic standpoint, the letters often lapse into verbatim dialogue found in novels (and never in letters), and one suspects Chbosky would have been better off just writing it as a straight first-person novel.<br /><br />In any event, soon after school starts and it's established that Charlie is utterly alone, he manages to befriend two seniors (a brother and sister). They cheerfully-and completely implausibly-take him under their wing and induct him into their established circle of \\"outsider\\" friends (the kind who go see Rocky Horror Picture Show every Friday). The likelihood of a group of relatively cool outsider seniors actively tanking in an utterly awkward freshman stretched credulity too far for everyone I know who's read the book. But you have to accept it to continue and soon, despite being the titular wallflower, he is well on his way to learning about the classic themes of sex, drugs, and rock and roll (although it's admittedly a bit of a stretch to call The Smiths rock and roll...). Much of the story revolves around how numb Charlie is to life, and his halting attempts to \\"participate\\" in life. Alas, his social skills are completely retarded, and while he is completely nice and full of love for his friends, his cluelessness to social norms continually confuses and thwarts him. And lurking behind all of this is some heavy duty emotional damage that has him always on the verge of bursting into tears, the underlying cause of which is revealed with a grand flourish at the end.<br /><br />The book moves right along at a rapid pace, however if one steps back at the end, one realizes that Charlie has managed to encounter almost every teen issue out there in a kind of smorgasbord of afterschool special issues. There's drug experimentation, sexual experimentation, homosexuality and homophobia, abusive relationships, teen pregnancy, bullying, suicide, depression, social ostracization, and so on-basically every coming-of-age topic is covered in the span of a school year. It all becomes a bit much, and Chbosky would have been much better served focusing on only a few of these instead of throwing the kitchen sink at Charlie.<br /><br />Charlie's account of all this is certainly likely to generate a great deal of empathy in certain kinds of readers (a number of people in my bookgroup reported having cried at times while reading it) and a certain degree of introspection on one's own teen years. However, elements of the story read strongly of author-fantasy, of being the kinds of things that Chbosky wishes had happened to him. For example, there's the cool Teach for America teacher who gives Charlie all these extra \\"advanced\\" books to read and eventually tells him that he's not just the most brilliant kid he's ever met, but he most brilliant person! And then there's Charlie's first kiss, set up in heart-rending perfection by the much older girl he's in love with, which reads like a textbook entry of what everyone in the whole world wishes their first kiss could have been.<br /><br />So, it's not a great book, there's a lot of really cheezy bits, and one has to suspend a great deal of disbelief. And yet Chbosky does manage to pull off some very nice and sometimes quite funny writing about family, friendship, and figuring oneself out. The sexual themes are perhaps more than many parents might feel comfortable with, and what's especially likely to worry parents is that no judgments are made. (Of course, if judgments were made, it's unlikely the intended audience of teens would respond particularly well to being spoon-fed what they should think and feel.) Still, it struck most people I know as a good book for generating discussion with their own kids at age 13 or 14.most brilliant person!

0446577383|5.0|The Camel Club is not your ordinary thriller . . . or your ordinary David Baldacci novel.  If you simply want the tried and true formula put together in the usual way, avoid this book.  If you want to expand your vision to see the silliness of politics and government as practiced now, The Camel Club will be your favorite thriller of 2005.<br /><br />The Camel Club takes the patriotic outsider's view of citizenship. As the Founding Fathers said so often, a government is as strong as its citizens' willingness to be intelligently active.<br /><br />The Camel Club is made up of four unlikely candidates for improving government.  Oliver Stone, a made-up name, is a cemetery caretaker by day who protests across from the White House at night.  Caleb Shaw is a bibliophile who dresses like a 19th century salesman.  Reuben Rhodes is a veteran who did some spying who's down on his luck, but is still a powerful hulk of a man at sixty.  Milton Farb is a genius who has obsessive-compulsive disorder which makes him quite unusual to be around.  They meet to find ways to track government wrongs and right them.<br /><br />As the book opens, the Camel Club members find their meeting is intruded upon by two thugs murdering someone . . . and making it look like suicide.  It's a scene reminiscent of the Vince Foster death.  The thugs spot the Camel Club and gun shots are fired.<br /><br />In a parallel thread, veteran Secret Service agent Alex Ford finds himself attracted to a lovely, young bartender who is a DOJ attorney by day.  To his surprise, she asks him out.<br /><br />In his day job, Ford finds himself partnered with an annoying rookie with friends in high places.  By a weird coincidence, Ford is assigned to investigate the death the Camel Club observed.<br /><br />In the background, someone is preparing the granddaddy of all terrorist attacks on U.S. government officials.<br /><br />As the story develops, you follow many different characters as narrators and plot threads until they all overlap in the book's second half.<br /><br />By the time you are done, you'll have a different perspective on how terrorism can attract attention and influence behavior.<br /><br />I liked this book very much.  I found several characters to be appealing and interesting.  That sympathy made the story work much better for me.  By contrast, in most thrillers the characters are barely made out of cardboard (comic book paper would be a better description).  Baldacci takes the time to develop several characters into reasonably identifiable human beings.  The plot relies on your sense of the characters as well as an intricate imagination to provide a lot of interesting surprises.  It's only in the last few pages that the book seems to settle down into the comfortable old formula.  One sequence there reminded me of the end of The Man with the Golden Gun.<br /><br />Beyond that, the book is very funny.  Baldacci knows how to make government pretensions seem to be about as ridiculous as possible.  At times I felt like I was reading a Jon Stewart script.<br /><br />Baldacci has also written a book that is very easy to visualize.  I found myself running a movie in my head as the action developed.  This will be a great film!<br /><br />As I finished the book, I found myself hoping that there will be more Camel Club books in the future.  These characters can go the distance to support a very entertaining and satirical look at government lunacy.<br /><br />Well done, David Baldacci!s and plot threads until they all overlap in the book's second half.   <br /> <br />By the time you are done, you'll have a different perspective on how terrorism can attract attention and influence behavior.   <br /> <br />I liked this book very much.

055357342X|5.0|I should mention that I'm not a fan of fantasy fiction, however I had been stuck in the serial killer genre and was looking for a change of pace.  The Game of Thrones was on sale for $3.99 and I thought what the heck, if I don't like it I'm only out 4 bucks. <br /> <br />Well, for the next month the read The Game of Thrones and The Clash of Kings straight through.  Thats about 2000 pages of book.  I took a little break and just started A Storm of Swords.   <br /> <br />I can't remember when I have ejoyed a story as much.  I love the way it's written in the differing POV of several characters.  Each one is both good and bad and there is no real hero in this tale.  The story twists and turns and what you thought you knew turns out to be false.  I'm sure everyone has their favorites, mine are Tyrion, Arya and Dany.  Heros die and new heros emerge.   <br /> <br />Will look forward to the next book and the one's there after. <br />
B00005JNJV|5.0|Batman Begins is a superb movie on so many levels.  It is a realistic action movie, one with a compelling and realistic storyline, that incorporates the comic book movie into a full fledged movie for everyone, leaving out the cheesy unrealistic characters.  The acting as well was very believable, with the characters not being overdone or getting into emotions and interactions that are out of place.  That Rachel couldn't be with Bruce is real, whereas other movies would have them be with each other.  That Bruce is looked down upon or does wondrous deeds for people and they don't even know it (\\"drunken billionaire burns his house down\\"), only draws you into his character and makes you feel for him.    Then, to top all of this off, it has a darker edge that is all too often left out for fear it would drive people away.  Not so in this movie as it enhanced the theatrical effects much more, making the movie that much more enthralling.    I can't say enough about this my favorite movie of the year.  A must see for everyone, even if you aren't typically entertained by comic book movies.  An action movie with a compelling storyline that draws you in, that is what you will get.  A definite recommend.

B00005B36H|2.0|Basically this sounds like Tool doing some rehashed versions of their previous songs with a boring squeaky clean production throughout which totally sucks the life out of this record.    There is no way this album can stand up alongside \\"Optiate\\" \\"Undertow\\" or \\"Aenima\\".
B00097DXZS|3.0|There's a few nice songs here. Steven Tyler makes the most of a lightweight tune and Bo Bice and Michelle Branch do well. But Carlos seems positively stuck in his Salsa roots and his guitar licks seem more and more routine. And please, you know your head is getting way too big when you write a song about yourself(Con Santana). Reuniting with Clive Davis may have helped sell a lot of CD's but artistically it has proven to be a huge mistake.
0385334206|3.0|I got hold of 'Breakfast' after reading 'Slaughterhouse', which impressed me, though I've found the prose style is not something a person can subject himself to at any great length without looking at his watch and wondering when the book will end. I was less impressed with Breakfast, though it was quite entertaining in parts. Some of the never-ending offshoots Vonnegut indulges in are interesting enough, but I believe he overdoes it. I also didn't like the way Vonnegut injects himself into the novel, more overtly as it progresses. I'm not sufficiently interested in Vonnegut as a person to be impressed - there was no real indication he is so remarkable a thinker that his presence was warranted. Some people seem to regard him as a genius, however, so if you're of that opinion you'd no doubt enjoy the glimpse into his background. <br /> <br />I also found the outsider's persective quite annoying at times, and condescending. For instance, we're told that Communism is the idea that people should share, which us silly humans (Americans in particular) naively rejected. Any elementary school student doing history could tell you Communism has created more death and pain than any other ideology. Was the purpose to shock us with such glibness? I don't know, but whatever it was, it backfired. At other times Vonnegut's musings from this simplistic outsider perspective were funny and interesting, if occasionally peurile. There was nothing astonishingly original or inventive about it, as I saw it, but I was entertained enough to keep going to the end. <br /> <br />I agree with reviewers who say there is not much literary substance to this book. It's light entertainment, and if you approach it that way, you're likely to enjoy it.
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City really did turn out to be a great comic book movie. The cinematography was great, the acting good and the storyline flowed, albeit in disjointed scenes, leaving you with the feeling that you got a complete picture.  <br /> <br />Through the adventures of a few misfits battling the ruling Roark family (the Senator and his son, as well as the Cardinal) we get a tale that is moving and fun. Through and through is the underlying moral of sacrifice, which isn't overdone, but instead firmly imbedded amidst the gory and violent encounters that are in practically every scene. The use of colors to accentuate characters and scenes is amazing, adding much to the storyline. <br /> <br />At times it can be looked at as unrealistic but, lets face it, it is a comic book movie, so suspend reality for 2 hours and let yourself be taken for a ride, that is if you don't mind watching a little violence. I would definitely recommend this to anyone.  <br />

First of all i must notice its line up. Its really an allstar band. One of the best thing has happened on instrumental progressive rock guitar Tony Macalpine,  Eddie Van Halen of bass Billy Sheehan, young genious Dave Weiner, polyryhmic master Virgil Donati are all available on this album with grand master Steve Vai. After you see those names in the band , naturally anyone wait for something beyond stars. Bad news:It is not fully, unfortunately. It is not something we've never heard from Vai before. Morever, it is not bad or average album. It has very unique, excellent, glamorous guitar (actually, whole instrumans) tricks and melodies, perfectly clear produced and engineered (so that it has perfect sound). Songs are very brilliantly composed and performed.\\"Building a Church\\" gets the curtains up with its very impressive opening. Very great track. I advice everyone to listen it loud. It is easyly understandable how good keyboardist Tony is.\\"Dying for Your Love\\" is a song like we can hear on vocal sides of Fire Garden or The Ultra Zone. Typical vocal song of Vai. \\"Glorious\\" is more faster song with its sustainer supported tricks. \\"K'm-Pee-Du-Wee\\" is very very cool track. But the most negative comment about this album is especially valid for that one. Very nice song but if you are a good listener of  Vai in past 5-6 year, there is nothing \\"fresh\\" here. I emphesize this because i love Vai music and dont want him to repeat himself all times and to be forgotten in future. \\"Freak Show\\" is one of the bests. East meets west part of the album. But this is not superficial made as some people do. Moreover Steve uses his oriental instruments that he had bought from his last Istanbul concert in Ultra Zone tour. Here comes 7th song. It means we are going slow down. \\"Lotus Feet\\" is very geniously  created, orchestrated and composed  track. My first expressions were not as high as \\"for the love of god\\" or \\"windows to the soul\\" but after a while you can get lost in its orchestration. The polyphony is spectacular. It is not from those one man plays, orchestra accompanies. Everthing is a whole in here.  \\"Midway Creatures\\" is one of the highest peak in \\"Real Illusions: Reflections\\".

B00005N919|4.0|Oddly enough, Basic Instinct to me is in the same league as Jaws and Psycho: something from the film literally impacts the culture. How many times have you gone swimming and hoped a shark wouldn't come? Or whether somebody's outside your shower curtain? And of course we always hum their respective themes, whether we're going after someone in a pool/lake or making a stabbing motion with that irritating-but-effective high pitched Psycho theme. Well add silk scarves and icepicks to the list. <br /> <br />Detective Nick Curran is investigating a case of an old rocker killed in bed while tied up and repeatedly stabbed. Their trail leads them to his \\"girlfriend\\"(a.k.a a **** buddy) Catherine Tramell, a novelist. Interestingly, a character in one of her books is killed in the precise manner as the rocker. So is someone framing her, or does she know that people would think she's nuts for killing someone in the exact way she wrote it obviously naming her the killer? <br /> <br />Then Nick starts to get obsessed. The sexually charged presense of Catherine affects him, making him smoke in non-smoking buildings and even having rough sex with his girlfriend. He also has to deal with Catherine's girlfriend(and not in the \\"girl and she's a friend\\")Roxie, who's quite jealous. So the question becomes is Nick dating the killer he's looking for? Or is Catherine's lover a little too obsessive? <br /> <br />The film was extremely controversial when it first came out. Not only for the sex filled narrative but also the \\"treatment\\" of gay and lesbians. Some gays and lesbians aren't crazy? We're not always that idealic view that we have. In a special feature on the Desperate Housewives set, Felicity Huffman recalls the scene where a woman asks \\"isn't it great being a mom?\\" Well yeah if you don't factor in the sleepless nights, frantic running around and calling for babysitters and housework. Same idea here. Sure Roxie is slightly off and a bit obsessive but isn't some of them? Like Norman Bates said, we all go a little mad sometimes. <br /> <br />Now the sex in the film is never explicit. We don't see anything that'd get the film NC-17 but it sure implies a lot. We got implied oral on male and female, standard positions, tons of nudity and even some girl-on-girl lesbian kissing(sorry guys, no love scene with those 2). The unrated version just merely extends shots by a few seconds or changes the camera angle, such as Nick and Catherine's first sexual encounter. <br /> <br />As for extra features they're not bad, including one feature that shows what was cut out(which really needs to be implemented more in these unrated editions). The commentaries are ok except you might find famed feminist author Camille Paglia a bit irritating since she's so university-lecture and overemphazing things. For example here's something she mentions about the interrogation scene: \\"The intensity of looking in this scene, looking on the part of the men, on Catherine's part, on our part, raises the temperature in the scene. There's a kind of sadism as Catherine plays with her prey. There's a kind of evocation of great movies about St. Joan, where in this case, the perverse saint, a Mary Magdalene figure, is defying her interrogators.\\" Um, lady it's just a scene. <br /> <br />Watch it with your spouse than get incredibly nervous when you decide to have your own frolic.

While it is one of my personal favourites, I can see why so many dislike it. It is one of the oddest albums ever recorded. But I very much reccomend this classic to you. Thank you.
B000BIQKXM|5.0|Personally I felt Allow Us To Be Frank was rather disappointing. I bought this album, Face to Face, on rather good impulse today. I have all their albums - I'm not a crazy fan, but I love their music. This album might be the album that's gonna restore Westlife to their former glory. It seems to revert back to the older \\"Westlife sound\\" - it's a great album.<br /><br />The kind of music I love.<br /><br />Go ahead, listen to it for yourself.<br /><br />The first few songs are amazing
B00005JMEW|2.0|Saw this movie yesterday and believe me, there is way too much of violence than I have ever imagined. Especially the amount of blood and the way it has been portrayed (just sprinkling and squirting, god, awful), I feet very abhorrent. After watching full movie, I didn't understand why the assassins were trying to kill her in the first place. May be this is reveled in the second part, which I'm no way interested to see.<br /><br />If you enjoy violence with too much of blood, this movie is for you otherwise, your time and money is best spent on other good titles.
B00008973A|5.0|Richard Attenborough had a difficult task in making a film of a stage production which is so closely linked to a single theatre set. His success is shown by the way this film holds ones interest and  possibly  sets a standard of dancing to  which future productions will be judged. Great musical score, brilliant interpretation.
0679745203|5.0|\\"The heart is an organ of fire,\\" says Michael Ondaatje in his novel, The English Patient.  Showing absolute belief in these words, Ondaatje's tale is a fiery love story about individuals, their hearts, and the pasts that plague them.  In addition to this weighty theme, lyrical language and a stunning ability to relate and interpret the deepest human emotions make Ondaatje's novel a stirring read anyone can enjoy. <br />     Ondaatje primarily uses characterization and description to relate his points.  For example, in one of my favorite passages the English patient says, \\"I am a person who if left alone in someone's home walks to the bookcase, pulls down a volume, and inhales it.  So history enters us.\\"  Is that not beautiful?  History, the stories of those who have gone before, is as necessary and natural to us as oxygen.  Our very survival is dependent on the consumption of the lessons of lives past.   Toward the end of the novel, the English patient once again speaks with a gentle wisdom that touched my soul.  \\"Words,\\" he says, \\"They have a power.\\"  He is absolutely right.  Words have the ability to construct images of great beauty, to relay profound messages, to communicate ideology, and simply to ease the perpetual loneliness of the human life.  The words of Michael Ondaatje's masterpiece The English Patient do all of these things.  It is a force of unspeakable strength and beauty.  Read it and let it ignite the fire in your heart.   <br />
B000002UAR|5.0|The Revolver album is not only my favorite Beatles album, it should go down in history as the greatest sound recording of all time.  Not only does this album grab you by the balls from the very beginning (the deep voice count in ONE.. TWO... THREE... FOUR... ONE... TWO... into Taxman), but it keeps you seduced into it's sonic blast throughout and up to the very last acidic blastings of Tomorrow Never Knows.  This album was pivitol, unlike Rubber Soul, because it surpassed the rules of studio technology and it all sounds fresh even to this day!  It was also pivitol because it opened the floodgates for other bands of the time and of today to be experimental and to overuse the resources that are available to create music and art.   <br /> <br />I am a very picky person when it comes to reviewing music especially the Beatles music.  I have a lot of criticism for each of their albums, some negative and positive and I've been known to make some hardcore Beatles fans cry because I gave such an  honest critique of their music.  But it's only fair to say what I think about music in general just because I am a musician myself and an artist as well and I have a passion that will be with me for the rest of my life.  I feel that the Revolver album is the only album in the history of music that deserves 5 stars and it's only right because it shows how musicians can push themselves and bring out the best and the best of all time when they're able to sit down amongst a busy schedule and record 14 of the greatest pop songs that have ever graced a needle, a tape head, or a laser!!
B000002I25|5.0|I'm not a huge fan of The Doors, I'm rather just getting into band. I own this album and \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" and I think this one is much better. I got really inspired by Doors music; their magic, psychodelic style, supported by amazing Manzarek's keyboard playing and haunting vocals by Morrison is just what I love.     Back to the album, it's great. It has Doors' biggest hits including \\"Light My Fire\\" or \\"Break On Through\\" but the rest of the disc is, for me, equally great. This is just the album I love to listen all the way through, from the beginning to the end, not skipping anything.    Break On Through - Angry, intense rocker, setting You in the right place. Incredible. 10/10    Soul Kitchen - My personal favourite. Great keyboard work, catchy chorus, ah, the entire song is excellent. 10/10    Crystal Ship - Another classic. Dark and haunting. Love this song. I think it could be a bit longer. But still gets 10/10    20th Century Fox - Catchy, typical Doors number. 8,5/10    Alabama Song - Another hit. Catchy chords. Like this song. 9/10.    Light My Fire - Doors' classic. I really love this song, but sometimes have the feeling the jam part in the middle is a bit too long. 9,5/10    Back Door Man - A blues cover, filled with Doors' essence. This one is much better than the original. 10/10    I Looked At You - Typical catchy song. Don't know what to say about it... just cool. 8,5/10    End Of The Night - Oh yes... the haunting climate and the psychodelic slides always gimme the thrills. 10/10    Take It As It Comes - Another catchy one. Cool. 9/10    The End - Well... I think it's a bit too long and gets too weird in few moments. Has its climate... but not my favourite. 9/10    Great. If You like 60s psychodelic music, You should own this one.
0380713802|1.0|Bryson has a lazy and sometimes obnoxious style of writing, and the countries he visits in this book all blur together because of it.  His perceptive commentaries on the natives can generally be summed up as \\"The Swiss, they're so funny!\\", \\"The Austrians, they're so funny!\\", \\"The _______, they're so funny!\\"  He also uses a lot of expletives, apparently thinking this will add humor to his writing.  His attempts to tie his travels to an earlier journey as a student are thin at best, and may be nothing more than an attempt to add padding to this small and worthless volume.
B00006AW2J|5.0|After their awful TSMR album, an attempt by the Stones to jump on the psychedelic bandwagon, they returned to great form in doing what they always do best - playing R&B. However on this album there is even more emphasis on the B than usual.<br /><br />This is the only Stones album I know which does not have one filler track on it. All the tracks range from good to eeceptional. Particular standouts are: 'Sympathy for the devil', the melancholy 'No expectations', 'Jigsaw puzzle', with its rather Dylanesque lyrics, and the rousing 'Salt of the Earth', the final track featuring Keith Richards on vocals with a backup gospel choir.<br /><br />'Prodigal son' is an attempt by the Stones to perform a song in Delta blues style, and Keith's excellent acoustic guitar makes it sound authentic. In fact Keith's guitar playing on this album is much improved over previous Stones albums. There is even a C&W track, 'Dear Doctor', with a narrative throughout by Jagger and is done with a little tongue-in-cheek humour. 'Factory girl' is often knocked as a poor track, but people tend to miss the point. It's another bluesy track about a working class guy standing outside a factory in the cold and wet, waiting for his unattractive girlfriend to finish work. The song perfectly complements the other tracks in sentiment, and evokes a poor man's view on life. Had this song been on LIB or SF, then it would have been out of place. But on BB it works well.<br /><br />BB is easily the best Stones album for me, and one you will never tire of listening to if you are into (what was then genuinely classed as) R&B. It was also the start of the Stones greatest period of musical output, 1968 - 1973, as well as the last album to completely feature the Stones original line-up.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I'm sick of scene kids and screamo death metal basket cases who think that people need to conform to their crappy genre of music in order to pass as \\"cool\\". (I also like how most of you hypocritical wrist-slitting a$$ clowns detest conformity, yet that's all you do.) <br /> <br />Now, on to the review. I &lt;3'd A7X before CoE, and I &lt;3 A7X post-COE. This album is so friggin cool. It shows that melody and metal go together well. A7X was one of the few screamo/metal bands I liked, because their music was just so well put together. The same can be said about CoE. Plus, I actually LIKE hearing the lyrics on the song (OMG! No way!, I mean, who WANTS to enjoy music these days? God, they must be insane).  <br /> <br />My generation is friggin pathetic. The mentality of most of these people make me wish I lived under a rock away from society.  <br /> <br />And, I am not some make up wearing gothic 15 year old MTV girl. I am a 16 year 6'2'' fat dude who wears baggy clothes and prefers underground rap like Immortal Technique, Wu Tang, Rakim(now a bit commercial), Krumbz, Diabolic, Tonedeff, Copyrite, etc.  <br /> <br />Grow the kcuf up you narrow minded turds and go get in the head with a bag of sledgehammers. That's practically the same as listening to your crappy deathmetal. I swear, everytime I listen to atreyu, or any form of scream/emo (with the exception of very few bands) I feel like my brain is turning to liquid and bleeding out of my ears.
B000002G7G|5.0|An interesting turn for the mellower after the art maelstrom of \\"White Light/White Heat.\\"  Some of their finest songs are presented herein.  \\"Pale Blue Eyes\\" is nearly without peer in modern songwriting.
B000641ZA4|3.0|As a lifelong fan of Genesis, it was always a treat to see their videos played on MTV, which wasn't too rare an occurrence in the 80's-early 90's. But the videos that are most memorable to both myself and the more casual fan are the outlandish puppet-Reagan bashing of \\"Land of Confusion\\" and several varieties of the 'let's make a video about making a video starring Phil Collins' variety, e.g. \\"Invisible Touch\\" and \\"I Can't Dance\\".  These videos, along with the sublimely dark atmospheres of \\"Mama\\" and \\"Tonight, Tonight, Tonight\\" are among the most popular of Genesis' video career. <br />   Where this collection shines is giving us the more rarely-seen and unique vids from the past.  Some shining examples: the humorous band-interplay (esp. between Steve Hackett and Phil) on the 1976 clip for \\"A Trick of the Tail\\", the hear-no-evil-speak-no-evil-see-no-evil themes of \\"Keep it Dark\\", and a Top of the Pops appearance by th band in front of a small, very-80's crowd in support of \\"Paperlate\\".  There are lots more seldom-seen videos above, many are quite nice on their own, but the disc drags in that there is a string of videos with the same theme:  the band playing the song faux-live.  Not very creative, and they don't always look like they're having fun.  Phil Collins occasionally laughs while lip-synching, or the band acknowledges that they're clearly strumming to the music, but you get the feeling they'd rather be mugging for the camera a la the humorous \\"Illegal Alien\\" or \\"Jesus He Knows Me\\" clips. Of these band jam videos, the worst offender perhaps is \\"abacab\\", which edits out the extended instrumental at the end of the LP version in favor of the looped single version.  It's jarring aurally and visually.  However, not all is lost on the live shots:  \\"Home By the Sea\\" is a stunning mix of lights and smoke, while the rare \\"Tell Me Why\\" video intersperses the band with affecting shots of the poor, starving, and suffering...it drives the message home just as effectively as Phil did in his solo \\"Another Day in Paradise\\" video. <br />  So, in summary, this is well worth it if you love the songs and the band, or just want to have digital quality versions of some MTV staples (in an age where you don't see Genesis on air anymore! Well, maybe over on VH-1 Classic)... but the majority of the tracks are clearly for the die-hards, and are a bit indistinguishable when watched straight through.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Many reviewers here expressed their dislike for the characters portraited in the movie.  I think however unlikable the characters are in any movie, the storyline should be coherent.  It is not the case with this movie...  While the acting was fantastic, the connections between each \\"section\\" of the movie were weak, unconvincing and required a lot of contemplating by the audience.  I watched the entire movie against the wish of my girlfriends as they wanted to cut it half way into the movie.  This is not a chick flick or suspense or your cookie cutter type of drama if that is what you are looking for.
B0002EXH40|5.0|This is the foremost the best Megadeth Album EVER!  A Tout LeMounde is by far the baddest song i ever heard Dave Mustaine and his Mighty crew have ever assembled.  If there were 6 starz i would of definitly would have awarded it without a second thought.  Youthanasia came out in 1994 and never looked back and kept cruising along at metal speed.  Dave Mustaine, Dave Ellefson, Marty Freidman and Nick Menza hands down can do it like no other band.  It was a God Send that the ego-maniacs Metallica gave Dave Mustaine the walkin papers, cuz they knew that he had the talent to put together some awesome songs(didn't want him to steal their sunshine)  So much the better DAVE MUSTAINE YOU ARE THE BEST!  YOUTHANASIA!!  shows your TALENT!  Do pick this up if your a MEGADETH fan, and if your not you will not be disappointed!!  Reckoning day is the heaviest song on this album and will rock the most stubborn rock fan!! Touch'e Dave YOUR ROCK BROTHERMAN!!
B000B2YQX4|2.0|To say that 'playing the angel' is simplistic and pedantic would be much the same as stating that drawing a crooked line on a sheet of paper somehow requires a ruler.  <br /> <br />It's all down to the producer(s), which are all Depeche Mode have left.  The kindly gentlmen from various production houses who want to add something 'impressive' and 'original' to their  resumes. It's no accident that Flood will not have anything to do with them. <br /> <br />I will state it, bluntly, this band should have stopped when Alan Wilder left. There is no other way to view it; ignore all the talk of analogue equipment being brought back in for the making of this album.  <br /> <br />Depeche Mode have obviously been listening to bands who sound like them, there is no other explanation for such a banal and derivative clunker like 'playing the angel' (or perhaps it should have been titled 'playing the angle' as it is quite calculated). <br /> <br />If this one isn't the end god help us. <br /> <br />
B00005JO1G|5.0|There's a lot to love about JARHEAD, but there's an underlying current, too, that may effect some viewers negatively (specifically those that have been or are Marines.) Myself never having been in the U.S. Armed Services, I can't make those glib comparisons that others who've \\"been there and done that\\" might be able to. But what I can do is rate this film on its own merits and tell you why I gave it such a high rating.<br /><br />Like Sam Mendes' other film, AMERICAN BEAUTY, which delves into the depths of suburbia and all its great and terrible significance, Mendes here takes hold of a U.S. Marine and shows us an excellent character study. But this time it's of a young man's ultimate genesis into a fighter.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal (DONNIE DARKO and OCTOBER SKY) is Anthony Swofford, a naive recruit with dreams of glory and medals, a dedicated American protector who takes his lumps during his early time in \\"The Suck\\" (the Marine Corps unofficial title given to it by the grunts). He rises to the station of a Marine Scout-Sniper along with Troy, Peter Sarsgaard (FLIGHT PLAN and KINSEY). And above them is Staff Sergeant Sykes, Jamie Fox (RAY), who \\"loves The Corp\\" and will never leave it.<br /><br />As Swofford makes it through boot camp and into the lower echelon of a Marine trained combatant, he is very willing, ready and extremely able to kill whenever the order comes.<br /><br />But what if it doesn't? This is the crux of the film.<br /><br />I've heard a lot of gossip about JARHEAD before its release, and many have d@mned it for a message that I simply did not see, that being the making of a political statement or \\"bashing\\" the Marine Corp. On the contrary, I think Mendes held back on this point and skillfully allows the viewer to insert their own beliefs (if you lean one way or the other - pro-War vs. ant-War). And that's War with a capital \\"W\\". Because, let's be honest, that is what our Armed Services are trained for. They are trained to kill during wartime. And each man/woman brings with them their own justifications for this (be it \\"In protection of my country\\" or \\"Because my father was a Marine\\" or \\"Because it was this or jail.\\")<br /><br />This film focuses on the relationship that Swofford develops with the Marine Corp and within himself. He is given the right tools (both psychologically and physically) to exterminate the enemy. He is beat down by his instructors and built back up into a killing machine (\\"This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine...\\"). He's loaded with adrenaline as they enter Iraq for Operation Desert Shield. But the days start to drag and he begins to wonder if he'll ever see any action and get to do what he was designed for (sharpshooting). Boredom sets in, and with it comes resentment and anger directed at everyone (even men in his own platoon). But then a mortar attack on their outpost occurs. Slow motion blasts of sand cover Swofford's face, a sort of baptism into the War. He wets himself during this scene, but whether it's from excitement or fear is left up to the audience (I personally loved that part, as it might be perceived as another type of baptism.)<br /><br />Then we see Swofford and his platoon moving into the desert as they witness the burning of the Kuwait oil fields. They go into this muck and the feel of the film turns as dark as the petrol spilling from the infernal wells. Are they in Hell?<br /><br />My initial perception was that something bad was coming. But it never did.<br /><br />There is no \\"War\\" to speak of for Gyllenhaal's character. We never see a speck of enemy blood on-screen. No head splatters or bullet-riddled chest shots. The war is \\"distant\\", beyond his reach, and you begin to feel his frustration. Why can't he just kill somebody? (This is especially noteworthy when they are given the opportunity but it is quickly taken away.)<br /><br />All in all, this movie is a fantastic break from normal Hollywood form. There are no great external battleswith dismembered bodies and the death of half the platoon. The battle here is compartmentalized into one man's struggle to find out what he's supposed to do as a killer when never given the opportunity to become one.<br /><br />(There is a great feel of dichotomy toward the end of the film when an obviously disenfranchised Vietnam Vet gets on-board the welcome home bus carrying the \\"victorious\\" Marines down Main Street; a \\"victory parade\\" that the Vietnam Marine never got.)no great external battles with dismembered bodies and the death of half the platoon.

B00004SAAY|5.0|This is undoubtedly the best Bach box set I have heard. These Concerto's for Harsichord, Violin, Flute and Oboe are among the finest in classical music. Although the Harpsichord volume level could have been a bit higher overall the recordings are very good. I am very pleased with this CD set with so much music at a very good price. This is truly a collectors gem.
B00005JO9J|4.0|Grey's Anatomy may not be a hard-hitting medical drama, nor is it even a very realistic portrayal of hospitals or medicine, but it's not meant to be ER or Chicago Hope. Rather than giving us a slice-of-life portrayal of surgeons and hospitals, Grey's Anatomy uses the medical setting as a metaphor for the human dramas being experienced by the doctors, particularly the new crop of interns (one of whom, Sandra Oh, is awesomely sarcastic and ambitious).     The cast overall is very strong, and unfortunately it's been universally noted that the weak link is the lead, Ellen Pompeo, whose voiceovers giving us the \\"life lesson of the day\\" may be the main detractor of the show. The outlandish medical cases are again not meant to be taken literally so much as they provide metaphors for real life and mirror what's going on with the doctors' relationships.    Yes, there's a lot of romance and sex going on for one hospital, and it gets a bit wrapped up in the romantic-drama elements, but the characters and their relationships are strongly portrayed and the storylines move briskly. None of that will-they-or-won't-they wishy-washiness that draws out tensions forever and frustrates the viewer's patience. And whenever the tone veers toward the overly dramatic, the comedy undercuts it and brings us back.    Not quite cutting-edge or groundbreaking television, but very enjoyable and entertaining to watch. The mostly adult-indie-rock soundtrack is a little obvious and occasionally overused to the point of being intrusive, but for the most part works well with the show. Some particularly nice choices in Season 1 are Tegan and Sara, Rilo Kiley, The Ditty Bops, Wilco, Nellie McKay, and Iron & Wine.    Season 1 was originally supposed to be 13 episodes, but ABC only aired the first 9, then held back the rest and used them to open Season 2. It's not clear if this will be a 9-episode or 13-episode set, but at this price it's a good deal either way.
1559409010|5.0|Watching this movie for the first time was a strange experience for me: I was laughing myself silly, with tears of joy running down my cheeks, but then suddenly came a moment that changed it all, a somewhat sad and emotional bit for me. It was the scene when Brian is caught by a Roman centurion while doing an anti-Roman graffiti, and given a Latin grammar lesson, complete with that cruelest entry in the every teacher's bag of tricks, \\"write this sentence a hundred times before dawn.\\" The moment when yawning Brian finishes his job and sets himself up to be the Number One Public Enemy of the Evil Empire, I suddenly knew that the good people that made this movie understood how it feels to get up at dawn and drag your weary self to a 7 am Latin class, and run down a dozen declinations of \\"Rosa, rosae, rosae...\\" before you even begin to wake up. My heart went out to the Pythons and all I could think of was \\"Revenge is sweet! Take that, Caesar, you hack writer!\\"<br />However, in a very likely case that you have no emotional issues with and don't really give a toss about Latin grammar, then all you get is only a most brilliant movie: a ruthless expos&eacute; of the machinery of Roman and British empires at their biggest and baddest stages, a merciless spoof of Bible epics, one biting satire about organized religion and political parties subdividing themselves into absurdity, and possibly the funniest movie ever made.<br />Watch this movie with your friends and if they don't laugh with you, change your friends; it's a litmus test for bigotry. If they think that the discussion about the line \\"And blessed are the cheesemakers...\\" is not funny, or worse, if they find it offensive, it's time to upgrade.<br />And if you know and love this movie something awful, and play \\"Always Look on the Bright Side of Life\\" when life gets you down, then you have no excuse not to get this edition of our beloved classic, because you get Brian and a host of fabulous extras in one great DVD package.<br />For starters, try the Radio Ads, featuring heart-wrenching pleas from Michael Pallin's dentist, and mothers of Eric Idle, Terry Gilliam and John Cleese. Then check out the hillarious theatrical trailer, the deleted scenes (the Shephards one is a hoot), run the whole epic with several available enlightening commentaries (where you get to hear John Cleese's story of his struggles with Latin cases) or see the wonderful and bizarre documentary about making of Life of Brian and joys of shooting on location and good hearted trashing of your co-Pythons.

0060516402|5.0|This book is a master piece, and is one of the most interesting business books I've ever read, I recommend this book to anyone who is studying for an MBA or doing research related to business organizations. The authors have done lot of work before they wrote this book, it is evident with the amount of references that they have quoted in the book. It busts the myth that \\"management is complicated science\\" and shows you simple and intriguing stories as to how some of the top companies in the world stumble upon fortune. And how they kept the company afloat during times of struggle (did you know that Boeing had to do furniture business to keep the company running? I read it on the book), the way they treated their employees.. Its an investment to buy this book.
0062502182|4.0|A parable is an allegory that illustrates a complex point, and that's what The Alchmist does, it illustrates the search for our inner treasure, that which we all seem to look for desperately.  <br /> <br />I read this novel almost at the same time that I read Grigor Fedan's \\"Dream Maker:A Mystical Tale\\" and I can't help but compare the two, because they deal with the same topic, the search for our inner self. While The Alchemist is simple in its message and warms the heart, Fedan takes the topic and brings it home in all of its complexity; the search is prompted by a sense of emptiness and the answers that we all crave for are brought to the surface in the narrative. Cohelo's is a fairy tale, Fedan's is a complex metaphysical novel that makes you think.  <br /> <br />It almost depends what you are in the mood for, but I would definetely recommend for people to read both novels, they complement each other nicely. <br /> <br />I am grateful to both authors. I want more novels like these. <br /> <br />

It's one of those albums where every single song kicks ass, and you don't have to hit the skip button one time. <br /> <br />This album is why White Zombie will always be my favorite band.  La Sexorcisto was really f'in cool in it's own way.  But this album is insane?!!?!?!?  HAVE YOU LISTENED TO SUPERCHARGER HEAVEN?  Each song is hard, every single one...even Blood Milk and Sky which sounds like a Hippie mixed metal jumablaya. <br /> <br />This is by far the best weight lifting album out there.  Each song gets you pumped up and rearing to kick the crap out of any little emo beitch that gets in your way.  It is better than any of Zombie's other attempts...but the songs are so awesome..that they even sounded good on Supersexy Swingin' Sounds all techno'd up. <br /> <br />It's a shame as someone before me wrote...that this album didn't get more attention than it did.  If it had come out now...it would turn the tide of music from Rap's favor back into hard rocks.  Unfortunately music like this cannot be found these days thanks to whiny bitches like Green Day and Blink 182 and all those other 'singin-about-my-girlfriend-who-cheated-on-me-with-the-cooler-guy' bands. <br /> <br />This album is 100% whoopass and NO ONE will be disappointed listening to it.  Go out and get it now...and stop accepting the crappy new rock music that has been coming out.  We are entitled to much much more...and this album is proof.

B00003CXAA|4.0|i havnt seen part one in a while but i remember it as the best of the 3. brando and cann where great. <br /> <br />part2 was good too. it had 2 stories in one. it had one of my fav actors(deniro) so i am biased. the second story with pacino kinda confused me on who plotted to kill who. overall the movie was a bit more boring than the first. <br /> <br />part3 i watched with the commentary but it was ok, i actually liked the ending the best, very sad. i like when andy becomes the new godfather but the whole movie before didnt really go anywhere and is my least fav of the 3. in the commentary copolla says duvall didnt want to do 3 without equal money as pacino. that sucks, it woulda been a better movie. <br /> <br />in checking the bonus disc the deleted scenes are plentiful and go in order of date instead of per movie. it was a good idea but they should have had a playall feature. i was mad about that. the commentaries where great. i hate it when they have like 10 people who are not actors or the director giving their commentary. im glad it was only copolla <br /> <br />on a side note, sofia looked pretty good. lost in translation was ok but overrated as well.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Batman Begins is by far the best movie about the caped crusader to ever hit the screen.  The movie nails every aspect of what Batman should be, and as such, is a far darker movie than even the Tim Burton Batman movies.  Batman is the Dark Knight, a man driven by vegeance, yet when given the chance to be the executioner, he refuses.  It's a long movie, it moves slowly at times, but it has to. Truly a great movie.
B00006FDCD|5.0|stephen king's it is awsome and 1 of my top 5 fav. scary movies. it has some real funny parts thoe like when he IT is in the libary and he is just making jokes up and all of the balloons are splashing people with blood. the only neagtive about the movie is the 2 part when the IT is a spider and that is kinda lamb. i give this movie a 5 out of 5.<br /><br />IT (WE ALL FLOAT DOWN HERE)
B00097DXZS|1.0|I won't be buying this CD.  Sorry, Carlos, but if your label needs to hijack my computer because they don't trust me with your music, then there's no reason for me to trust them with my money.

She stood by be in the days when my confidence was shaken and I was not \\"All There\\" It makes me love here more knowing she didn't give up on me.<br /><br />I read the book to see if it could help my teenage daughter. Not appropriate for teenagers! Too much mature info.<br /><br />The book is too hard on men. We are not perfect. I know that's not what we should say now a days, but its true.

B00008H2LB|4.0|For the second major label release, linkin park continue with their rap-rock sound, putting out 11 cuts of hook heavy, radio-ready alt-rock rap. Although some prefer \\"hybrid theory\\" to \\"meteora\\", I'd have to go out on a limb and say that this is the better of the two. <br /> <br />The bad news: If there were any clear-cut indication the LP was finished, it would be mike's solo effort \\"fort minor\\". I've always had the feeling that LP had a hip-hop preference over rock, and this only further proves that. It's been almost 3 years since meteora, and nothing from the LP camp indicates a release anytime soon. You have to respect a band for doing what they want too, but i can't say that i wasn't looking forward to another LP record. Oh well, 2 major hits and a strong following proves that LP was a popular act, so i guess the only thing left is a change of pace. <br /> <br />RIP linkin park.
B00004Z400|5.0|The Deftones emerged among a midst of bands who were trying to accomplish what they did, but couldn't capture the same intensity; the right measurements of anger and elation, when mixed together create a very pleasing entr&eacute;e. The White Pony on this album is like one of the icons of my early college years.  I revisit this CD often, and each time I get some sort of new perspective on it.<br /><br />White Pony has violent moments, like \\"Korea,\\" where the pounding guitar and pouring lyrics jump from the song and take us on an invigorating journey. Unlike many hard-edge vocalists, Chino Moreno manages to make his heavy saturation evocative, not annoying. My other favorite moments of the album occur with \\"Knife Party,\\" where screeching never sounded so good; \\"Digital Bath,\\" which builds into a magical, euphoric force; the follow-up \\"Elite,\\" with screaming, drowning vocals that literally sound underwater (an interesting pass to \\"Digital Bath!\\") and \\"Change,\\" which brings upon the mood of a dark, contorted fairy tale. The guitar work on White Pony isn't anything fancy, but I don't feel like it's due to a lack of or downplay of talent--it happens to sound good this way. It's filled with tunes that don't just stick in your head for a day--they stay forever. It has a psychedelic resonance. If you're in a crowded room and this album is on, you may have a hard some conversing because you want to get lost in the music that's pulling you into its black, delicious hole. Although transitions between songs are less than buttery, it makes sense in the context of the album, because thematically it fits together like a puzzle. The songs are not autobiographical, but rather represent emotions and experiences of others. \\"Back to School,\\" for instance, isn't a typical I-was-a-misfit-in-high-school song--it's more of a parody of revisiting sour memories. I'm seduced by this album the same way I initially was five years ago.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This series was one of the most original, thoughtful, and entertaining I had ever seen. I did not discover this series until after it's demise, but happened to catch it's big screen sister (which was also great) and decided that I would give the tv show a chance. I highly recommend both. I think all of the other reviews tell truly how great this series is, on my review i'll tell you how much I hate fox. In the past few years this evil broadcaster has cancelled Firefly, Boston Public, John Doe, Tru calling, Point Pleasant, Family Guy(which they finally brought back) and oh yeah, Buffy The Vampire Slayer. They start these great shows and then never give them a chance. Why would I even start to watch a fox show that is just going to be cancelled before it gets a fair chance?
B0006399FS|4.0|I've been a fan of U2 when they came out as a \\"new\\" band while I was a touring musician I thought, \\"good ideas that weren't quite up to the band's potential\\", I was told I was wrong about how I felt and as I've read in several of the reviews here, I'm wrong again. <br /> <br />U2 has always been political, whether religous or political. When they released \\"War\\" I felt they'd found their pace. Much as I liked several of the songs from \\"The Unforgetable Fire\\" there were songs on it that had out of key guitar solos and due to the exceptional quality of songs like \\"Pride\\" it was just as disappointing to hear \\"Elvis Presley and America\\". <br /> <br />I was happy with the progression of a fully thought out album that was superb to good from start to finish with \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and the continued maturation and experimentation of \\"Achtung Baby\\". By \\"Pop\\" with it's techno flavor and ready for the dance floor mentality there were problems, mainly, the lack of well written songs. <br /> <br />And thus we get to \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" which is their second comeback album, as some see it. I see it as another stage of maturation. <br /> <br />Once again, Bono is in political mode, the band is in mid-tempo to slow ballads peppered with rocking tracks like \\"Vertigo.\\" The thing that I appreciated was U2 accepting their age! To some degree I understand this as I still work as well and I'm a bit older than the lads. Much of what I've written has been slower and more heartfelt. More of my time has been spent getting things right - to the point where it gets in the way of making music, and to a good degree that's how this album feels; like a band that is growing older, thinking more about the things they used to sing about and giving us their take on similar themes 20 years after some of their famous begining albums, which \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" strikes me. <br /> <br />And it is a bold step for U2. While \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was thematic and enthemic as old U2 fans remember, I felt like it was U2 trying to get their old sound together. While I liked it, as time went on, I grew tired and it didn't get much airplay. Not so with \\"How to....\\" Maybe it's because I'm an aging musician seeing things that are wrong, but there seems to be as much craft as there is heartfelt themes and appropriate music. <br /> <br />It's not quite as thematic as several pre-electronic era 1990s albums, but that's good as far as I'm concerned. I wanted to see a more stripped down U2 and am happy with it's more personal sound. <br /> <br />It wouldn't surprise me if a group of people who grew up with U2 and National Public Radio for news have changed as U2 listeners that listen to FOX media and the human called \\"Rush\\", which is to say some fans may have turned to the right and find the left-wing humanist songs on this album not quite as stiring as the message is no longer something they agree with. <br /> <br />It wouldn't surprise me to find that young people to college listeners are U2's audience these days. <br /> <br />To wrap it up, U2 tries some different things here, although it's more like a return to the late 80s U2 with a bit more professionalism. The songs are well written with several rockers that are atypical of the anthemic songs from U2's past. That is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. <br /> <br />The feelings sound genuine, U2 sounds more reflective and showing their age by the maturity this recording shows. If you like the rock based U2 and can give some time to listen to the album I think you'll find it's one of the best things they've done in over a decade. It's not a great album, but it is a 4 star effort with 5 star production, mostly by Steve Lillywhite, who knows the band well and who always delivers exciting, emotional sounding recordings.  <br /> <br />Not a must buy, but still a fine album filled with sentiment backed up by the band's perfomance.
B000B9J4EI|5.0|What would you do, if a mysterious plague swept throughout the world, literally killing everyone off, but leaving in its place something new, something frightening, something downright horrible, while leaving you alive, immune and seemingly alone? What would you do, if the undead now walked the earth looking for you, the last man alive...the last vestige of the human race? What if what they wanted was the taste of your blood on their lips? Just what on earth would you do?<br /><br />These are the questions that faced Robert Neville. It is he who is Legend. How he answers them is what makes this a book to remember and a classic within its genre. It is a book of profound hope and despair. It is a book which demands to be read. Read it. You will not be disappointed.
B00005JO1G|3.0|<br />Or, at least, nobody fought in a conventional sense. <br /> <br />Even in anti-war war movies (which is most of them) we're used to getting the big battle scenes, a signature glimpse of the horror that, however eye-popping or momentarily thrilling, will eventually become repellent. <br /> <br />\\"Saving Private Ryan\\" has its whiplash, surround sound depiction of D-Day. <br /> <br />\\"Full Metal Jacket\\" has its more-grueling-than-battle boot camp sequence, and its hunt for a sniper in the ruins of Hue City. <br /> <br />\\"Apocalypse Now\\" has helicopter attacks more beautifully choreographed than ballet. <br /> <br />But the new movie about America's first war with Iraq, \\"Jarhead,\\" is built around the \\"hurry-up-and-wait\\" rhythms of combat in a technological age.  <br /> <br />It's about the forces who stood on their mark in the desert for months - from the invasion of Kuwait in Aug. 1990 to the start of hostilities in Jan. 1991 - to take part in a war that, in the end, lasted just four days and was fought mostly with planes, tanks and remote controls. <br /> <br />We see it through the eyes of Anthony Swofford (Jake Gyllenhaal), a smart-but-naive California kid who joins the Marines and soon realizes he's in over his head. His basic training is gone in a blink (probably to avoid further resemblance to \\"Full Metal Jacket\\") and almost immediately, he finds himself serving as a sniper in the Persian Gulf, waiting for Operation Desert Shield to become Desert Storm.  <br /> <br />In the meantime, he and his comrades are gung-ho, expertly trained, fairly well-equipped, coiled to strike ... and also scared, bored, lonely, frustrated and uninformed. That's a volatile cocktail. <br /> <br />The result, as directed by Sam Mendes, will probably divide audiences, especially those hoping for combat scenes (a surplus of which will undoubtedly appear in the movies that spring from the second war with Iraq).  <br /> <br />This film, however, is slowly, episodically paced; its satire isn't always focused and there's a haziness with some details (did Marines really dig foxholes directly under drizzling torrents of oil?) that left me eager to read Swofford's book.  <br /> <br />But the movie is usually engaging and occasionally chilling; it gets solid performances out of Jamie Foxx and Peter Sarsgaard, who play career Marines; and its final scene, a montage set against Tom Waits' song, \\"Soldier's Things,\\" may be a bit too on the nose but it still got me.  <br /> <br />Ultimately, though, \\"Jarhead\\" just isn't the four- or five-star home run it could have been. Though it tries, it doesn't achieve the gritty satirical edge of, for example, David O. Russell's \\"Three Kings\\" (which made a statement about the Gulf War *and* told a nifty heist story *and* de-glamorized combat violence). Like its hero, this is a movie that's angry and bound up and takes careful aim ... but never really shoots to kill.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Several years ago, we bought a Diana Krall album and attached was a bonus Christmas CD with 3 or 4 songs.  We've been waiting for Diana to do a full length Christmas CD.  This album is the best by the best.  Diana Krall has once again outdone herself. <br />We saw her perform at CNU in Newport News several years ago. As she did that night and has done on her other albums, she has found the perfect mix of upbeat sounds with the smooth, soulful sounds that we've come to know as Diana Krall.  Her rendition of \\"I'll be home for Christmas\\" is fantastic.  This will be the perfect Christmas gift for anyone who loves the sound of Diana Krall.  Every song is beautiful. <br />
B00006AW2J|5.0|Plenty let me tell you!  This CD is AMAZING.  Clearly the seeds of the incredible Exile on Main Street.  This release found the stones in transition from post British Invasion with cute hair cuts to lettin' it all hang out while creating a serious work of art (that is coincidentally lots o' fun).<br /><br />Not only is the song cannon superb (no clicking of the skip button on this release) and often downright humorous (Dear Doctor, Factory Girl), the slide guitar playing in abundant, it's hard to make out who is actually doing the singing... is it Mick Jagger assuming some character role or is it one of the other Stones?  I mean, who is THAT who sounds like an ol' black share cropper singing on Prodigal Son?<br /><br />And the sound... The sound is INCREDIBLE:<br /><br />Sympathy for the Devil never sounded so good - the listener is surrounded by growls, snarls, howls, demonic percussion and manic piano and of course that crazy blues Mephitso guitar solo.<br /><br />When I was a young teen, Street Fighting Man was a favorite.  I always loved that mysterious mix of strings, sitar, and Jack Nitche's pentatonic (didn't know that word back then) piano lines floating above the cacauphony at the end and in the middle transition.  Street Fighting Man sounds way better than ever.  I couldn't stop playing it.  on this SACD release Charlie Watts sounds like he's playing a bass drum with a 500 ft diameter on Street Fighting... - Ba-Boom!  That drum has to be HUGE!<br /><br />It's all great people. great! Great! GREAT!  I enthusiastically encourage purchase, even if you have the earlier CD release of Beggar's Banquet.  You will be pleased!<br /><br />Postscript:  Out of all the SACD re-releases, this is just so superior. Actually, it is far superior to ANY remastering job I have heard period.  Unless you own the vinyl, just throw out your old copy and buy this now!  It is actually worth every penny of the $17.95 list price.  One of the most gratifying CD purchases I have ever made.<br /><br />A word of warning on the used disks. Make sure they are the 2002 remaster before wasting your money. I once purchased a used King Crimson CD advertised along with the remasters. It was a 20 year old remaster that really sucked.ake sure they are the 2002 remaster before wasting your money.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|John Landis at the time had know idea he was creating a cult classic. He does now, with sales of the dvd, vhs, soundtrack, etc. But, Mr Landis, your not the star, the beloved John Belushi is. Devouring an entire line of buffet food, slamming an entire bottle of Jack, falling off the ladder with a wood, and swinging across a parade as a pirate during the homecoming parade. Belushi trying to recite the procedings of Pearl Harbour, or a pencil in his nose, he was the man. Without him, the film would be O.K., with him, superp. Smash that guitar big guy. I love you and your talent, you left us too early. I feel apreciated that I actually got to visit his gravesite on Martha's Vineyard. I slammed a cold beer on his headstone, and went my way. He would wanted it that way. Buy this classic, you will enjoy for ages, God knows every college kid knows this film line by line. Rest in piece John, we all miss you.
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Like most MK fans I am always anxious to get to hear the newest work. As with his recent solo work there is a preconceived expectation to the initial listening. I have come to realize that MK is like a fine vintage wine not to thrown over a few ice cubes  in a water glass and chugged down. To the contrary a wine is to be taken in small sips and allow the bouquet to be savored. After the first listen a few tracks always stand out, however after listening a few times and you start to understand that MK's guitar work is truly to be appreciated in the phrasing, the breaks and the fades at the end of his work that give the lyrics their true feeling. No other guitar player I've heard has the truly unique signature sound that MK possesses. If after listening to the guitar work on Shangi la and you don't get it you are missing what separates MK with the masses of high energy twangers.  But if you slow down, sip and savor, you'll remember why you have listened to MK through his career and evolution. It is \\" What it is\\".
B0001I55NS|5.0|I do not know how this movie recieved such low ratings. I for one loved it. I am a huge fan of Gerard butler and rented it oneday and i loved it so much i ordered it the following week.<br /><br />Gerard Butler and Paul Walker give a great performance in this movie that will make you laugh and even cry. It is great for those who love movies with a historical play to them. I just love it because it has a bit of everything really. It is a love story, it has historical events incorporated into it, it is superbly acted out, it is humorous, it is sad. I highly recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. It is deffinately worth the time it takes to watch it!<br /><br />And if you are a Gerry Butler fan then you will especially love it!
B00008OWZC|4.0|before you assume I am some anti-Plant/Page music fan who thinks those guys are nothing but huge moneyloving egoholics you are wrong. I like Led Zeppelin alot and think they are a great band but this album just let me down, in fact I dare say that BBC Sessions is a better live album and that the only thing that makes this better than \\"The Song Remains the Same\\" or whatever that live album was called is that fact that there are three CD's. But why are there two cd's you might ask? Because there are at least 4 songs that are over 12 minutes long and at least two of those are 23 min. (Whole Lotta Love(a medley of tunes but still could've been shorter)) and 25 minutes (the highly overated Dazed and Confused with the highly overated violin bowstring guitar solo by Jimi Paige to which I say la-de-friggn-da!). Seriously If you took one of these songs and put a normal live track next to it you could have an entire classic Van Halen album length (which is way better anyway since EVH proves that virtuositic talent and technique make an awesome guitarist, not theatrics!)! I am not saying I hate Jimi Paige and think he is a sucky guitar player, in fact he is a great guitar player but is highly overated because of his theatrics and not because he churns out unbelievable guitar riffs. The fact that this is live does not change the fact that Robert Plant still sounds like a woman, sorry fellas asking for Robert Plant to sound like a guy is like asking for world peace or a cure for cancer, maybe possible but just not probable under the circumstances. If you want to hear great Plant vocals buy \\"In Through the Outdoor\\", where his throat is hurt so bad he almost does sound like an actual man, it's just too bad they used overworked keyboards on it.<br /><br />But let us talk about Led Zeppelin's highly underated rhythm section on this live album. First off John Paul Jones, perhaps one of the most underused bassmen in history; I wonder if half the people reading this even knew who John Paul was before I mentioned this? Probably only Led Zeppelin fans who will tell you that Jones is so criminally used it is like a having a cheeseburger without the beef, you can just barely grasp the bass. Like the studio albums Jones is still very underused here even though if it weren't for him Zeppelin wouldn't have half of their compositional million-sellers thanks to his experience in string orchestration. Finally Jon Bohman, one of the greatest drummers that ever lived puts on a performance on Moby Dick that is way better than Paige's guitar work in Dazed nad Confused. Bohman alone is the reason you should buy this album, you will be amazed beyond belief, it is like God on drums. The only drumming that I have heard that is better than this would be Neil Peart on Rush's Different Stages Live album, IF YOU HAVE ANY INTEREST AT ALL FOR JON BOHMAN OR DRUMMING BUY THIS ALBUM, EVEN IF YOU HAVE TO ENDURE THE DISGUSTING OVERHYPE OF JIMI PAIGE AND ROBERT PLANT.

B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers music is really good. I love all of their singles and when listening to their CD for the first time I liked all the songs I listened to.

B0006ICF9A|4.0|If you were to judge only by sales, then this is the album that justified R.E.M.'s move to Warner Brothers Records, since \\"Out of Time\\" is the first R.E.M. album to reach #1. \\"Losing My Religion\\" was certainly their best single to date, and the power of their new major label affiliation also made sure that it was also their best-selling (for a full-length review of this song, proceed to the end of this listing). If truth be told, this album is also their most inconsistent. High points like \\"Losing My Religion\\", \\"Texarkana\\", \\"Half a World Away\\" and \\"Country Feedback\\" are offset by semi-realized efforts like \\"Shiny Happy People\\" (a top ten hit in its own right, proving that many, many people disagree with me here), \\"Endgame\\" or \\"Low\\". When compared with the `hair-metal' that passed for `rock and roll' back in 1991, though, this album sounds like a work of genius. From just about any angle, the good far outweighs the ordinary (nothing here is bad per se), and by the time the album raps up with Michael Stipe and Kate Pierson (of the B-52s, who appears on 3 tracks here) harmonizing on the uplifting \\"Me in Honey,\\" it is impossible to deny the charms of being \\"Out of Time.\\"  A- Tom Ryan
B0000C9ZLD|4.0|I like this album.  I listen to it every few months from beginning to end.  If it got stolen I'd buy it again.  I just can't see writing 3 pages worth of praise and devotion to a POP band who don't even take themselves that seriously. It's not as if they reinvented music as we know it.  This band, and others like them, get way too much praise for churning out good POP songs...although they are \\"indie/alt-rock/throwback\\" etc. their videos still get played alongside Brittany Spears and the like.
B0006IIKS0|4.0|I was never a Metallica fan, and yet I spent five nights watching the various bits of this DVD, completely fascinated by most of it. It's an incredibly personal look at the individual personalities within a band that most fans think of as idols and/or unreachable. Now, I feel as if I almost know them. The movie itself is revealing, and the extra bits enrich the experience exponentially. There's so much great extra stuff here, which is why it took me five nights watching all of it, then listening to the band or the filmmaker's commentary while re-watching the film.<br /><br /> Watching the movie with the band commentary is like watching an episode of \\"Mystery Science Theater 3000\\". It's wry, but not particularly insightful to the film. What's most telling is their silence during the moments that must have been excruciatingly uncomfortable at the time, especially with a camera trained on their faces. Even better is the filmmaker's commentary. I'd even go so far as to say that the commentary is essential for anyone intrigued by the movie. It's fascinating to learn that the band made NO mandates regarding the final cut; Despite their reputation for controlling every nuance of their career, they granted the filmmakers full access and made no demand other than that they keep it honest and real. There are lots of cool stories that arise, too. For instance, you learn that after not playing for months, the band warmed up by playing Ramones tunes. Or, that the band gave the filmmakers free licensing in an earlier documentary, which is what led to this film being made in the first place.<br /><br /> In the process, over 1600 hours of footage were filmed. 1600! They whittled this down to two hours, which is what makes the extra footage so valuable. One scene shows the band reacting to the news of Dee Dee Ramone's death, just as they were trying to decide on a song that they were going to contribute to a Ramones tribute album. Another scene shows drummer Lars Ulrich revisiting his childhood home in Copenhagen, which is now a fertility clinic (!). Another features a fairly bizarre but entertaining recording session with Swizz Beatz and Ja Rule. Another scene shows the band performing for tailgaters at an Oakland Raiders playoff game. There are over forty extricated scenes available here, and there's a lot of fascinating stuff that didn't make final edit. Ultimately, the commentary tracks and additional scenes are just as intriguing as the movie itself, which is what makes this DVD so vital, especially to fans of the film.<br /><br />If you saw \\"Some Kind of Monster\\" in the theater and liked it, then you will definitely want this DVD. If you didn't see the movie, don't let yourself be put off, thinking that it's a `heavy metal' movie.  This is a riveting documentary that completely humanizes the band. Their portrayal is three-dimensional, and the extra footage only helps to make the experience more fascinating, while keeping every last bit real. I might have spent five nights of my life watching Metallica struggle, but I feel as though it was worth every minute.  A- Tom Ryanood home in Copenhagen, which is now a fertility clinic (!).

B00006M183|4.0|Riot Act (2002.), the Pearl Jam's seventh studio album<br /><br />For me, the rock band which defined the 90's were without question the Pearl Jam. From the iconic debut that is 'Ten' which was released back in 1991, the team of Eddie Vedder (vocals), Stone Gossard (rhythm guitar), Mike McCready (lead guitar), Jeff Ament (bass) and current drummer have set trends with revolutionary rock albums (i.e. Vs.), taken risks (i.e Vitalogy) and experimented (i.e. No Code). However, as time has wore on, Pearl Jam became increasingly uncommercial with their music, resulting in low sales on their previous three albums to this one (eventhough all those albums were classic efforts). Many people sadly are now unaware of the recent music Pearl Jam have put out; plenty are amazed the band are still together. So, here is Riot Act, the most recent album from the only surviving band of the 'grunge' era in the early 90's. Riot Act has proven to be the band's least popular studio album, plus it has become another critcised work alongside this. However, is the 2002 album effort from the band who have pioneered, taken risks and experimented really just an uninspired collection of songs.<br /><br />Having bought all of the Pearl Jam's albums in chronological order, I was always going to judge Riot Act in the harshest manner, given that it is their most recent effort. All of the band's previous efforts are awesome and personally I think that Riot Act deserves its place up there with all of the band's albums. For me, it is by far not the band's best album, for that I look to Ten or Yield but still, this latest effort from the band is still great and did not disappoint me in the slightest. Many have complained about this album and the previous effort 'Binaural' as albums that lacked the passion and energy of the band's early releases. However, I personally think this is a misconstrued argument. The whole grunge thing ended a decade ago; the Pearl Jam have explored the aggressive music (i.e. Vs.), classic arena rock songs (i.e. Stuff on Ten) and Eddie Vedder has gone through the phase of dark and downcast lyrics (i.e. Vitalogy). Many just fail to realise that this band has moved on; heck that's why they've outgrown grunge ... they've EVOLVED. True, 'Binaural' and 'Riot Act' lack any songs to thrust the band back into popularity but at the same time they are albums that focus on new directions in music and different styles. Pearl Jam are a rare band in the way that they've never let profit come between their musical goals. They've always been willing to do their own thing over the years; afterall they've pioneered enough in music to not have anything to prove to anyone.<br /><br />So what about Riot Act. This is one of their more interesting albums. On the whole, Riot Act is a chilled out affair but at the same time a diverse listen. Sure, there are some songs which don't work greatly but at the same time it makes the album more interesting and shows why Pearl Jam are such a great rock n' roll band. Saying that there is a whole lot that works greatly on the album and there is some classic PJ sounding material (i.e 'Save You', '1/2 Full') and some timeless lyrics from Eddie Vedder (i.e. 'Love Boat Captain', 'I Am Mine'). This album is also important for being the first to contain inputs from the bands unofficial sixth member. Enter hammond organ player Boom Gaspar. The hammond integration on some songs is a great idea and adds a new edge to the Pearl Jam sound.<br /><br />Riot Act kicks off with opener 'Can't Keep'. Different to most album openers from the band, this song has more pent up energy beneath the surface of the music than outward power. Vedder's vocals are more reflective than anything on this track backed by a ponderous but great riff. After this, 'Save You' bursts in. This song has a classic Pearl Jam sound to it with a driving riff. Eddie Vedder's lyrics about overcoming things which pull you down in life sound good to the tune of Boom Gaspar's organ in the background. Following this is one of the highlight's of the album, 'Love Boat Captain' is a personal, quite emotional tune from the band. Vedder's lyrics are top notch here, a personal offering to the fans killed at the Denmark concert. Again the Hammond organ is a great addition. The song builds to a great climax before dying off subtlely at the end. Following this great song is 'Cropduster'. Great instrumentation, penned by drummer Cameron but the lyrics are over the top on the themes of mistakes in the world; still a good song though. 'Ghost' looks at events surrounding the world trade centre attack; Vedder's lyrics are poignant though the riffs are a little bit repetitive.<br /><br />'I Am Mine' follows, and this is another classic bit of lyrical writing from Vedder. Vedder sings about the harsh realities of life to the backdrop of soft guitars. 'Thumbing My Way' is a similar lyrical yearn, and another winning track on this album, where Vedder sings about things we feel we may have done wrong in life. After this is probably my personal favourite track on the album in 'You Are'. This song is a great piece of experimetation, with a guitar sound effect produced by running a recording of Mike McCready's guitar play though a drum machine of all things! A genius track, with a great atmosphere. 'Get Right' is classic pacy, Pearl Jam riffs with a very catchy chorus and 'Green Disease' is a short, fast but mellow rocker.<br /><br />The last third of the album opens up with 'Help, Help'; perhaps the strangest song on the album. Eddie Vedder sings falsetto, which doesn't work amazingly well, over some rather dissonant riffs from McCready/Gossard's guitars. 'Bu$hleaguer' is rather too thick sounding; I'm no fan of Bush but at the same time I'm quite surprised the band would cast their ultimate opinion on the man on an album; its never been their style before. That said, this song is funny seen live where Vedder wears a Bush mask during the song. Next though is '1/2 Full', a nice rocking song with an offbeat riff. 'Arc' follows; the standard, short experimental track that we've come to love (and hate) the Pearl Jam for putting on most of their albums. This song is OK though, a short vocal harmonisation. 'All Or None' though to me, is Pearl Jam rounding off an album in style as usual. A slow, relaxing tune which is very powerful lyrically and melodically. The band have always been great album finishers and this is no exception.<br /><br />Riot Act is another great release from the Pearl Jam. By far not their best work, it is still an interesting and entertaining album to listen and relax to. Pearl Jam are one of the better established rock band's around these days and it is quite sad that a lot of people no longer purchase their albums as they are simply unaware of the music. Riot Act is not an album I would recommend for any new Pearl Jam listener but any fan should be able to appreciate the band's creative and experimental side that has formed a big part of this album. Pearl Jam are still going and still making great albums, as Riot Act proved. The band are due to release a new album in the next few months, and hopefully it will be another classic for the band to add to their tally.<br /><br />AN EXTRA NOTE: To reviewer 'Nero's Fire Against The Christians'.

B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Mighty Re Arranger - Robert Plant and Strange Sensation<br /><br /> For those of you who have never quite gotten over the fact that Led Zeppelin decided to call it quits after John Bonham's death, I have some very good news for you. Robert Plant's new band, Strange Sensation, comes very close to capturing not just the sound, but also the spirit of Plant's latter-day Zeppelin work, imbued with a 21st century perspective. Granted, there is nothing here to suggest the highwire buzzsaw of Jimmy Page's electric guitar work, but there is plenty here to replace it. Plant himself seems to willfully avoid the falsetto squeal that he (over)used back then, but the power and familiar timbre of his voice is still there, as is the power of his presence.<br /><br />\\"Mighty Re Arranger\\" is an album full of textures - not necessarily `world' music, but rather worldly, with songs deeply rooted in North African/Moroccan rhythms and American blues structures. Robert Plant and Strange Sensation whip up an intoxicating brew that rewards multiple listens in much the same way as the classic stuff from Led Zeppelin's heyday, but the most beautiful thing here is how the album serves notice that Plant has not grown obsolete with age. Quite naturally, his perspective has matured since those heady days. Now, it is laced with a touch of world-weary ennui, so it is fascinating to here him come to terms with the contemporary world on his own terms.<br /><br /> One significant highlight is a track entitled \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" where Plant seems to be sizing up his contemporaries in today's marketplace with a raised eyebrow or two. Just as he conveys the grateful realization that he doesn't fit in, the band explodes with a burst of energy that serves as proof that he is above it all anyway. \\"Freedom Fries\\" provides more food for thought, as a wildly syncopated indictment of contemporary ignorance, particularly in regard to how a powerful culture can infiltrate, or willfully attempt to eradicate, a weaker one. A similar sentiment is presented on \\"Another Tribe,\\" wherein Plant suggests that mankind will bring warfare into heaven, as we all \\"race to justify (our) chosen one.\\" There is a clever, observant mind at work here, making it quite evident that Plant is not particularly interested in veiling his message in oblique, flowery imagery any longer. Don't get the impression that the entire album is full of complex high-falutin concepts, though. \\"All the King's Horses\\" is a love song that is as gorgeous as it is simple, with an acoustic guitar accompaniment that cannot avoid suggesting some of Jimmy Page's best work on \\"Led Zeppelin III\\", while \\"Mighty Re Arranger\\" conveys the pointlessness of obsessing on the future while propelling itself along on the back of a loping blues groove.<br /><br />This is no band of Led-Zep wanna-bes. Instrumentally, Strange Sensation is consistently excellent with an identity all their own.  With great skill, they combine versatility and eclecticism with familiarity and startling dynamics. Still though, it would be a mistake to burn bridges, and that is why there are numerous musical references to some of Led Zeppelin's strongest assets. Clive Deamer's drumming does suggest what might have evolved had John Bonham survived, especially on the powerhouse rhythms of \\"Takamba\\", while the twelve-string strum of \\"Dancing in Heaven\\" emulates the textures of that band's late work. All in all, \\"Mighty ReArranger\\" is brilliantly constructed and consistently interesting on many levels. Twenty-five years removed from Led Zeppelin, Robert Plant and Strange Sensation are finding new ways to deal with those timeless themes, and it is a wonder to behold.

B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin IV (AKA 'Untitled', 'Zoso' or 'Four Symbols') (1971.), Led Zeppelin's fourth studio album<br /><br />At the end of the 1960's and start of the 70's, Led Zeppelin proved themselves to be an utterly groundbreaking band. The band were a worldwide success, with their first three albums selling in their thousands. After the release of their great acoustic album, Led Zeppelin III, the band returned to their recording studio, an old workhouse called Headley Grange, to put together more new material. Originally designated to be a set of 4 EP releases; due to a number of delays, the material the band recorded in early 1971 was put into one album. In Novemeber 1971, the album, with cover not displaying the band's name or album title on the front was released. That said, Led Zeppelin IV has gone on to be Led Zeppelin's biggest selling album and is the greatest selling hard rock album of all time. So why has this strangely untitled album gone on to become an all time hit?<br /><br />There is something mysterious and magical about Led Zeppelin IV; the packaging and the music on the album itself sees to that and that is part of what has attracted people to get this album over the years. It has that unknown element to it that makes it so special. Jimmy Page himself quoted that he would see if the music really would sell itself without the cover displaying the band's name. He was right to assume that because the music on this album really has sold itself; and it is a deserved thing too. Eventhough this is not my personal favourite Led Zeppelin album ('Houses Of The Holy' claims that honour in my mind') there is no denying that this album displays the band at their technical best and at their most ultimately consistent and refined. There is effortless confidence seeping through rockers like 'Black Dog' and 'Rock And Roll' plus the band also keep up with their acoustic tradition with songs like 'Going To California'. However, it is probably in 'Stairway To Heaven' that the album is ultimately confirmed as the band's most popular; given that this masterpiece of a song is perhaps the most played rock song of all time. All in all, this masterpiece has become a blueprint for many rock acts to follow. Page's riffs and solo performance's are legendary, Bonham's drumming is revolutionary on this album, JP Jones shows his adept ability on the keyboards once more and Plant's vocals capture the mythical lyrics based around this album. The work is barely flawed.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin's prized masterpiece gets rolling with one of the all-time great openers in 'Black Dog'. The classic calling vocals from Plant echoed by some thunderous riffs from Page are awesome. This song is unbelievably assured ... and don't forget Page's exit solo; one of his best. Following this is the encore classic, 'Rock n' Roll'. The song's title speaks for itself; Bonham's drumming is furious and the band as a whole create loads of energy in this 3 minute rocker. Next we have a diverse acoustic based gem in 'Battle Of Evermore'. Guest mandolin player Sandy Denny adds an extra dimension to this song and the mysterious, mythical lyrics are great. After this song fades out, we come to the epic itself. 'Stairway To Heaven' is deservedly Led Zeppelin's most acclaimed song. Beautiful lyrics with a great fusion of acoustic and electric guitar sounds are legendary, as is Page's guitar solo. The end of the last verse line of 'To be a rock and not to roll' for me is timeless. What a song!<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with keyboard backed rocker 'Misty Mountain Hop'. Another song with real attitude, the slightly dissonant melody works brilliantly. Plant's vocals are powerful. Next is 'Four Sticks', for me the albums only slight rough spot, but still a great track non the less. Bonham's drumming is complex and bubbling and Page's rolling riff is good though you feel as though it could have developed into something more by the end of the track. 'Going To California' is perhaps the highlight of the band's acoustic catalogue; an unbelievably relaxing tune with more great lyrics. Finally though, we come to 'When The Levee Breaks'. I don't care whether everyone else disagrees with me, this for me is the best track the band ever made. Bonham's opening drum sequence, full of energy, has become the most sampled drum sequence of all time and it makes a foreboding start to the song. Plant's vocals are assured and the mouthorgan part in the song adds a unique eeriness to the music. Oh and I forgot to mention the riff to the song ... legendary and thrilling; I never tire of this song.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin IV is a masterpiece, no questions asked. This is the band at their technical and songwriting peak, and consistency wise, you couldn't ask for more in this album. The fact that this album sold so well eventhough the band's name isn't printed on the album just goes to show how good the music really is.

The patriotism of it all. The loner, yet hurt character. And of course who could forget the beautiful woman. \\"Yes we'll always have Paris.\\" <br /> <br />It's the style, one of a kind and exquisite. All held together by a plot point that never really existed (in reality) the letters of transit. The letters were a McGuffin, an Alfred Hitchcock word meaning something in a plot that every one wants in order to advance the story. It is the object of desire that gives the story its energy to propel it and to keep the audience wanting to know who's after it next. <br /> <br />This film could never be repeated successfully. It is of it's time and the people who came together to make it, including the actors were unique in their own character. <br /> <br />Yes, We'll always have Casablanca.

This is not so much an album for teenagers to bounce around to as it is a celebration of music.  <br /> <br />Two of my favorite songs on this album, \\"Shepherds Delight\\" and \\"Mensforth Hill\\" are not even mentioned by any of the reviewers who dis this album. Too bad for them. There is something here for fans of reggae, electronica, jazz and folk, and it's all done in an original way. Anyone looking for songs that sound like (blank) will be disappointed. <br /> <br />Punk is great. I love driving around and screaming punk songs. Who doesn't. But the aim of \\"Sandinista\\" is a much more difficult. You've gotta sit with this album for a while, and think about and let it sink in. <br /> <br />It took quite a few listens, spread out over a couple of years, but this has become my favorite clash album, and one of the most heavily played cds i have. it just fits any occasion. it is so thoughtful, and the vibe from it is rebellious but very positive. i am lifted up by these songs. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

The end of the last verse line of 'To be a rock and not to roll' for me is timeless. What a song!<br /><br />The second half of the album opens with keyboard backed rocker 'Misty Mountain Hop'. Another song with real attitude, the slightly dissonant melody works brilliantly. Plant's vocals are powerful. Next is 'Four Sticks', for me the albums only slight rough spot, but still a great track non the less. Bonham's drumming is complex and bubbling and Page's rolling riff is good though you feel as though it could have developed into something more by the end of the track. 'Going To California' is perhaps the highlight of the band's acoustic catalogue; an unbelievably relaxing tune with more great lyrics. Finally though, we come to 'When The Levee Breaks'. I don't care whether everyone else disagrees with me, this for me is the best track the band ever made. Bonham's opening drum sequence, full of energy, has become the most sampled drum sequence of all time and it makes a foreboding start to the song. Plant's vocals are assured and the mouthorgan part in the song adds a unique eeriness to the music. Oh and I forgot to mention the riff to the song ... legendary and thrilling; I never tire of this song.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin IV is a masterpiece, no questions asked. This is the band at their technical and songwriting peak, and consistency wise, you couldn't ask for more in this album. The fact that this album sold so well eventhough the band's name isn't printed on the album just goes to show how good the music really is. If you are looking to get into Led Zeppelin's music or rock music in general, this album is a perfect place to start; this best selling album will get you hooked!t of the band's acoustic catalogue; an unbelievably relaxing tune with more great lyrics.

B000B5XOY8|2.0|Ok, I saw this film in 1989 and I was excited because it was supposed to be a far cry from the '60s Batman and it was. Despite my excitement, I just couldn't find a way to get into this movie. I expect all \\"superhero\\" movies to be as good as if not better than Superman The Movie. Batman is not close. For one, Michael Keaton does not fit the role of Bruce Wayne and even back in 1989 when I heard he would be Batman I was doubtful. Batman looks patheically weak in this movie. The bums at the beginning knock him down and seemingly out with thier handguns. He practically gets his ass kicked throughout the whole movie. It probably seems that way because you don't even get to see him (Batman)that much. Jack Nicholson's portrayal of The Joker upstages everyone else in the movie.The batmobile is cool and the batwing is awesome, which brings me to a couple of points. Number one, if this high tech machine is so badass, why does Joker stand in front of it while batman fires at him with machine guns and missles and come out unscathed? Number two, how does this machine become crippled by one shot from that rediculous gun that Joker pulls out of his pants? This movie must appeal to people who either don't know the batman comic or people who have never seen a well done superhero movie (Superman). It's not that it's not worth watching, but it is a disappointment. Batman Begins, on the other hand, is EXACTLY what I would expect from a hero that is supposed to be dark and mysterious. It is, in my opinion, the equivalent in 2005 to what Superman was in 1978. I only hope Superman Returns can live up to it's expectations. It would be a shame to tarnish the image that Christopher Reeve gave us in his films. I can't wait to see how Christopher Nolan handles the Batman sequels. I'm hoping that he rewrites history and reworks the story of Batman's rivalry with the Joker in the same fashion that he made Batman Begins. One can only hope.
B000055ZB8|5.0|Nosferatu is the best silent film ever, along with The Phabtom Of The Opera and Metropolis. Also, the best Dracula movie ever, along with Horror Of Dracula and Bram Stoker's Dracula.<br /><br />Max Schreck's performance of Count Graf Orlok is still one of the most haunting performances today. And his makeup is still one of the best of all time.<br /><br />This is the 1st Dracula movie ever made, too bad Stoker's wife wanted all the copies of this film destroyed. Good thing not all of them were. To me, this is better than Bela Lugosi's Dracula, for a silent film, Schreck's role as Orlok was more haunting and disturbing than Lugosi's Dracula.<br /><br />Just remember, if you buy this film on DVD, don't get the one with Type O' Negative's music playing during the film. Get this version and you'll have a bloody good time.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This film finally answers the question I've asked since the 60's series... Why do so many criminal weirdos like Gotham City? It's been answered for me. All the nuts in the nuthouse were let out. There is a bright future for the Batman franchise if all sequels can be done in this manner. Stay true to the comic book, keep Christopher Nolan as director, and keep Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne/Batman... Michael Caine as Alfred is a nice touch too.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Once in a great while, somebody will come along and do something a little different. Tenacious D has taken rock music and the world by storm with a new take on the usual repetitive rock and roll. The pair combines comical and at times, inexplicable lyrics with  genius guitar melodies. The words and music blend perfectly, with Jack Black's surprising vocal range complimenting the relaxed tones of acoustic guitars. Tenacious D is a welcomed fresh sound in a sea of rock copycats.  <br /> <br />Rock guru turned silverscreen star Jack Black and guitarist Kyle Gass make up the dynamic duo known as Tenacious D. The pair have been jamming together for years but recently took their brainchild into the studio after J.B. hit it big in Hollywood. The sound of Tenacious D has true rock roots. Its light but hard rock style pulls from well known acts such as the Foo Fighters, Nirvana, and Phish.  The sound is so different it cannot be grouped with any other particular catergory of music.  <br /> <br />Listening to the words in any of the songs leaves you appalled and delighted at the same time. Black leaves nothing to the imagination with songs such as \\"Kielbasa Sausage\\" and \\"City Hall\\". The group takes no prisoners by questioning authority, breaking down the bands relationshp, and even pledging their alligence to satan. Long before The D was singing  songs like \\"Tribute\\", Adam Sandler was inventing the growing genre of \\"Humor Rock\\". Since Tenacious D, Artists such as Stephen Lynch, The Bloodhound Gang, and Jimmy Fallon have all added a comedic spin on music.  <br /> <br />The lone drawback of the Tenacious D album is its inability to capture the charisma and charm of the pair's wild live show. The CD version of Tenacious D lacks the improvised humor and real interaction between Black and Gass that their concerts are known for. Like the numerous Kiss albums of the past decades, the CD is great in its own right, but can't compare to the live version. The band is more comedy set tomusic, than music with humor. Even the best stand up comedians are never quite as funny on a recording as they are live, the same goes for this CD.  <br /> <br />Overall, Tenacious D is uniquely in a league of its own. They do what they do very well, and the end result is an album full of hard rocks and hard laughs. Tenacious D will last months in the CD player and has everyone singing a full range of expletives along with Jack and Kyle. Give it one listen and you will be dancing in your seat, cheering for Tenacious D's raw and upbeat style to the very last note.  <br />
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|I dont know what some of the people below me are talking about but this cd is just incredible.  I am not kidding when I say I cant stop listening to it.  Its addicting.  Some people might have the initial impression that they suck because its a female singer but trust me they rock hard.  Every song is great.  I highly recommend this to anyone who is into pop rock music, actually anyone who likes music at all would like this cd.  Pick it up.
B000ASATWQ|1.0|I'm yet to get a good CD from any of the marley brothers . <br /> <br />They win awards  but to make a long story rather short they do so simply because they are Bob Marley's sons and even they must know that. Being Bob's sons automatically  gives them an audience of a few hundred thousand.  Peddling this HIP HOP WATERED DOWN MUSIC in the name of reggae is sad. <br /> <br />If you must get something from this CD purchase the single ' welcome to Jam Rock'. <br /> <br />How Julian can win a Grammy before artiste like Sizzla and Luciano to name a few just goes to prove my point. <br /> <br /> <br />I will give this album one star simply because It was  the lowest I could rate it . <br /> <br />All songs  get a one star rating and 'Welcome to Jam rock ' gets 1.5.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|The marriage of comic books and the movies has had a stormy relationship.  From the serials of the early 40's through the campiness of the 60's \\"Batman\\" to the big-budget opuses of the past quarter century, the comic hero as movie attraction has been topsy-turvy.  Successes have included the first two \\"Superman\\" films, the first two Tim Burton-directed \\"Batman\\" films, the X-Men movies, and the Spiderman films, while the duds have included \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen,\\" \\"The Hulk,\\" \\"Spawn,\\" \\"Hellboy,\\" as well as last summer's \\"Fantastic Four\\".<br /><br />\\"Batman Begins\\" belongs to the success category.  Revamping the Batman mythos somewhat, director/screenwriter Christopher Nolan has a genuine respect for the character and does a superb job of crafting a tale that makes Bruce Wayne an even more tragic individual whose obsession with fighting crime is only equaled by his drive to prove himself as a man worthy of his family's name and reputation.<br /><br />Christian Bale, late of so many critically acclaimed (yet not mega-hits) films, is deserving of a wider audience and the popularity of this film has gotten him noticed by filmgoers that may not have seen his other films.  He assays his role wonderfully and can only be better in the subsequent sequel.<br /><br />The film can't lose with a supporting cast as brilliant and talented as Oscar nominees/winners Morgan Freeman, Michael Caine, and Liam Neeson.  Chameleon actor Gary Oldman gets to be a \\"hero\\" as he portrays a young \\"Jim Gordon,\\" the character that would later become Batman's ally in the police department.  Perennial villain Rutger Hauer is also on hand as CEO of Wayne Enterprises and his limited screen time is well spent.<br /><br />Cillian Murphy's \\"Scarecrow\\" is so frightening that it would be great to see him as the chief adversary in any future Bat-film.<br /><br />The great dialogue in the script allows each character to deliver at least one ZINGER line, something that was sorely missed in the first X-Men film.<br /><br />The \\"look\\" of the film, though reminiscent of the Burton films, has enough of an individuality that makes it refreshingly new.<br /><br />And the new Batmobile??? At first, I thought it hideous, but when I saw it in action, I found it to be the perfect tool for \\"The Dark Knight\\".<br /><br />All the extras on the bonus DVD, as well as the comic book contained within, are worthy of multiple visits.<br /><br />If the makers of the new Superman film do half the job that Nolan, Bale, and company did on this one, they should have a winner of their hands.film, though reminiscent of the Burton films, has enough of an individuality that makes it refreshingly new.

B000AMJDHY|4.0|i first heard P!ATD at purevolume two months ago. one song alone made me realise i need to hear much more. i bought it a month ago. and ever since i need at least one spin a day to feel better.  dont trust me. just listen to the samples and buy the album.
B00005JO1G|3.0|Sam Mendes has made two other films, both very fine and very different: \\"American Beauty,\\" an evisceration of American Society and \\"Road to Perdition,\\" a `30's-era film about family, fathers and revenge. Both films have strong emotional centers and defined points-of-view both things that Mendes' latest does not.<br /><br />\\"Jarhead\\" is about Anthony Swofford (a detached Jake Gyllenhaal) and his experiences training for/being in and living through Desert Storm. There are the requisite scenes of Marine camaraderie, tough drill sergeant stuff and basic guy-to guy humiliation. And these scenes are humorous at times and sometimes not.<br /><br />The problem with \\"Jarhead\\"is that, at its core it is empty and more damaging...it is often boring. Once Swofford and his company arrive in the Middle East, it's a lot of waiting, more training and even more training. And when it finally dawns on us that there will be no actual combat...that Swofford will never actually aim and shoot his rifle at an enemy, we are more than ready for the ordeal to be over.<br /><br />Most of the performances lack energy and this we can only place on the shoulders of Mendes for Gyllenhall, Jamie Foxx and the formidable Chris Cooper have been excellent elsewhere. The only palpable energy is generated by a showing, to the company of Marines, of the helicopters swooping down onto a Viet Nam village scene to the strains of the \\"Ride of the Walkueres\\" in Coppola's \\"Apocalypse Now\\": an unfortunate reminder of how a war film should be made.<br /><br />Though beautiful to look at because of Roger Deakins's gorgeous, evocative camerawork, \\"Jarhead\\" is like a beautifully wrapped gift when, upon untying the bow, you find the box sadly and forlornly empty.

B000ASDFJU|3.0|Okay, look people...complaining about this coming out and the cost of it is a mute point.  I never really got into this show, but decided to buy this box set because I'm a completest.  Do none of you ever do bargain shopping?  I actually got this for $165 from Best Buy for crying out load--beating every other price out there, including AMAZON...if you want it that bad enough, believe me you'll find a cheap way to get it. <br />A bad point is the size of the thing, where the heck do you put it?  Use it as a doorstop?  And I really don't think this will be the new marketing strategy for most TV series...think about it...this is a half hour show with a total of 94 episodes..Most full TV series have way more than this, and the drama series of HBO are 45 minutes to an hour long in length---there is no conceivable reason that they would put complete series together for anything but this show, it was (relatively) short in its run, and it was a cultural phenomenon, AND HBO knows there are enought die hards who will buy it over an over again.
0740748475|5.0|Bill Waterson in my opinion had (and still does)  the best visual sense when it came to a little boy's imagination.  Calvin and his lovable yet 'furrrocious' :o)  tiger will forever be one of the best strips in history.  This collection is an absolute must have for anyone who enjoys the combination of wonderfully whimsical cartoon art and incredibly insightful writing.  What adult or child couldn't relate to these characters?!
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Most of the other reviews summed up the important points of the movie; I just want to say that everyone I have taken to see this movie has loved it, including many people who have never seen the tv-series which spawned it. <br /> <br />Also, what is up with the cover art?
0805066691|5.0|This is the tragic story of how the American Plains indians were exterminated from their land. It is a tragic story and will make anyone not native American want to board a ship and go back to their country of origin out of guilt!! It is however easy to cast stones at the caucasion ancestors but it was a different time. The settlers were brave and hardy family people. The confrontation was inevitable as were the results.
B000AADYYO|5.0|This is Opeths most mature release. They have put all of their signature sounds together with the twist of a mellotron. what can they possibly do next!? Who knows...but I doubt these guys are worried about that.They are just writing what they want to. The music comes so naturally to these guys. Words can't express how attached to their music I have become. To me they are the only metal band that matters. They are more about the music than any band I know. I've been listening to Opeth since the release of Still Life and I have finally got the chance to see them live, this monday at Ziggys. I am slowely seeing more and more Americans catching on to them, some are posuers but a vast majority of them actually understand the elements of their music. If everyone listened to them though, they wouldn't be as special to me. To me every Opeth release is just as good as the other. I can't compare albums to other albums because they are all just as good. The only thing that i can say is that Mikaels vocals most definitely shine on Ghost Reveries. and with the release of every album the arrangments on get tighter so that they flow a little more even..I'm am completely mesmerized by the beauty of Opeth's music, I can say no more. These guys are in control!
0375507256|5.0|It takes a while to tweak to what is happening in Cloud Atlas, but once you are there, you will find it delightful. It is one of very few novels that give you a choice of how you read it. You will find the ideal way and pace for yourself. The themes are funny, horrifying, and haunting, and will take you on a journey as variable as a cloud passing over continents. I really cannot praise this novel highly enough.
0684824906|5.0|More words have been written about Abraham Lincoln than about any other figure in the history of the world with the exception of Jesus. One reason for this is that Lincoln is the best story in American history and deserves the efforts of so many historians and writers. He rose from nothing through his own talent and efforts, gave all he had to his country, and was stuck down by an assassin. Now Doris Kearns Goodwin has thrown her hat into the Lincoln arena. It has taken the author about ten years to write this monumental study of Abraham Lincoln and his Cabinet. The focus in the book on the president's relationships with rivals-turned-colleagues makes for a somewhat trying start as the first quarter of the book cuts back and forth between Lincoln's life and the lives of William Seward, Salmon Chase and Edward Bates, the three men who vied with Lincoln for the presidential nomination in 1860. By placing these men in key cabinet positions, Lincoln, rose above emotional and personal grievances while still retaining complete control of administrative decisions at the height of the Civil War. His relationship with Edwin Stanton also highlights how Lincoln could rise above petty sleights for the betterment of the country. Goodwin is such a good writer that even this sluggish beginning is interesting and makes for good reading. Overall, the book illustrates just how difficult a job Lincoln had and exactly why he is widely considered our best president.
B00081912E|4.0|When a movie as big as \\"The Mask\\" is re-released, you might be expecting more. The same 2 deleted scenes from the first DVD, and 2 new featurettes. The featurettes are great, but the UK DVD from 1997 still has more to offer.  <br /> <br />According to director Chuck Russell, there were a few alternate endings shot for \\"The Mask\\". However, New Line couldn't take the time to scour the vaults to add them to this special edition.  <br /> <br />The DVD cover art is cheesy in the sense that New Line tried to parallel this original \\"Mask\\" release along side with \\"Son of the Mask\\". Now both \\"The Mask\\" and \\"Son of the Mask\\" covers are based around clouds and a Pee Wee Herman theme.  <br /> <br />\\"Mask\\"'s menu's are cheesy and still in need of a more modernized DVD experience... not much of an improvement from the last release, except from the addition of music from the \\"The Mask\\"'s Animated Series.  <br /> <br />Putting aesthetic value aside and focusing on the digitally enhanced movie itself and the features it does offer, the DVD is a worthwhile buy.
B000002HEM|4.0|While transferring old vhs tapes to dvd, I came across my taping of 10,000 Maniacs Unplugged.  I watched it then pulled out my cd of this album.  What drew me to this group was the charismatic & hypnotically voiced lead singer, Natalie Merchant.<br /><br />At the time I bought this, I was just getting into listening to music of other genres and bought a bunch of cds by singers & groups that were not r&b but whose music & voices moved me in some way.  I'd heard that this was a \\"folk\\" band but upon listening to this unplugged album, I felt that the songs, production & music was as soulful as anything I'd ever heard.  I think Natalie is a true artist who writes poems that translate into great songs which allows her to put a lot more emotion into her work which is exactly what I look for in any artist that I choose to support.<br /><br />I love the fact that there were additional muscians backing the group which gave the songs such a rich feel - that's what I love about the unplugged series, the orchestration, etc was terrific!<br /><br />The other thing that's great about this music to me at least is that it doesn't sound dated.<br /><br />The songs I enjoy the most are: Trouble Me, Noah's Dove, These Are Days, Don't Talk & What's The Matter Here.
B000002JPA|1.0|I purchased the Images and Words (ATCO 792148-2) CD from CDnow.   I got the correct liner notes, the disc is a factory pressing, correct in every way, with 8 tracks of W&I listed. However, the songs are not the songs of Images and words.  Turns out the music pressed onto my disc is the 10 track AC-DC Back in Black  I would suspect this is not the only wrong pressing out there.  Interesting! Hold those Reviews, this changes everything!  I gave one star to the music on my disc, but 5 stars for the real I&W  Could be why this fine cd has had a few bad reviews?
B000000WCA|5.0|Absolutely the greatest achievement in the history of music.  To heck with 5 stars, I want to give this album 56349589024594175891274350891247890571208945708914 stars! <br /> <br />From the poetic lyrics that can make you cry, to the great rhythm and dance beats that keep you moving, and right on to the musical melodies that can put a Beethoven symphony to shame, this CD has it ALL!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and buy it!
B00097DXZS|3.0|Play the CD on your CD player like you're supposed to and stop whining because you can't play it on your hipper than thou ipod.  Boo-hoo!  (Whiney voice ) \\"I can't rip Santana off and give away copies of his work from my computer.  I should be able to do whatever I want with his music.  CD players are sooo five years ago and I wanna be cool, hip, and cutting edge!\\"<br /><br />Boo-hoo!  Ya' big babies!  If you were a true Santana fan you'd own a CD player.  What are you doing listening to a CD on your computer anyway?  Go to your home entertainment center or car and pop it in there!  Technology has made people spoiled little babies who have no concern for the artist recouping from his labor.<br /><br />As to the music:  Yeah, I get it.  The forumla works.  You can push a lot of units by bringing in popular artists as guests thereby selling the product to their fanbase.  It's worked for three albums in a row and it's even working for that medicore new Earth Wind & Fire album.<br /><br />The question is, does Carlos have the guts to abandon this forumla to return to a full on Santana album without all the ringers.  I'd be happy with an album with Wayne Shorter or Herbie Hancock.  But hey, pop rules.  It's hard to turn your back on all the awards, attention and money.<br /><br />The new CD isn't resonating for me.  It's way too contrived by now and it doesn't have the stick to your ribs gut level resonance of even the last two albums.  Maybe it will grow on me.  It's well done stuff but the music is on a factory assembly line now.  Carlos tries to a validate this album by including four tunes in Spanish to give him cred, but it's so transparent.<br /><br />I'm not stupid enough to want Carlos to go back to his 70's style output.  Artists must evolve, but this whole marketing stragety gone exremely right is getting old.  Carlos has to change now once again or else.<br /><br />Who's going to be on the next CD, Kanye West and Paris Hilton?

1400032717|5.0|Wonderful book. Through the eyes of the scared, compulsive child in all of us- it never attempts to ellicit pity, and somehow you find yourself understanding completely the reasoning behind his ideas (like, counting the red cars on the way to school). <br /> <br />
B000AADYRQ|4.0|....and Plans is no Postal Service, but it's not bad either. In fact, it's pretty darn good compared to some of the earlier Death Cab records.<br /><br />I suppose what happened to me is that I got spoiled by the Postal Service. Now that one is unquestionably one of the best of the last five years. Plans suffers by inevitable comparison and to a certain extent from modest overproduction.<br /><br />Just compare Plans with the economical, elegant keyboards of Postal, which really allowed Ben's delicate vocals a perfect showcase. I've learned one thing in repeated listening though (and I've revised my earlier review accordingly), and that is to really appreciate Plans you must turn up the volume. Needless to say, the first cut \\"Marching Bands of Manhattan\\" would have easily fit into \\"Tusk\\", one of Fleetwood Mac's more misunderstood efforts, but great nonetheless.<br /><br />In the future, one can only hope that Death Cab learns from the mild missteps of Plans, as I have every reason to believe that this great band will do.

6305558167|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of this genre.  From the strong performances of the cast, notably Nicol Williamson as Merlin and Helen Mirren as Morgana, to the sensational soundtrack including the music of Wagner and Orff (Carmina Burana), this film has a magic all its own as it spins the tale of King Arthur.  Director John Boorman blends several variations of the legend together, combining some characters to fit the needs of the story, with strong battle sequences (not for the squeamish) and a compelling (and infamous) love triangle (Cherie Lunghi is gorgeous- what was she doing in the video of Level 42's hit Something About You, though?).  Look for soon-to-be-famous actors (in small roles), including Patrick Stewart, Liam Neeson and Gabriel Byrne- and sleep in the arms of the dragon.
B000003S09|5.0|KING CRIMSON - In the Court of the Crimson King  -  After many of my favorite bands: (Opeth, Porcupine Tree, Tool, etc...) Cited King Crimson as one of their biggest influences I knew I had to check it out.  Listening to this it is hard to grasp your head around the fact that this was recorded in 1969.   This album was more than ahead of its time. In fact a good friend of mine had a book about Prog-Rock and Listed King Crimson as the original prog-rock band.   There isn't much else I can say that hasn't been said.  However if you do not have this album or haven't heard it I strongly urge you to buy it....  One of the most influential albums of the last Century.

B0002S947K|5.0|One of the reasons I recently created an account at amazon.com was to write a review for Ray Lamontagne's CD \\"Trouble\\".    I had never heard of Lamontagne before I decided to buy this CD out of curiosity after reading reviews on amazon.com (thank you to the reviews that I read that encouraged me to buy this CD).  This is one of the best CDs I have ever come across...I can not believe this is a debut album from an artist.  This is beautiful music.  However, I would explain it as being \\"specific\\" music that maybe not everyone has an ear for.  It is NOT party music.  This is soul searching, reflect on life music.  I have a tendency to favor reflective, somber, beautiful music...and that is exactly what this CD is all about.  I am a fan of all music from rock to country to folk, and this is beautiful music to me.    The combination of Track #3, #4, and #5 is my favorite part of the CD.  If nothing else, lock yourself away somewhere and take time to listen to track #5 \\"Burn\\".  It deserves attention from a listener.  This is a beautiful CD from start to finish.  This music fulfills a purpose and is some of the most moving music I have heard in a long time.
