B0026IUXO2|5.0|This movie provides a glimpse into England's ruling class during the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth I. Well done entertainment.
B00B1OETJW|5.0|This is Bocelli at his best, singing Italian love songs and Elvis Pressley's Love Me Tender.  You will want to put this at the top of your Bocelli playlist and play it often.

B005MJDJQQ|5.0|This is the fourth Kurt Wallander Book I have read, I started with The Piramid.  I will keep on reading the series and anything else Henning Mankell writes.  Kurt is so real, so lonesome and so lost you want to go home and cook and clean house for him.  The story line is well done, the mystery and the solution are real.  I have one question,  why are his books available in Spanish before they are available in English?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really good and I recommend this game to everyone. It is very responsive with what you and very close to beating temple run.
B000MX7V5M|5.0|One of Alfred's best movies...good to see it again and again.  Good price for this too and it was a special gift for my husband.
B008AX18Y6|4.0|Being the 156th reviewer on this site probably left me lot less to talk about the book.  This was not my first book of Salman Rushdie, and after reading this book, I can tell you this is not going to be my last book of Salman Rushdie either.  That doesn't mean I endorse all statements and views expressed by this gentleman in all his books.  It simply means, I simply like his style of writing.  This book was no exception.<br /><br />Coming to the book itself, the author structured his writing in ten chapters.  The book is about his nine years of hideout experience across continents.  Shortly after a head of a United Nations' member state pronounced the sentence of Salman Rushdie, he went underground with the help of the British security agencies and his closed friends.  This book is about the subsequent underground run.  This book is about complex human relationships in the difficult times.  This book is about active international lobbying, with politicians, with intellectuals.  This book is about standing for a cause - a writer's privilege to write a literary article.<br /><br />The author spent first two chapters about how he became an author, including his early creations.  Those who have been reading Mr. Rushdie's work for several years now, would find this one repeated in nature, yet it's ok to read through for sake of the flow.  Those who are reading Mr. Rushdie's work for the first time, may find this one quite insightful.  These chapters talk about how the author had grown up, his early years of education, the student period in Britain, and so on.<br /><br />Throughout the book, the author presented a quite honest, sometimes brutally honest depiction of facts.  At times, it may sound like an unnecessary criticism of others.  At other times, the self criticism balances the bias.  Some sections would throw a dirty view of the British security agencies, and some sections would go all-praising for their personnel.  The dig at the politicians would match with majority's views on politicians, but all may not agree that the author was the pawn in a larger political landscape.  What is quite appreciable is the way the author cultivated and leveraged his lobbyists across countries.  The way he formed a favorable opinion in the United States, the way he made the literary societies in Europe to rally around his cause, simply describes a successful organizer.  I am sure Mr. Rushdie got enormous help from his friends, but he himself worked harder (and smarter) to win this battle against oppressive forces.<br /><br />The literary value of the book is on the higher side.  The flow of text was easy, though the size of book could have been reduced by some pages.  I would recommend this book to all who believes in a writer's freedom to write.rity's views on politicians, but all may not agree that the author was the pawn in a larger political landscape.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I first saw this at an IMAX showing when it came out.  Loved the movie and wanted to buy it as soon as it came out, but was not going to pay full price for it.  When I found this movie on Amazon for a great price and fast shipping, I was not shy about clicking buy.  Already watched 2 times since we bought it and will be watching it many more times!  Great seller and easy transaction!
B0090P98Z4|5.0|It's a very intense game so I enjoyed it very much because it keeps you on your toes and it has a lot of amazing weapons
0691143692|5.0|I ordered this book after reading an article by the author in the weekend version of the WSJ.  I had previously read a few other books on the middle east and was interested in pursuing more information on the intersection of Christian, Muslim and pre-Christian worlds.  Also, I was trying to understand to what extent our culture today (I mean Western culture) inherits its concepts, ways of thinking, architecture, vocabulary and structure from the ancients and how that influence had persisted over the ages.  Lastly, in the U.S. we learn little to nothing about Byzantium (I recall the sole reference from high school was the sack by the Crusaders in 1204 but it was never put into any context).  I wanted to understand why.<br /><br />This book was exceptionally easy to read, well-organized and straightforward.  I liked that Ms. Herrin introduces into the text an a self-conscious discussion of how she constructed the book, what she was trying to convey, and how she felt it differed from other histories or discussions that are out there.  After failing to get through Gibbon's Rise and Fall, I had no problem finding myself compelled to keep reading this text, although there were one or two chapters that were less interesting to me.  Because the book is organized in small chapters dedicated to specific topics rather than a chronological story, it is possible to skip ahead without an issue.<br /><br />Ultimately, the book succeeded in closing some of the gaps in my knowledge about the near-east and in correcting some things that I had wrong.  For example, after reading the book, I now think I understand why we don't learn about the Byzantines in the U.S.  I also enjoyed learning about the history of the Church and the various mechanizations, compromises and political fighting that underpins the modern splintering of denominations that we have today.  Regarding the ancients, it was interesting to gain the perspective that appreciation and study continued throughout the middleages in Byzantium whereas in the West Plato, Aristotle and others were only \\"rediscovered\\" in the Renaissance.  I also (as someone who works in finance) was happy to read some discussion of the economics of the empire and found the discussion on currency debasement especially germane in present times.<br /><br />Finally, the topics covered in the book touched a personal note for me as my Greek heritage stretches back to Asia Minor and Crete.  The next book for me will be on the Ottomans.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|More than half the songs are good. There are a couple that leave a lot to be desired.  But during my Spinning class....my instructor played a song...I asked ....it was Gotye...Save Me.  So, I now like that song too!  I'm saved!<br />The videos are a bit odd for my taste. But what the heck.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this trilogy it took me four days to read all three books. I highly recommended them.  Easy read wish there were
B0091REZMW|4.0|Pretty good I like it a lot you would to it is fun to play you should get it it is amazing
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|I found this story of British naval life and adventures to be interesting and enjoyable. It is based on historical events and contains detailed descriptions of sea battles and the associated sailing ship handling.  The primary proponents, while quite skilled, are presented with ordinary human frailties.  The story flows well and conveys an overall feeling of realism.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|I like about 4 songs on this CD. Oh well. At least I have a cd changer and can pick and choose what I want to hear. And download the few I like to my ipod! Too bad that I just don't like all Coldplay songs.
B005N09L5C|5.0|I love the book and movie. It is an eerie insight to man's dark side of manipulation and control. Very good movie
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Get the app because of the fun for everyone to have a little fun once in a time I'm 8 and still have a little bit of fun once again and take my word for it.  You can get buildings ponies. Love the app for kindlefire  free apps are asome
B008FPOIT6|5.0|What a delightful book! Part science fiction, part fantasy & part Wired! Wrapped up all my loves- reading, books, design, typography, friendship, technology, fantasy and quests! Better than Dan Brown's best!
B00571F26Y|4.0|A very in-depth look at the history of wheat transformation.  An eye opener if you struggle with weight, diabetes or inflammation.  Pretty deep at times so skimmed over some of the chapters. I eliminated wheat from my diet years ago and lost ten pounds. If I give in and eat it a couple days in a row I suffer with constipation and arthritic symptoms, not worth the few minutes of joy!
044024613X|5.0|This book really kept you going from beginning to end. It was a really good story with interesting courtroom drama as well as family drama. I really enjoyed it and couldn't put it down.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|there's finally a decent horse game (being a horse-lover myself,  I think this is fantastic). I just wish a majority of the stuff didn't caught gems..
B00014TJ7K|5.0|George really had a great cd with Cloud Nine.His guitar playing, the lyics make this cd really GREAT!!! Don't miss this one.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|As mentioned with other reviews - this product conflicts with position of RAM.<br />Other then that keeps it 10-15 degrees less then stock fan! Not bad.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|do not download it wont load on my kindle fire don't waste your time. there are a lot of other fun games out there
B00AW0KHMY|5.0|Who are no longer a tween but enjoy this saga. The added scenes in my opinion really should have been included in the original movie, yes, it's all about money.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is freaky. You can  hear him speaking he whispers<br /> &quot; I can see you &quot;  :(<br /><br />Also I was a over at a friends house in the dark we played . I had nightmares. But get it. Really detailed. Awesome game
B003JTHXN6|5.0|Shows how bringing himself into the workplace was a win for him, his employees, customers, and business partners. It is a fast read too. :)

B007PVHANM|5.0|A revealing well put together no rubbish documentary that tells the story. Watching this helps put the CD music into context about his life and the way the music relates
0765334798|5.0|Funny, creative, clever. A must have for fans of sci-fi comedy or Star Trek. Fast, fun read. Would recommend for sure
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I read the Tintin books as a kid, and this stays true to those books and the animated series.  I wasn't sure my kids (5 y/o boy and twin b/g 3 y/os) would like it, but it has quickly become a family favorite -- right up there with Toy Story and Despicable Me.  Excellent animation and a good story (if a tad violent at times).  These stories probably were the inspiration for movies like Indiana Jones, so it makes sense that other commenters make that connection.
B000GCFG7E|4.0|Loved it except for the sex, I don't need or want to know the details of Reacher's sexual relations...leave that to the Harlequin romance novels!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The 3rd season is just as good as the others and I hope they come out with season four soon.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|first time in years that I have actually started to lose weight, surprised how on non fast days you still want to be good. Easy diet that makes sense and works. Loved it
B0098VXMNE|4.0|Spartacus good.<br />Spartacus Strong.<br />Spartacus on steroids?<br /><br />That's pretty much it. If you're new to the saga, you might have a problem getting used to the way they speak (no one on earth really talk this way). The best way to describe it is someone thought Shakespearian speech was too difficult (and too boring) but Australian English accent wouldn't cut it either!<br /><br />So they found something in between.<br /><br />Despite a few laughs, the show grows on you. There's a lot of gory images and frontal nudity, but hey, it is not TV, it is PORN. If you're a buff guy, proud of your macho-man status, this may not be the show for you, even though the commercials may appear so, with their misleading decapitation, spilled guts and bloody mess images. Most of the guys are naked--all the time. ON YOUR FACE NAKED. So girls, (and some guys) saddle-up!<br /><br />If you're expecting History, watch HBO's ROME. If you want to be entertained, watch spartacus. The worst that could happen to you could be a overwhelming feeling that you SHOULD NOT HAVE HAD THAT BURRITO for dinner, and you must, immediately, join a gym.<br /><br />Pointing out once again AMAZON'S FAILURE TO PROVIDE CLOSED CAPTIONS AND VIEWING REWINDING may reduce you ability to fully appreciate this gory, eye-candy, thunder-muscle, series.<br /><br />P.S.: THE WOMEN ARE HOT TOO, BUT UNFORTUNATELY THIS SHOW CONCENTRATE ON THE MEN--MOSTLY.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Very predictable but great! I felt like my dog was talking to me. I have a 15 year old greyhound going through many of the same situations Enzo went through. Have a box of tissues. Funny, entertaining and sad. Highly recommend for dog or cat lovers.
B006HL9G10|4.0|It would get five stars if the function that turned off the sounds when you're using the app. Otherwise great app. It's making me meditate more.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Really glitchy and slow on the Kindle Fire. Can't use a lot of the options or visit friends. Used to be a fun game but now nothing works.
B00ARF92HK|5.0|2 bad parts in the entire movie, the first 5 minutes and like 1 minute in the last 5 minutes. Story is of course about dredd but also a DRUG. without giving to much detail I will say there are slow parts in the movie which is why i didnt quite like the first few minute but they make sense because the movie is based off \\"THE SLOW PARTS\\" (if u have seen it u know what i mean, and if not u will know what i mean).... was not sure if it was worth buying so i rented it, NOW I REGRET WASTING $4 on renting it that coulve been spent on buying the blue ray. GREAT MOVIE but of course it wouldnt do well in the movies since nearly all movies do bad now days unless its the top of the line movie that cost a fortune to make and kids movies.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|I hate this app. It is very hard to steer an could use a lot of improvements be glad it's free.
B003O86FMW|1.0|First book original storyline, but this book starts to get tiring, more of the same story in the second book.  Language pretty basic.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|It took me a long time to consider reading these books but I'm glad I finally did. I was so riveted I read the first 2 books in less than 2 days.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Staying true to it's quality, this adventure with our prehistoric friends is funny and lively.  It keeps my kids attention and they want to watch it again and again.  The quality is so well done that even I don't mind it being on auto-repeat.  :&#62;)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This rocks. Keeping up with the other episode every sunday. Now my wife is hooked and she can't wait for it to come out also.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We have watched the entire series twice ... an enjoyed it, both times!  The second time, we picked up the hints of events to come!  First class entertainment!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app! You just got to get it! You get to run,change your person and do other fun things! Have fun!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best writen series we've seen.Very entertaining.Very disappointed that there are only 9 episodes per season.Just watched season 3 and now have to wait for new season.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie and it was different from just a sci-fi thriller. Really worth the rental on this one.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|The story line is interesting enough.  Just the amount of frank nudity was unnecessary for the plot.  I would have felt uncomfortable watching this with my college-aged kids.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love this game but the only thing is when you sometimes have to get the stuff for your house but otherwise you should get this Game!!  P.S have more fun with this game than me!!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Grandson was thouroughly excited and happy to receive.  had been looking for this movie for a while and great price.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|Liked the book. Has some great points in it. Had fun discussing it with my husband and then taking the little quiz at the end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I play it all the time. I love when you update it and go to a different place. I am in Rome now. Can not wait to see were I go next. I also loved the Easter egg hunt.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game!! I just love the colors and everything you should really get it! If you get it have more fun than I do!
B004TI1WME|5.0|Love it. Tape feature is tops. Easy to use. Features a-plenty. This should be a native app. Good quality products like this one are worth paying for.<br /><br />Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;, Fire 7&#34;, DroidX
B004DM0UII|5.0|I downloaded Xiia as FAOTD and was immediately hooked.<br />I don't know what some people here are talking about permissions.<br />I doubt Xiia has something evil in mind.<br />I tested the program by entering the name of the German band Kraftwerk - not one of the most popular bands right now.<br />Sure enough, Kraftwerk`s &quot;tour de france&quot; appeared.<br />No matter what I threw at it after that, Xiia delivered.<br />A very versatile app and well worth the money it costs now.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game it does repeat the sounds but I got over it .I got this app on my kindle fire and it works extremely well it so scared me .Okay so I was playing it at about 12:00 and I was just about to die and my boyfriend texted me and the vibrations from my phone made me jump it is a really awesome game and recommend it to everyone.
B003O86FMW|4.0|If you don't want to get sucked into the trilogy, don't start reading the second book because it has no real ending so you HAVE to read the third book.
1609613937|4.0|I have liked Dr. McDougall for a long time, and his latest book is full of interesting and useful information. There is also some really good recipes included in the book. I have always admired his straight to the point style and his willingness to make sure everybody could afford the information he has to share.
B0093BUWGE|5.0|I discovered this new release as it was introduced and discussed on National Public Radio in January 2013. Mr. James has NOT compromised his commitment to art of Jazz. As with his colleague Glasper, he continues to explore and expand, which is in strict accordance with the spirit of the art form.
B0054SMID0|5.0|I love the characters in this movie - well thought out and very entertaining!  Def worth watching!! Marisa is always fun to watch and does an excellent job!  Matthew is as cool as ever!
B002SAUCBC|4.0|This book certainly kept me reading.<br />Odd, because it's entirely predictable!<br />It is great storytelling and is a superb study in how to write &#34;time driven&#34; material. I almost think Steven King wrote it as an exercise in pacing.
6301752686|5.0|Best Halloween diseny cartoon for any child or kid and for any adult to watch and re-live you child hood.
0062238868|5.0|What can be said about this American hero....that would do him justice...<br />Our hearts go out to his wife and children.....
B006L9B6TI|5.0|I love this book and reread from the beginning a few weeks after I finish it to keep the magic flowing in my life. I have seen amazing results in my life since reading this book, with the secret and the power, and thankful every day for the series and that movie. I recommend it to everyone that will listen.
B007R21JJK|5.0|I've been using the board for about 3 months now without any issues. BIOS is user friendly and the board is incredibly stable. I haven't had any crashes or unexpected reboots at all.<br /><br />Currently running with i5-3750k at stock, with 8g of ram, 560ti, Seasonic 620w bronze, and Intel SSD 160gb 520 series.<br /><br />I would recommend this board to anyone looking to use an Ivy Bridge processor.
B001BANK32|5.0|I saw the movie growing up.  No one does it like Jack Nicholson.  But, this book is outstanding!  Thank you, Stephen King, for being such an amazing storyteller.
1476719071|5.0|I myself am a big sucker for love stories. I liked that it was set in the present time and in my age group.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is a great book. I love it. I recommend this book to everyone. it is one of the best book that i have read.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|What an unexpected delight!  The premise of the book (astronaut stranded on Mars) isn't exactly original, but the genius is in the execution.  Using a log kept by the stranded astronaut as the primary means of narration, this book really held my interest - I could not put it down!  Weir did a great job of introducing the reader to some of the more technical aspects of a manned Mars mission while keeping it a very easy read and very entertaining!  I highly recommend this book to any hard sci fi fans, although I think people that don't get into sci fi much would probably find this book entertaining as well.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Good charaters, good plot, nice filming, and filmed in a beautiful area! Violent to the 9th degree though...no kiddos!! Very good for adults :D
B004TMPJP6|4.0|For the folks who do not find this app intuitive, you can find support as well as current issues at [...].  Happy reading!
B008MIMWOO|5.0|I like the Austin Powers trilogy.  It is obnoxious maybe, but very funny.  The blu-ray came packed with bonus features, and the movies themselves are always fun to watch.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Because the book was written by a neurosurgeon I found parts to be a little slow moving and technical from a medical standpoint. difficult to understand.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|i bought this for my dad for his birthday. He is a huge fan of the alien movies and absolutely enjoyed this anthology. I higly recommend this boxed set for all those fans of the Alien movies. It's a great set & an even greater buy!
B00AA0U046|4.0|Boy it's so intriguing the emotions Jimi STILL evokes after 40 years! Lots of opinions here and there about this release. Most all of you, whatever side your on, have valid opinions about this and Experience Hendrix. Me, I Love Jimi and his music but am not fanatical about it, which I think is a good thing in that I can enjoy what I chose to enjoy and not get so twisted about the way things are going with these posthumous releases. But my take is simply this: for $10 this is a lot cheaper than the bootleg cd's I used to buy 15 years ago with NO insurance of what the quality was going to be. Sure, it might be construed as 'shoddy', but ANY release after the initial 5 lp's put out when he was alive (AYE?/Axis/ELL/BOG/Smash Hits) isn't going to be what Jimi would have done had he lived to put these out. So, complaining about it is just bad JuJu. I myself am thankful for ALL the work Experience Hendrix: Janie, Mcderster, and Eddie have done over these past 15 or so years. If NOTHING ELSE, they put back the way they should be AYE/Axis and Electric Ladyland. EVERYTHING else is Manna from Heaven. All the bootlegs are still out there to peruse if anyone so desires. But the FACT that we have a Legitimate Treasure-trove of 'Library' releases at SUCH reasonable prices is just a beautiful thing. Again, all emotions aside, I commend you Janie Hendrix for not only all these releases over the past decade +, but for going through all the Legal S*** and bad vibes you had to endure getting to this place. I would guess that 99.9% of Jimi's fans wouldn't understand, or come close to knowing what you and your family had to go through in order to get here. So, no negatives here, just a hearty 'Thanks' to You and Eddie, to Al (RIP) and Jimi (RIP). It's just amazing that in the year 2013 because of your efforts, Jimi and his music still touch us in a very cool way!!  Rock On From Auburn, Wa.  Gerard Masters
B00B2PO148|5.0|I have been following the series since the first game came out on my birthday in 2008. This game series is brilliant and the art of it is very impressive. I got this  not too long after I got dead space 3 and its a really amazing peace to add to my collection. They really took their time and made a true collectors item. Totally worth it and highly recommended for any fan of the epic saga that is dead space. Looking forward to more great memories and hopefully more games from this series.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Well written!  The attention to detail and accuracy if phenomonal.  One stays in suspense until the end.  It is scarey because the plot is happening in the real world.
B000FC10WU|4.0|This was a really fun read.  Agatha Christie always can weave such a wonderful and twisted tale for one's enjoyment.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|...or at least, I don't understand the hype.  I thought this book was boring and I never really found it erotic or even that interesting as a romance.  It wasn't horrible or particularly badly written, but it just wasn't that engaging.  The hype had let me to believe that it would be racy, erotic and fascinating.  Nope.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Exciting and mind blowing. Intriguing characters and good story line. I especially like the old guy who plays Dr. Bishop.
B001QFZADA|5.0|I am reading this book with my Bible study group.  It provides insightful conversation.  We read a chapter a week and we also use the study guide to reinforce the lesson.
1600247245|3.0|The previous reader was terrific. What was the publisher thinking when making such a change. Not a smart move. At least it wasn't Scott Brick. The story itself was ok, but didn't feel like a great Bosche story. Still, it was better than 99.9% of the books published today. Unfortuately, the reader was distracting to point where I was paying attention to him rather than the story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good game, very good for young children who like horses. Competitions and choice of horses and horse tack, overall good game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|i am enjoying this book make sure you purchase the audio book too. quiet with the comparison with fifty shades of grey. only things that is alike  the heros are young billionaires and very controlling and working for a relationship.  buy this book why because it is very good and who does not want to see two jacked up people in a crazy relationship. you  want to the relationship to work so bad but both of them are so jacked up. if you meet these two in real life you would run as fast as you could.  i am looking forward to the next book.
B001UAX56A|5.0|My 4th copy. I loved it. My other copies were worn out. This album has helped me n rough times get through. Make me smile. I would suggest for young n old women.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely loved this show.  The acting and story are great.  I love this time period and totally enjoyed the show. Can't wait to see season 3!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Firefly is one of those rare shows that adds realistic science fiction to comedy,drama, and a great western! The part that really caught my eye was the use of no sound effects for the engines on the external shots of the Serenity in space. There is no sound so why add it? Great cast, great writing, wonderful sets. Not a better Sci-Fi show out there!
B001NN4162|5.0|I enjoyed it very nuch on DVD, but better on Blu-ray, and recommend it too, My son also enjoyed it.
0525953728|4.0|Ther is nothing like first hand experience . To have been there I hope there is no amplification of events in this book.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|I laughed, I cried; it's a roller coaster of emotions. Anyone who enjoys movies will enjoy this movie. Well worth the buy.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|My whole family enjoys Coin Dozer!!! We argue about who used up the coins last!!! Wish we didn't have to wait so long in between players.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|I enjoyed it very much on DVD but better on Blu-ray, It had a surprise ending and i would reccomend it.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Audrey is stunning in this story of a young girl who wants to work with the sick. I could easily re-watch it.
B000001F9E|3.0|Some of the licks are remakes and just don't cut it.  They others rock out.  I don't think I would have bought it if I had the opportunity to listen to the whole thing.
0765325950|5.0|Loved the whole store.  Enjoyed the series so much I plan to reread the entire series.  The ending was exactly what I loved.
B00867GK26|5.0|It was very good and had some sad moments in it also, My son liked it too,and we would recommend it.
B0058YPL66|5.0|Watched it in two weeks, one right after the other. Great way to catch up on a TV series not currently on.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Great series! Cannot wait for the next one to come out! Definitely worth viewing this one! i highly recommend this
B000U0F7RG|4.0|I bought this for my wife, who is a Gilmore Girls superfan and rewatches the entire series at least once a year. It's a good value for seven seasons of a TV show. The box and packaging it comes in is terrible, however. It looks like 60s nostalgia as imagined by a 13-year-old girl, sort Mad Men meets Tiger Beat. The discs themselves (and the design of the DVD menus when you play them), don't match, and my guess is that they were repackaged somehow. The packaging is also a bit cheaply made. Since my wife has seen the show so many times, I was hoping there would be lots of DVD extras, and there are some, but not a lot.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I enjoyed it very much and it had a surprise ending. My son and I will watch it again. Amuzing.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series! This series shows the power of friendship! Even the differences in each of the characters can overcome the biggest challenges with the friendships they form.
B0040HJNKC|5.0|OMG, Buddy Guy is amazing, after all these years he's still got it!  It's truly a pleasure and a must have album for anyones collection!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It followed what I thought should happen... very well written.  I love the characters and seeing how they grew up over the years... only wish there was more books to continue the saga!
B004K00NMG|5.0|It was very ammusing and had a surprise ending to it. My son has never seen it, but I am sure he will enjoy it too.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game was a little challenging at times but overall it was great.  It definitely made you use your brain.
B004NCOQCE|5.0|What a wonderful release, this blues / rock album should be in every Jimi fans collection, it's purely and totally amazing!!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This book kept my attention... very easy read...great beach book...easy to pick up and drop and pick up again.  The movie wasn't nearly as interesting to me!
B0061QD82E|5.0|IU saw it when it first came out and it is one of my favorites. I also enjoyed it more on Blu-ray.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|He gets things done but hopefully he gets his in the end for what he did. More seasons to watch.  This show was on TV some time ago.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Great movie. Nice visuals and music. It's not just a good animated movie, it's a good movie on its own. Best video game movie ever made. Great tribute on any gamer (or anyone who plays games) that grew up playing video games 80s and 90's or use to hang out in the arcades (in which don't really exist anymore). Tons of cameos and scenes for us older folks/gamers that I loved. Two bad things. Mario (and maybe Luigi) is the most well known video game character in video game history but Nintendo didn't allow him (or Luigi) in the movie. Very disappointing Nintendo. The other is the packaging for the 3D combo pack. Why in the world would you package the discs to stacked on top of each other instead of normal individual flaps/pages inserts? This could damage them.
B002A9VJ40|3.0|I gave this three stars because I didn't like it but my husband loves it and three is right in the middle. The movie is made of every cliche known to man and is lighthearted--even at the serious part.
B000VBJEFK|5.0|We enjoyed it very much and it showed a rat could cook. And it was very funny and i would reccomend it.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I watched the first season and thought it was very entertaining and thought provoking. started this season and was disappointed at the change of venue.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|One of his best books ever!!  I couldn't put it down. Saw the movie after reading the book. Stick with the book, it was way better. If I could, I'd give it 10 stars.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|I have all of Diana's CDs and even a couple of DVDs I just think she is such an amazing jazz singer and pianist...There is nothing about any of her CDs that I don't like...
B003H9M1QM|5.0|I enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed it when it first came out. I liked it better on Blu-ray than on DVD.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I Loved the first season and was surprised at how the second season ended. I am looking forward to this season.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|fun game. good graphics for kindle fire. I find this app a great time waster. will recommend this to other kindle users.
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I can't say anything bad about this CD some days the only way I can get thru a hard day at the office is to crank up What Doesn't Kill You Makes You Stronger, when my boss goes to a meeting.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|A Christmas Carol has been one of my favorites for years at Christmas time. This is very entertaing and will be enjoyed for years to come.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I'm not sure I've ever been so compelled by a book that was non-fiction.  I have described myself as an atheist for many years and yet have found myself drawn to books regarding the after-life for as long.  Maybe I was looking for proof.  I can't say.  But whatever I was looking for, I found it in this book.  Unlike some books that clearly come off as cheesy and contrived, this book doesn't try to &#34;sell&#34; you anything and does not wave a flag for organized religion, which I appreciated.  I reread the chapters describing exactly what Dr. Alexander experienced over and over.  Each time I feel more connected to the love and peace he describes.  I would highly, highly recommend this to anyone who considers themselves spiritual or seeking spirituality.  I was particularly impressed with how he put the book together (kudos to his editors) and how he bolsters the science behind what he experienced.  I was hooked from the beginning.
B008J34466|5.0|There was only one song I liked the rest of the CD sucked beyond belief I guess I'm just not a true fan.
B00838HVDA|5.0|I enjoyed it greatly, I have forgoting how good it was. Haven't seen it in years and still enjoy it.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I viewed this show on a suggestion from a friend and was pleasantly surprised at how great it is . I am hooked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a wonderful game! It is very fun to go agasist your friends and have a compatistion. My brother and me go and around and around with this game
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Stupid name but they don't have a bad song on any of their CDs I just love them...Which reminds me I need to go and see if they have anything new out.
B004G6009U|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I would recommend it to everyone. I know they would enjoy it as much as I,
B009SQOGZ2|3.0|had big expectations when saw previews, but lacked what i thought would be more exciting and or more paranormal movie.
B005CRQ2DK|3.0|Its a funny book for little kids I recommend this 100%  if you like comedy right here this is  the book
B008RYN44U|5.0|I have been a No Doubt fan forever I have always just thought Gwen Stefani was just so cute in the way she sings and performs...There has not been a single song on any of the albums that No Doubt has done (and I have them all) that I just hated...
B0030IIZ56|5.0|I enjoyed it when I saw it on DVD, but it was better on Blu-ray. My son will think so too.
B00BCJWOA2|4.0|Warner Bros. is a studio with a long and flavorful association with the gangster genre that dates back almost to the advent of sound pictures with enduring classics such as the Public Enemy, Little Caesar, White Heat and my personal favorite the Petrified Forest, continuing up to the modern era with the seminal Bonnie and Clyde and more contemporary movies such as Goodfellas, Heat, L.A. Confidential and Martin Scorsese's  Best Picture Oscar winning the Departed. While Ruben Fleischer's Gangster Squad most likely wont be joining the immortals, it is a fun and excessively exciting throwback to days of yore when the silver screen glistened with stars who could easily be identified by single names such as Bogie, Eddie G. or Cagney.<br /> Set in the post-war Las Angels of 1949, with a handsome production design by Mather Ahmad and the best cinematography any pulp action movie could ask for, provided by Dion Beebe. Beebe, an Oscar winner for Memoirs of a Geisha, but also the DP on the nourish tinged Collateral, Equilibrium and the motion picture of Miami Vice, here his camerawork is thrillingly and engulfing, every review I have read singles out his splendid work with significant praise, even the negative reviews.<br /> Praised as well critized with equal measure for it's highly stylized, often  flamboyant style of filmmaking. The movie plays successfully as a loving homage to the gangster classics it wants to immolate. The story maybe similar in ways to Curtis Hanson's L.A. Confidential, but it is actually a completely different animal aiming for the more low brow visually pleasing pulp of classic Warner gangsters. As such, I feel it is very successful, as I'm sure most will as long as they go in thinking more of Dick Tracy than Don Vito Corleone, or maybe just Al Pacino as Scarface with a slightly more colorful palette. Call it cartoonish cool.<br /> The plot involving a magnificent group of seven L.A. cops trying to take down the racket of mobster Mickey Cohen. Will recall the Untouchables and my pick for the best movie of the last fifteen years, the already mentioned L.A. Confidential. It's not in their league, but if you are inclined for this sort of pulverize entertainment, you wont be disappointed. The screenplay by Will Beall is chocked full of ostentatious hard boiled tough guy dialogue, based on a book by Paul Lieberman, it is Beall's first filmed movie script, but he is the author of the as-yet unfilmed \\"Lethal Weapon 5\\" and the \\"Logan's Run\\" redsux, at least judging from his work here it gives high hopes for those possible future projects. Yes, the story is familiar, obvious and filled with clichés, but I am not entirely uncertain that is not it's aim.<br /> Director Fleischer is a great stylist if not a great moviemaker, as the director behind the excellent and cheerfully cheeky Zombieland, but also the dismal 30 Minutes or Less, Fleischer does exhibit a wonderful visual flair which he puts to good use here in this highly visual movie.<br /> It would be nearly impossible however not to discuss the exceptional cast of Gangster Squad. Beginning with Josh Brolin in full leading man command, a fully watch able talent and likeable movie star all before getting to the fact that he is a first rate actor. All the same praise can be heaped on Ryan Gosling ten fold, it's amazing watching him play tough because he doesn't look like a bad ass, but is able pull it off on the sheer strength of his performance. I would hate to see him bogged down in action roles as he is such a great actor, probably the best of his generation, but after the exquisite Drive and the forthcoming A Place Beyond the Pines and Only God Forgives, he seems to be choosing his roles very well even in the sometimes limited action movie genre.<br /> The rest of the gagster squad is fleshed out by top notch character performers such as the veteran Robert Patrick, Michael Pena coming off a star making turn in the excellent cop drama End of Watch, Giovanni Ribisi and Anthony Mackie with Nick Nolte as the chief of police.<br /> Nolte seems to be aging like a rock, he looks like solid brick and his rhapsitty voice is only getting deeper and more gruff, as an actor he could drive fear into your heart at 71 years old with just one scowl and when he declares that this \\"isn`t a crime wave, it/`s enemy occupation\\" you believe what he has to say. Patrick himself a long dependable character star, is offered his best role since his breakthrough of Terminator 2: Judgment Day some twenty-two years earlier, as an old gunslinger who prefers a six shooter to the more contemporary tommy gun.<br /> Emma Stone is a nice surprise, sultry and with the classic good looks meet style that recall starlets of yesteryear, particularly Lauren Bacall and other classic movie femme fatales of the silver screen past.<br /> However, make no mistake this is Sean Penn's movie. Giving an electrifying performance as Mickey Cohen who happily declares that this \\"the wild ****ing west\\"\\", aas the ex-boxer turned  gangster Penn gives the movie it`s meat and it`s center. It may not be a historically accurate portrayal of the man, but it is one that wont soon be forgotten. If there is anything that elevates Gangster Squad close to greatness it is Penn's performance, a richly textured evil that reminds us every time he's onscreen why this is a gangster picture and not a cop movie.<br /> As well known for their gangster and crime films as Universal was for their monsters and MGM for their musicals, the classic Warner Bros. tradition, unlike those others still survives and waves it's flag high and proud, and while Gangster Squad probably wont win any Oscars or be highly regarded in years to come, it is a satisfactory slice of juicy pulp fiction to sustain us until their next classic rolls out.<br /><br />read my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I especially enjoy watching my success increase as my village and level grows.  The only problem I run into is that the game keeps forgetting my friends and when I go to visit them their gone.  Other than that, it's a fun addictive way to pass the time :)

B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love this book it needed 10 stars!!! I chose it because of it being a Nicholas Sparks book. It's a great book, great read. You'll not be disappointed....
B008BM9L72|1.0|This is an erotic S&M saga. It should have been described as such. found my self skipping paragraphs to try and get away from the erotica to the story itself. very disappointing. Was not impressed by the plot. Not my cup of tea.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|Ok so I started playing this game Slender Man, because all my friends said I would pee my pants right? NO WAY!  I tried an attack on Slendy but I guess that's not how it works so, not for me. It would be awesome if you could kill him.
B00407PNY2|5.0|Having seen this movie when it first came out, I enjoyed the action and drama as it kept me on the edge of my seat. I would recommend it as a classic action movie.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I adore books. I had just finished the HP series and then started getting hooked with this book. If you like mythology and adventure, you'll like this. Hope you found this helpful.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Glad the doc was inspired to write this book and pass on his experience to the medical and scientific professions.  Wish he would have touched more on his personal relationship with God.  Nonetheless, very interesting.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|If you have read 1 you need to read all of them loved the triogy. Would recommend them to everyone.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris was killed after leaving the military as a sniper. This book became a best seller after he was killed, after he had left the military.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Very well written book with a peek into the bdsm world.  Good book for people that are not into the lifestyle to read.  It will ignite your curiosity to play and explore.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Free app of the day, what did I have to lose? Saw the reviews about how scary it was, I had to try. Def wear headphones, cool sound effects you forget your playing a game. I got so engrossed that when I heard voices I felt my hairs stand up on my neck like someone was on my heels, I didn't want to look back! I really enjoyed playing, now I hope this doesn't lead to nightmares!
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|The entire series is excellent.  I highly recommend reading all of the Outlander books. It's the best series I have ever read
B00A1U2SVS|3.0|Not my favorite, but still awesome and pretty amazing considering their age and the fact that they hadn't been a band in over 30 years

B0089LOKHG|5.0|I loved this trilogy, I really did...but I really was left with more questions than answers in the end.  Lauren Oliver really developed both Alex and Julian so well, I truly feel the struggle Lena felt-I mean seriously, I was so sucked I to this story!!!!  Rumor has it they're developing a tv show for this, so maybe ill get some more side story knowledge there...I hope they do it justice.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|it was pretty fun but I could not get it for a while because it was kind of expensive for an app
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Not as good as the first 2 in the series.  Its almost as if she just had to pull together an ending.  Couldve stopped at 2...
B001P1MZNI|5.0|As I am in my thirties, sadly I never got the chace to see Sinatra live.  This album to me seems like the closest I'll get to experiencing the event. The music by Count Basie is amazing.  Franks voice is in prime form, and the between song banter / comments to the audience really give the listener the feel of being there.  I am impressed with the sound quality of this disc.  For being a &#34;live&#34; recording from the 60's, the sound / clarity is excellent!  Much better than most &#34;live&#34; albums out there from as recent as the nineties!<br />If you're a fan of Frank or the whole Rat Pack era, I'd say this album is a must.  Put it on, grab a cocktail, and go back in time. ring-a-ding-ding-baby!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This book is really nice. The way the story develops is so cool that you'll get hooked up reading it non-stop.<br />Great ending too! Good price.
B000002N25|5.0|Having been a huge Dire Straits fan, I was naturally anxious to hear what Mark Knopfler would do on his own.  I've listened to this one too many times to count.  I recently saw Knopfler open up for Dylan (row 5).  I hadn't really kept up on his many releases over the years.  Of course he was awesome.  Can't say the same for Dylan on this night.  Since the concert, I've picked up every one of his solo releases and have played them to death.  Kill to Get Crimson, Get Lucky and Shangri La stand out, all with lots of great material.  Sailing to Philly is up there too.  But I can't help but compare them to Golden Heart, and none of them hold up from end to end.  My all-time favorite Knopfler tune is Rudiger, but that's only one of many classics on this CD, and although the styles range all over the place, the songwriting is consistently a notch above his later releases.  Listening to it again as I'm writing this, there just isn't a weak track on the disc.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|I just don't get why anyone would like this movie. It was just plain bad. Very dull and boring. Like to put me to sleep faster than a sleeping pill.<br />It was more like a really bad documentary of the Iran Hostage crisis than a movie.<br />Can I get a refund?
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't wait to read the book, couldn't wait to see what happens next, can't wait to see what GIllian FLynn offers next! Really enjoyed the suspense, hope she follows through with a sequel, so I can know how life ends up- for all three of them.
B00622B3MY|1.0|It's impossible to watch! My grandson is a very patient little boy but there was nothing That I could do about it!
B000MV90IU|5.0|Bullitt is known for its signature (and ground-breaking) car chase sequence. The realism, and use of sound and editing to put the audience right in this escalating duel of muscle cars are a revelation to those who haven't seen it in its entirety, and context in the film.<br /><br />But the entire film, one of several that McQueen developed as personal projects, was a revolutionary in the tired ranks of \\"cop dramas.\\" The muted storytelling and subtle way in which plot points developed (more reminiscent of European New Wave productions than regular Hollywood output) require more of an audience than simply showing up. You have to listen to dialog, watch the characters, and realize what's going on through deduction. When you do, the car chase becomes nerve-gratingingly suspenseful from the outset. On a double-bill with [[ASIN:B004QXJZXA Le Mans [Blu-ray]]] you can appreciate that McQueen had a distinctive tone and intelligence that he wanted his star vehicles to convey. It's a pity that he didn't develop more projects like these.<br /><br />The BD comes with several extras, including a superb full-length bio pic on McQueen, and an in-depth feature on movie editing (which includes details about the car chase and other scenes in Bullitt). A period studio featurette on the film, as well as feature commentary from director Peter Yates, round out list of extras.<br /><br />Other reviews complain about the picture quality. Not every BD is a remastered release of studio print material ... So long as it's not the DVD rendering simply reprinted at BD definition, what you get on BD should be fine -- at a certain price point. These \\"value\\" BDs don't disappoint me if the rendering and menus are done reasonably well. Compared with the outright terrible [[ASIN:B000H7J9S0 The Brothers Grimm [Blu-ray]]] release, in which colors and definition go haywire in a few spots, this BD of McQueen's signature late 60s production is fine. The colors are consistent and well balanced for the film stock and cinematography of that time.<br /><br />For the current sale price, this BD is a good value IMHO for the devoted fan, or for those who've yet to see this film in its full widescreen, full-range sound presentation (important when you hear that Mustang really rev up).tock and cinematography of that time.<br /><br />For the current sale price, this BD is a good value IMHO for the devoted fan, or for those who've yet to see this film in its full widescreen, full-range sound presentation (important when you hear that Mustang really rev up).
B008673ZAQ|5.0|great book, I finished it in two days. It is hard to put this book down, you just have to finish it.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This book gives some real insight into the German mindset in World War II.  It shows a side of Hitler's military I was unaware of and demonstrates that, in many ways, we truly are all the same.  While it may have gone into more detail than necessary at times, it was a very enjoyable read.  I have recommended to friends that have enjoyed it as well.
B0013WJGJ0|5.0|Great movie, great price, great watch.  Definitely a must see!  One of the best Batman movies yet.  Can't miss it!
0679805273|5.0|This book is very special to read to you r children, but it has such motivating passages that I have read it to adults as well.  I read it to my employees.  I read it to a dying friend.  My daughter says that it felt personally written for her and was very motivating.  She is now in a PhD program at Columbia University.  Maybe it helped!
B0000025T6|4.0|I bought the vinyl on this in the '80s and never played it. So I bought the CD in 2012 and played it. Enjoyed it.<br /><br />I put this unusual album in the category \\"Labor of Love\\", the same place I put McCartney's \\"McCartney\\", Joe Walsh's \\"Analog Man\\", Costello's \\"Kojac Variety\\", Dylan's \\"Nashville Skyline\\", Little Richard's \\"Southern Child\\". Not exactly commercial...but quiet, peaceful, personal \\"retreats\\" for the Mind and Soul. (Well, Walsh's would be 'unusual' in this 'unusual' group.........).<br /><br />Gotta say that I like Springsteen as a folk singer even better than a full throated rocker. Enuff said with that. Has no bearing on the review rating.<br /><br />Bruce never sang better or...Boss experts correct me if I'm wrong..written better. The wordscapes are beautiful even if this Reviewer sees an abandoned motel on Route 9 in central Jersey on a Sunday night in February. (sounds like a song). \\"Atlantic City\\" is a particular standout, although the storyline is a little murky: something about a poor slob who takes money to enact armed vengeance on behalf of a creep, at the AC boardwalk.<br /><br />I'm not sure what \\"Nebraska\\" has to do with any of this..other than maybe the loners lookin' for a White Castle at 4:05 in the morning in Perth Amboy might be wishin' they was in the midwest, instead.<br /><br />For the critics, we do have some choice pieces, namely the predictable Chuck Berry meets Slim Whitman at Sun Records thing; and the obvious link of \\"Reason To Believe\\" to Joe South's \\"Games People Play\\". I guess the \\"Highway Patrolman\\" delivered a summons to \\"Johnny 99\\" on *that* track. :)<br /><br />[great line about listening to \\"Night of the Johnstown Flood\\" while the world crashes in].
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Strange, interesting story. It is light-hearted with an eclectic mix of characters. Nothing was what you expect and everyone was more multi-faceted than first appeared. Take a chance and have a read.
B00BP4WAZS|3.0|My 6 year old loved it, my husband and I thought it was watchable but not impressive.  Worth a watch, but not the price of an Amazon rental.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good story and I had a hard time to put it down.  The movie has good reviews that it follows the story in the book and I hope so.<br />Nicholas Sparks wrote another good one.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|This second album from Fun. is a joy to listen to. It has great messages along with fantastic beats. It's a fresh album with stunning melodies and harmonies.

B0056JJ1M8|5.0|We love this movie and realized we must own it so my son can watch it again and again as he likes to do
B001X0ZKM4|3.0|...but it is definitely ok.  Not a waste of time, but not as good as others in the series.  It's ok.

B0010AN7Z4|5.0|This is a Jack Lemmon classic.  I have seen it several times and decided I wanted to own it.<br />I have recommended it to several classic movie lovers.

If you love Bon Jovi, you will definitely love this DVD. If you aren't familiar with their body of work, this is a great introduction. You will become a fast fan!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I rated this book 5 stars because it was well written for a war era mystery, which is not easy, and every night when I got home from work I looked forward to coming back to it and immersing myself back into the story.  I  am starting another Kate Morton book next.  Thank You.

B008HT4FUW|4.0|The set I ordered was used and described as &#34;in good condition&#34;. There were a few places where the disk stuck and we had to skip forward or take them out and clean.  Other than that we enjoyed the set.

B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Our 6- and 8-year old girls love this game and I do too. It's got interesting variations in the roller coasters and effects that make it very addicting. If you have kids, you may need to limit their time or make them do educational apps before they play this game.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|Love this game but worried about the .99cent charge, hope they don't charge every month. Would anyone know the answer
B004UID2LC|4.0|As a free application, it does what I was looking for downloading videos on youtube. Thank you to the publisher.

B0058YPG2K|5.0|This is an emotional roller coaster ride!  Hats off to the writers of this fantastic story and series.  So much better to watch the uninterrupted season than on live TV.  I highly recommend this series to anyone who loves drama and unforgettable characters.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|double lame...  triple lame... adolescent hysteria by sheeple soon to be  Moonies in training .  Technically touch controlj on Kindle Fire is unresponsive.

B00BHMETKC|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed it - great acting, amazing that it's based on a true story (although the chase seen at the end is a little Hollywood addition...)
B0063HBPH6|4.0|Read this for the Storywonk book club and enjoyed it a lot. For some reason the 'Four horsemen' stuff didn't really appeal to me so much, but that's probably just a personal thing.

B005LAIGZU|4.0|The behind-the-scenes portion of the BR is reason enough for to get this movie. Shows you the thoughts and accuracy of how the SEALS actually work. The movie was great too, it feels real and was great the directors used real SEAL members to be the main characters instead of using actors for the roles.
0321146530|5.0|My question is, &#34;Why did Microsoft take so long to put the toolset in their product.&#34; This is by far the best way to program and it's implecations are far reaching and this book deserves the acclaim of which I have heard regarding TDD.  The book reads easily and I was following along in C# for the case samples provided. When used, this will have a profound effect on the way you code and I assure you, it will be a change it for the better. My sincere thanks go out to Kent Beck, and all the people that have promoted this technique. I feel fortunate to have come upon such a wonderful process.<br /><br />All my best, Kent G.

B000000WCA|1.0|Spice Girls are always going to be a classic from the 90s.  The songs are very annoying actually and I wouldn't waste my money to get it again.
B004QL7K8E|3.0|I quite enjoyed the movie. It was a little different from the usual college party which sort of had a happy ending. The UltraViolet copy howvere doesnt really work for Asian customers....should have just bought the regular version with just the Blu ray....
B009X01C64|2.0|it's too heavy. it's even heavier than the kindle itself. wish it was lighter it would have been perfect. wish I can return it for something lighter.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|When I first saw this game I honestly didn't know what it was, so I glanced at the reviews to see how people felt about it and generally saw it was supposed to be scary yet fun. So I downloaded it. And it's true what they all say-it IS scary. Omg. On the first level or whatnot, I'd already collected like 5 papers and walked into a phone booth when my brother popped into my room at the same exact moment where those skinny men popped up. I screamed like bloody crazy, needless to say. But get the game...it's addicting and fun!
B0014VPFTA|1.0|I don't know why I purchased this album. I believe I purchased them for a friend, but it was a waste.  I'm not even friends with that person and John Mayer is lame.
0345529057|4.0|I haven't started reading them yet, but the boxed set is great.  I maybe should have rated it higher and would have if I had read it.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Not bad for a tablet. I like it. I like the features and the pattern. it's just like regular yahoo mail.
B004L03B3S|5.0|Very beautiful and natural storyline.  Excellent actors all around.  I watched it several times and I enjoy it every time I see it.
B00005OAIE|1.0|I purchased this album for a friend that I am not even friends with anymore.  Wasted time & money. (my opinion.)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Because it is an excellent program with fantastic acting. We had viewed a couple of shows of season 3 and ju;st had to see earlier shows.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|I don't believe you can go wrong with this calculator it has a design similar to your basic hand held calculator. Easy to use with large keys make it even a good choice if you are looking for a  basic good looking calculator which also has addition math features which can also come in handy.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I have read all of the Mitch Rapp series and thoroughly enjoyed each one.  Vince Flynn has masterfully learned the art of intrigue, fast-paced plot, and attention to detail. I recommend this book and all the others (in order) for great reading entertainment.
B000000WFF|1.0|Spice Girls are a classic, but I wouldn't waste my money on the album again. I only liked a few songs from the album, otherwise the rest was garbage.
B000IYU9IG|5.0|Love the movie, one of my favorites.  Reproduction to DVD is good on this DVD.  There are other &#34;black market&#34; versions that did a lousy job on the DVD rendition.  This DVD does not have those blurry off colored parts like in the hotel room where Wayne and O'Hara have it out.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|I'm surprised that the avg rating is not higher, in the mid 4s at least. I found this movie incredibly entertaining both times I watched it. It has mystery and suspense, characters you care deeply about, and a great monster. The story was meaningful, so this is not a throwaway. I can see myself watching this every couple of years.<br /><br />One reviewer said that the alien wasn't done well and that he was supposed to be sympathetic but failed. I respectfully disagree. He was doing what he had to do to get home. The army made him into a scared killing machine. He liked the teacher but on the whole thought that humanity was as violent and callous. I find that situation very sympathetic. It wasn't until he (SPOILER:) picked up the kid that he realized that there are good humans out there driven by love. That's how I took it anyway. (End of spoiler)<br /><br />Anyway, it's worth watching at least once! If you liked Lost or Star Trek, that's a bonus because this is kind of a mash up in a way. I know that's a stretch but it has the mystery like Lost and adventure like Star Trek, at least.
B008C20TDG|5.0|IT STARTS WITH FOOD is Not a diet . IT STARTS WITH FOOD is easy to read and describes the Whys behind all the &#34;clean food&#34; rage.  Sure some of it is a little too CA for a Wyoming grandmother but 90% fits my life and it is a better life than I dreamed possible.  I am 66, female and have been in what I consider to be good health.  Okay some high blood pressure, a few aches and pains, need to loose some (well maybe 30) pounds and I had discovered excess sugar seemed to cause a bit of embarrassing gas.  But it really does start with food!  I read the book After 30 days following a version shared by adult daughters.  Stumbled through dragging a resigned but patient spouse with me.  Then the book came and I continued trying to follow.  I love, love, love to bake and cook in general.  This rethinking our lifestyle was not easy.  But we did it.  I feel better than I ever have I don't use wrist supports at the gym.  Doctors have repeatedly sent me to physical therapy for knee and leg issues.  It always helped but this way of eating solved issues completely!  Thanks for an amazing book.  Best self-help purchase in a long time!
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|An inspiring story of s courageous man who found his true calling in life and along the way battled and conquered his drug addiction. A great example of the love of wife, family and friends who prayed for and supported him through his battle with addiction.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|i really like this app it is good to use because my kindle is always losing battery and it tells you the temperature of the kindle, the charge, and the remaining charge to do things like mobile internet and games.  i recommend it but my kindle shut off for a day or so too but i think it was pretty long after i got the app.  i reset it and my brothers kindle shut off and still wont turn on and he never got this app and his is newer and shut off before mine.

B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Before you object, please keep in mind that this is ONE opinion about ONE aspect of the Middle-earth films.<br /><br />Ok I kept this bottled up for a long time but I must make my feelings of absolute despair known about Peter Jasckson's obsession with cheap gags and so-called \\"comic relief.\\" If you want to include SOME humorous moments I can see that as reasonable, but Jackson didn't give any thought at all to his slapstick and juvenile (and sometimes scatalogical!) humor. At least put some thought into it Jackson. Like every other element in a film expected to draw a reaction from the viewer, humor has to be EARNED. You can't have Gimli burping in the middle of a serious disagreement between two kings discussing the safety of their peoples, and expect to get an Oscar for the acting in that scene, or any others which involve Gimli's gags and pratfalls. One other reviewer on here said he had taken a class on Tolkien in college. Well, let me tell you I TAUGHT a college course on Tolkien, which testifies to my great love for Tolkien's work. The most egregious and insulting misrepresentation or misinterpretation of Tolkien's work is to cast both the Hobbits and the Dwarves as comic fools. First of all, Jackson does not seem to understand that Merry and Pippin are upper-class hobbits, with a sort of nobility, if you like. And Frodo and Bilbo are considered strange, nouveau riche, figures by the people of Hobbitown. I assume Jackson just took the easiest, most puerile route in making short characters the foolish ones, both in the Hobbit and in the LotR trilogy. The bit when Pippin volunteers for the quest and asks \\"where are we going?\\" was indeed in the book, but Jackson totally misread (or disregarded) the context of it. It was intended to be a very \\"English\\" demonstration of Pippin's wit, not a show of stupidity (it goes back to the style of Restoration Drama, wherein the upper classes were always jockeying for a chance to put their wit on display). Also, did Jackson even read The Silmarillion, or did he just disregard it as well? The Dwarves were created by one of the Valar, (just like the other races) and they were made short and stocky for a specific reason, and it most definitely was NOT so they could be laughed at by the other denizens of Middle-earth. It would not have been an issue to the other people of Middle-earth. In fact, they probably wouldn't take notice of it at all since that's just how they were created by the gods. The Dwarves accomplished great deeds in past battles against Melkor, and they even wore masks to strike fear into their opponents. They are a brave and noble race.<br /><br />Again, it's as if Jackson didn't put any thought into it at all, falling back on the low-brow humor of slapstick and hijinks. Instead of being engrossed in the film, I was constantly ripped out of it by the jokes and found myself cringing and rolling my eyes. My suspension of disbelief can only go so far. Jackson really went overboard with the gags in The Hobbit (The Fellowship of the Ring is a far better film in my estimation, despite its silliness at times). Even the great humorist Woody Allen knew when to dial back the humor for the sake of the drama (Match Point, anybody?) Shame on you Jackson, for disrespecting Tolkien's work. Now we won't get another film based on the Middle-earth legendarium for 50 years. Jackson was not the man to direct or write these films. Is it just a coincidence that for the first time in history, a film won 13 academy awards (Return of the King) and was not even nominated for any acting awards? Why? because the writing was so bad; instead of being allowed to really act, the cast members had to tell jokes and be funny throughout their dialogue. At least the Amazon reviewer seems to agree with me, charging the film with engaging in \\"tedious,\\" cheap humor. It has bothered me to such an extent that I have looked into buying a film editing program and cutting out the intrusive gags, just like that guy did with The Phantom Edit in cutting out Jar Jar's scenes and making the movie more comprehensible overall. Does anybody know of a good program for that? J.R.R. Tolkien was an intellectual and classy writer. Yes this is a book for adolescents, but Tolkien wrote it with CLASS. He would never debase himself to make a joke of Radagast perpetually having bird poop running down the side of his face. Peter Jackson has no such scruples. He wallows in the lowest of low humor. And he can't resist that infelicitous mix of elevated English speech and vulgar modern idioms. What was the deal with the retarded looking dwarf with the sling-shot threatening to stick something up Smaug's jacksie?<br /><br />I can hear the responses already: \\"The film would be too serious without comic relief.\\" Well, I ask, was The Godfather too serious? Was The Exorcist too serious? Was Flight 93 too serious? Was Syriana too serious? Or did I just miss all the gags and jokes in those movies? Moreover, there is hardly any humor to be found in the Silmarillion, which is the central work for the whole legendarium. Another response will be that The Hobbit was written for children and so it MUST have a lot of comic relief. Ok, fine, I can understand that, But for goodness' sake Peter, use your brain a little and stop wallowing in the sandbox of low-brow humor. And let a REAL WRITER write the scripts. I believe that the Silmarillion can be filmed (perhaps in the style of something like Clash of the Titans), but if Jackson directs, he's got to hand over the writing duties to someone else.<br /><br />I would also agree with others who have criticized the film for its overly-obvious CGI renderings. You'd think by now, that Weta would be able to make a character like Azog (and the goblin king for that matter) look much more realistic. I was rather shocked at how computer-y he looked.<br /><br />The bright spot really is Martin Freeman. Although his lines are not always great, he does a fine job with the material he is given.<br /><br />This is a bit of a digression, but I need to respond to those who think The Hobbit is far to short a book to warrant a trilogy of films. Remember that Jackson, in fact, is essentially working with three books: The Hobbit, The Book of Lost Tales, and Unfinished Tales, not to mention the extensive appendices at the end of LotR. He's got plenty of material to fill out three movies' worth.<br /><br />Another digression. This is a minor complaint, but it has always gnawed at me that Gollum says his name in a hacking cough. Doesn't make much sense to me. The name was supposed to have resulted from the warbling sound he made in his throat. I'm not sure how you could get \\"Gollum\\" out of a coughing sound, or how Gollum can't help but say it when he coughs.<br /><br />Well, that's my 3 cents anyway. And please remember people, this is just an opinion about ONE aspect of the films. If you like the films, humor and all, then I'm glad for you. I have no beef with anyone who has a differing opinion. I am aware that I speak for a minority of viewers, but I do hope those who find this review helpful would chime in with your own thoughts.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm enamored of this series because of its detailed portrayal of a bygone era and a society I knew little about. The story lines are riveting and the actors polished and professional. I especially liked the glimpse into the life of a servant in a noble's household--very revealing. Unfortunately, season 4 is not scheduled to premiere in the U.S. until January or February 2014! It will be a long wait.
0345529057|5.0|Fantastic. Read them all! Once you get started on this series you won't be able to put them down. The story is gritty, dark, vivid in the breadth of the realms and characters developed, and utterly enthralling. Watching the HBO production after reading them lets you know just how much better the Author can do in painting a story in your head than what even a fairly big-budgeted video production can do; the story is so rich that there is no way to convey it on TV. Highly recommended for fans of fantasy or even regular fiction.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I absolutely love this series and I recommend it to everyone who asks for recommendations. I love the adventure, the friendships, and the taste of suspense at the best parts. You feel like you are literally in a whole new world while reading. I recommend this to anyone who likes adventure, a touch of gore, and mythology, especially Greek mythology.

Cudo's to Ben Affleck and George Clooney for producing it, but Ben should have received an Oscar for his acting and of course his directing.

For a first time viewer, I would suggest doing a little research about LOA...history..geography and you will enjoy this film even more. I have the DVD and I am considering getting the Blu-Ray for the added quality and extras. As I write $10.

B008JFUNAU|4.0|In \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" a prequel to the 1939 classic, Sam Raimi presents us with a visually striking wonder that boasts a talented cast and magic-filled story. The basis synopsis involves a traveling magician and confidence man named Oscar Diggs (nicknamed Oz and played by James Franco) who dreams of doing more than entertaining small audiences in small towns. His dreams include not only being a \\"good man\\", but a \\"great one.\\" During a violent storm in Kansas in 1905, the magician is magically transported to the magical land of Oz, a realm in which his arrival indicates he's part of a grand prophecy that foretells his slaying of the Wicked Witch.<br /><br />There's no doubt that Raimi is a master of the visual arts, as is seen on display here. The vibrant colors and sweeping, majestic landscapes are beautiful and a real treat to look at. Not to mention the incredible opening sequence that really set the visual tone for the rest of the film. I didn't see \\"Oz\\" 3D but I've heard from others the movie makes great use of the technology.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in spite of the terrific art direction and special effects, there's something lacking in the story Raimi was trying to tell. Perhaps that's due to flaws in the script but there's definite inconsistencies in the tone and a couple gag-out-loud lines of dialogue that take away from the sense of wonderment in the film. At times the movie is a suspense-filled mystery, shrouded by dark overtones and shadowy characters that, frankly, I would be a little nervous to bring a little one to. At others, it's a fun-loving family film that doesn't take itself too seriously. Mix in a few overly long dialogue scenes and you get a very uneven story that doesn't quite know where to go.<br /><br />On the positive side, while there may be problems with the overall story, there's nothing wrong with the cast. Say what you will about James Franco but the actor knows how succeed with what he's given; he smiles and charms in his role as the title magician and, in my opinion, was a great casting choice. Equally enjoyable are the witches that Oz encounters, namely Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams). Weisz in particular seems to enjoy her evil role and Williams is regal as ever as the good witch. The two standout members of the cast for me, however, belong to Zach Braff, who plays Oz's assistant in the prologue, and later on voices the flying monkey Finley, and Joey King who voices the delicate yet feisty China Girl. Both of these characters have some of the most memorable lines and interject a lot of the humor contained in the film. As a treat, there's also a cameo from Bruce Campbell that will make fans smile.<br /><br />Though there's flaws in the overall story, this film is worth seeing for the sheer sense of wonder and awe. The talented cast and wonderful special effects make up for a lot of the misgivings of the movie, and make for an experience that fans of the original Oz film, as well as youngsters that have no idea who Dorothy even is, will enjoy.le as the title magician and, in my opinion, was a great casting choice. Equally enjoyable are the witches that Oz encounters, namely Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams).

B004J4WKTW|4.0|The story was impossible to put down. I always wanted to know what happened next, and it kept me guessing about future possibilities the whole time. The writing itself was purely &#34;magical&#34; and captivating, and I loved the sense of timelessness of it, even though we were given very specific dates throughout the story.<br /><br />My only &#34;complaint&#34; is that the whole competition was a bit anti-climactic, after leaving me guessing about it for the majority of the story.<br /><br />But overall, this was a fantastic story, and I am so happy that I took the time to read it!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I have read all her books and although they start to have plot similarities, I enjoy her choice of language and the surprises.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|This was a great ending to the captivating story. The only downside is that it skipped over some great plot and didn't give it enough detail for my liking.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|Love love love!!!!! Wonderful remake and move over Mr. Darcy here comes Captain Wentworth!!!!!I would definitely recommend to all of my friends.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Saw this on directtv & my copy was erased so had to replace it. The only horror movie that continues to scare despite having watched over a dozen times. And still can't determine which horror was worse - the inside or outside ones!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Lots of fun playing this on the Kindle all the kids and adults agree.  It is fun for the kids to have their own profile on it and compare how their stats compare.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|my son loves being able to take care of his own horse. it keeps him entertained for hours! love it!
B005HSL626|5.0|This has been fun for the kids, they like the fast pace of it and all the combinations to try to get upgrades.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Robert downey Jr now has 2 franchises that are huge hits....Ironman and Sherlock Holmes.......My favorite Holmes was always Basil Rathbone..but Downey has made the character his...Jude Law is great as Watson..........Who we find out is actually a man of action
006091307X|2.0|I believe you would find that the readers of this novel would fall into one of these groups: those who really sincerely love it; those who want to love it, who think they should love it, who maybe even pretend they love it, but who really don't; those who don't love it even a little bit, who want to throw it across the room when, or if, they finish it.<br /><br />Those who love it would certainly include those English professors and graduate students who love analyzing books and teasing out hidden meanings and clever puns and metaphorical references. These folks don't read a novel for its plot or characterization and generally dislike books with a clearly discernible message or emotional content. This book, then, is perfect for them. Usually their favorite book is Joyce's Ulysses.<br /><br />The second group, those who want to love it, are those graduate students and others with intellectual pretensions who can see the cleverness involved in the writing, who get some of the references and word plays and can understand some others when they are pointed out, who maybe think if they were just smarter they would like the book more. These folks, however, in their heart-of-hearts would really like a novel to make more sense and to have characters who seem real, even if exaggerated.<br /><br />Those who don't love this novel might laugh at some of the satirical comedy, including the names of the characters, and might catch glimpses of the supposed metaphorical meanings, but they would find this book to be pretentious and empty. These folks don't like to think that there are no answers, that none of life makes sense, that people cannot connect and communicate. All of that may be privately suspected, but they hope it's not so.<br /><br />I fall somewhere between the last two groups, although I tend to veer toward the last in my old age. I did not throw the book across the room; I could appreciate it on one level; but I did not love it, or even like it, at all.<br /><br />Theplot is pretty superfluous, but here it is: Oedipa Mass is named as executrix of the will of a past lover and starts finding clues about a centuries-long (possible) conspiracy involving Trystero, an alternate postal service. Three possibilities occur to her: she is hallucinating and going mad, her dead lover arranged the whole series of clues as a practical joke, or the secret conspiracy actually exists. Do we find out the answer....NO.<br /><br />Privately, I even wonder if the whole novel was a practical joke by Pynchon, satirizing post-modern writing. Surely not.<br /><br />Anyway, I do not recommend this novel to the average reader.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I have enjoyed Star Trek from the begining. The original crew was always my avorite and you can start heated arguments ovewhich captain is best! The crew ages as the series goes on and except for the first movie..which for the most part takes place on the bridge of the Enterprise...all of these films have excellent special effects......and good plots......guest stars like Ricardo Montalban.....David warne, Chris Lloyd, Kirstie Alley , and others add to the great action....Look for Lloyd as a Klingon in Star Trek III....He is very sinister and mean!
B000E1155E|5.0|One of my favorite cds to play over and over.  I never get tired of it, A. Turner has such a good voice, great album.
B0018TNMC0|5.0|Clint as  preacher might seem a stretch, but this preacher packs a punch. Michael Moriarity does a fine job in a supporting role..Look for John Russell,....Tvs&#34; Lawman &#34;in the role of the leader of a band of killers brought in to run the miners out
B002QNTNL6|5.0|Very cute movie! Enjoyable to watch - good comedy mixed with the right touch of drama. I could watch this multiple times.
B000002IAZ|4.0|This band spawned a bunch of bands...they were together as a unit far to short a time...Stills Young  and Messina all had success with later groups...some reaching bigger heights than this band, but the sound here was unique
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent novel. Richly developed characters. Movie was great too but novel has so much more, as you would expect. Look forward to reading more of his work.
B002ZG97RY|4.0|Damon has gotten better and better in action flicks....His bourne movies are excellent..this movie deals with soldiers in Iraq looking for the upper crust of Iraq's military leaders......and all the pitfalls that ensue
B009YP9L7U|1.0|I like to read the occasional romance novel for a quick escape but this was just awful. I couldn't even tolerate finishing it. It was just so cliched and contrived.
B000G0O5N2|4.0|With only a few recognizable names......this movie manages to capture the horror of war and the desperation these soldiers felt trying to get back to thier lines when an operation goes horribly wrong
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was expecting this to be just some freaky novel, but I was surprised to find it was a total love story. I felt this story represented many levels of realistic relationship struggles. I laughed outloud, I cried, and I fell in love with Fifty!
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Once again Holmes is pitted against his enemy Dr' Moriarity..........And the action is spread all over Europe....Watson finally gets married but his honeymoon is ruined by the evil Dr'
1439102813|5.0|This book gives an insight into how Alzheimer's feels to the person- as opposed to looking from the outside.  I wish I'd read the book before my husband died of Alzheimer's.  The book comforted me with the potential that he understood what I was saying even if he could not express himself.  It made my grieving easier.  I also purchased several copies for friends who have lost loved ones to Alzheimer's. Thank you to the author!
B007L4HFDI|5.0|This movie has awesome special effects  a great villian, and enough action for any 2 movies....Tobey McGuire does a great job as Peter Parker and spidey. Willem Dafoe is excellent as the Goblin....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Initially I wanted to read this because of the movie hype, but the book was s o good I could hardly put it down!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I loved that all the discs where in the same case that way you have them all at your fingertips.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|does not work. I have tried to load the game for about a week it doesn't work. I am glad I did not pay for this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book. I rushed through it so quickly the first time I missed a lot of little details. In the beginning its hard to believe someone as innocent as Ana could even try to be what Christian needs. I was able to really get a feeling for the characters and feel for them. There was times I was shocked, mortified, and blissfully happy all at once. The sex is a little repetitive and the writing could be better but, I was totally caught up in these characters and had a hard time putting this book down even the second time through. I really feel that in order for this plot to work the ending needed to happen this way. I know it's sad but, their relationship would of never worked without them loosing each other for awhile.
1426308469|5.0|Got this for my 6 year old granddaughter who can read (brag) I like the fact that there are not tons of text on each page and really nice pictures. She helped me pick it out by looking at it on amazon.com.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I missed it in the theater so glad it was on Amazon. Not at all like previous James Bond movies
B00B47NO2O|5.0|\\"The Following\\" has me hooked!  I've been trying to catch this show on FOX, but for one reason or another haven't been able to so far.  Thank goodness for Amazon Instant Video and TV Pass I can now catch up on all the episodes I've missed and be sure to catch the rest of the season.  The pilot was fantastic; with Kevin Bacon, as Agent Ryan Hardy, who is called back to active duty when the serial killer he put on death row, Joe Carroll (James Purefoy) escapes.  The action is non-stop as we learn that Joe Carroll has managed to gain access to the internet and amass a \\"following\\" of sociopaths that will kill themselves and/or others at the whim of Carroll (Purefoy.) Kevin Bacon gives an excellent performance as a damaged hero, damaged physically at the hands of Joe Carroll from a stab wound that leaves Agent Hardy with a pacemaker to keep his heart beating; damaged psychologically from having dealt with the horrific \\"art of a serial killer.\\"<br /><br />Can't wait to watch the other episodes ...<br /><br />Nicholous
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much it is better than temple run great puzzle and time waster go subway surfers
B003G4W49C|5.0|I don't read many books, but when I do I enjoy ones like these.  Ones where you can imagine being in the character's shoes.  I only like a certain genre of books which is along the lines of this, The Hunger Games, and the Maze Runner (though that one less so).
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|Decent acting and plot. Moe Intresting then police dramas you will find on network tv.  Not good for kids though.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great subject and great concept.  Would be great if he could whack booth next and save lincoln.  Delt like I was back in that period
B003SAF76Q|5.0|Great fast paced album, amazing for the gym. The best apart about parkway drive is every song on every album is worth listening too and always keeps you up.

B004WGIXX4|4.0|I believe the other movie made with the same plot was a bit better even tho I liked this 1!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|it is a lot of fun and one of my fav angry birds games<br />i like it a lot great fun
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This is a very good game for all those people who like action and fighting the evil! This is why I am giving it five star rating.
B004W25KKW|5.0|Highly enjoyable, well written book.<br /><br />Since finishing it two weeks ago I have been thinking about it regularly which is a true sign of a good book.<br /><br />I actually learned a thing or two which I have applied to my studies and it's helped enormously.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game i enjoy playing. Love the game. I can just pick up my kindle fire and start playing. The game is awesome
B0094K1PW4|5.0|We really enjoyed the movie. For me, it was as good as the classic, Stand by Me, with kids as the main characters. I would definitely recommend it :)
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game its scary if you play it with headphones turned all the way up. The only problem i had was i couldnt find the last paper!!! Then i was walking and fell out of the map! Im so confused so i just staryed a new game to see if i can beat it.
1596680296|5.0|easy to read , nice hard back book  and easy in structions  really good book. I would sudjest to anyone who love knitting their own socks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really love the game.  Play almost every day.  Find it relaxing; but challenging at the same time.  Would like to see fewer ads.
B00005JKTF|5.0|This is a wonderful love story and a cinematic masterpiece... Unfortunately the American public didn't appreciate it as much as the rest of the world.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun game, but sometimes gets boring. I like it though it takes time and some effort by  not much. I would get this app if you are interested in horses!
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|A bittersweet, sexy, heartfelt, and witty movie that both my lady and I enjoyed. These two actors are the next Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan on-screen pair.
B00BLCHYKU|3.0|It's okay. Will watch a couple more episodes though before I decide on it. The lead is certainly very engaging.
B006TKP2B2|4.0|Good underlying story of damage due to genetic engineering.  Multiple story lines keep it interesting.  Some Thai words hard to read...I wanted a glossary...glad I knew sanuck
B003LQ3YXU|4.0|The stories are interesting and the acting half decent but the effects are definitely 80's level. The quality of the visuals isn't the best but the characters are at least decent.
B00BP0Q69I|5.0|A very interesting and easy to read book.  I enjoyed readying each paged and very much like the simplified graphics and visuals used to describe the context in an elegant way.  I benefited a lot from the business model design approached and used the testing methodologies in some projects at work.  I highly recommend it for all entrepreneurs and business oriented professionals.<br />[[ASIN:0470876417 Business Model Generation: A Handbook for Visionaries, Game Changers, and Challengers]]
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app; I can take care of a horse when I cant ride my real horse. It hardly ever freezes. The only bad thing I can think of is the ads that pop up after you do certain things. But over all, I love My Horse!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game in the WORLD!!!!so addictive,but so worth it!!! I wouldn't listen to those cuckoo crazyheads who give this game a one star.MUST DOWNLOAD ThIS APP!!!best game in the history of games!!!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire soothes the rabid beast in the waiting game...  Yep  works just like the basic on the computer and comes with spider and freecell... keeps me from killing people all over town.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I really love this battery status app! It is super easy to use and it makes knowing the status of your battery levels,  and overall battery health, much easier to find than having to go thru all the settings on my kindle for the battery level estimate given by the device itself. Plus it seems to have a more accurate battery level reading,  which I prefer to the guess of the kindle meter. My dad found it first and raved about how nice and user friendly it was, so I decided to give it a shot and have been loving it ever since. I really like how it tells me how long it will take to charge, how long I have it has been since my last charge, how long it will still has left in a variety of the activities I use it for, as well as just in &quot;standby mode&quot;. I definitely give it 5 stars! Thanks for such a awesome, easy to use, and well fucntioning app. In our household it is being well used on our multiple kindles. =)
0765316994|4.0|Nice that the redshirts get their revenge!  This is a good turn around and well thought out idea for Star Trek fans and sci fi fans.
B00005AQF7|4.0|Good and timely service, finally found this product to replace my old one that was hijacked. :) - now I'm back in the pound &#34; boow-wow&#34;!
0553801473|2.0|Leaving out half the story lines makes no sense, and seems like a bad marketing idea.  But nice enough if you want to keep up on half of the main players.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think subway surfer is a good game and I am glad it was made. It has good twist and turns but doesn't show any sign of intelligent studies. Maybe see if it improved somebody's thoughts other than that the intellect of this game is golden and thank you for letting me rate it... thank you.
B0034G4OYA|4.0|I love creative animation, clean comedy and enjoy a good story.  This movie fulfills all very well.  The animation is clean and crisp.  The comedy is clean and quite funny with its references to lore, trends and music.  The characterizations and voice talent is excellent and well-cast.  The story of being sheltered, dealing with stereotypes and xenophobia rings well for today.  At the center of the story is Dracula and his 'teenage(?)' daughter voiced by Selena Gomez) who wants to go out and see the world.  Dracula (wonderfully voiced by Adam Sandler) who wants to protect her from the bad humans and does not want her hurt.  She, of course rebels and is helped by a wacky human who is at first oblivious to where he is (Hotel Transylvania - a vacation spot for monsters).  Trouble erupts but in the end, old Dracula realizes he cannot shield his daughter just teach her what is right and to be careful. I loved this movie because of the father-daughter relationship.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I have only uses it a few times,but it is just what I need for doing simple math, large, easy to read numbers readily make it great for me. Thanks
B00A83075M|4.0|Imagine the world of video game avatars and you are in the right setting.  In this delightful Disney movie, the avatars/characters of video games interact with each other while staying within the set of rules that prevent mayhem.  Well, Wreck-It Ralph, a villain in one of the games wants to change.  His desire to be a hero starts a chain reaction that brings havoc to all.  He lives with the warning that he could go over the edge like another avatar did but he goes forward.  his ideas of reality, fate and being good are challenged as he learns valuable lessons.  This is a wonderful film with some sticky moments but it is an enjoyable film for teens and adults.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Been looking for a good racing game, oh yeah I found it or maybe it found me either way its a great game and so much fun. Outstanding graphics, thanks.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like this game it is pretty easy to follow. My husband is very addicted to it he plays it every day
B006LRUVUA|5.0|I love the service and peace of mind. They are very good. Treat customers with respect whether they know programs or not. Very patient with you.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Jane Eyre is my favorite classic novel and the PBS Masterpiece Theater is my favorite movie adaptation. I spent a summer watching every version I could find just to be sure.
B0055SJVPW|3.0|I got frustrated with the way the story goes. Not at convincing and this is a good example of a plot with great potential but fell really short. The main female character could have made better choice....
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The show just keeps producing surprises and content like no other available.  The reason you loved the pilot just keeps coming back around again; you haven't seen this on TV.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|I loved this movie and it was really entertaining. Enjoyed watching it and had laughed a lot but also there are some touching moments in it too.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was an excellent book. A bit over the top in terms of the conversations between the main characters who are a bit weird (their conversations and topics are over the top in many cases!) but overall a very good read; the ending is unexpected and very sad. Of course, we know that these two kids have cancer but I guess that throughout the book we're hoping for a mircle to happen. But it's real life that kicks in instead. I'd definitely recommend this novel to teenagers and would probably use it for a class novel as well.<br /><br />Lynn
B0085KGHI6|5.0|Seeing MJ feeling intimidated by another legend.....priceless. Classic footage, ok audio. One of the Stone's all time heroes jammin' with rock & roll's best at the Checkerboard. I'd give my left nut.....
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie.  For once a movie that lived up to all the great accolades it received.  I was not disappointed.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|As often the case I am found looking for something in between my favoroite authors putting out books. Grabbed this one on a flyer mostly because it was $2.99 to download on my kindle. Pleasantly surprised by the book and the character has a lot of potential.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome app! My 5 year old and 4 year old have a blast, I enjoy the game as well. I find myself playing when the kids aren't even home!
006117758X|4.0|This guy Bukowski wears his heart on his sleeve, gets it off onto paper and gets it right. I didn't live his life, but reading his book made me feel I was standing right beside him while he was doing it, and isn't that exactly what the reading-a-book experience should be like. I didn't live a life like his, but someone close to me has and I actually bought the hardcover version of the book (because that  someone close to me hasn't got things like Kindles, any more than Bukowski would have) and posted it to him - he loved it, and maybe that's because reading Ham On Rye was a lot like reading about himself. This book is an experience, and I loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever but could use more updates in the game but still awesome to play so I recommend it for all of the world
B00138EWGG|4.0|Great album.  Continuation of the formula used for Screaming For Vengance.  Brings back a ton of memories for me.  Nostalgia aside, very very solid effort from the Priest.  Still if you haven't done so, check out older Priest.  Killing Machine, Sad Wings of Destiny, British Steel Check out entire catalog it is worth your while.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|ive always wanted a horse of my own, and since we could never afford one, now i can finally have one.
B002P79KAC|5.0|I tell my husband all the time that this is the funniest show on TV! Nothing else makes me laugh out loud! I love Sheldon!!
B004XXIHS2|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. It keeps you turning the pages and does not have the modern day requirements of sex, blood baths and course language.
B003XVYLDU|5.0|Re-reading this once again, I still marvel at the language and what that language set out to accomplish. Kurt's was a unique and valuable imagination (and conscience) that is sorely missed. Vonnegut himself rated this one of his best works. I can not disagree.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I rated 5 stars because it was an entertaining read. I am sorry I read a previous review saying the second book was much better than the first. Not true. My advice would be read THIS ONE first.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of my favorite books. I've read this several times and I still can't put it down. The word are well written and I always feel like I'm part of the book
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love these books! I will be sad once I have finished the third, wishing there were more to read.
B005HSL626|1.0|will not show up in the cloud so far Amazon is really droping the ball with their products. Not too happy with my new kindle
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|Great game but the graphics are not the best. Needs improvement on the graphics but other then that great game. PLEASE IMPROVE GRAPHICS!!!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game. I have it on my iphone. I cant wait till they add the necroa virus. Best app ever
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Should be required reading for HS students! A great alternative to mostof the liberal craptrap my daughters are expected to read...
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i do love it. it is a great game. worth hours of fun. it is really like you r taking care of a horse. the only bad thing is ads r popping up now. but i still love it.
B007REV4T8|5.0|Very good combo of sequel and prequel, answers some of the age old Bond questions and leaves you ready for #24...
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Cool game. I download it to play with my daughter. She loves the differant pets. Great. She is having so much fun playing this game. Wish they was more games like this one.
0307277887|5.0|Great!  This is a great book, unless your sick and your expecting some detailed descriptive gruesome writing about killing and torturing.  If you just like a good story with some great violence and killing though, buy it.  Part 2 is great also.
B005Y8KWNS|5.0|This app works great!!!  I enjoy being able to scan someyhing that I can't physically place in my desktop scanner.
B00BCQL7MG|3.0|Buyer beware: despite having some of the top names in Wagnerian opera on this recording, it is a big disappointment. Ren&eacute; Pape as Wotan sounds vocally fatigued, with many passages lying higher than is comfortable for him. It almost sounds like he was indisposed during the recording sessions, given that he has one of the most ample and sonorous bass voices of his generation, it's a surprise to hear him straining and pushing his way through the role. Equally disappointing is Nina Stemme as Bruenhilde, whose voice has not aged well. Her singing sounds effortful and she tends to artificially darken her voice as she applies pressure, creating a performance that is heavy and earthbound. The singers assembled for the Valkyrie chorus in Act 3 are unbelievably bad, sounding more like a parody of what people hate about opera and Wagner: shrill, uneven, and vocally affected. Still want to buy this recording? Then you will probably appreciate the brilliant musicianship of the Mariinsky Orchestra and Gergiev's passionate approach to the score. The brightest star on this venture is Jonas Kaufmann who delivers one of the best performances of Siegmund on record: vocally solid, dramatically engaged, musically insightful. If only his cohorts could have risen to this level.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Having read the first two of the trilogy, I already knew I was in for a treat, but Requiem simply put me under a spell. The scenery, I saw it; the characters, I knew them; the emotions, I felt them. I finished it within 18 hours, barely taking short breaks to eat or pee. It was a satisfying, inspiring, and heart-warming ending to a breath-taking trilogy. I'm tearing as I type this!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Kind of repetitive sometimes but the humor every week is great and the ongoing story line with all the characters is great.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wow what courage.  Fascinating vid<br /><br />Fascinating view into a world we do not know and incredible testimony of those brave enough to do the right thing.
B005MMY5RK|5.0|This is easily one of the classics. No one should ask us to rate classics, they are in a world of their own.
B007N85POS|4.0|Very Exciting! Fun.Fun.Fun! I enjoy playing in my spare time and collecting stars ...I want them all. Now let me get back to the birds.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|He (Denzel) should have won the academy award for this perfomance. However, the movie itself should have won more awards.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|While the app is good the NEW completely revised version in the Google play store (4.0.2) is a HUGE improvement over this outdated version (3.9).  come on Amazon UPDATE THIS APP!!!!!
B0041VV03A|5.0|This was a great sci fi movie and a little scary.  Makes you think about all the stuff scientist could make if they pushed far enough.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Story was wonderful, acting was superb and scenery cannot be ignored!  This is one I will watch again and again!
B004DTXJ4S|5.0|This movie is awesome as good as the rest of the Resident Evil movies.  Mila Jovovich is an excellent actress.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|The starts out a little slow, but it is a story that needs to be told. Rodriguez is a creative force that is basically unknown in the US.  He is a star overseas and his music is something you need to listen to to understand. Loved the story!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is awesome I would totally recommend it for people who have or want a horse!This app has horse racing and you c a n groom,feed,and enter your horse in a competition's.

B00B5HQKNI|3.0|I am a James Bond fan.  This movie lacks:<br />Major bond girl interaction<br />Really cool spy gadgets<br />The Bond &#34;experience&#34;<br />The movie lets Bond show his age.  If that is the case for Bond, it's time to find a new Bond.  The plot line was a little thick, with a lot of unnecessary filler.  The villain is fairly &#34;un villain like&#34;, his main &#34;weapons&#34; are thugs with automatic weapons.  If I were a Bond fan, I would see it just to say you did.  If I weren't a Bond fan, I wouldn't bother.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game is great I've never played it on pc but I wish I could, they need to add redstone to the game,there should be mods and texture packs but otherwise it is awesome
B004SBULWE|4.0|I am a heavy android user (I have a phone, a 7' unit I use primarily for reading and a 10' unit with keyboard I use when away from home).  Although android has gotten better about using memory, the ability to kill certain apps when I don't need them is much better than rebooting, and saves power.
B000JMKRKC|2.0|I was really looking forward to reding this book.  So many good reviews, I rushed to buy it when I read the synopsis of the book.  However, I was quite bored. It's a very dark gothic book filled with tragedy, and small amounts of Romance. The story is repeated at least twice thru different characters. Even though they both have a differ perspective on the events, they are basically the same. I didn't want to finish the book, but I always finish them. I would be disappointing myself if I didn't.  I was hoping that by making myself finish the book, I might by some chance love the ending, I was horribly wrong.  The end is just as disappointing as the end. I wish I wold hAve like the book, but I'm sorry to say that it is a failure.  The story could have been good, I blame it on the writer.  She just didn't pull it thru, did not put the bang in it.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Preface this with the fact that I am 50 year old geek and have been &#34;video gamed&#34; out for about three decades.  Angry birds is easily one of the most favored video games for the PC, phone or tablet.  It is fun to learn the nuances of each of the types of forts and each of the birds.  That being said, you get an infinite number of chances to figure out how to defeat each level.  At this price, give it a try, if you enjoy the game, there are hundreds of other Angry Bird variants.  If you don't enjoy it, leave it on your phone to keep your nephew or niece entertained during mass.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its a pretty good game I like it. its kinda like taking care of a real horse. I suggesest getting it
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|If you like plot lines and fairly decent character development, there's a good chance you will enjoy this move.  There is not a huge amount of graphic violence,although there is some.  The movie does put the viewed in several situations where I found myself asking &#34;what would I do if that were me?&#34;  I never had the answers, but the screen play writer sure did.  Worth seeing

B00B19DMUE|3.0|In short... No.<br /><br />This movie was decent enough but it started to grow goofy the more I watched it. It does a good job at some scares once in a while but not something I would recommend unless you are looking for a scary movie you have never seen before.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This was ordered after my wife's iPhone dove from her back pocket and into the toilet.  So far, it is definitely water resistant, but I'm still not comfortable with submerging a $600 phone in water to see if it is truly waterproof.  I don't like the gap that is between the screen protector and the display, but my wife doesn't mind it.  I just prefer the feel of the screen protectors that actually stick to the display.  I wish they had this in better colors as well.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Right when everything is good and things are falling into place, THEY KILL OFF MATTHEW!! Wrong move, regardless if the Actor was going on to do other things, they should have handled it differently, sending him off to India/New York and do some pick up shots every now and then or they could have replaced him with another actor, or put him in a coma until they decided what to do - killing Matthew off was just wrong.  I'm sure we the audience would have accepted a dream scene instead of having him die off.  I love Downton Abbey and believe it to be one of the better series I've ever watched.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Finally a movie with substance, inspired by true events and inspirational.  It gave me sense of the good in Americans and the fact that there are good people in our government who are willing to take risks to help others and have the courage to do the right thing, gave me inspiration and hope.  What made this movie so wonderfully entertaining was also the fact they didn't have to use curse words in every sentence or sex, nudity and depravity to make a great movie that was pretty awesome, inspiring, entertaining, humorous and wonderfully good to watch.  The directors, producers, script writers etc of this movie just proved that great movies can be made without all the cursing, sex, occultism and gory violence that is pushed down our throats everytime we look for entertainment...Why can't 90% or more of our movies inspire our families like this instead of the other way around?  Hollywood, take care of the next generation what they learn and see in movies is what this nation will become in the future..lets give our children some good nourishing mind food...
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The magic of Once Upon a Time is classic at best.  The characters interact great with one another, and Regina is getting soft, they'll have to pick it up a notch and get her back to her evil ways - she's the EVIL QUEEN/Stepmother not the nice one.  Rumplestiltskin/Mr. Gold is a complex character whom I have compassion for - Robert Carlyle's portrayal of the character is most excellent.  I like how they've have intertwined classic fairy tales together, it's brilliant.  Once Upon a Time is most enjoyable.
B009NX409M|2.0|I am not sure whether the movie was any good or not since it timed out in the middle of the movie and couldn't get it back.  Cleopatra did the samething.

B00005ASIL|5.0|very nice! I am learning to play the flute, and this is the first Jethro Tull cd that I've picked up. For an intro to the band, its pretty good. True, the songs could've been longer (these seem like radio edits), but if your brand new to the band, this is a good starter. Look forward to playing and learning more in the future.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It's good game and, easy to use. I would have gave it 5 stars except it was an older version

B003DT194G|1.0|Isn't this the movie with about ten minutes at the beginning of guys waiting for a train with flies landing on their face?  What a boring piece of crap!  Try \\"Ride the High Country\\" instead.  I think we've all outgrown these spaghetti westerns.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was an Awful book. I don't see what all the hype was. I would not recommend. I cannot believe some people consider this erotica. The writer simply repeated herself throughout the entire book.

This movie by Joss Whedon (The Avengers) and a little bit of your own imagination just might be how it all began.  Kirk's father, Spock's childhood, set phasers to &#34;Thoroughly Enjoy&#34;!

B00915G6WQ|5.0|Im completely thrilled. The fact season 8 starts in June.....that means this awesome intense amazing season comes out on dvd in May. That just makes me so excited. Have all 6 seasons on dvd I love them. Finally a season comes out earlier in the year. Thank you showtime. Especially all the footage I saw from season 7...wow. Im just so glad I dont have to wait till September. I will definitely buy this dvd set. I love this show. Looking forward to watching the actual episodes from this season. I watched some scenes from season 7 on youtube. I loved them. Riveting. At least in my view. So the episodes I can tell will be awesome. Again I am really excited about the earlier release date.  I will get Dexter season 7 dvd set as soon as I can once it comes out. Again thankyou very much showtime. Im not sad if the series ends after season 8.  Because I know this show I know it will end incrediably. Then I will complete my collection with season 8. I can get my Dexter fix....have all 6 seasons. And soon season 7.:)
B0031RS2HC|5.0|I found the book extremely absorbing and allowed me to escape into another world. Great distraction from other pressures in my life. I guess I am a 'Jack Reacher' fan - he is a 'bit over the top' and certainly not a role for Tom Cruise.
1401232590|5.0|I have read the vast majority of the Batman graphic novels that are considered his greatest and this is my favorite.  I love the entire story where Batman, Gordon and Dent decide what is right and what is wrong.  This one definitely focuse on the detective aspect with only a couple direct confrontations through the entire story.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book pulled me in ,in the first few pages. I simply could not put it down . I hope the movie does not disappoint.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|There are two things i dont get. 1) Why a movie this long is so Great 2) Why IN the world the academy of motion picture arts and sciences failed to give this and the movie Perks of Being a Wallflower any nominations.Seriously. To begin, yes this movie is very long, but the awesome part is that Cloud Atlas never gets boring. For those of you who have seen some of my previous reviews I try my best not to do any spoilers. But I will say The Acting(both main & supporting cast) is Incredible. The cinematography is very Captivating. The story line is so good that it is believable. If you look in a movie dictionary and look up the definition of the word masterpiece, Cloud Atlas should be next to the word. Tom Hanks and Halle Berry both deserved nominations in my opinion. More importantly, yes you should DEFINITELY watch this film. To describe this movie in one line I would say: So brilliantly acted and yet, so astonishingly underrated. With no questions asked, Cloud Atlas easily gets:<br /><br />5 Stars
B0087GZ8YW|5.0|just when I had come to grips with the fact I had read all the Rebus novels, Ian Rankin comes up with a new one. A beauty too, coming face to face with Rankin's more recent key character.
B008NA3I30|5.0|Highly recommended!  Fasinating view of the 5 year itch! The amusement ride scene along is worth watching several times to see the emotions on Daniel's face... since they mirror all he has felt since meeting Margot: apprehension, excitement, angst, passion and then back to reality.<br />Everyone will have a gap in their relationship it is up to each person whether to fill the gap or ride it out.<br />Nice to see the quirky way the married couples plays with each other... everyone has their own quirks but they are rarely shown on movies.<br />The chemistry between Daniel and Margot is electric! The way the movie comes full circle at the end is the perfect ending and does the movie justice.
B009O2XY12|5.0|My daughter loves this but I find myself playing it more often than she does.  Great little at to pass the time with.

B000MAH5O2|1.0|I'll keep it short and simple. This book is full of s***  just like Obama's campaign promises and 2 terms in office. Obama is a repeat of Bush and Clinton in terms of expanding illegal wars and bending over for Wall St to screw Americans. Nothing he says is worth a damn and neither is anything he writes. It's best to keep what little money you do have since he's wasting your tax dollars on murdering kids overseas and corporate welfare for bankers.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This game is super fun it's a MOBA just like LOL. The only problem is when finding matches online it takes forever, because it restarts the search for players every time someone quits.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I really love a good mystery and a search and find. I would recommend this game to anyone like myself. Not too hard, but not too easy.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this book because it's so like heart warming that precious Jackson would stay holding annabeth Chase´s hand and letting go of the cliff so they would fall together . I recommend this book because it may not be the correct info but it still teaches you a lot. It's the best book ever. P.S read the precious Jackson and the Olympians it's another good series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book. It has lots of detail and amusement for everyone. I think this is for people that don't get haunted by the thought of kids fighting to the death.
B00A0SKFLG|2.0|When I first saw the previews for this remake, I was quite excited. Then I heard reviews on a few podcasts and grew skeptical. I rented it from Amazon the other day and gave it a whirl. It was not as bad as I feared, but it did not meet its potential. Not even close<br /><br />As with so many adaptations of Philip K. Dick's work, the film has only passing similarity to the original story, \\"We Can Remember It for You Wholesale.\\" This is OK in films like Blade Runner, but Total Recall is so different, it seems as if the title is simply a marketing ploy, losing not only the story but the themes of the story, which Blade Runner in all it manipulations of Dick's novel still carries through. And themes are the DNA of Dick's work. So when you cut out that DNA, you are left with something else entirely.<br /><br />From here on, spoilers.<br /><br />The idea of a path between through Earth's core between Australia and the UK is outlandish, and if it had been simply a \\"nifty\\" idea that did not have any real effect on the story other than to set a tone, it could have passed, but it becomes central to the story--exposing the absurdity. The seeming reason for this method of travel is that the rest of Earth is so toxic that normal travel along the Earth's crust is impossible. Of course, later, Douglas Quaid/Carl Hauser travels outside London to meet Matthias and only a gas mask is necessary. Even then, when the government troops show up and blast holes in the building, gas masks become optional.<br /><br />Overall, the cityscapes are impressively done and the whole setting has a very Blade Runner feel. (You'll find a nod to Verhoeven's 1990 Total Recall in one brief scene.) The use of flaring light (I'm sure there's a name for the technique) gives the film a moody, futuristic feel.<br /><br />The most troubling aspect of the film though is that it robs the story of what Dick so often focused on and what Verhoeven's Total Recall still managed to retain: is Quaid really a spy or ishe living out the Total Recall experience? The story and Verhoeven's film leave that ambiguity in place. After a brief few minutes, the 2012 remake abandons any pretense of ambiguity and becomes a generic action film with a technological absurdity that I could not suspend disbelief. Avoid this film. Read the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is by all means my favorite book. It has a lot of different things than from the first hunger games and I defiantly think it is the best

1250012570|5.0|A silver pansy for remembrance . . .<br /><br />Sometimes words fail me. They feel inadequate to describe a hauntingly beautiful painting or how a passage of poetry moved me to tears or the way a piece of music captures a feeling of love or loss.  Trying to describe how wonderful Eleanor & Park makes me feel that same impotence, searching and struggling for the right words.  In a word, Eleanor & Park is unforgettable.<br /><br />Though it is a story of first love with all the insecurities, the hope, the fluttery feelings in the stomach, the pain, E&P goes much deeper than that.  It is also a terrific book for young adults to read about fitting in and finding a way to cope with feelings of isolation.  It is romantic, it is funny, and it is heartbreaking.  It is without a doubt one of the best books I have ever read.<br /><br />I loved the step back in time - big hair, overalls, punk rock - and Eleanor's description of the polyester gym suit onesies brought a flashback to my own green horror story.  The only kids those gym suits looked good on were the cheerleaders. This book captures all of those uncomfortable, terrible, wonderful feelings of being 16, not fitting in, falling in love. All of the fierce, intense emotions that you've never felt before are relived as Park and Eleanor fall in love.  Reading Eleanor & Park was like running across an old faded photograph of my first love, forgotten and hidden away in a drawer, pulling it out, and remembering, reliving the nervous excitement,  the exhilaration, the sadness, the pain I thought would never end, and the  passion of that first time my heart felt like it beat because of another person. This book affected me so deeply.  By the time I finished Eleanor & Park, I was sobbing, crying big ole honking, nasty, noisy tears.<br /><br />Eleanor and Park's story spans across the course of one school year beginning in August 1986.  Their first meeting is about as unromantic as it can get not only because it's on a school bus but also because it borders on antagonistic.  Eleanor is the new girl riding the bus to school and no one wants her to sit beside them.  She could never blend in or appear invisible which is what Park is trying to do.  He knows the bus demons very well and his strategy of flying low below the radar is a sound one. So how can he do that if this &#34;big awkward&#34; girl with wild red hair plunks down next to him? Reluctantly he lets her sit by him and promptly ignores her all while trying to figure out how to switch seats with someone else.  Eleanor is no fool. She is very much aware Park allows her to sit there on sufferance.  For days they do not talk or look at each other.  There is a full six inches of space between them at all times.<br /><br />So how do these two build a bridge to span that great chasm of six inches.? At first it's Park's comic books.  Eleanor begins to surreptitiously read over Park's shoulder. Eventually Park realizes what is happening and he paces himself turning pages to accommodate her. Park becomes fascinated and intrigued by Eleanor and vice versa.  Over time they do begin to talk about music, comic books, and swap jokes.  I loved this part of the book, that slow and gradually deepening relationship.  The first time they touch was sensual and yet so innocent:<br /><br />  &#34;He didn't look up. He wound the scarf around his fingers until her hand was hanging in the space between them. Then he slid the silk and his fingers into her open palm&#34;.<br /><br />Eleanor is at various times described as a &#34;scarecrow&#34;, as resembling a &#34;trouble doll&#34;, a &#34;gypsy hobo&#34;, and a &#34;sad hobo clown&#34;.  She declares herself &#34;fat&#34; (although I wonder if perhaps this is an exaggeration due to poor self esteem), she has lots of freckles, and she wears old, secondhand mismatched clothes with odd bits of fabric and ribbon to cover up holes and tears.  She pins her bra together.  Various nicknames are bestowed on her butthe one that sticks is &#34;Big Red&#34;.  In addition to her  odd physical appearance, she is awkward in crowds and around strangers.  Winning friends is not her strong suit.<br /><br />Beneath the surface, however, Eleanor is smart, sharp, brave, funny, a bit sarcastic, and even, surprisingly, a bit hopeful. That comes out as she constantly strives to make the best out of bad situations.  Despite her truly nightmarish home life, her cruel depraved stepfather, a biological father that cares more for himself than his children, and a beaten down mother, Eleanor still has hope.  She can't afford batteries for her Walkman or shampoo or even a toothbrush, but she writes bands, songs, and other  &#34;interesting stuff&#34; on her books  because she'd like to hear them someday.  This is her wish list.<br /><br />Park is also a misfit.  He is half Korean and resembles his mother in coloring except for his green eyes.  He not only has to deal with a bit of stereotypical prejudices because of his Asian heritage at school, but his relationship with his father is strained due to Park's disinterest in hunting, football, and driving a stick shift.  Park is into alternative music like XTC, the Smiths, Skinny Puppy, and the Misfits.  He loves/obsesses over comics like the Watchmen and X Men.  Eleanor likens his home and family to the Cleavers and the Waltons, and in comparison to hers she isn't far off the mark.  On the surface it appears Park has a perfect family and though it is very clear Park's dad loves him, it is also equally clear his father doesn't understand his oldest son who &#34;cried when he took him pheasant hunting&#34;, or why it is nearly impossible to teach Park to drive a stick when he taught his youngest son, Josh, to drive in two weeks.  Mr. Sheridan is a good father, however, who clearly loves his family.  Park's home is not a battlefield like Eleanor's.<br /><br />Park and Eleanor's story is richer for being told in in alternating POVs.  Being able to witness Park's shy advances and Eleanor's tentative responses just made me love these two more.  I cheered them, I cried when they argued, and I laughed at their jokes both public and private.  I loved how the things that made Park and Eleanor different, misfits,  were also the things that looked completely wonderful through each other's eyes.  To Eleanor, Park has &#34;magic eyes&#34;, And to Park, Eleanor's freckled body becomes &#34;candy sprinkled.&#34;<br /><br />Throughout Eleanor &Park there is an almost perfect balance of lightness and darkness, brightness and shadow, clarity and cloudiness, a chiaroscuro effect that painted a vivid, vibrant story of Eleanor and Park's reality.  Ms. Rowell crafted an  intensely realistic picture of first love between Eleanor and Park, how they complement each other, what brings them together, the obstacles they have to overcome. There is the darkness of of Eleanor's home (dark, small, dingy), and there is  Park's home, (bright, normal, secure).  His home is a temporary sanctuary for Eleanor from the gloomy, cramped, prison of Richie's house.  Park's father becomes a positive model as a father for Eleanor.  She experiences the freedom of sharing opinions, jokes, and music with Park on the bus, but at Richie's house, she is restricted, confined, forced to be as invisible as possible.  She admits that she &#34;practiced being in a room without leaving any clues that she's been there.&#34;  The joy Eleanor experiences at the mementos in her keepsake box are juxtaposed with the destruction of that box and everything in it. At school, Eleanor's English teacher  respects and even seeks out her opinions but then there's the dirty, ugly things written on her school books.<br /><br />Even the ending is a blend of despair and heartbreak but also with a touch of hope.  Eleanor & Park is not light and fluffy.  You won't see any cute, blonde cheerleaders paired up with football heroes or tattooed bad boys in this book.  What you will get is a book filled to the brim with a rich storytelling about wonderfully complex characters who meet, fall in love, and try to hold on to those feelings despite huge obstacles.  Parts of Eleanor, and, yes,  Park also, resonate deeply within me, and this is a book that has stayed with me long after I finished reading the last page.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Omg this game is like super super scarey I reccommend this for people who love love LOVE the scatter games I do<br />I mean best scathe game yet!!!
B0039HR5QS|5.0|This classic thriller has action and excitement coupled with a strong plot, brisk direction, and excellent characters  from the leads to the smallest of bit parts. Redford shines as the everyman caught in a web of deceit, while Robertson, Dunaway, and von Sydow are excellent and memorable in surprising ways.  There is no fussy self-important cinematography to get in the way of the plot or slow it down -- just twists and turns shot in the cold hard light of gritty New York -- and that suits the story perfectly.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Here is a no-fuss calculator that is easy to use!<br />The large buttons are great for quick calculating! Yeah you should use this app.
1401324649|5.0|I listen to audio books during my daily walks.  Just finished this most enjoyable, fantastic, whimsical book.  It must also be said that the enjoyment I derived from the audio version is due to the very talented Steven Crossley narration, who has each character down pat, and a sense of timing and expression that easily exploits the humor of the text.  People must have wondered at me as I walked along smiling or even laughing out loud.  Highly recommended if you want something funny and coincidentally outrageous.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|this app is really fun.  it works great on the kindle fire and is just lige gta.  i am so happy that this app exists.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|Having been to Mumbai in December, Shantaram was a recommended read that I ended up falling in love with. Do not be put off by the length. Once you start reading, you do not want it to end. I had already read the wonderful memoirs of the Maharani of Jaipur and wanted to know more about the other side of India. I now feel as if I have been to every nook and cranny of Mumbai, know all the ins and outs and look forward to learning even more (which will include a visit to Leopold's bar) when I return to Mumbai in April. Thank you Gregory David Roberts for writing this labor of love and letting us into your past life in India.

B00AGKH7K0|5.0|If all you think of when you think of Eric Burdon is &#34;House of the Rising Sun&#34;- this will definitely change your view of Eric's work. Listen to his Memorial Day, and Interview at the White House.<br /><br />He's grown up-71, and still making music you will grow to love, just like in his younger days. I liked it so much, I bought a second one as a gift for a friend.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|I listen daily to Rodriguez, have been for the last 4 months, discovering daily a new word, note or a piece of an arrangement here and there that i missed. He is a class act all by himself (Do not believe reviews comparing him to others); no two songs are alike. He writes beautifully, pay attention to his words, you will be enchanted.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I think I have read all the Scarpetta books and this one was no less wonderful than the last.  I wish someone would make a tv show out of her books.  I would be glued to the set.
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|I'll give it to them on the controls. They responded very well on my asus tablet, but to put in game description that this game is one of the scariest games is a lie. In this game there is a teleporting slender man that if you get too close to you will lose. In a scary game you should die the first few times playing this game until you figure out some kind of strategy to last longer, this was not needed. The game is simple and not scary. Music is not original either. If you want a game that may be more difficult and scary for someone under 10 then this game may work, but if you are any older than that then you will likely be dissappointed like I was.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was a great read.  It is scarey .  I wont let my granddaughter go to the bus stop alone ever, ever, ever.  There are some total freaks out there ready to ruin lives at the drop of a hat.  Jaycee is a brave woman!!!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have never really gotten into the whole zombie ordeal until recently these past couple years. The angle that Walking Dead is quite interesting. That the human race is infected regardless if the person is bitten or not. The struggles that the characters go are and can be a related...except the Walker part.<br /><br />The one thing I do love the most is the animalistic personality that each person has. They all develop into it in some fashion or another. Some go completely crazy and others are able to cope with it and adjust the circumstances. It is quite interesting. Plus I'm a find of the sista!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book shows what a true American hero Chris Kyle was. He will be missed. I highly recommend this book.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|The worst part is that I wasted two hours and $4.99 on this movie.  Although visually beautiful this movie is a huge disappointment.
B008B11R1Q|2.0|The voices were very weak and the wording was almost impossible to understand.  I puchased the CD based upon what another person had commented about the music.  We apparently have very different tastes.
B002LBKDYE|5.0|Food, Inc. was a life-changing documentary for me.  It changed the way that I think about our food system and the food that I put into my body.  I think this is essential viewing for everyone, and I recommend it to all of my friends.  This documentary, for me, starts the conversation of what we're doing wrong and how we can correct it before it's too late.  It's not a consipracy-theory kind of documentary, but it presents facts and different points of view.  In addition to Food, Inc. I would recommend Barbara Kingsolver's Animal, Vegetable, Miracle and Michael Pollan's The Omnivore's Dilemma.

159562015X|4.0|I used this test with the Board of Directors for an organization.  We were approaching our member recruitment cycle and used this strengths tests to see where as a group we were strong and what kinds of candidates we should work on recruiting.  The information about each strength and how they work together was great - I just wish there were a little more meat to the front of the book.  It described the basic principles of the test, but I wish it had focused more on different uses for the test and how an individual's results might change over time.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie is very well done. I'm not sure if its screenplay or direction or editing but there are many little things...like at the beginning of the movie we see the guy and his cat and you realize that the cat could easily kill him...  Its a very touching movie.<br /><br />The expressions, the moments, the feelings and awareness imparted by the scenes...its just well done.  The characters played their parts well.<br /><br />I wish the Amanda story had been given more development but I can see that, if it had, the flow of the movie might have changed.<br /><br />Its a five star adult movie...a movie for adults.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|The book keeps enough secrets as it unfolds to be very interesting to the end.  The story is plausible and intriguing.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Enjoyed it.  Not as good as the Hunger Games as parts of it were predictable.  I am curious how the second book unfolds.  The epilogue has me wanting more.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Hoover weaves together so many unlikely events to make this story happen that it tends to fall apart in the credibility department.  However, her dialogue is realistic and her characters are too.  They are what keep you reading even as you are asked to believe in the (almost) impossible.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this app very handy and available at a moments notice. I recommend this to anyone who wants to do simple math like<br />balancing a checkbook etc.

B005LAII08|5.0|the Blu Ray delivers crisp HD, the extras are plentiful, including a great  short of the animators having fun.  The movie itself has strong female characters, and a great focus on mom/daughter relationships.
030758836X|4.0|I could not put this book down!  It was so clever and well written I had to keep my 2 year old occupied during the day so I could read more of this book. Then, I got to the last page. I feel guilty for ignoring my family for the past 3 days because the ending of this book was horrible. It is sort of like riding an exciting roller coaster up and down, twisting and curving. Then just as you are about to drop down the highest most exciting peak and see the end is near, the ride breaks and you are told to get off. It's like the author was tired of writing and didn't have time to write an ending. So disappointing!!!!

1594744769|5.0|We all love(d) picture books, right? The pictures were what lured us in and started us reading. So wouldn't it be ingenious to create an amazing story full of quirky old photographs that pulled a struggling reader in with the images and held them with the rocking story? Well, Ransom Riggs did just that with Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.<br /><br />Jacob grew up listening to his grandfather's wild stories about girls who floated, an invisible boy, a fire starter, and the orphanage they all lived in run by \\"a bird who smoked a pipe\\". When he was young, these stories were addictive, along with the photos that accompanied them. Once he got older, though, he became skeptical and eventually confronted his grandfather about their authenticity. When Jacob's grandfather is found brutally murdered, Jacob loses it. He pulls away from everyone and everything, and his parents make him see a therapist. With the therapist's encouragement, Jacob and his father finally set off to find the orphanage his grandfather escaped to as his Jewish family was being herded into concentration camps.<br /><br />Once they arrive on the remote island in Wales, they realize it is a strange place- almost stuck in time. When Jacob finds the orphanage, his dreams are immediately destroyed with the rotting corpse of the building. But then he spies some kids- the same kids from his grandfather's photos. They take him back to the orphanage- or at least exactly how it was in 1940. The orphanage they live in is in a time loop created by Miss Peregrine, the head lady of the orphanage who can shift into a bird and protects the \\"peculiar\\" children. The children have been living for decades in the loop, and Jacob's arrival is very exciting. But when it becomes clear the peculiars are in trouble, Jacob is will to risk everything to protect them, especially Emma, the girl who once loved her grandfather. But how can a normal, boring human help the peculiars? Maybe he isn't so \\"normal\\"!<br /><br />The best way to describe this book is \\"peculiar\\". It is comforting, yet strange and different. The photos aren't the only oddities of this story, the characters, concept, and execution are strange too, but strange in an amazing, whirlwind way. Without the photos, the story still wouldn't be your average \\"supernatural\\" or \\"paranormal\\" story we see so much of today. It is a truly novel concept and execution and I couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />The writing, story, and characters are all appropriate for a wide range of students. The photos will captivate a younger or lower-skilled student and keep them turning the pages, but the story is sophisticated enough to keep a stronger or older reader hooked as well. I can see the quirky students loving this book, but the less \\"peculiar\\" students also being sucked into the interesting story. Truly, this is one of those magical books that might end up as my \\"go to\\" independent reading story for most kids. I have a few of them, my reliable all stars that work for so many students. I predict this book will soon be added to this illustrious list! Add it to your libraries and classroom shelves... you won't be sorry!he best way to describe this book is \\"peculiar\\".

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Wonderfully scripted tale of a future we hope will never be.  Flows well with great depth of characters and plot. A great read!
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Fast moving thriller with same character as other works.  Setting is believable as to the Chinese computer abilites.  Nice fiction read.
0062200399|5.0|I received this as a birthday present and have to say that I was floored when I opened it. The design on the cover, the inside art, and the back of the jacket are beautiful. I have read this story before, but now can say that I own it in hardcover and can add it to my bookshelf with alot of eagerness.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|NOT scary, NOT fun, JUST BORING, BORING, BORING.  Could not delete this garbage fast enough.  Ignore these phony positive reviews from Digital Code Works employees.<br /><br />There are no instructions, controls are impossible, graphics are horrible, entire game is incredibly stupid and absolutely pointless.  Even the music is a poorly executed playback loop.  WTF AMAZON!!!
B004KKX80A|5.0|Make sure you keep your light launcher safe because my bigbangs light launcher broke,and my dad liked the light launcher.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Good game. I am giving it 4 of 5 stars because it was not as scary as I expected. But still great game.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I thoute Minecraft was fun until March 9th when HeroBrine came on it's ok but not better then sub Way suffers.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|As a publisher I plan to buy this book for every one of my authors.  Today's writers need to understand marketing and John Locke does a great job of explaining it and giving ideas on how to do it.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a good game and its fun to play the game and I'm getting really far in the game. What a good game.
0399213015|4.0|Wouldn't leave it in little ones hands though, the pages and definitely intended for a older child with a gentle touch.
B008B68J2G|4.0|this toy came just in time for spring break. my daughter was VERY pleased to receive this monster high set as she has just become interested in these characters.  The set is SO cute! The details are not scary but appropriate to the monster high designs. It was easy to take out of the box which i cannot say for the much more popular dolls that have been around forever (B*****) The food pieces are not ulta tiny either which is good since my daughter has find motor skill delay. The monster high doll and even other brand dolls fit very nicely on the chair and things don't tip over easilyb either. Great set!
B007D5E7C2|5.0|Great DVDs!!!!!!  Kill Bil/2, what can I say, maybe two of the best martial arts movies ever!  Uma Thurman is fantastic and the extra features on the discs are really informative.  This is a two-disc DVD, not two movies on one disc.  Take a deep breath and enjoy!!!!!!!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love the game but I really want a zebra and I don't know if I will ever have enough gems to buy it.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|The only misstep was John Goodman.  The rest of the casting was dead on.  I preferred the story line of the crash over that of the addict.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read if you like the hunger games trilogy. I can't wait for the movie and watch the book in action.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|The vehicle used by the director of &#34;the stage&#34; made the movie impossible to watch. We barely made it 1/4 of the way through. Too bad because Kiera was beautiful and her acting superb.
0345803507|5.0|Exactly what I ordered!!! Could not be happier with this purchase,  I have read these books twice in the past six months best gift my husband has bought me :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game has the best graphics in all the games I have EVER seen (which is a LOT) and if you love horses this is the PERFECT game for you!!!
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I have seen this movie many years  ago on DVD and I got a very good impression of it, now that I own the Blu-ray version I MUST confess that it is just absolutely stunning not only for the new 26 min of amazing animation, more than 1000 editing but most importantly that Japanese know how to make a great story MORE memorable for its fans from all over the world.<br /><br />This edition has also a very detailed evolution of Final Fantasy from the first video game going through its chronology, and all the trailers you have seen before about it.<br /><br />Blu enhances images in a way that it has never been seen before in a unique way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br /><br />HiGhLy recommendable ;) and its price is the best!!!!! :D
B004SBX112|4.0|love no ads popping up and slowing down the game...its a lil slow on some levels, but overall, I really enjoyed it.
1454701250|5.0|Cound't wait to get my copy and lovee the whole book. Read it from beginning to end. Creative, colourful, easy to follow instructions and enjoyable to read.This one shows a lot of applications on different pieces. Love it!
B0000029AP|5.0|I grew up listening to Aerosmith, and this was one of the first albums I ever owned...had to buy the CD...my biggest problem is getting back from my daughter who is now an avid fan!!
B00B29J0I6|5.0|This is just a great fun challenging but totally do-able physics based game for kids (and adults).  Fun characters with silly story lines that make it very entertaining.  This is the kind of game you just want to keep playing!
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Absolutely loved this album...play it almost daily...surprising changes yet old school Aerosmith shines through...if you're an avid fan of Aerosmith, you do not want to miss this!!!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel is fantastic, and everything about this movie is excellently crafted. Even the audio is perfectly constructed; it serves to heighten the drama of a tormented man suffering from addiction. Don't see that too often with a movie.<br /><br />The only dislike? It's 2.5+ hours long. This is me being picky, and to be frank, I actually didn't regret the length of this movie. However, I'll need to be critical about something...
B004GYY714|5.0|I love the fact that I can listen to my favorite radio stations on my kindle while reading, or on my cellular phone when a radio is not an available option.  Totally recommend this!!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is so much fun you should download it right now!And check out my zoo! Hope you play it!
B007MNV5WU|5.0|a little quirky at times, games will pause and skip on some levels, but overall, I like the games, kept me interested.
B00BHMETKC|1.0|Won \\"best movie\\"??? Are you kidding me? Other prizes too? Ah ah ah<br /><br />Movie like this usually do not score more then a 2 stars as a \\"mathematical average\\" 4 here?... Why?  Full of inaccuracies, boring, self-referential. That do not even try to fully-deeply explain \\"what\\" happened but only \\"in a fairy tale style\\" how it was \\"solved\\" (with a lot of luck to be honest!).<br /><br />Hollywood gave a prize to itself, that's the whole story and people buy it. ;(
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|This was free and rightfully so, pointless game with little or no real game play. Walking around collecting sticky notes is the entire game, no interactive environment just sticky notes. Deleteed immediately.
B0034G4P80|5.0|An excellent debut for Chris Hemsworth. The guy is not only buff but plays his character well. The movie is a keeper.
B009ANP4F4|4.0|This is my favorite one. After this one, it is a tie between 1 & 3. I decided to do a marathon just to be sure, and that is where I ended up. I think it part because I love the Miami scene itself. I also like all of the really good dancers and venues.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I had a hard time putting it down and I really enjoyed reading this book. If you grew up in the 80's you'll love all the references.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I thought that the concept of wreck it ralph was cleverly conceived and the overall message is a good lesson for children to take in. However, from the perspective of an adult who enjoys a number of animated family features, I found wreck it ralph to be somewhat thrown together, and outside of John C. Reilly's voice I did not enjoy the other selections for actors and actresses.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|I'd seen parts of their Live in London concert on YouTube, but it paled in comparison to the DVD on my big flat-screen tv. They're so magnificent--those voices, that incredible sound, Carlos' face.........I saw them in concert last year in Alpharetta, GA, and they clowned around quite a bit, but parts of this DVD are hilarious. Solid recommendation for ANY Il Divo fan!
B00BHMF578|5.0|Pretty good movie, not a lot of action though.<br />It keeps your attention and you want to see wht is going to happen on the next scene.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Just downloaded this for the Kindle Fire &amp; I'm really enjoying it...great movement and set up. I highly recommend this app.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I personally think that for the Roman-greek you don't have download it off the internet.If that is not case I'm really sorry. Also the game is really fun, great job too!keep up all the good work :)<br /><br />Sincerely Avery stevenson
B007SGLZP8|5.0|What this book is, is a tour de force of stylistic virtuosity. It would make a great study piece for a creative writing course. It would be used to teach flow of writing, plot mainly. As such, it resembles \\"The Importance of Being Earnest,\\" by Oscar Wilde - a tongue in cheek piece of writing, or perhaps Michelangelo's David, done not for theological import, but because Michelangelo could.<br /><br />So it can be enjoyed as such. That's why I gave it 5 stars, because its a beautiful piece of writing, of really no cosmic significance or deep meaning. But that's OK - We see here a piece of writing whose form in itself grasps us in its command of the craft, and perhaps we can see this in life - that style itself can sometimes be worth pursuing.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Well some levels are very hard and some are easy but power ups makes the game easy i love this game

B008XG1X18|5.0|Great ideas and easy to organize my subjects.  I am on Pinterest every day and can always find something new.
B00BHMF578|4.0|Liked the plot.  Very suspenseful but not sure how it won an oscar.  It was worth watching but not worth paying for it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas couldn't write a bad book if he wanted to. This story was as wonderful as all of his books. A little real, a little suspenseful, a little spiritual and a lot of love keep you glued until the end. You will not be disappointed.
0525478817|5.0|Oh my God. Ohmygodohmygodohmygod. What a powerfully, beautifully, devastatingly well-written story. For the last sixty pages-- who makes a book turn achingly sad for sixty long pages and keeps you reading?-- I soaked through eight kleenexes, each time angrily pulling another reluctantly from the box, SWEARING it would be my very last tissue, that I couldn't possibly need one more. I want to know Augustus and Hazel in some sort of lifetime.
B00821OX98|4.0|This show is excellent although at times predictable. It has enough twists to keep me entertained, but it does require a healthy suspension of disbelief.All in all a great introduction to the world and a great framework for exploring some very interesting ideas. If you like science fiction, aliens, or post apocalyptic themes this show is a must watch.
B0010SKUYM|4.0|Very good start to a fantasy series. Could have been a little tighter at times, but worth a read. I'll be moving on to book two without hesitation.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is a fun game and easy to play with friends if they have it.  I play it with my friends all the time
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|In my opinion, this is one of top 3 CGI animated films of all time. The other two are the Incredibles and the Toy Story 3. I thought this movie was way better, for example, than Cars.<br /><br />I think it is hard to have more adorable characters than Wreck-it-Ralph. They really put a lot of thought behind the characters.<br /><br />The story is quite excellent. You will be laughing and crying throughout this movie.<br /><br />I think this movie will resonate the most with those who are 35-50 years old. The movie refers to popular arcade games of the 1980s and you won't get all the jokes unless you have played them.<br /><br />If you want to watch a family movie, then by all means, watch it.<br /><br />Pros:<br />1)One of the best CGI movies of all time.<br />2)Fantastic story and characters.<br />3)Funny and enchanting<br /><br />Cons:<br />1)You won't get all the jokes and nuisances unless you played popular 1980s arcade games.
B008FYZIVY|4.0|She has watched every minute of it. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time while she was enjoying this show. :)
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I have loved this movie since the first time I saw it. Dramatic and touching at the same time. Can't go wrong with Spielberg.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I really enjoyed how they were able to keep the tension alive despite already knowing the end of the movie.
B004PGO25O|4.0|This is a short but practical book which exposes the enemy of progress - Resistance. Steven identifies the many faces of Resistance and shows the reader ways to overcome the very force that prevents us from moving forward with our hopes and dreams.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|Enjoyed the tension in this season and thought Jensen has improved as an actor while Jared's performance continually falls flat
B008220C38|1.0|I was really shocked when I watched this film and realized that it made no sense at all. Vronsky the lover, is so pretty, he competes with Anna for good looks. The one saving grace in the film is Jude Law who plays his part perfectly. But he isn't in the film that much, it is mainly her, Anna, who slides in and out of stylized sets looking much like a wax figure at a museum display. She does this very odd thing with her face throughout the film, twisting her lips into what looked to me like fake snarls. It was very disconcerting to see such a lovely woman deliberately make her face unattractive. The costumes and sets are gorgeous, and it's fun to watch if only for that reason. The story itself is a big disappointment.
B008QPCCQQ|4.0|This is the sort of book you can put down and pick up again at any time. I had read &#34;Little Women&#34; years ago.  Taking into consideration the time it was written gives a good look at what makes America today. The moralising gets a bit much.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|The pacing in this film is amazing. It moves at the speed of light. The editing is superb. The scenes flip back and forth between Washington and Iran, between the Canadian consulate's home and the American exfil expert Tony Mendez who rescues people for a living, bringing them home from dangerous locations. The dialogue is clever and very entertaining.<br />Ben Affleck is intense and riveting. I can't stop watching him as he calmly takes six hostages through a maze of dangerous and life-threatening situations. The script is perfect. Not a wasted word. Alan Arkin and John Goodman are hilarious as the two movie moguls who help Tony create a fake movie as a cover for the six hostages. The six Americans are to become a Canadian film crew as Tony leads the through the maze of Iranian soldiers with guns who hate Americans and want to kill all of them. This is a film not to be missed. Trust me, it's perfect.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I think its pretty decent, it gives me a good scare every now and then. With the update u have a new map but it glitched and i fall through the ground. O.o
0375842209|2.0|The Book Thief is set in Nazi Germany.<br /><br />Death – leads us through his experiences with Liesel Meminger, and the people she encounters as she tries to live through World War II.<br /><br />He takes a bizarre interest in Liesel because she steals books.<br /><br />Liesel’s first theft is The Gravedigger’s Handbook.<br /><br />Somewhat surprising, as Liesel is illiterate.<br /><br />Her mother leaves her with Hans and Rosa Hubermann as the war kicks into gear, and life is irrevocably altered.<br /><br />That is the basic plot of the book.<br /><br />It took a while to get into this story.<br /><br />I picked it up and dropped it a few times before getting involved emotionally with any of it.<br /><br />I must say I found the explanations of what was coming at the beginning of each chapter annoying.<br /><br />But as the story progressed I did develop an affinity for certain characters.<br /><br />Ones I hadn’t expected to.<br /><br />Enough so that I did want to find out the ending.<br /><br />I would love to be more enthusiastic – it is a book many rave about – but The Book Thief failed to grab my attention, and before I finished it, I read at least three other books.<br /><br />Markus Zusak said it was only supposed to be a small book.<br /><br />In my opinion he should have stuck to the plan.<br /><br />Truthfully – I am glad I didn’t pay for it.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Exciting and suspenseful. This movie was one of the best I saw this past year. Deserving of its Oscar for best picture. Ben affleck was robbed of the director Oscar
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|I loved this game because you could replay each track any way you wanted. Great app. It is also a great game for teens or kids!
B006CC0YB0|4.0|I like the electronic, rock, blues eclectic mix of this album. Put Lanegan's rasp on top of this and you get a good sound.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game hasn't really disappointed yet. I will say that trying to update it was somewhat painful but the quality of what the update gave was rewarding. I hope it continues to put out new and cool material.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|Great second &#34;chapter&#34; to If I stay.  Really enjoyed both books.  Really, really enjoyed this book, and LOVED the outcome!!

B006MW3V6U|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this show. The graphics are stunning, the storyline line is captivating, the characters are perfect, and the fact that I can watch it on amazon prime makes it a grand slam!
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|Great<br />I love the series so having it on my kindle was a whole new level. Rodrick rules is my favorite so I was very impressed.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I AM GOING TO MISS THE SHOW WHEN SEASON 7 IS DONE. I IS SO LIFE LIKE I CAN PICTURE THE SUSPENSE
B00571F26Y|5.0|I have struggled with my weight for a life time - sometimes I win at least for a while - recently I gained weight after an injury laid me up for a few months - I put weight on and felt very tired most of the time - I am a 50 something road warrior - consultant.<br /><br />This book has been great for me - I don't know if eliminating wheat will work for everybody but after four weeks I have lost weight - my pants are &#34;swimming around&#34; my waist and I have more energy but most of all I now longer crave foods and can say to my self &#34;not that&#34; and it sticks ....<br /><br />The book is easy to read, informative and practical.<br /><br />Thanks
B001QE9WEO|4.0|This is the first zombie movie I ever watched. I can still remember the dread that I felt as the barrel shook and jumped around on that truck. I may have only been 7 but I knew that when that gas leaked all over the cemetary s*** was bout to get real.    This has to be the epitome of cheesy 80's horror. You have it all. Horrible actors. Ridiculous plot. Unnecessary screaming. Talking ghouls. The only thing missing is the gratuitous nudity. So I will only give it 4 stars for the lack of boobs.
B00021HBGS|4.0|My child loves these. I've had them for a few months and my only advice is they stick fine if you don't have any soap on the back before you stick it up. If they fall off, just rinse the part in the tub to get off the soap then stick it back on.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very interesting premise. Descriptions of people and places are great. Good writing, I like the chapter to chapter  idea. It get four stars for a good read. But, I felt clueless at the end.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|Two outstanding performances that couldn't be more different, but yet complement each other so well.  Comic, sad and inspiring all at once!
B009FZHYKU|4.0|I am a pretty big fan of this show.  It's been very surprising to me that I could watch zombies for so many episodes and still be interested.  This is a very good show.  Not necessarily the best I've ever seen, but certainly worth the time.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I loved the updated version of Sherlock Holmes.  The dynamics between Sherlock and Watson are excellant. I also enjoy the dynamics with Sherlock and John's landlady and Sherlock's brother.  All of the characters are well cast and the scripts are well written.
B0000844I8|5.0|I love the series and the movies and this was as good as it gets ....thanks.  I would recommend this to anyone that likes star gate.
B001223BLU|4.0|I enjoy listening to these guys and now it is easy to do on my kindle.<br />I plan to get more music on my kindle.
B008458O3S|5.0|Simple at first and raced through but soon it became more intriguing as more actions were added. I loved solving every one and spent hours on the latter ones. This is a simply brilliant app! The children like watching the solved puzzles guessing which train will win. As a free app it is the best.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|With all of the negativity that goes around today about the ability of our government to get anything done rigtit was great to see a story about a government agency that got it done.
0765325950|1.0|What can I say about the last book in a series I've been reading since I was eleven years old? I'm sorry to say that what I have to share is not good.<br /><br />I would really love to know if Sanderson even read this series before writing his parts. I highly doubt it. Characters acting out of character is bad enough... but this book is essentially 909 pages of battle scenes, with little to no redeeming qualities.<br /><br />I'm an avid reader. I love to read. I get emotionally invested, especially in a series that has gone on this long. I had to force myself to finish this book, and I'm kind of sorry I did. I'd rather write the book myself, and I may, for my own personal satisfaction, write up the ending I would have liked on my computer.<br /><br />It's strange to say I couldn't dislike this book more. I've been a huge defender of several previous books when others bashed them... but Sanderson does not have Robert Jordan's talent. He doesn't even come close.<br /><br />I grieved for Robert Jordan and his family when he passed.<br />I grieve for myself (however selfishly) that he was not alive long enough to finish the series-to do it justice.<br /><br />Brandon Sanderson has not.<br />Edited to add:<br />As a side note, the women in the book were a mere footnote, and apparently not worth mentioning much, in Sanderson's opinion.
0321811984|5.0|Excellent. Excellent. This is an easy read. I suppose the writer set it up, the same way he would with presentations. Well, it's a book and different then presentations, so he goes in more details, but keeps it very easy to read. Even if many of the concepts probably we already know in our head, (lot of is is kind of obvious) we seldom apply. We keep making the same boring presentations with lots of text to read. This book did help me to be more conscious on how I prepare my presentations.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Can't wait to read the next book.<br /><br />Loved the characterers...especially Sarah and Em.  Couldn't wait too get to the end but didn't want to finish... Always a indicator of a good book.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|What can ya say? about this Great flick. Kate is... well, Somethin' Else. No wonder she got the Academy Award for this role. Nice body, too.
B007MJSQSK|5.0|the animation is wonderful and the resolution was perfect.<br />We could not stop wondering how the movie was made and if real actors were involved.
B00005JPNY|5.0|Not really into 'kids movies,' but this is Great! Kidman is good, as usual, Craig is briefly on but good; Mostly I can watch it again and again just to appreciate how GOOD Blue Dakota is -- Amazing!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not really about zombies but about human survival and responses to very very stressful conditions. Stress brings out the best in some and the worst in others. Very good special affects.
B007D5E7C2|5.0|I don't usually go in for this type of flick, but I'm in LOVE! w/Uma. And Daryll Hannah looks dang good - and SEXY! - with an eye-patch! I do like sword skills.... I guess it would be boring w/out the violence (?).
B009GEEMLY|5.0|This is the biggest superhero based movie event for Marvel. All those old school heroes and their back stories revealed flawlessly. And, that's not even the end of the movie yet. Throw in an epic battle sequence with funny one liners and it totals to be totally wizard movie. What's next.
6304711905|5.0|Every actor/actress in this - one-of-the-top-5 Westerns of All time, is GREAT! Especially Kilmer. I use lines from this movie all the time! Why? &#34;I have not yet begun to defile myself - my Hypocrisy knows No Bounds.&#34;
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I live to play this game & my Granddaughter also is having fun with this game. When she is here I have a hard time play because she want my Kindle.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|Brody is great! The storyline is familiar, yet this is a quite interesting version of the Holocaust. Fantastic music! Just Do It
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a  nice app. well worth the price. for u horse lover's it is great!!!!!! pretty fun to do when u are bored.
B000089A06|5.0|I like Fiennes in everything I have ever seen him in -- Except &#34;The Bruges.&#34; And of course, Hopkins ia always good, esp. in this role as Hannibal The Cannibal. yes Yes Yes
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|This game was way Too short and the game was too easy . Great soundtrack. No<br />worth the money it took to unlock the full version.
B000UBMSB8|5.0|What can you say about one of the Original Great sci-fi flics!? Rates up there in the top of classics for this genre. Only thing I didn't care for was Sean Young's hairdo...
034580404X|4.0|I've read a few dozen of each of the 1-5 star reviews, and while I agree with some of each category, I think overall people are missing the point. This is a love story. It wasn't meant to be high literature. It was meant to give a window into a very particular lifestyle, lived by an unlikely couple. Have you ever been in love with someone not suited to you? In a relationship that wasn't expected to work? Look beyond the eye rolling, blushing, lip biting and other handful of repetition, and you'll see a flawed man who is really trying and a young woman who wants to help. The trilogy also deserves credit for shedding light on the horrors of child abuse and the potential lifelong repercussions to those who endure it. And while some of the sex scenes are repetitive, I found many of them to be inventive and well described. Many of the book's emails are laugh out loud funny, and while I did notice some character inconsistencies (Ana has such a high GPA, is so bright, etc. etc., but she can't remember birth control?) overall I think the author did a good job of fully fleshing out the main characters. So to speak. : )
B000E5N6LG|3.0|Dennis Quaid is Outstanding here - however, being a Big Fan of Tombstone, This sorta pales in comparison. I like that it was filmed around here where I live, in Nuevo Mexico. I guess that's why I bought into it, but Quaid can't save the whole pic.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so awesome it has great graphics and it actually feels like your taking care of a real horse:) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B005CMSDLE|4.0|This was lacking a little something; I can't put my finger on. The girl maybe outshone Streep and definitely better than Bana. I think perhaps the script could've been better....
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Could not put this book down. It draws you in and won't let go. Amazing character development and imagery. Highly recommend!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Although there were a little too many criminal topics for one person to experience,  I did enjoy this book.  The overall writing was very good.  Colleen Hoover is one of my favorite writers.  I highly recommend any of her books including \\"Slammed.\\"  Again, I just wish that the author chose one or two of the serious topics the main character experienced and it would have been a little more believable. That being said, Colleen Hoover is such a great writer, I actually finished this book in 2 days because the main characters were so likable!
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Excellent storyline, strong acting and filming. I watched it twice and was still intrigued the second time around. Excellent work, Ben Affleck!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks and loved this book. Can't wait to see the movie. I look forward to his next novel.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Loved this book...brilliant writing. I was completely immersed in Charlie's world. It's as if he was writing his letters to me and I got to know each character just as he did. Highly recommend.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Charger and cord are a much better quality than the original I got when I received my Kindle Fire.  I highly recommend this.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|Always loved this movie, seen it so many times and still, I love it! very nice to watch for free! Thanks Amazon for making so many good movies available on prime!
1616550414|5.0|No matter how many times I open this book, it does not fail to amaze me. After reading it for almost 2 nights straight, I am now determined to purchase all the gamers and their respected consoles at some point. I would even purchase the complete Zelda Manga box set.<br /><br />Point is, if you love Legend of Zelda, buy this book. No fan would regret it. I know I didn't, and especially not my friend who almost had a heart attack when I gave this as a present to him (He loves the series).
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|This is the first mystery/hidden object game I've played on Kindle. It's a lot of fun! It's a little spooky with the ghost. I'd give it 5 stars but I don't like that it cut me off mid-game to write a review or pay to unlock the whole game. I'm writing the review, however worried it will still cut me off unless I pay to unlock- the app showed it was free...free should be free, not require you to pay to play.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was skeptical when I saw all the crazy tweets with the Downton Abbey hashtag. And I expected it to be &#34;stuffy.&#34;  I was drawn-in from the get-go. I became an insatiable addict. I watched all the season in less than five days, staying up all night and binging. One night I think I watched seven episodes in a row. That was including the finale. The next night, I swear, I was going through withdrawal. I heard the theme music in my head when I tried to sleep, heard the characters voices and started talking to myself in the style of various characters. I couldn't get their images out of my mind. I cannot wait for the next season!
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|I absolutely loved this film, and recommend it without reservation.  I've never felt compelled to leave a review on Amazon before, but had to comment on this movie.  Trust us; you will love it!
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Not scary. Not entertaining. Not fun. Not happy I believed the 5 star reviews. Not happy I installed it.<br /><br />It is getting uninstalled now.
B009TSA7MA|4.0|This is the best Michael Schenker video ever. The Sound is first rate. The band is his best. the choices of tunes is also excellent.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I couldn't put it down. My job, my family, my health, everything suffered until I finished this book! Just kidding! But I loved it!!
B005KXU83G|5.0|I bought this on vinyl back when when it was released. I have been wanting to replace it, so on the eve of the Bob Seger concert we were attending in Toledo, Ohio, I bought this MP 3 version. It is &#34;Still The Same&#34;.....Great!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is like nintenhorses haha! amazing its got great graphics and it doesn't lag much. great for passing time when you wanna take care of something

0399157565|2.0|And I thought it was just me?  After reading all these reviews listed, I realize I am on target.  In a Doris Betts class at UNC, this manuscript would be handed back for a rewrite (and this author knows Betts.) Why are the characters driven into the ground with her descriptions?  Why is the plot so tenuous and tedious? Why isn't the end more exciting?  Why does Kay's cooking seem to be plastered in--we want to know what the killer is doing, not what she puts on her pizza? Why did I have to reread several times to get \\"unconfused\\"? We know Lucy is gay--do we have to be told this every 10 pages? Why did I not feel that I had had a good time when I finished reading? Because I did not.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We were instantly grabbed by this series and can not recommend it highly enough. The characters and acting, the writing, the stroy- you just fall into it. We sat through the entire three discs- could not stop. Wife and I have not had that much fun together since we were young.
B000003RCY|1.0|I received this, along with another CD, in a timely matter, I opened the albums to rip on my music library, only to find out that both CDs are ineffective. They play but slow and choppy. I tried some of my older CDs and they work just fine, Ive owned both of these albums in the past and know what they sound like. In fact the Herzeleid album didn't even have the manufacturers label on it, as if its been opened once before. Can I return these CDs for a refund or an exchange of the same albums that work?
B003WUYP56|5.0|Lee Smolin has the ability to take a complex, almost indecipherable subject, like quantum physics and make it totally fascinating. This is not the usual egg-head type book and perhaps, that's the shame of it. Just the word, &#34;Physics&#34; almost put me off. I am not one to understand the inner workings of an atom or a star. But, this book was a complete and fascinating surprise for me. I almost could not put it down. I think I read it in four sittings. You will come away with a bit of an understanding of the time-space-thingy. but, you will really know about the fascinating world of physicists and the politics of learning institutions and the interrelationships between people of very high intellect- some are magnanimous, others insanely petty and selfish and still others are out right thieves and liars- Oh! Just like regular people, eh? An excellent reading experience and I strongly recommend it.
B00003CX95|5.0|One of the best movies from my childhood, was happy to purchase this Item and will gladly watch for years to come
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We were instantly grabbed by this series and can not recommend it highly enough. The characters and acting, the writing, the stroy- you just fall into it. We sat through the entire three discs- could not stop. Wife and I have not had that much fun together since we were young.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|My 7 year old son loves this game. He has fun playing it. For only 99 cents you can't beat it. Lots of levels and sound effects too.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|Nothing spectacular about movie.  Would suggest renting vs buying this one.  Good for one viewing only but not for keeps.
B004LROUW2|5.0|I was led to this book based on a TED talk that I watch. I got it out of pure curiosity. I'm very tuned to reading classical literature, plays, and poetry. So by biggest problem with contemporary literature is the lack of the whole flow to a composition, which is especially prevalent in American literature. This book was a huge surprise as I was expecting to find just another novel. Its very serene, and a calm read but still packed with plenty of shocking events and enjoyable dialogue from early on. Its slow to start like many great songs and films but its well worth the wait.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I hope everybody likes it everybody upgrade to Rome that is awesome one so that's what I think about the game
B00181JGI2|4.0|I watched this with my daughter and her friend on &#34;Big Lebowski night,&#34; a traditional viewing complete with white russians.  At first the movie seemed a bit weird, but once I caught on I found it funny and entertaining.  My favorite part is probably the magic carpet.  The great one-liners throughout the film helps make it a great cult classic.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Wish there was a forth book:( but I still love this series. Now I've got to go find something else to read.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This overall fascinating drama has it's high and low points during the season 3. I was relieved to see the Bates prison story resolved.  Edith's life has had some interesting potential with different sub plots and I would like to see one of these evolve into more story.  Shirley Maclaine was an uninteresting addition and her character was somewhat disappointing. I was glad to see where Tom was placed in the series.  I hope we can look forward to seeing more of his role in managing the estate.  Anna is fantastic and Mary intriguing.  Would enjoy seeing more of Mary's savvy and a little less of the pettiness with her sister.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|It was great...read it in 2 sittings. Would definitely recommend previous to viewing the film. Ending was strange...it leaves you wondering.
B000ID37RM|5.0|From the civil rights era, a reminder of the way things used to be, in film as well as society.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this application almost daily. It lets me clip and store web pages that I use for research. I've also started using it as a Journal. The handiest part is that it's available on multiple platforms, so the same notes and clippings are within reach on my PC, Kindle or phone. Our, if I'm stranded with nothing but a computer with net access (say at a friend's or the library) I can log in to the Evernote website and find my stuff. The website also has idea starters for various professions.
B000002OZY|5.0|I always have said Tommy was The Who at their best, like The Wall is Pink Floyd at their best.
B002O3Z4QQ|5.0|This series emphasizes the drama of the Apollo program and is less about the technical achievements and challenges.  The cinematography is breathtaking with accurate models of the moon landcape, space suits and space capsules.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Lowest I could go is 1 star, but it really deserves no stars; it worked for all of 10 minutes and then would fail to load. Had to delete it. Worthless.
B0002HZ18C|5.0|I like this model so much I bought one for my nephew.  This kit is inexpensive and nicely done.  I adapted mine with new doors and raised walls to conform to HO scale (1:87) and waterlined it (sawed the hull to sit on top of the water line).  With some work and a coat of paint this model is suitable for an HO scale model railroad.
1603580557|5.0|I liked this book a lot. It's non-technical, meant to help an average person gain understanding of what systems are and how they work. It's clear and well-written with a lot of real-world examples, ranging from simple examples like a bathtub to complex examples like countries' population policies.<br />The ideas in this book can help you look at problems in a different way, which can sometimes be really helpful in solving them.
B009VMN3RA|3.0|No doubt about it - Sachi had a most unusual upbringing.  I found myself feeling sorry for her and then asking how anyone could allow herself to be treated that way.  There were so many inconsistencies in the story that i came away at the end asking how much of it could be real, or was it embellished to make herself look better in places.  She complained her parents did nothing to help her financially, but then neglected to claim the multi-million dollar property in Japan that her father left to her, only to let it eventually be claimed by a step-mother who treated her badly.  In some ways, it just doesn't ring true to me.  The book was a disappointment.
B00BC5I6Q2|1.0|I decided to watch more than one episode and give this show a chance after seeing the new season come out on Netflix. I'm on the third episode, and honestly, it's grating to anyone with intelligence that follows the news and politics. I also have been able to decipher what's just wrong with this show. The characters are all unlikable. No one is likable. Most of the main characters are evil schemers that always outsmart their enemies, who are nothing but complete, unwitting dopes, ripe for the plucking. DC is basically some version of hell, with everyone at war with everyone else, unhappy with their place in life. The characters don't seem realistic at all, just caricatures from TV shows and movies from long ago. There is no balance in this world. It's just the very bad, and the very stupid. Having watched Fincher movies for years, it's not hard to figure out his schtick, creating pseudo-dark worlds in which everyone is bitter about everything, with no joy or chance of joy for the rest of their lives.<br /><br />I have to admit, while I don't live in DC and know the type of people that live there, I do know something about political platforms and beliefs that people hold. That's where this show fails miserably. Characters talk about political beliefs and platforms with ZERO conviction!!! This is something that politicians fight tooth and nail over! The education plan discussed in the show was hilarious. The characters are just reading from cue cards, which was probably copy and pasted from wikipedia or something. These people know exactly where they stand with their beliefs, and everyone else, from their allies, lobbyists to their enemies know where they stand as well. In episode 2, the secretary of state candidate withdraws because an editorial surfaces where he calls he Israeli occupation of Gaza or whatever illegal. It raises such an uproar that he eventually is booted. Come on. Assuming he's a Democrat, I'm quite certain his allies support his views and that everyone pretty much knows his views about the matter. Furthermore, it was an editorial from decades ago. Like anyone would seriously take that seriously in 2013. Very likely, his views could have changed! I fail to see how this would be held against him.<br /><br />The education issue offends me the most, because no effort is made to talk about how much of a failure all these reform efforts have been. Like I said, it's all an uninformed, one-dimensional depiction of politics and characters. There's nothing behind the stories. It's like this show was written to appeal to high school and college students. In one scene, Claire Underwood, to a candidate she is aggressively recruiting, tells her she values her so much because she is a \\"valedictorian.\\" Did the writers really think a line like this would ever appeal to grown adults? Does being a valedictorian really impress anyone a few days graduated from high school? Give me a break.<br /><br />Everything about this show is phony, written by people that have been out of touch with reality for years. It's not even smart, because quite a lot is dumbed down and simplified, with political issues that don't even seem to be fully understood by the writers themselves. A show like this could be great if it were balanced and realistic. Unfortunately, it's not, and it will only be a matter of time before the masses wise up and realize how terrible House of Cards is, like they did with Homeland.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I check the weather almost every morning.  In Texas it changes enough to require a daily update. I appreciate the various forcast options.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|i like how you can play with music with the EQ (equalizer) and that it scans apps too. the only downside is that the unlocker isnt free
B005S9EJ14|2.0|This was recommended to me, but it is not what I want to watch.  I only enjoy wholesome stories.  Where couples stay together and work out their difficulties.

B005K0HDGE|4.0|Waited a long time before reading as I couldn't fathom how this could capture my imagination.  I remember when the President was assassinated.  I had forgotten the butterfly effect.  Thanks again, Stephen King!
B00AYXNKIC|5.0|they keep making this game better and better. some updates with more levels would bebgreat but other than that I highly recommend this game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|like I said WOWZERS this game is the most awesome game ever and I luv 2 play it its awesome
1400067820|2.0|At first I couldn't have been more enthusiastic about this book.<br />Mr. Taleb proposes so many ideas that at least a few will seem great.<br />During a second reading, my enthusiasm was replaced by disappointment.<br /><br />He wrote, \\"Have you noticed that while corporations sell you junk drinks, artisans sell you cheese and wine? And there is a transfer in anti-fragility from the small in favor of the large -- until the large goes bust.\\"<br /><br />When I thought about this, it didn't hold up. Corporations sell junk drinks. They also sell cheese and wine. An artisan, by definition, is going to sell something that involves craft.  Some very large companies go bust. Some (many) artisans and small companies go bust.<br /><br />Quite a few of his statements don't hold up under even the most cursory reflection!<br />Despite that, there is fun to be had in reading the book, as long as it's done with the understanding that this is entertainment, not analysis.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|It is one of my most favorite books ever ,u must get it.  I would read it a million more times
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I was very excited to see this game on the market place and for free. You can progress through the game without in game purchases if you are very patient.<br />The graphics are quite good and the sounds are as well. They do a nice job of representing Jurassic Park.<br />Game quests are nice and plentiful and help you progress with XP, cash and in game dollars. However to get some of the more desirable items in the game would require real cash purchase or a few years of gameplay.<br />The downside and reason i gave the game 3 stars is due to some serious slowdown and lag input as the game progresses and your park grows. I am currently at level 18 and it is really starting to become an issue.<br />One example is with a mini game called &#34;Code Red&#34;. Your objective is to keep your dinos secure during crisis times that arise. You have a time limit and need to click on your dino pens before the timer times out in order to complete the objectives. However on my last attempt I just barely completed the task as the slowdown to scroll through my park was pretty bad. To further mar the experience, when I finally did get to the pen my touch input was severely lagged. It makes what could be a fun portion of the game an act of frustration just to try and complete it.<br />The problem also arises as you try and collect cash from your dino pens, something that is done on a regular basis.<br />If the developer can correct these issues I will definitely change the score I gave to a 5 star review, the game is quite fun and very enjoyable to play when it works right.<br />Hopefully they do just that.<br />Definitely worth the download though for those who enjoy this type of game and can put up with its shortcomings.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|simply awful, really painful, waste of money and time, don't bother. watch cartoons instead to pass the evening. The original movie is much better and if you know how to read, try the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i really love this game! im an 11 yr old and love this game but my parents play it. its really an enjoyable and affordable game for all ages and i think everyone should have it!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book really took some turns that I didn't expect. I really liked it. Through half of the book you're thinking one way, and then...a complete turn around.
B008Y73940|4.0|Interesting and MCCaonaughey does a great job as usual.  I'd recommend this to a friend.  A little raunchy, didn't add much to the movie.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Makes you look at life so differently. One of my favorite books and totally worth reading. Be prepared to cry.
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Took some getting used to but really like the app. Lots of great free ebooks in any catagory you could want.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|in my opinion its the best game the kindle fire has to offer.I love this game and if you play it I know you would love it too :)
B008OOYALE|3.0|Dragon story, after the first six levels, takes a lot of time to level up.  The cost to remove trees and rocks is not in line with the amount of coins received.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The graphics are great but there is really nothing going on besides walking around. And then, Slender Man shows up and he's just standing there. He doesn't come near you at all. I tried both the road and the farm, both day and night and let me tell you...NO ACTION whatsoever. This isn't necessarily a negative review, I just feel the app needs some improvement. I don't see what's so scary about it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the greatest game I have ever played who made this game and why ilove it so much that when I take my Kendal to work I always.have people have to ask where I got it from and I said get a Kendal and bring it to me and I will download it to third kendal
B009LDXQGW|5.0|Best kept secret TheWeeknd is so sensual the music is a great mix of old school symphonic jazz and R&B. Dont miss this one plain ole good singing.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I really love it I'm 13 you cant bye a lot if stuff with really money my sister loves it t
B008XBCJ34|1.0|Intermittent sound as well as small silver lines appearing on the screen throughout the movie.  Definitely ruined the entire experience.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|I received the DVD quickly, in good shape, all the packaging was included, and the product was exactly as advertized.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Chapter One: Alone haunts me.I am torn between wanting to see what Slender man looks like and running away in screaming,crying,snot-bubble-in-nose,urine soaked,sphincter tightening terror! Plug in your headphones and dim the lights if you dare.Got this game free,one of many good reasons to be a Prime member,and ready to plunk down real money for next and all following chapters. The fog and effects options make this infinitely replay-able by ratcheting up the terror.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|This might work for some low-powered/self-powered devices.<br /><br />I only have one firewire 800 device, which is Sabio DM2-PT (http://www.amazon.com/Storage-Portable-Hardware-Solution-Diskless/dp/B005GREVW0/ref=sr_1_1?s=electronics&ie=UTF8&qid=1362874594&sr=1-1&keywords=sabio)  This Sabio External drive has two Toshiba 7200RPM 1TB drives in RAID 1 configuration.<br /><br />I just upgraded my laptop from 2010 Macbook Pro 17 to 2013 Retina 15.  The Sabio enclosure worked perfectly on MBP17.  It was mobile, fast, bus-powered via FW800, and offered additional peace of mind with RAID option.  The on-board eSATA and USB 2.0 ports required external power supply, and USB2.0 is too slow for what I use this for. (Lightroom RAW file storage)<br /><br />MBP 17's FW800 had no problem spinning the two drives. I read on apple forum that this can power up to 7W, and when I checked the external power supply that came with the enclosure, it was rated at 5V@2A = 10W.  Most devices do not use the full capacity of the power supply, so I was hopeful.<br /><br />Well..it looks like the retina MBP w/thunderbolt-FW800 cannot feed enough power for this.  The drives just click when I power it up.  As far as I know there is no compact USB3.0 hardware RAID enclosure.  If you know any, please suggest one.<br /><br />Just wanted to save some time and hassle for others with this same enclosure, or any devices requiring anything close to 10W.
B004I744AS|5.0|I like this app because it is easy to use. I look up words on a regular basis. I also enjoy the extras like famous quotes, birthday person, word challenge, and horoscope.
B003MC5N28|3.0|This book was a good read. The simplistic ideas were easy to read and understand. It left me wanting more of the story. I wanted to read about the Jonas being successful in his attempt for change.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Good book they got married happy ending  and everything was just drawing me to the book great just great book
B00881VLCE|3.0|I think I've done most of these puzzles. they are fun. the scenes are clear and easy to recognize. thanks
B00AREIAI8|5.0|so so so awesome I love this app please get it if you love horses than this is the app for you
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This is a great movie full of action. I would recommend it to anyone who likes James Bond movies and lots of action and great cars! Definitely not a movie for children.
B0084AZXKK|4.0|The idea and plot of this book was great although it takes a lot of knowledge of pirates ,the way they talk and ship terms to fully understand what is happening throughout the whole book.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I loved the cheaper version of this app so much that I paid for the full version. There are plenty of sounds to choose from and I love that you can listen to many at once. The timer is great to keep my Kindle from being on all night. The right mix of sounds soothes me to sleep every night!
1400077915|3.0|I would rather read a 600 page book than a short story.  Stories were okay, but canadian.  I couldn't relate to her tales.
B009IF82SK|4.0|Unfortunately, this show is losing some of its freshness and uniqueness.  They're even trying to promote it as &#34;The New Friends.&#34;  However, partially owing to reruns being driven into the ground by local stations, the episodes have become predictable, and Sheldon and Raj, in particular seem to be out of the writers' range anymore.  Amy and Bernadette have certainly added to the mix, but a lot of the endearing quirkiness seems to be fading.
B005NKGEP2|1.0|Sorry. This story line and plot doesn't work. It's disjointed and doesn't hold together. Lots of books to read, and this isn't one of them.
B001AQIYJC|4.0|I will be buying this movie sometime in the future. I have seen it a few times and will watch it many more.
1575666286|5.0|Great reading and easy to follow recipes. I recommend it to those seeking a change in eating life style. Love it
B0063GORYU|5.0|I could play this game over and over! I think every game can be won if you work at it long enough.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It was just keep turning pages and keep reading even though it was past my bedtime
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Not only is this story thought-provoking, it can also be life-changing if you let it be. Every moment in life is precious and, since time doesn't stand still for any of us, we must learn to live each moment as if it were our last.
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|one very solid and unique  Cd cant wait to hear thier next one when its released in april definately will purchase
1416550550|5.0|Knowing who we are and where we came from. Morton has a way of keeping held to find the mysteries of who we are.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|i loved this book and the characters.  It was so heart warming and uplifting. Especially to people who have been exposed to mental illness or who have it.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was a Warrior of the caliber of David's Mighty Men of 2 Samuel 23:8!  He sacrificed His life for ours!  I thank God for men like Chris Kyle and so many others who are silent Warriors fighting on our behalf.  May God bless his family for his life and sacrifice!
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|this app should be removed from the app store. What a ripoff.  Please do not download this game it is not what you are hoping for...not even close.
B001NLKT60|3.0|The first book was better.  This one was somewhat predictable and I liked the characters less and found them less believable.  Plus the second book makes it so you have to buy the third book.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Rachel McAdams was perfect for the lead role as a woman trying to run a struggling daytime talk show. Harrison Ford almost stole the show as the lead anchor, there were several scenes when I burst out laughig and couldn't stop!
B00021HBGS|3.0|This product is fun for kids to play in the tub . Only one issue with the roads not sticking to the wall. They seem to be too big.
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|When the 1970's arrived Jimmi Hendrix wanted to experiment with his music. He got new approaches and ideas in his mind and wanted to develop them. This compilation is practically the result of those ideas and the recordings are just jams of them. For example he added keyboards, percussions, horns, vocal choruses and even wanted an extra rhythm guitarrist. Some of the songs we have heard them before but the takes of this particular album have never been released. Including a killer cover of \\"hear my train a comin\\". Some highlights are \\"mojo man\\" and \\"earth blues\\". We can also appreciate in a more obvious way Jimmi's love for the blues. The blues was escencial structuring Hendrix guitar playing and we can listen to that in People, Hell and Angels. \\"Villanova Junction\\" the last song of this record is my favourite and it lasts only a minute and a half leaving me hungry for more. Unfortunately the bloke's been dead for more than 40 years but we are lucky enough this songs came out. So dig them all you can.
B007W1BLN0|4.0|An amazing look at a young man who chucks everything, Ivy League education, family, money, etc. to find his dream of living in the wilds of Alaska. Beautiful cinematography and great acting throughout. My only question, was: Why didn't this young man fish to ensure his existence. He had a river nearby yet I never once saw him trying to catch fish, which would have been much easier than shooting a moose and trying to butcher it. Maybe someone has the answer for me...
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Lovely compartments, fits two cameras, three lenses, goodies and filters.<br /><br />At half the price?  You said it!!!  Only thing is that it has the Amazon Logo.  What could be better?
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics, awesome touch screen interface, a fun seek and find strategy game! I would definitely recommend giving it a try. Interesting story line also
B007QDNKQA|5.0|This movie is about a political assassination and a conspiracy against a former Marine Corps sniper reluctantly forced back into service. This USMC sniper takes revenge to take down the most powerful people in the country.  I really enjoyed this movie and I know you will too.
B0060CV31C|3.0|Should have just bought the dvd....guess our internet service isn't fast enough, the movie buffered throughout the entire movie. What a bummer!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A needed, nice and practical calculator. It does its job well. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I think this anthology was great jack nicholson was a great joker danny devito was a great penguin and tommy lee jones was a great :(  :) two face.I think the movie series was better than the tv show of batman.
B00A757EFW|5.0|This was an oldy but goody. Fun game, same grafics and very enjoyable. A A A A A A A
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game cool graphics easy recommend to any one. Sometimes it glitches a little but almost every game does overall good
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good fast fun for everyone. Very enoyable for all ages; 4 through 44 in my home. The younger seen to do better on the game.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|Got the game and was having fun with it.  Good sound and ambiance.  But, randomly I would fall through the ground and off of the map. Even starting a new game wouldn't fix it. Had to close the game and restart it.... Needless to say, I have yet to complete a map as a result.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game and I have played it everyday and night since I bought it. I have my friends and co workers playing it.
1609611543|5.0|Want to save your life, and the lives of your family and friends? Read this book, then give them copies. Dr. William Davis is a hero.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season 2 is as equally awesome as Season 1 was. Downton Abbey is a wonderful mini series. I cannot wait for Season 3.
B007SUW24W|5.0|What a classic. Love your music Ed Sheeran. Such a talent; to think that he writes his own music and lyrics, and sings them too.
034580404X|5.0|I bought it for my girlfriend.  shipped on time. fair prices. she didn't put them down till she finished reading all of them. thank you
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|High energy vocalist, clearly a talented artist. Used product in like-new shape. Mr. Phillips, from my homestate ~ congratulations on your success!
B00307OTDE|5.0|I don't know what else to say, it is Jimi and that should be enough . Ok it's not?.?. Well then you don't have a familiarity with mr Hendrix . If that is the case then this album is exactly what your looking for . What I mean is if your not all that clear on if your \\"into \\" Jimi this would be for you. It's a collection of his most commercially played hits with a few extra to give you a little more depth into his mastery . Bottom line is if you heard something that made you look up this album then you'll like if not love this album!
B008JFUN8C|4.0|Pretty smashing! Great actor selection and the landscape was beautifully crafted without feeling completely unreal. I could have thrown out the heaviness of the whole love triangle nonsense... but the balance between the 3 witches is at least remotely tied to Baum's works unlike blatant missteps like &#34;Wicked&#34;. The film does a great job of letting the Wizard's trickery be played to the fullest and watching the people of Oz get in on the act is great. I also liked the blended references like a lion that runs from a puff of smoke or the stitching of scarecrows. The soundtrack blended nicely - something Elfman always does well.
B000SEI230|5.0|Much intrigue and unknowns. A story of remembering the past and renewing the future. I recommend this book if you like a love story that turns out well.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|... although the cable is a little to thick for my preference.<br /><br />This means that it is not as flexible as I would like nor as convenient for packing, as it is bulkier than my existing 15-foot 30-pin cable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awsome. It may cost a lot but it's so amazing. I can't believe that everyone doesn't love this game. The graphics may not be amazing and it may not be as good as the other versions but this is a MUST HAVE!!!!!!
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|romance and blood and underdogs and brotherly love.  How could you beat that all in one place at the same time?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I am so happy they update it daily ,also I can play this game all day if I wanted to!:)
B009VYF5E2|5.0|I enjoyed each installment of this season - made me anxious to see the next season.  May have to buy season 5.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Loved this series, sad it's over. I don't know what to read next! I even got the makeup palette, inspired by the movie, it's amazing!
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I have watched this show on Netflix (as I was just introduced to it earlier this year), and am absolutely hooked. At least once per episode I laugh (literally) out loud.
B00899DR40|5.0|I definitely have biebermania... My 3year daughter and i just love him and his music. We sing and dance to him all the time.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|If you liked their earlier work, you'll like this too - a good band, with a good sound. The songs are catchy, and definitely get stuck in your head. Enjoy!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I was so excited for this movie when I saw the preview for this movie.  I never saw it advertised in mainstream.  I cannot wait to tell all of my friends about it.  I cannot think of anyone who would not be moved by the beautiful relationship between the odd pair.  Both hilarious and moved to tears.  This will go to one of my all time favorites!
0385333846|4.0|Slaughterhouse Five is part science fiction, part memoir, part philosophy, and throughout it all, strongly anti-war. Focusing on the firebombing of Dresden (an event for which Vonnegut was present), we follow a narrative within a narrative (a book within a book) and our anti-hero Jimmy Pilgrim. Pilgrims last name is not without merit, and he jumps between decades and locations and situations with astonishing frequency. And it is here that I believe the book has its strongest moments; Vonnegut's ability to leap between the past, present, and future with such smoothness is truly impressive. I never felt lost or confused by where he had just taken me.<br /><br />What left such a poor taste in my mouth was the consistent theme of fatalism (\\"you sound to me as though you don't believe in free-will\\") and Billy Pilgrim's correspondingly helpless and listless nature. Our anti-hero DOES very little in this book. For the most part, stuff just happens to him. This isn't a flaw in the work, rather it is the author's intent and purpose, but I found it exhausting.<br /><br />Of note also is the fact that the number of Dresden casualties has been drastically reduced since the publication of this novel. Vonnegut cites 135,000 but that has been decreased to about 20,000 by German scholars. This does not alter the core of the book's message in any way, but is an important fact to be aware of, should you wield the novel in a historical debate over the bombing of civilian targets and the ensuing moral implications.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend this book for its literary elements, and the discussions it can spark in regards to war, religion, and the nature of time. I did not like it though, nor do I agree with a good number of the authors assertions, aside from my unequivocal agreement that war is a terrible thing.<br /><br />It is a book without hope. It is not humorous, despite the satire and witticisms, and it is through and through a tremendously sad work. None of that should keep you from reading it, but bear it in mind when you pick it up or open it for an English class. If not for the refrain 'and so it goes' which is used over 100 times in the novel (to my continuous exasperation) I would have given it five stars. It was, so to speak, the death of me. And so it goes.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I love all the SOA seasons but season four really gets going. Love the characters and characterization, the actors, the plot, but most impressive is the writing.<br />You can't go wrong following SAMCRO. Watch it. --MMW
B00005N6KG|4.0|I wanted a light pair of headphones that would be good to jog with and these fit the bill and the price is right.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This game is free and worth every penny. Games that want you to spend real life money on pretend items are like a slot machine...just not as fun. The game is cute but keep your wallet CLOSED.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is absolutely amazing! But the only reason I'm doing this review thing is to get some gems.. so yeah.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is verry fun and it doesn't get boring on the first level like every other horse game out there.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I really love this game and tilts really fun and spooky so if u r spooked easy dont get this game but if u love scary things then deffintly get it
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is fantastic!!! Graphics are stunning. Very addictive. Game responds well to the touch. This one will definitely get added to my favorite list. Played on kindle fire.
B004IPPINW|1.0|Self Centered<br /><br />I understand that this book was considered for a major writing award. How sad that one would consider this poorly written story of a child of privilege who comes to America and state department our finest schools, falls in love and then makes a personal choice to reject the goodness of the US in exchange for stereotypical paranoia about our goals and ideals .The insult is compounded by his total lack of understanding of mental illness, and how to relate to one in crises .Self centered, egotistical, and immature all describe this character. A total waste of valuable reading time.
B004GXKBFQ|5.0|The movie is grand. The Blue Ray is great. Blue Ray helps this movie; watched it on DVD before the Blue Ray. Buy, it is worth the money.
034580404X|5.0|Ami the only one who found humour in the irony of this story? Yes, it gets a bit intense, but there is veiled hour in it as the girl is relieved of her innocence.
B00008H2LB|5.0|This was by far the fastest delivery I seen. I got this almost over night. I order it late night Thursday turning Friday and I received it Saturday. Brand NEW, sealed, in a packet, just like if you were to buy it at a music store.<br /><br /> thanks you<br />looking forward to do business again
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best game ever go and get it I have it<br />thank you mo.jang Jen that's all I now.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I saw his story on 60 minutes and was hooked. I purchased everything available on Amazon that he's produced and haven't tired of his voice. One caveat though, the CDs all have songs that are available on his other CDs, ie, you'll hear the same song on other Cds. No matter for me though, I enjoyed hearing them mixed in with a different group of songs on each CD.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really Like this subway surfed game its awesome cant stop playing.I play do much that the finger I use toplay with is only adjusted to that only if I try to play something else lol
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Helped me out a lot when I had to take a part my mac, has everything I need. So happy I was able to fix it. :)
B003SHUMRI|2.0|I just watched this movie because I like Channing Tatum, and that's all I got out of it mostly. The actresses were kind of bland, and most of the acting felt unnatural and overplayed at times. The dancing was great though, so if you take out the dialogue, rewrite and completely change the storyline, and change the actresses, then this would have been a good movie. However, if I could go back in time I would save the 2 hours I spent watching this movie and try something else. It was boring.
B0053O89RY|5.0|but this is a must have for your DVD collection if you are a fan of this very funny and witty show.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Adventure, intrigue, action and surprise make for an entertaining read. If you're in to fantasy or medieval history, you'll love this.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|A must for a fan of the supernatural and hot guys!  :)  This show is scary, suspenseful, witty, and entertaining.
B001P06GX4|5.0|This is a great game for adults, as well as for children. It can be used to train kids to think critically, strategize how to win. My kid has become quite an expert in winning the game after playing for a few times. It's a great family game, and it's better than many board games.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Very good book. I hope he writes another one. And if so it should be orange! It's a great book for kids!
1476719071|4.0|It was good. Some parts a little over the top. But still a good read. I am forced to add more words
B007W7P5L8|5.0|I love this cover for my kindle! The Kindle Fire is slightly heavier than the other Kindles, therefore, needing a cover that you can use as a table for comfortable reading. I love to read anywhere so when I am reading it sits on my lap as a small table or I can use it as a traditonal book. It also makes it easy to secure it and slip it into your purse. I liked the fact that there were several colors to choose from. I have ha mine for a few months now and it is used everyday, and still looks brand new. Good value!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Like a lot of the other greatest hits albums.  Whitney has one of the best voices ever.  Enjoyed the album
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Jaycee Dugard's story in her own words moves us toward a better understanding of the mindset of the pedophile as well as an understanding of the complex wreckage left in the wake of such a tragedy.  Jaycee is an amazing young woman whose willingness to share here experience promises to bring hope to other survivors and to be a wake-up call to our society to be more alert to other situations in which children are endangered.
B009DKFST6|3.0|Admittedly didn't listen to the whole album.  got bored.  Seemed like same old stuff.  will still probably buy another Pit Bull album.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book was very confusing. The characters were not well developed. Overall this book was boring and not worth purchasing.
B002JODUI4|4.0|Son listens to DeadMau5 all the time.  Any of these albums are good to him.  He would probably have rated a 5.
034580404X|5.0|What can I say that isn't already said about the book.  I WANT MORE!  I would stay up until 3 am to finish a book.
B002UD56I6|5.0|Given that this disc is stitched together from footage shot on many different days using different format cameras, I am amazed how well the entire thing turned out.<br /><br />On most songs that are stitched together from different footage, you'll see the clothes of Michael, the dancers, the singers, and the band change in the middle of the song as new scenes are cut in. You'd think this would be distracting, but it isn't ... probably because the audio is seamless. All the scenes for a given song are synchronized to the audio track perfectly.<br /><br />You'll also see for any given song that the cameras used are different. Some are high definition and fill the entire screen of an HDTV while others are lower-resolution - you can tell when there is a black border surrounding the scene. Still, I wasn't distracted by this at all. The audio tracks sound great on my home theater and its fun to see Michael interacting with his fellow performers.<br /><br />The scenes with Jackson's lead guitarist, the Australian Orianthi, are just amazing. She is a standout musician. The duet with Judith Hill on &#34;I Just Can't Stop Loving You&#34; was also one of my favorites. I wasn't too crazy to see so much of Kenny Ortega as it seemed he made a special effort to insert himself into some scenes, but that's Hollywood for you.<br /><br />For anyone who grew up listening to Michael Jackson, this is a great disc to remember him by. Even though he didn't get the chance to take it on the road, I hope Michael's adult relatives are proud of what he accomplished on &#34;This is it&#34;.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|The documentary style that makes this book so cool also betrays it by lacking climax toward the end. Overall very good read though. I'm not into zombies either
086547897X|3.0|I like how the book went into technical detail of movement. Yet, I can't help but feel detatched from it when trying to apply the ideas to my own work. I felt as if this book were too formulaic in its examples, especially the walk cycles. If your interested in hand-drawn animation as a jumping off point for you to develop your own set of principles, I would suggest Preston Blair's \\"Cartoon Animation\\", Tezuka Production's \\"Tezuka School of Animation\\", Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston's \\"Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life\\", though the latter is more of a historical overview. I also thought the subtitle should have kept the word 'Classical' and removed everything else, as it was the book's overwhelming focus.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|I eagerly await each new &#34;Pendergast&#34; books, but Two Graves, lacked the excitement and flow of previous books.  It was a good read and set the stage for more on saga of Constance Greene and another player introduced in this book. Good, but not great
B0083Z614S|4.0|This book is a delight to read. Burnett uses such vivid language that the reader can almost smell the garden. Beautiful imagery paired with a touching story makes this book a must read.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This was a page turner.  The ending was not satisfying.  Disappointing,  makes women look bad. Doubt if I would read this author again.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|The person I bought this for loved it. He just gave it to me to watch and he fell in love with the horse. I haven't yet but will because he knows I love animals
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I've read all three books and they are really easy, fast reads. They grab your attention immediately and keep it the whole time.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|My daughter and I just watched this for a buck from Redbox. I am now getting ready to purchase the movie from Amazon.  It is about time they make a movie of quality!!! 3 Oui, Oui, Oui's for this beautiful, funny and charming movie!!
B007MDB548|5.0|If you like the first two TinkerBell movies, you'll love this one too. Another great Disney movie with new cute characters.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I wish the instructions for the trainings were a bit more clear. wasted a few exp trying to figure that out. Otherwise this is a fun way to spend time.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Another classic kids movie. It's as good as all the other kid movies. My daughter loves it and we'll watch it for many future Christmas'.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|It's got it all! Mystery,suspense, drama, AND great graphics with a storyline that makes you want to keep playing. The hints aren't a penalty and being able to choose between seeking or a card game is fun, too.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Good price and bought it for the digital copy. I've seen it a few times now when traveling and never disappoints.
B000YPUF9W|4.0|I purchased this movie so that I could complete my Resident Evil series. For whatever reason I like the movies and now own the complete series.

B000J3OTSM|5.0|I had to purchase this one to complete my collection. I already owned the other three movies but somehow missed the first.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I bought this app because it was in the &quot;top free&quot; section of my kindle fire. Now I know why it's in the top free!!! It will make you crap your pants especially when you put on headphones
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like this game a lot and its addicting my kids also love to play this game!!! I don't have friends who play so I cant add friends to my list but love it otherwise.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is the best app in the world. I love it so so so so so so so so  much!!
B006ZDU7QI|5.0|I can hear echos of Peter Gabriel and Sting in this album. A few of the songs are a bit strange but overall a strong album.
B002Y0TGOU|4.0|This movie was great - I really like the &#34;old&#34; Star Trek, and I think this was a really good idea :) my main complaint is with the quality of the picture.<br />I rented this movie in HD, and I have an HD television and fast (15mps) internet cable connection. I told it to play and within seconds it started playing in full HD. It looked great, I was pleased. But I stopped it about halfway through and did not finish watching it until the next day. It would only play with 2 of 4 bars lit up in orange, no HD. I stopped it, checked my internet connection, rebooted my PS3, rebooted my router, and even tried to start the movie fresh from the beginning again. No matter what I did, it gave me poor standard definition with blotchy pixels. I finished the movie, went on to watch an episode of Fringe, and it played immediately in full HD, as did several other shows. Don't know what happened, but I was just disappointed that the movie wasn't as high quality as I wanted.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The fantastic special effects and interesting story lines have carried through to the 2nd season.  We will watch until the series ends, hopefully many seasons from now!
1592537251|3.0|I am a great fan of sketch book drawings. The sketches in this work are first rate.<br /><br />But the captions are unreadable without using a strong loop in addition to my bifocals!
B007EC27QM|1.0|Who needs to have the words top rated on your app icon.  Not me.  Hate it never even used it.  This was one of the reasons I returned the kindle and bought an ipad
B0034G4ORC|3.0|Good movie, but nothing special. Really more like a &#34;video game.&#34; To me, this movie is just a shameless &#34;military propaganda&#34; film. Just as “Independence Day” was a propaganda film for the Air Force, this one is propped for the Marines. How many times can you remake &#34;War of the Worlds&#34; before it gets stupid? It was even made in Californian, but in Louisiana!
B0063IH60K|1.0|If you like not getting directly to the game, getting side lined to &#34;suggested&#34; other games then get this. I bought a different one this is bad
B008XG1X18|4.0|addicted!! but wish I could get to my boards faster from search to check if I pinned it already. but I love it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great for looking up the weather. Easy to look up other towns and information is easy to read and interpret.
B00BHMF578|5.0|We need more movies that enlightem the public about what our government does and the heros behind the seens. Loved it!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Makes it easy to pull up facebook. Works really nice. Displays pictures a little too big on the screen though.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas Sparks has been a favorite writer of mine for years. In fact I think Safe Haven was one of his best!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My husband is addicted. We both love it. Fun game that can challenge your mind. Great for all ages too.
B00942X8PY|4.0|When I first booted up this game on my RAZR the game gave me a popup asking if I wanted to download a different game.  I hit no, and then it crashed.  I was annoyed.  But I booted it back up a second time and there was no popups and no problems.  So it had to lose one star because of that issue.... now onto the meat of the review:<br /><br />This game could very well be one of the best puzzle games I've ever downloaded for my phone.  It has a great simple, clean interface.  It's got music that fits the theme of the game and is unobtrusive and relaxing while giving you just enough of a hint of energy.  The controls are crisp, responsive, and simple.  The game play is so simple there's no need for a tutorial and everything just feels completely intuitive out of the box.<br /><br />I love puzzle games and this one really delivers.  This is a game I'd actually pay money for, but as a FAOTD, I'd suggest highly that any puzzle fan snap it up immediately.
B00632HWOG|5.0|Makes bring up my yahoo mail easy. Works great. Displayes nicely. Easy to use. No problems with using the app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Really enjoy this game easy money to collect and easy for my two year old son to play by himself
0061692034|2.0|This was one of the dullest, most drawn out, depressing books I have ever read. In fact I almost gave up on it about 3 times and only finished it because I wanted to know what happened to Berner in the end. (Not much by the way!)<br /><br />The main problem is that nothing actually happens in the book apart from the two things he tells you about in the first paragraph of the story, which means there is no suspense and you are just waiting for them to happen and hoping that something interesting will happen in the meantime (it doesn't). He just goes over and over and over the lead up to these events, analysing the characters' thought processes and explaining why they did what they did.<br /><br />I normally love novels about places I know nothing about and characters who are very foreign to me and while Ford is very good at conveying the beauty/bleakness of the landscapes, he barely scratches the surfaces of his characters (I thought the narrator was a girl for the first third of the book). Annie Proulx or Peter Carey he is not and I cannot believe he is a Pulitzer Prize winner. In fact I had never heard of Richard Ford before I read Canada and thought that this was probably his first (and last) novel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|there are quite a few ads, but not terrible. I won't uninstall unless it gets worse. I'm still able to play the game, so I'm not complaining.
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I had just got off a dark knight high and was looking for more and more to satisfy it. I was a little uncertain when I popped this in, but to my surprise it was one of the best stories I have seen! 5 stars!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The ending was sad but really great book!! I love Nicholas Sparks books!! Good read. I recommend it to all !
B000SGGUWS|3.0|I liked it. I've read better teen books and I've read a lot worse. There are more in the series, but the first one didn't motivate me enough to read the next one.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|strong sexual content but kept very clean, classic submissive and dominant role play. Christian Grey and Ana Steel look like they have a long future together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All three in this series are great. But I feel because of the subject matter they are best read by those who are 15 or over. With the world we live in kids are exposed to enough. The idea of kids killing kids should be left for an older set. An eleven year old who read the first one said &#34;But hey have to because they need food&#34; There is no justification for killing another unless you are protecting your own life which is what they are doing, but if everyone refused to do it in the first place then there would have been no hunger games. That is a concept an older person would know.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One question why do I LOVE it so much<br />I LOVE it so much that I acutely play it to much<br /><br />I LOVE this game so much that I acutely play it way to
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as exciting as the first two, but for a conclusion it was very good. If it was too exciting then it would require a 4th book.
B008KE3960|4.0|Overall great game, but I just think that this would be better if you didn't have to control the planes. And if you didn't have to spend money on some of the planes. But other than that this is a great game.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very interesting plot. Couldn't put it down.  Enjoy books that keep your interest until it is finished.<br />When is the next book coming out?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The Book  Thief I one of the best  books ever! You have to read it,  it was my perfect read, and it's so long, you won't need another book for a while.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy the game and the app. There are ads on the free version but not enough to be annoying.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book was even better than The Book Thief, Reached, and The Hunger Games, and is right up there with The Hobbit. Trust me, if you read this, nay, if you buy this book, you will not be disapointed!
B008XG1X18|5.0|it is a lot of fun to search all the different topics and i have a few great ideas, especially in the gardening section and crafts
B007PT1PEY|4.0|Good read enjoying book, wish I could spend more time reading it.Hope to get into it more next week. .
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Mr.Brooks does an amazing job of creating characters so real and vivid that they leap off the pages, and the level of detail in the backstory really transports you to the many different settings of the book. Tales of heroism, horror, fear, love, and the human will to survive will leave you exhausted, but craving more.  Well done sir.
0465011047|2.0|I was hoping to find in this book an account similar to Primo Levi's experiences during World War II.  Sadly, this book falls far short.  It is poorly written and shallow.  Numerous times there were references in the text to experiences or people never mentioned before - a sign of poor editing.  There was little insight and barely more than a surface skim of the topic.  It's a shame, because there are so few accounts of the North Korea gulag system.  However, this books fails to convey them in an impactful manner and I can't recommend it.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|Love it.  They don't have the talent, story lines, of yesteryears.  This was a family-type movie that was a joy to watch as there was not violence, filt, or sex,
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is definitively a page turner.  Recommend this series to friends.  Can,t wait to read the third book and finish the series.
B0045HCJ9E|5.0|Another mystery that leaves you guess until the end.  Good acting, good story plus good actors, how can you go wrong.  Cary Grant is always a plus to any movie.  Wish they could make more of these movies today.
B006R8GK2Q|1.0|Too few different locales. Repeating puzzles. Searches that just threw stuff on the screen haphazardly. Seemed to be a very lazily put together game.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazingly awesome with its graphics and style.My baby brother loves this game and kills me every day just to play it!!!!and so does my MOTHER !!!!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|This was a really good challenge! Lots of puzzle varieties. Great graphics. Definitely would like to see more from this game company. Way worth the price! Thank you!!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|I am not a mystery reader, nor am I fond of Cold War episodes, but if you enjoy both then the ending to this novel makes the whole read worthwhile.
0374214913|3.0|** spoiler alert ** I found this to be a real page-turner with a lot of fun ideas. As it progressed, it got a little too far away from the tech that was supposedly driving the Unbroken Spine revolution, especially once the action moved to the Google campus (really?) and at a certain point it became too couched in the now for me to sustain a suspension of disbelief. Once the plot shifted to involve a ripoff of Warehouse 13, except more mundane, i stopped feeling pulled along by the tale but pushed through to the end. Not a bad read and certainly not one i regret spending time with, but not one i'd wholeheartedly recommend either. I wanted to love it to bits, and instead it was only just okay.
B007QPFGJW|4.0|I think Jo Nesbo is one of the best writers I have read in a long time. He is creative and the writing is tied together very well. I think many of my friends were turned off due to the substance of his writing - a bit gory or morbid. But I read 6 of his books in a two month span and well I won't ruin the rest for any of you if you also decide to embark on the series of Harry Hole. An intense investigator, who battles alcoholism. He does a marvelous job through his incredible ability to think about the crime scene and investigation. Plus he has an off and on again relationship with a woman and her son. It gave me all the pieces I needed to keep turning those pages.
0486278077|4.0|I loved this book as a teen, when I thought Oscar Wilde hung the moon and stars. This time through, if I were in his writing group and this was a draft, I would have these comments:<br /><br />1. Bring Alan Campbell in sooner and develop him more as a character. Same for Adrian Singleton.<br /><br />2. Beautiful though they are, some of the flower metaphors get a tad purple.<br /><br />3. Look carefully at your dialogue. Sometimes Lord Henry pontificates for so long it feels like notes for a witty lecture you gave, not actual social exchange. At others, the lines fly so fast without attribution, they read like notes for an unfinished play. Integrate those better into the novel form.<br /><br />4. I know you can't do this, mired in the 19th century, but please hop in a time machine and write a damn sex scene into this. All the oblique dancing around sins gets tiresome. Up here in the 21st century, we can handle the hot boy on boy action in our literature, so you should just go for it.
B009UZBLSG|4.0|This works great for displaying my phone on my TV. The only drawback is that the optional pass through charging port cannot actually keep up with the power consumption of the phone. For simple things like web and email it does ok but if you play any games your battery will still drain.  I haven't tried it with something like Netflix yet but I would imagine that your battery will still die eventually.<br /><br />My biggest use for this device was to play Real Racing 3 on my large TV screen. If I fully charge my phone first I can play it for about an hour before my phone dies.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is easy to use and works great.  The buttons are big enough so that you don't hit the wrong button or two at once which makes your calculations accurate.  Plus it's free! You can't beat it.

B006HL9G10|5.0|I don't meditate much but want to. I was intrigued by this program (honestly, I just wanted to play with the bell sounds!) But then when I did and heard how beautiful they were, I thought I should add a meditation routine to my daily life. A meditation routine is highly recommended for folks with stress and high blood pressure (like me). The program has prompted me to start.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|You can start 1,000's of plans, and not just read the bible. Read your highlights, notes, and public highlights and notes. You can make your plan public or private. I love this app :)

B003TSEEDY|1.0|Crappy book. Talks about sex too much. Very, very boring and not constructed well. Would definitely not recommend this book to anyone.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|This afternoon I went to see \\"Oz the Great and Powerful.\\" Hey---a new theatrical interpretation of Oz, how could I possibly resist?<br /><br />I've noted previously that the 1939 Oz film had a tremendous impact on me as a child, and influenced me throughout my life. (For instance---I daresay the influence of the film is one of the reasons I've always been partial to the poppy flower. And in fact at this very moment I'm working on a stained glass lampshade featuring a poppy design---over four decades after I first saw this film.)<br /><br />How does this new trip through Oz compare? Well, it doesn't---but I hardly expected it to be in the same league as the iconic 74-year-old film. However, while flawed I thought in the end it proves to be an entertaining entry on the list of Oz adaptations---not as good as some of the others, but far better than many of the lesser offerings.<br /><br />I am not well acquainted with James Franco's body of work, so I had no expectations going in on how he would play the role. I'm afraid my primary impression of this actor was a negative one, based almost entirely on his bizarre and disastrous turn in hosting the Oscars a couple of years ago. (If he wasn't drunk or high on that job---then what on earth was he thinking?) But---I think he does a decent job here with the character. Oh, perhaps he could have used a bit more bluster and bravado---a dash of Robert Preston's Professor Hill from \\"The Music Man.\\" But overall, his interpretation worked for me.<br /><br />Unfortunately, one of the other primary casting choices was disastrous. Mila Kunis didn't work AT ALL for me as the Wicked Witch of the West; I just didn't buy it. Her transformation to this evil creature was underdeveloped, though this was primarily due to problems with the script, which shortchanged both the set-up and payoff. But I didn't find her voice, or physical appearance, or general demeanor convincing in the least. And this is such an iconic character, that the weak link is problematic for the film overall.<br /><br />The script was okay but rather by-the-numbers; I thought the story dragged a bit in the central portion (the film clocks in at around 130 minutes), though things livened up considerably during the final half-hour as the battles between the witches got underway. I think the main problem with the film is that it's lovely to look at, and fairly imaginative, but it has no genuine heart or soul. The audience isn't really given any character to root for, to identify with, and as a result our emotional involvement and attachment to what is happening on-screen is muted at best.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say that I didn't find the scoring to be particularly memorable, which is a shame because first-rate orchestrations could have greatly enhanced the viewing experience. And it was a real shame that no elements directly related to the 1939 film were included in this production. (Due to copyright restrictions, only Baum's original book series---now in public domain---were used for inspiration.) For instance, the presence of the ruby slippers could have provided some key plot points---I've already thought of interesting ways they could have been incorporated into the story. And frankly, I just don't see why the producers of this film didn't secure the rights to use some of the elements from the classic film, because such a thing has been done before in previous Oz adaptations. It makes no sense whatsoever to me.<br /><br />All that said, I did enjoy the film---don't regret going to see it---and found it a pleasant diversion overall. It very well may be one I'll buy when the blu-ray becomes available. I don't think it will leave any lasting or particularly memorable impression in today's pop culture, but it's a respectable enough entry to the world of Oz. I'm hoping that this film performs well, because if it does turn a profit it will make the possibility of further Oz projects that much more likely. (Though it does have a job cutout for it---it will probably have to make over 400 million (USD) world-wide before it breaks even. I'm going to follow the box office most carefully and see how it does.)<br /><br />Oh, an addendum---for those who are curious, I would say this film is moderately family-friendly. Now, I wouldn't take toddlers to see it or anything---too scary for the very young---but it was much less intense than I had been anticipating. I suppose I had been thinking that it would have a bit more \\"mature\\" content. In fact, this film is fairly light in comparison to 1985's [[ASIN:B0000DZ3EN Return to Oz]], which has a much darker, more adult tone. Now, while that film was a failure at the box office, it is one of which I am very fond, and which does have a cult following to this day. If \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" puts you in an Ozian sort of mood, by all means don't forget to check out \\"Return to Oz\\" in turn!out for it---it will probably have to make over 400 million (USD) world-wide before it breaks even.

B00B0NEH8C|5.0|Clutch has been around for over 20 years churning out album after album of top shelf rock. One bad outing can cause a lot of damage to any band's reputation, but that's something Clutch will never have to worry about.<br /><br />This band is so consistent, coming out of the blocks rocking on the title track a dynamic,vocally bombastic, full blooded banger due to Neil Fallon's characteristic intensity. The next cuts, \\"Terminal Velocity\\" and \\"Mister Freedom\\" continue the flow matching the opener step for step.  The band has stated that \\"Earth Rocker will be a more harder and straight forward rocking album.\\" I believe they nailed it.<br /><br />On and on it goes, with every passing track the realization is that there isn't going to be a decline in quality, and that they may have produced an album that ranks up there comfortably with the best of their career.<br /><br />Tim Sult is probably better than most band's top axemen on his worst day and JP Gaster's rock drumming makes it look easy, but honorable mention goes to Neil Fallon as usual, for his \\"mixture of demented preacher speaking in tongues mixed with no frills blue collar rocker that sets them apart from the competition.\\" The man has buckets of personality which overflow into the lyrics and the music.<br /><br />I read...<br /><br />\\"Earth Rocker is a rollicking heavy rock ride that showcases Clutch at the top of their game once again. With their 'no-filler, all-killer' logic and a fan-pleasing alteration in style, the outfit have churned out one of the their most widely appealing efforts thus far, not to mention a staple release for alt-rockers in 2013.\\"<br /><br />The blues cuts and influences are not missing altogether, \\"D.C. Sound Attack!\\" is the song that has some of the most obvious blues influences. All the tunes are catchy and there is tons of energy happening here. Yeah, like Clutch is going to be laid back, LOL. So crank it up and blow out your speakers, as Dan Maines quotes...<br /><br />\\"I think this record comes closer to really capturing that energy of Clutch live. It's a very balanced album. There's no B-side material. It's an album of A-sides. That sounds pretty bold and confident, but that's the way we feel about Earth Rocker.\\"<br /><br />I can't wait to receive my copy to listen to the total album rather than the snippets and you tube videos that are out there. So saddle up and ride this one till the horse packs it in as this rocker is going to wear you down.s record comes closer to really capturing that energy of Clutch live. It's a very balanced album.

You can select the difficulty, the map, the setting (like if its daytime or nighttime), and the effects (like if there's fog or not). It's such a thrill to play; everyone should get it!!

B00992CF6W|5.0|My son loves it.  He is excited about everything he builds.  I mean everything he CRAFTS makes him really proud and excited.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|This man just can't do a bad song. Been listening to him since he was 17 and am looking forward to going to his concert soon.
B00ANVX6DY|4.0|The movie was exactly what I expected however; I was expecting to receive an activity book, stickers and a tiara which did not come with the dvd.
B0043URV5U|5.0|If you love Bob Seger, you will love this Ultimate Hits CD! Hm...I'm supposed to say more about why I like it. I like it because it's Bob Seger!
B004L9MFM2|5.0|Loved every minute of this book, as I did the first book. I can't wait to start number 3 tonight.
0767817478|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie and isn't that what a movie is supposed to do, give us enjoyment.  The sound and special effects were above standards.<br />The actors were fun to watch.  Hank as Victor &#34;animal&#34; was a big hit.  He was funny and yet convincing as a warm, loving husband.  The French guy was so tough and full of action but could never seem to get a decent cup of coffee.  And Broderick did a great job.  All of them were convincing in the parts they played.<br />This is a movie that I had to buy as I will watch again and again.
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Great price for the whole pack.  The batteries work perfect.  I really only needed two but I kept the rest as replacements.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My grandson loves Minecraft and Legos, so how can you go wrong. As others have said, this set is mini,so don't be surprised when it arrives. The pieces are small so not for real little kids. But overall very happy with product.
B008220D7S|5.0|I really was in need of a comedy and I love Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann as a couple on Knocked Up so I was really excited to see this.  It was a very cute movie. I didn't quite laugh-out-loud but did chuckle.<br /><br />We start the movie with a sex scene in a stand up shower. It seems like a completely different movie and my husband perks up on the couch next to me after saying this isn't his &#34;kind of movie&#34;.  Well, that lasts a moment and all hell breaks loose. The couple is fighting over the fact that the husband took a viagra!<br /><br />Debbie (Leslie Mann) and Pete (Paul Rudd) are the quintessential, married couple with kids and have their ebbs and flows as most couples do. There is a moment when Pete is telling his friends that they are at that moment in the relationship where everything they say, makes the other person mad.  Who hasn't been there and can't relate? My hand isn't raised right now.<br /><br />There are moments are that very cute, and very sweet and funny. Melissa McCarthy as a very pissed off mom cracked me up.  While I was hoping for more hysterics I loved watching this couple who are trying very hard to head into their 40s with the best of intentions; changing their diets, working out, controlling their kids, taking care of their parents, etc., they are a lot hotter than most average couples so seeing them struggle to hold onto their youth wasn't something I found easy. Also, while they bicker, they are very in love and spend a lot of time talking and &#34;getting along&#34;.<br /><br />There are some very funny moments like Paul with his legs up in the air, a mirror posed at his anus and a smartphone trying to snap pictures of something he wants his wife to see by his butt and some surprises like Megan Fox and Jason Segel, who I thought were great in this. I am a huge Jason Segel fan so seeing him as a workout instructor with game was cute.<br /><br />See this movie! You won't be disappointed. I can't wait to see it again.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Ken Follett geniously takes you back to the era of serfs and lords and corrupt church leaders, all interested in surviving the hard life dealt in that time.  Frequently sequels are a distant second to a great first, but I enjoyed this one as much as Pillars.
B005NKGEP2|3.0|I enjoyed the voice of the main character most of all.  She is a mom of two, the wife of an absentee husband and sort of full of resentment.  She struggles with her new life of being a stay at home mom as well as being in a strange new country.  Her voice is often cynical which lends itself to some interesting points of view about life.  The bits and pieces of background info kept me guessing and I really didn't know how the story would end.  The book jumps back and forth from past to present so the whole time it's like putting together a puzzle.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a female lead that isn't a teenager and is no nonsense. Fun book. (There's a lot more to the story but hate spoilers.)
0062082353|5.0|A must read, few hero's left today and Kyle has to be one of the top. Bought just before his tragic death so it is a keeper.

B0099Y2YL6|1.0|dvd was defective (bad skipping) as of yet it has not been made right. would not buy online to big a hassel to return
B00A7OJ0DC|3.0|I love the movie, it's the best video game movie of all time, and probably in my top 10 favorite Disney films.<br /><br />Other reviews have tackled the movie's plot, so I'm going to stick to reviewing the details of the 2D Blu-ray disc. I do not have a 3D set or a surround sound system, so I cannot comment on those.<br /><br />The picture quality on the Blu-ray is superb. No artifacts, color banding, off color skin tones or other problems that come from compression or a bad transfer. It looks like you're looking through a crystal clear glass window straight into the world of the movie. The clarity is amazing. If you're a gamer with a large TV, you'll get a lot of joy out of pausing the playback to pick out cameos and references in the backgrounds that you missed in the theater.<br /><br />The sound is likewise excellent. The dialog is clear as a bell, with no muddiness in the sound effects or musical score. This is a real bonus, since many of the video game references are auditory. For example, the sound effect when Sargent Calhoun charges her gun is taken from Mega Man X.<br /><br />Love the movie itself, but extras is where this release falls flat. There's five deleted scenes (with an optional commentary track), four promotional commercials made for Litwak's Arcade, a &#34;making of&#34; documentary that runs about 20 minutes, and the Paperman short shown before the film. There is a trivia feature that pops up on screen when you pause the movie, but it loops after around 10 minutes. Watching everything would take you about an hour, and that's if you watched the deleted scenes twice for the commentary track. I was expecting a lot more.<br /><br />Where are the cast interviews? The character galleries? I want to know what kind of legal wrangling they had to go through to get all those cameos. There isn't even a commentary track. Disney couldn't even get some of the staff or cast members to sit down and talk about the movie for an hour and a half?<br /><br />The lack of concept art is particularly annoying, because they show brief flashes of some it during the featurette and it looks really interesting! Then there's the music, which they don't talk about AT ALL. Come on Disney, you got Buckner and Garcia to record a new song for the credits, and it's not even mentioned.<br /><br />Maybe they'll be pushing an &#34;Ultimate Edition&#34; with all of the stuff that should have been on this release a few years from now.<br /><br />5 stars for the movie.<br /><br />2 stars for the extras.
B00881VLCE|3.0|This is a solid puzzle game but it could be better. I'd like to see a timer and easier categorization of puzzles.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|After I read &#34;Gone Girl&#34; and LOVED the book, I checked on Amazon to see what else the author had written.  I had other books waiting to be read at home, but waned to read more by Gillian Flynn.  She is an amazing writer.  Just when you think you know who did it, everything changes.  I suspected many different characters as I read Sharp Objects, and was surprised at the end.  I love a book that can &#34;get me&#34; at the end!
B009NNG202|1.0|Couldn't even finish watching this.  Awful, minimal dialogue.  Lots of violence.  Very confusing and not sure what it was about.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is so fun and addicting my daughter plays this game everyday and she loves it soo much I think people should download it I think it's awesome.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Of course it was fun to see the old video game references (that would be lost on kids), but the story was pretty good as well.  The integration of all of the games and their characters was done very well.  I have to admit I did not expect the plot twist at all (I probably should have, but it eluded me).  I also liked that the requisite sad turn of events wasn't so bad that it made me tear up or squirm in my seat as they often do.  Overall a very fun movie that won't make kids cry.  The animation was excellent and the \\"sets\\" were extremely fun to watch as were the quirkiness of the characters.
0811826848|5.0|FIVE STARS! AAAAA+
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Haven't played this game for long, but do enjoy using my pinkie to draw the colored lines.  I enjoy the appearance on screen, and usually play for a few minutes before I go to bed.  Though easy at first, I've gotten to a level that now requires real thought, and I've had to use ? a couple times to suggest a solution.  I'd recommend just for something to do to kill time.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Back to his old twists. The book had me from the start, very entertaining and hard to put down.<br />Good book.
0316069434|3.0|I wanted to like this novel...I really did. I have read every Harry Bosch book that Connelly has written, and I have enjoyed this series so far. This book just fell flat.<br /><br />The start of the book had some momentum going:  the murder of young reporter/photojournalist Anneke Jesperson during the 1992 riots. But I feel that the book lost that momentum as it went on. The introduction of Lieutenant O'Toole was annoying. Another character that Bosch can butt heads with, since Irving can't be used as that kind of antagonist anymore? (yawn) And okay, Bosch likes jazz, but this book went overboard beating the reader over the head with all kinds of jazz-related info (different artists and Bosch giving in-depth analyses on the emotional impact of the various pieces he is listening to at the time. Has Bosch referenced jazz pieces by name in past books? Yes. But it comes across less as a subtle inclusion to flesh out Bosch's character and instead makes it all seem unrealistic.<br /><br />Then there's Bosch's daughter Madeline. She loses a lot of character depth in this book. She just seems incredibly two-dimensional. Same goes for Hannah Stone, who is supposed to be Bosch's love interest, but she comes across as almost an afterthought of a character here in this book. David Chu continues to be a non-essential character. Connelly hasn't given Bosch a partner that could also be integral to plot and character development since Jerry Edgar.<br /><br />I like that there were some complexities to the case Bosch is investigating, but the over-description of war-related scenes dragged it down a little. I don't read Connelly for war narrative, and he could have easily cut down on some of the overblown description and still gotten the point across.<br /><br />I'm giving this 3 stars because, to me, this comes across as just an average read and certainly not up to the stellar par of some previous Connelly books that feature Bosch. Hopefully the author does better next time around (assuming there is a next time and Connelly does not stick a fork in this series). But then again, with all the times Connelly mentions that Maddie is interested in becoming a police officer, I'm sure he's setting up a \\"next generation\\" series with her as the star anyway.assuming there is a next time and Connelly does not stick a fork in this series). But then again, with all the times Connelly mentions that Maddie is interested in becoming a police officer, I'm sure he's setting up a \\"next generation\\" series with her as the star anyway.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Good acting...  just didn't like the story line.  Just not Washington's type of film.  He has had better material in the past.
B0095P31L6|2.0|As much as I want to like this film it's just bad - no - I mean it's genuinely bad.<br /><br />Rango impersonates a children's film from the way it appears in the supermarket top display stands to the way it consistently appears in Amazon's top movies for families and children.  Having watched the film with my children I can only say this is a mystery because it is neither.<br /><br />While the film uses animated animals as it's characters, that's about the end of where children under twelve might have any ability to relate to its content. Many over twelve may simply find it a weird movie.<br /><br />There are some strange cameo's by a Clint Eastwood \\"cowboy\\" who offers cryptic advice that only a grownup familiar with Eastwood and his older spaghetti westerns might \\"get\\".  And Clint's delivery of the advice is just freaky.<br />Another scene has Rango landing on another \\"rider\\" with his dress (yes, his dress) draping over the rider's head.  When the garment finally blows off, the rider comments how the situation \\"was not altogether unpleasant\\".<br />While you keep expecting it to become funny (maybe it's because of the animals) it doesn't get any funnier it only gets weirder.<br /><br />There are some fight scenes, warlike scenarios, a giant, evil rattlesnake and situations that are scary and avant guarde, but then, again, that is probably a fitting description for the whole movie - avant guarde.<br /><br />So if you and your children enjoy an unusual, avant guarde film that looks humorous but largely is not, and that looks entertaining but leaves you wondering why you rented it, This film is for you.  If not, don't rent this for your kids.  Instead, you might enjoy something more like Wreck it Ralph, Monsters Inc., or Swiss Family Robinson.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|To imagine this girl lost five years of her life in one accident.  But how she feel in love with her husband all over again after having been released from the marriage she couldn't remember.  Amazing.
B00197U0DU|5.0|I knew this disc from Youtube. I wanted to have a better quality of one of the REAL music world example (among many, happily), which is the first album by Genesis.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really awesome game! I think everyone should play it! It is a little like temple run. I want to unlock frizzy.
B005Z28M58|5.0|I watched the final season on television & was very pleased with the acting delivered. Particularly, Marcia Cross (Bree) stood out to me. This season was the pinnacle of her acting on the show. The last episode when Kathryn Joosten was on her death bed & Bree rushes in to be with her in those last moments was just depressing. Just the expression on Marcia Cross's face was Emmy worthy (so much depth). How she is willing to take the wrap for manslaughter & is the one to take the secret to the grave. Great cast. Hoping for a series with either Marcia Cross or Teri Hatcher as the lead for future ABC.
B00942X8PY|3.0|I like this game.  I'd probably give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the dumb comments it gives after you complete a round.  I don't feel that instructions are necessary.  The first few levels kind of walk you through how the game works.  The graphics are simple, but that's all that's needed.  I've played 23 levels and I'm not bored of it yet.<br /><br />I have to take off another star.  It just locked up my tablet when I tried to select a level.  I hadn't done that before, so I don't know if this is a one time occurrence.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|this game kept me coming back whenever i had down time. well worth the money.  can`t wait to play the sequel.

I will learn to get my point a cross in a more understanding way by using his love language. I recommend this book to every married couple.
B00AZ3KPZC|5.0|Peter Pan and Tinerbell take the Darling children on a fantastical adventure to Neverland. The theme of never growing up asks children of all ages to allow time for dreaming and play. Peter Pan the and Lost Boys enliven our risk taking senses to question less and follow the insticts of the moment. Peter Pan, the Lost Boys and the Darling children enterntain the notion that nothing is impossible when you dream. Even overcoming Captain Hook and his pirates. A great movie for all ages.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|No resolve! I never write reviews but come on!!! I WAS LEFT WITH A CLIFFHANGER A YEAR AGO AND NOOOOOOO RESOLVE NOW!  Pick Juilian, pick Alex, give us a 5 year later picture worthy of reading a trilogy! Maybe she wants to write another book? But honestly we deserve some closure....this is not real life.....its a story and all the characters that we have grown to love or hate need to have some sort of ending...makes me mad I got involved in this story at alll.....I feel like this book was more like a \\"filler\\" for the real ending or final book to me......sooooooo bummed about this book.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This movie was great. I really like Alex O'Loughlin and Jennifer Lopez. They really complimented each other in this show.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This novel explores unconditional love between two beautifully evolved characters despite their tragic childhoods.  The future of these two young lovers is the Sky.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Love this book because it is peculiar and different.  It's not your ordinary boy meets girl story, or monsters are real, or time travel adventure, it's all that and more presented with awesome photographs that adds authniciticy to the story.  Great book to use for high school book club also.  My students really enjoyed the book and were mesmerized by the photos.

B005GFPZYK|4.0|Chris Kyle does not think he is superman. He knew that he just tried harder than others. He was a true hero and put his country above all. I was going to read the book even before he died. He excelled at helping other soldiers during war and after. During his deployments, he saved many soldiers and just felt it was duty.

B0080K3G4O|5.0|Always thought \\"normal\\" was a setting on a wash machine...I almost feel normal after reading this book and certainly affirmed.  I would love to see a reading group on this book alone if on no other books...I am an avid reader and a contemplator...spend lots of time \\"pondering\\"...existential issues...not sorry for them...I always thought \\"positive thinking gurus\\" were full of bulls*** after trying some of them..just more bulls***..this book affirmed me with proofs...lots of them...entertaining..humorous even on the topic of death which I have annoyed others talking about.  Have been with 7 folks upon the moment of death and ya get really serious about your own.  I am actually getting pats on the back since other folks have read this book and got comfortable with \\"failure\\" and death.  Some real teachers in this life.  Would recommend this book highly for anyone who loves hanging out and thinking.<br />Kathy
B001D7CHAA|5.0|Having read other books by Mr. Miller, this was also a delight!

1451624468|4.0|There is another book, God Stopping A Nuclear War, which presents a solution of what God is, and it fits into this view of Nothing. What is presented, that from Nothing, first came relationships relating to the state of Nothing, reflecting back on itself, Alive Information, which created God/Holy Spirit/whatever(his mind). Answering the question, who or what created God. That it wasn't matter or energy which first came from Nothing, but metaphysical principles(relationships), which interrelated, and became the underlying mind to the rest of reality, spiritual and physical. Suggesting that information itself, later created natural laws and physical objects, but underneath is one mind behind it all. And behind it, is the Nothingness, from where it came from. Also agreeing with Krass that Nothingness is unstable. But that best part of the other book is that it suggests that this mind, while behind everything, still isn't the old Biblical God. That the universal mind is relational in nature, Alive Information, which is why the afterlife seems so alive to people who experience a NDE. And what God really is a composite mind of all the Left Brains on earth, being very verbal because our Left Brain handles verbal processing. Which is why God favored the Jews as his chosen people, being so verbal. Also explaining why Jews produce more lawyers, bankers, and media people than mechanics, artists, and laborers. Jews and Muslims and Indians are much better with their left brains than with their right brains. Jewish kids want to be lawyers and doctors more than mechanics don't they? Or want to work with their hands for a living. And what we call Satan, is really another composite mind made of all the Right Brains in mankind, more mechanical and spatial, favoring populations more naturally artistic. Explaining why Muslims, a Semitic people, also close to God, shut down their right brain pleasures. No pictures, no drinking, no pretty faces, little music(remember how Cat Stevens abandoned his music career when he embraced his religion). The second anti-Christ was a failed artist, like Nero was, Hitler. And why Hitler mistrusted Jews in banking and loved only art which portrayed pictures realistically, without any abstract influence from the left brain. Explaining why the three of most mechanical minded populations in the world during the second world war, Italy-Germany-Japan, fought to win the world. The right brain doesn't like to follow the verbal rules that come from the right brain. Thus Hitler didn't follow laws, except the laws which he liked. Germans, being more right brained on average, don't like following rules as much as Jews. No speed limits. And the population with the highest right brain to left brain usage in it, blacks, have the highest crime rates. Read both books.

B000JMKNV0|3.0|First part of book was excellent but got tedious towards the end.  This could be me since I do not like psychological thrillers.
B005EGXTHG|4.0|Great characters and a gripping storyline.<br />Once I started found it hard to put down again.<br />A must read story
B006VA57CY|1.0|Beware: Downton Abbey is yet another marcher in the never-ending parade of the secular progressive homosexual agenda. Don't let the positive reviews draw you in. All the fine acting and beautiful set dressing in the world is mere lipstick on the pig of this depraved script.
B005EGXTL2|5.0|I enjoyed this book the most which is strange as usually in series like these the books don't get better along the way.<br />This book tied it all together and wrapped it up in a satisfying end.
0307895475|5.0|This thing is big. It is like the size of a phone book. Very comprehensive. I am looking forward the the gaming experience.
B0071DJZZA|4.0|Lots of twists and turns in the second instalment.<br />The ending was a bit abrupt and left me assuming I had guessed right!
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Gut zum slashen und auch ohne Geld kann man weiter<br />Konmen am also ein gutes Spiel für Kindle für zwischendrin
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the book very much..it's so mind bending and mysterious and it keeps you competing back for more .
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game for kids.  After newness wears off, game moves slower than preferred in some areas. This is one of the best nonviolent games available I played.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Just as advertised! I like the white noise option. I like picking my own wake up music. I also like the night light mode.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It takes a minute to get into, but am enjoying them none the less<br /><br />Definitely would recommend this book to all.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very entertaining and engaging from beginning to end. Now I am ready for more of his books. Any suggestions for me?
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I really enjoyed this book, I just wish they could make a movie that would do the story and author justice.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I love Kate Morton's books.  This was a page turner with plenty of twists and even a gasp or two.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Far from blew me away but certainly have seen worse dramas. Silliness of chase at the end ruined the tension for me.<br />Silliness of John Goodman and Alan Arkin, on the other hand was a treat.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I tried the free version for awhile-and loved it!  I wanted to help support the developer, so I purchased it.  It's beautiful in it's simplicity and functionality.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Thank u a bit scary for my 4 year old but we love it and so did he ! Thank u! Great shipping !
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Having grown up in the Middle East, and gone to University in Cairo, Egypt, to learn Arabic, I see and understand the Arab side of the equation. 99% are lovely warm hospitable people. I wanted to read American Sniper because everyone must learn to think outside their own box and try to understand why the conflict exists from the adversaries' perspective (they look at America as having lost its moral compass with regards to church, sex, drugs, dress; and we want to impose this degraded societal norm on them?? - can you see the huge disconnect here?). So I needed to understand the drive and logic of an American soldier who goes into someone else's country and tries to impose a US religious and life-style norm on a conservative religious and religiously-diverse culture. Well, this is not the book for that. Neither the soldiers nor the insurgents get the big picture, it's just we're the good guys and their the bad guys, my government told me so, and the civilians better get out of the way until the madness plays out. So what is this book? It is fascinating in terms of the technicals, thought process and efficiency of being a trained honed sniper. And it illuminates the box of the US flag waving, patriotic, my-way-or-the-highway, US soldier. And I agree that the insurgents are just as unthinking and intransigent, and can't understand the US box. But it also illuminates two points. One is that this is the type of person who fights wars and the civilian population should just get out of the way as best they can whenever countries are going through the early violent periods of self determination.  And the second is that it has always been this way and always will be. Worth the read. The writing is not Hemingway, but neither is he trying to be. He's a normal Joe who wrote an enlightening story.
B004PR71JC|5.0|We love this movie ! Excellent for my 4 year old ! He watched it over and over and I watched with him :)
B002SRQ214|5.0|It was slow getting here, but who cares about that now as this thing is smoking fast! For the money it is totally comparable to Intel (as I have an Intel also) it is not as fast but for the money it is better. If you are debating on a low price quad-core cpu get this now. I got this on a Asrock 970de3/u3s3 and it is running very well. The first build I've done with AMD since 2000 and I'm glad I went with AMD.<br /><br />*Update* I ordered a new heatsink and fan(Cooler Master) to go with this as the stock one is only good enough to keep it running. It ran a lot hotter than I liked with the stock cooler on it, but I do play some graphic intense games, so anyway just order a new after market cooler to keep it cool!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is too good! I got Temple Run as soon as it came out. It was great, but eventually, Imangi comes out with this, and I am blown away. Amazing graphics, great sound effects, great additions, it is just phenomenal.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|The game is OK, controls and graphics are at quake 1 level. My issue that I can't fix is the following:<br />farm lvl, day time, medium difficultly<br /><br />After collecting 7/8 pages my character has some sort of no clipping turned on. I fall through the ground and can't stop. Even the spooky man can't get me.  But I can't get back to ground level and I get stuck. After that I quit the game thinking I bugged out.  Now EVERY new game of the same difficultly it says 7/8 at the very start and I fall through the ground instantly and get stuck.
B008NR8YXC|4.0|The Good:<br />This is one of the most beautiful interpretations of  &#34;The Well-Tempered Clavier&#34; I've ever heard. I absolutely agree with the superlatives written by other reviewers: Schiff's playing is elegant, balanced, relaxed, thoughtful, joyful, meditative, airy, and almost perfect. One minor criticism: in my opinion Schiff unnecessarily tones down pain, sadness and passion that I feel is appropriate for a few pieces (e.g. in Prelude in B flat minor, BWV 867; track 19 on Disc 2), erring instead on the side of lightness. However, I love his interpretative choices in more than 90% of the tracks, so this is basically nitpicking. I give five stars to Schiff, but since I'm reviewing a product, I have to subtract one star for a nearly fatal flaw in the recording as discussed below.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />There is WAY too much reverb in the recording! I don't know if the reverberation is natural or added in post-processing, but I find it almost unbearable. It &#34;cathedralizes&#34; this music and it is jarringly at odds with its inherent intimacy and intricate polyphony. In the interviews Andras Schiff emphasized not using the sustain pedal while recording in order to increase the clarity of the counterpoint. I hate to say it, but the &#34;permanent sustain&#34; of the long reverb effectively obliterates most of the fine detail he worked so hard to convey. Did the recording engineer take the 'Well&#34; in &#34;The Well-Tempered Clavier&#34; literally? I sure sounds like it's coming from a pretty deep well... I am angry about this because the flawed recording prevents me from listening to Schiff's performance as much as I'd like to. What a waste!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Like the graphics. The concept of the \\"mirrored\\" worlds was a great idea!! I give it 5 stars and would recommend it to my friends.
B003B02PF4|5.0|Love this book!! Just finished reading it for the second time!! Takes you in from page one and you don't want to put it down till you're finished.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Disapointing. The series as a whole lacks depth. It was a decent quick read, but I was left feeling like I didn't get everything I wanted out of them.
B008MG1E4A|3.0|While certainly a fascinating story and despite the protestations of humility, the book comes off as rather egotistical and is not very well written.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|The author might be thinking of writing another book because he left a lot of unanswered questions at the end of the story.  I would have liked to learn what happened to Chet and Buck.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|picsart is the best free photo app for the kindle fire! With all the different features,  you can do great things to any pictures! I highly recommend it!
1616550414|5.0|If you like Video Games in general you MUST buy it!!! It`s an amazing book to celebrate the anniversary of one of the main franchise of video game`s history!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|My wife enjoys this show so i guess it's a good deal. Price wise, not enough episodes for the full price of a DVD.
1609611543|2.0|I followed a low carb in the past, and noticed that I felt better.  So I thought maybe the problem isn't carbs, but gluten.  I started out reading this book with anticipation, but it didn't take long to lose interest.  There is way too much repetition, and way too much information on the history of wheat.  Plus, unless you are a chemist,  you probably won't have any interest at all in a lot of the information presented.
B0024RID60|5.0|A great selection of classic Stones tunes from a time period  that brings back a lot of hazy memories. One of their best.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Slender Man! Chapter 1: Alone is the second best app (apart from Minecraft PE)  ever!!!  Was playing it on the \\"farm\\" mode and for three signs,  he never appeared. But then BOOM BADDA BOOM he appeared on my trail to the graves. He kept on emerging in front of me,  but failure for him!  If he even is a guy!  It isn't that scathe but if you do not like being pwned or if you really have weak constitutions,  don't even press buy. But in the nd of my farm episode,  I won. Cool. Well don't just stand there reading this... get this game or be a s***!
B003XUKVXK|5.0|Great CD with lots of energy and special guests of old time Chicago Blues artists. Kenny Wayne tears it up with &#34;Dance for Me&#34; and &#34;King Bee&#34;.  Just wish the CD included a live version of &#34;Voodoo Chile&#34; like the one done on the Jimi Hendrix tribute concert.  He stole the show!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Have watched all three seasons and enjoyed them very much.  Hope they stop eliminating characters on the series or at least go at a slower pace in season 4.
B00006AW2J|5.0|Brings back a lot of memories and a great selection of classics.  All in all a great piece of work.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I love the game it is so addicting. I can never put it down when I have to. I have no problems with the game it works fine on my kindle fire. Anyone else must have a older kindle than me.
B00A8307BG|3.0|I was excited to see the song list on this CD, but was disappointed at Trower's versions.  Expected a lot more.
B0074V3712|5.0|Another great book by E.O. Wilson.  If you ever feel perplexed by the range of human social behavior, Wilson lays out a biological explanation that just might help save us from ourselves if enough of us will stop to consider it.
B0055PMURG|5.0|This was one of the best inspirational movies of this type that I can remember.  Especially since it is based on fact.  If everybody had the kind of courage, perseverance and kindness as Bethany, this world would be a better place.  If her tragedy happened to me instead and I some how lived, I would probably become a hermit full of self pity.  She is an inspiration to a LOT of people.<br /><br />As to some of the people saying that Carrie Underwood sucked in the movie, you have been watching way to many movies where the characters couldn't possibly be a real person or were expecting more out of her because of who she is.  Personally, I think the movie would have lost just a little bit if it were a different actor in her role.  She was so human.  She didn't sound fake at all.  She really did sound like a real life person that does what she did.....a normal person.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|I have enjoyed these movies since I was a kid. Now my son is watching them and also enjoys them. Great price. Thank you
B00942X8PY|5.0|Finally, a game worthy of grabbing as a free app of the day!  Huebrix gets it right with pleasing music and sounds, tons of levels/difficulties, simple but appealing graphics and challenging (but not completely frustrating) gameplay. This will be a great time-waster for me! It's nice to see that some developers still &quot;get it&quot;. Sometimes less is more, folks. Addictive, well thought-out gameplay trumps empty, buggy eye candy every time. I like that there are no directions and you are left to figure it out on your own. Just adds to the thinking experience.  Kudos to the developer! Great work!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|What can I say about this amazing human being.  There will never be another quite like him again.  You are so greatly missed.<br />Thank you Michael Jackson for all you gave to me and the world.  God rest your soul.<br />Justice For Michael &#60;3<br />Peace and love Christiane (mj lover)
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Good look at the reality war puts someone through. Having been there done that I thank all of our veterans for their service.
1608871517|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I feel Michael Bush has done an incredible job in allowing those who love Michael a glimpse as to what went on behind the scenes.  The respect between these men and the joy they experienced with each other. In my position it's always good to know the caring Michael Jackson had with others who worked for him and the humbleness he had comparing to other artists.  Thank you Michael Bush for your loyalty to Michael.<br />Justice For Michael  &#60;3<br />Peace and love Christiane (mj lover)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|fun game, nice animation & drawings.<br />best success: my 7yrs kid is the best player at it, loves it.<br />downside: she tries to get my kindle all the time...
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and will look for more from this author......highly recommend especially if you like books about magic and wizards..
B007N6NGYG|5.0|I love about anything with trains, so I was excited to see this one and I wasn't disappointed. It's not too difficult, but not too easy, so it's easy to enjoy the game without getting too caught up in the strategy. Graphically, it's nice. I really don't think anyone would go wrong with this one.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|We really enjoyed both the first and second of this series.  We really hope that Guy Richie and the boys will make several more!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|I've loved her since she won American Idol.  Knew I wanted all of her familiar hits in one CD.  She is just so talented.
1611748755|5.0|The CD arrived quickly and was very enjoyable to listen to.  Its a great story - read it or listen to it.  But, know the story!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I knew I had to have this CD after hearing just a portion of it in a commercial.  AT the time I had not heard it on radio.  What a voice and talented writer.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Super addicting game. At first sight the game does not overly impress with the graphics, but makes up for it in game play. It has this great preview play where you can run through the entire level. The only negative is that your extra powers are limited and there is an option for in game purchases of power. Small annoyance. Great game! !!
0062082353|5.0|My son was a member of SEAL Team Four for a good number of years, went back to school and is currently serving in a field hospital providing treatment to wounded Marines in Afghanistan as an orthopaedic trauma surgeon, so anything having to do with the stellar performance of SEALS automatically captures my interest.<br /><br />I gave this book my highest rating for several reasons:  1) Kyle holds the highest record for enemy kills of any sniper in American history.  2)  Many books written by SEALS or former SEALS, engage in a lot of self-praise and chest-thumping (particularly books by Richard Marcinko).  Kyle's account of achievements is humble and modest, while he delivers so much credit to others.  3)  As with most SEALS, Kyle's dedication to America's security is unquestionable.  4)  Although Kyle was retired from the Navy, he still spent a good portion of his time helping fellow veterans with PTSD--his dedication continued up until the moment of his unfortunate death.  5) Aside from his stellar performance as a SEAL sniper, Kyle set a perfect example for America's youth to emulate by the way he conducted his life.  6)  Kyle was truly one of America's most admirable heroes!  7)  Upon reading the breaking news of Kyle's untimely death, I immediately ordered his book from Amazon.  I enjoyed the book so much, that I am nearly finished with my third reading of it.<br /><br />America owes so much to Chris Kyle's family for his dedication as well as his and his family's sacrifices in behalf of America's security.  Thank you Kyle family!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Love this case! I love the color purple. It is a beautiful colored case and I like the band it has to keep the case shut. Great product.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I was soon exited when I herd that leps world 2 came out this game is 100 times better than leps world one not saying that it was bad but in this game you can fight Monsters and there's way more worlds and levels this game is all epic you need to get this plus its free
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Great for watching movies on your kindle. My daughter likes to watch a lot of movies so I downloaded this and it works great.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This was one of Lee Child's best books.  It moved along at a fast pace but still fleshed out all the characters.<br />As always it had plenty of action and mystery until the last chapter.  And Reacher stays true to his values.<br />Rodney Penland.
B000AYO3NG|2.0|This record comes up when you search for the UPC (094634057523).  Unfortunately, my copy of this Argentinian pressing had the dreaded &#34;Copy Controlled&#34; label on the inlay.  It's a great album IMO (their best since Violator) but it's unforgivable to buy a CD you can't rip to MP3.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|A very thought provoking story. Sad and heart breaking. Another look at  life during World War II. It will make you pray we never have a war like this again.
B0091THDOM|5.0|Ordered it.  Received it in timely fashion.  Was everything I expected.  I carry the phone in my pants pocket and feel that the phone is well protected.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Another fabulous story of love, fate and courage by Nicholas Sparks. Just when you think you know it all, a sudden turn takes you further into the story. You won't be disappointed you chose to read this book.
B0045XICB2|5.0|I just this rating for many reason. The movie is amazing the CGI is epic the makeup on the vampires makes them look less sparkly more human in a way. The acting is amazing. The sellers left me awe stroked at how fast the shipping was. I will by this over and over again. I would recommended to all those Twilight fanatics.
B0089LOKHG|4.0|Lauren Oliver's long awaited finale in the Delirium Trilogy was, at times, frustrating, joyful, heartbreaking, and heart pounding. It left me wanting closure, as there is none, but it is quite fitting for the setting.  For those looking for a reunion, or a clear cut path, don't hold your breath.  An epilogue would have been nice.  I feel that the readers, who have devoted their time to the series, deserved more.  Overall, a good read with an ending that is severely lacking.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|fun to play  keeps kids and husband  busy for hours. tilt screen is great. funny  to watch them play and see how crazy they get with it.
B009GIPDQS|5.0|Super book. Always a shame when you come to the end. Grisham novels rarely disappoint and this is an excellent read.
B004SBX112|5.0|I have played all the Angry Bird games.  Like them all.  They are for all ages.  I am 55 and sitting in the barbershop the other day I played it with a 6 year old I just met. Graphics are incredible.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|About as good as todays hollywood could do with a cast of old has-beens the first was better and that aint sayin a whole lot.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This was a very well written book. The story would make a Great movie. A great who done it.  It took almost the entire story to figure out who the killer was. I had a hard time putting it down. I was sad when it was over, wanting more.  it was a great story and you really felt for the main character, wanting her to overcome her tragedy.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|This was watchable some nice action scenes and a good story a watchable flick , and there are no regrets for renting it.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|I like this story.  Well written, not a run-of-the-mill novel.  Based on this book,  I will read this author's works again.
B00A77II0U|1.0|I own the game on my PC from Big Fish.  I played it one time and I've always meant to go back and play it again, but I can't get it to work.
1615238948|4.0|This is another book about slavery in the early yrs of the United States, with a few twists.  The story is interesting, characters well-developed.
B003UBTX6S|2.0|In the second installment in the Beautiful Creatures series, we return to Gatlin, where Ethan Wate is trying to return to a normal life with his beloved caster girlfriend after the death of her uncle on her sixteenth moon. Lena begins to pull away from Ethan, feeling responsible for her uncles death, and starts to show signs of darkness.<br /> I wish I could say where the plot goes from there, but there was so much happening by the end of this novel that I have no way of knowing for sure. While the book is in some aspects entertaining to read, it was very hard to follow. At times during this book I found myself reading passages over again until finally just trying to get through a chapter in hopes that it would make sense in the end. Early in the story three new characters are introduced, none of whom are given any sort of background and only very vague explanations. In a random nonsensical vision that Ethan has when he touches an item that belongs to Lena's uncle, we read about Abraham who we know only as a Ravenwood ancestor who is a powerful and evil incubus who saved Ravenwood manor, and then don't hear of him again until the end of the story. We are then introduced to John Breed, a mystery creature who is super strong and who has Lena constantly running off on Ethan in random, seemingly romantic gestures, although its \\"not what we think.\\" And finally Liv, the British keeper in training who forms a close friendship with Ethan after he's drawn to what he thinks is Lena's laughter in \\"the tunnels,\\" an anomaly that is never fully explained, and who subsequently throws it all away to help Ethan do barely anything himself. When the plot finally picks up halfway in, we follow Ethan in and out of poorly described tunnels and through twists in the plot that never completely make sense and become just plain irritating. Amma, the Wate family nanny for all intents and purposes, is somehow capable of frightening all of these deadly creatures, even though she possess no realpower of her own. Lena loses it on Ethan for spending time with Liv, only for it to never be pointed out to her that she has been sneaking around on him with John Breed.  Ridley has her powers taken away by Sarafine for disobeying her, but rather than doing the same to Lena for fear that she will be more powerful than her, she simply uses all her power to call the seventeenth moon \\"out of time,\\" an event I wont even try to explain, to force her to claim herself sooner. Macon died, but was trapped inside a glass ball which somehow managed to keep him from dying. And at the end of the story when Lena claims herself both light and dark, two characters die with absolutely no explanation as to why them and not anyone else.<br /> Having said all this I still was intrigued, and honestly confused enough to purchase the third book, mostly in an attempt to have it all make sense, but i think that readers should be warned what they're getting into. If you enjoyed the Beautiful Creatures novel and think you can get past all the confusion to enjoy the story, don't let my review stop you. But I don't think any author should ever get away with breaking the number one rule of writing, never leave anything unexplained. Having said all that I'm still giving the book a two star review for keeping me slightly intrigued through all of that.
0385340990|5.0|I liked this novel.  It is in letter format, and a fun read.  The story is sweet, funny, sad at times. I recommend this book.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Game is a good find it game,wish it was longer tho. The graphics are amazing and the game play is flawless, and fun for all ages.
0316172324|1.0|This should have been a short magazine article.  I am hard-pressed to write more about it.  I would not recommend it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|anytime I am feeling. down or lonely. or depressed. I just. reach for. my Bible and. read something soothing and calming.  its always at my fingertips.
0375842209|5.0|Another dark story, but very good.  Heartbreaking and sweet, with excellent characters.  Story takes place during WWII era. I recommend this novel.
B000002I6X|5.0|Is this album as good as his original solo debut Stephen Stills? No, but it is close. Change Partners, Singing Call, Sugar Babe, Know you've Got to Run & Marianne-all amazing songs and my favorite- Fishes & Scorpions. Word Games was also very good. The music stands the test of time. From anybody else, this album would be judged to be a masterpiece. From Stephen Stills at that time, a let down. Which was really not fair. If you are a fan of Stephen Stills, buy the album! You will not be disappointed.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Does exactly what I need.not fancy, but still a very attractive app that so far works flawlessly. I highly suggest it to anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game, which I have had from the time it came out, has progressed and perfected, if not matched, the main idea and fun found in the original PC version. There are very few key components missing, such as caves, mine carts, especially buckets, and Redstone. If these can be created, I don't think there could be much more to add other than the Nether and weather changes that would make it any more perfect. Truly a five star-worthy game, that's also well worth the price as it provides endless amounts of fun.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Nice to see all of the Avengers in an action packed movie.  Looks like Darkside will be in the future for them to battle.
B0074JODP8|5.0|I bought this because a friend of mine recommend it. And I could not be happier with Joe Bonamassa's performance. I will be buying more of his stuff.
B002APU580|5.0|This is a great movie. It is romantic, humorous, attention grabbing, and heart warming all at the same time! The actors are casted really well and play the parts realistically. The only charecter I didn't like was Elizabeth's mother. The soundtrack is exquisite and the photography is beautiful.  If Jane Austen's novel is as good as the movie then I want to read it!
B007T9UIMA|5.0|My granddaughter is a One Direction fan and bought this for her for Christmas. She watches it over and over and loves it.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|This was just what was looking for it fits my needs I needed kinda like calendar/journal type of thing but I like this just fine to keep track of my weekly activities
0765334798|3.0|The Basics:<br /><br />Andy Dahl and his fellow new crewmembers on the Intrepid, a craft very much like the Enterprise of Star Trek, begin to notice that something is very wrong with their ship and its crew. The fatality rate on away missions is astronomical, and free will and the laws of science tend to suspend themselves at dramatically appropriate moments. Once they can bring themselves to accept the fact that their lives are being controlled by the scripting of a low quality Sci-Fi TV show on which they're little more than extras, they have to find a way, within the low quality Sci-Fi rules, to stop it.<br /><br />The Downside:<br /><br />It's a one-joke book. If you want deep and character-driven, this isn't it. If you're not familiar with Star Trek, don't bother. The loosely drawn redshirts jump through whatever hoops the joke requires for the equivalent of about three quarters of a novel. The remaining pages of the book are devoted to the three \\"Codas,\\" supplemental shorts that read like writer's workshop exercises. Speaking as a writer, they're mildly interesting, particularly the one written from the perspective of one of the scriptwriters, but with the story already perfectly well wrapped up, reading them has the aimless, extraneous feel of chasing videogame bonus material once the storyline has been played through.<br /><br />The Upside:<br /><br />For those who do know Star Trek, it's a pretty good one joke. Whenever it gets tired, there's another laugh-out-loud twist on a standard trope, another inventive loophole noted in the rules of surviving an episode.
