Swept off her feet at a tender age by the handsome Irishman, Holly isn't exactly sure what she wants from life, and this leads to petty squabbles and extremely hot making up afterwards.<br /><br />Before they really get started, the Fates snip Gerry's thread, and Holly is left with a snazzy urn and an empty apartment, which she proceeds to fill with her blue funk.<br /><br />Her thirtieth birthday brings a big surprise, as it seems that for once, Gerry has made a plan.  Gerry's gift goes on giving, and gradually Holly comes to terms with her life, while we, the audience, get to look on with unbridled glee.<br /><br />Butler is as easy on the eyes as always, and Swank pulls off a difficult role with apparent ease.  Lisa Kudrow is a perfect friend, and Kathy Bates proves unsinkable.  Other good performances are logged by Gina Gershon and Harry Connick Jnr.<br /><br />Short Attention Span Summary (SASS):<br /><br />1.

B00133KDM8|5.0|In a similar fashion to her tenure with Nightwish, Tarja pulls off a cinematic and operatic plays against soundscapes of heavy guitars and new age orchestrial sounds.  This album is close to her Nightwish work, but definitely hers (except maybe the Alice Cooper cover).  You will hear some sounds like Enya, gothic Nightwish (closest to \\"Deep Silent Complete\\" and \\"Sleeping Sun\\"), Wagner and Mahler classical, traditional folk music, and progressive Dream Theater.
B000002GQK|5.0|Blew me away, this LP did, when I first heard it as an impressionable 20-year-old. I'd thought the Moodies' musical envelope couldn't be pushed any further, having already reveled my way through the other six of their seven masterpieces from 1967-1972 (My true admiration for the band ends there).Talk about a late-night, headphones-only kind of experience for mid-'70s post-partying college kids. When I read the lyrics on the LP's liner notes, I knew I was in for a treat.    The ride the band takes you on is unforgettable, alternately accelerating and slowing in and with each cut. The last four tracks (side 2 of the original record) are unparalleled, starting with John Lodge's magestic \\"One More Time to Live\\" and ending in Mike Pinder's \\"My Song,\\" its luscious instrumentals evoking the one-moment-soft, next-moment-erupting instrumentals in his earlier work \\"Have You Heard/The Voyage\\" from 1969's \\"On The Threshold of a Dream.\\"    Shame there are only five stars to ink in here.

0452289963|5.0|In 2006 of November, our brand new library opened for the first time. I sat by the acting branch manager - met her for the first time, and I whispered to her that I wanted to be the first person to check out a book from our brand new library. So the night before, she urged me to pick the book. I went down the aisle of books - and within seconds, the book A NEW EARTH was in my hand. I checked the book out, but I didn't read it. I was so busy to read another book. And there was the beauty in right timing! I had no idea what the book was about - but I've read THE POWER OF NOW and has listened to Eckhart Tolle's CDs THE REALIZATION OF BEING, and EVEN THE SUN WILL DIE (911 interview). Until a few weeks ago, an old friend gave me the audio CDs of A NEW EARTH. I've been listening to it ever since. It has given me a break from thoughts and stories in my mind that ran constantly. I've felt so peaceful that I have more energy to be with people, and more energy to create. I think this may be the instrument that humanity has been waiting for - many spiritual leaders have attempted to speak of it - and now, it's speaking out with greatest clarity. If this is the truth, it shall set many people free. I came from a religious background. I was born in a Catholic family, and I became a born-again christian in the early 80's. I traveled with the Continental Ministries and sang about God all over the world and the USA. I was involved with Campus Crusade for Christ for all 5 years in college and went on short-term missions with Campus Crusade for Christ in South Lake Tahoe and the Philippines. I showed the Jesus Film on the nomadic tribe of Samburu in Northern Kenya. Ive studied the Bible intensely with groups for several years. And now, I feel that the message in this book allows the reader to experience compassion and kindness towards self - and then allowing the self to flower naturally, as it is intended to be. \\"You will know the truth, and the truth shall set you free!\\" Enjoy, andBe!

B0013FSL3E|4.0|When you have a track record like Pixar, each new film becomes compared to the best you have already done. If a new film doesn't attain these same levels, these same impossibly high levels, the same levels no one else can attain with such consistency, a film that would otherwise be good, is just OK. \\"Wall-E\\" is such a film. I didn't love \\"Wall-E\\", it doesn't achieve the greatness of \\"Finding Nemo\\", \\"The Incredibles\\" or \\"Ratatouille\\", but it is good. \\"Cars\\" good.<br /><br />In the future, the Buy N Large Corporation runs the Earth and it becomes so polluted they evacuate all humans, sending them to space on super deluxe spaceships, much like a cruise ship, for what they promise will be a five year trip. They are leaving behind a number of Wall-E robots, robots designed to collect and compact all of the trash humans have left behind, clearing the Earth of all garbage and allowing plant life to return. Seven hundred years later, there is one Wall-E left. He has developed a little routine and starts each morning listening to an old VHS tape of \\"Hello Dolly!\\" After rallying his pet cockroach, he heads out to work. If he needs a replacement part, he collects it from one of the many defunct Wall-E's and also collects a small ice cooler of odd objects that are of interest to him. One day, a spaceship touches down and releases a new modern probe called EVE. The shiny white robot begins to scour the area, looking for something. Wall-E watches from afar, entranced by the new robot. Suddenly, he understands what all of the singing and dancing in his favorite tape was about. Eventually, Wall-E and EVE meet and begin a relationship. But when EVE finds what she is looking for, Wall-E works desperately to follow her back to the mother ship and to keep their relationship going.<br /><br />Directed by Andrew Stanton, who directed \\"Finding Nemo\\" and worked on the \\"Toy Story\\" films and \\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Wall-E\\" is very similar in tone and feel to \\"Finding Nemo\\".<br /><br />The first half of the film sets up Wall-E's environment, showing us what his responsibilities are, what he does for fun, his friend (the cockroach) and his life. He enjoys watching an old VHS tape of \\"Hello Dolly!\\" because of the singing and dancing, but doesn't quite understand why he enjoys watching it. Every day, he sets out to work, taking his old ice cooler with him. When he finds a strange, or likable object, he throws it into the cooler and takes it back to his home, to store or use as decoration. As a robot, he happily goes about his daily routine, keeping an eye out for the frequent dust storms that seem to pop up and sweep across the landscape.<br /><br />As Wall-E sets out to do his work every morning, he passes the skyscrapers that are still standing, but very much vacant. As he collects the garbage and compacts it into little blocks, he builds his own skyscrapers, much like they must have built the pyramids.<br /><br />Then one day, he finds a strange object. A little plant, which he transplants to an old shoe. He takes it back to his living quarters.<br /><br />Then a spaceship shows up and EVE is left behind to scan the area. Initially, Wall-E watches her from afar because he is unsure of what or who she is. And it doesn't help that she has a mean laser gun, ready to fire at the slightest sound. So he follows her around, ducking behind garbage and other objects to watch her as she becomes more and more discouraged that she hasn't found what she is supposed to find.<br /><br />Eventually, they meet and Wall-E realizes why he has liked the singing and dancing in \\"Hello Dolly!\\" so much. He has fallen in love. And EVE is smitten too.<br /><br />This part of the film is almost completely without words, except for the occasional talking billboard or burst of music from the VHS tape, Wall-E and EVE are robots. They don't speak, but they do manage to make sounds that are like each other's names, communicating in this way. This, combined with the very different style ofanimation, may be a surprise to many. The children in the audience will probably universally accept it, but it isn't the same brightly colored animation we are used to. Many of the images are almost photorealistic, and everything has a hard edge, looks dusty (the Earth was abandoned due to pollution after all) and it looks a bit like an old spaghetti Western.<br /><br />But it is very sweet. Watching Wall-E go about his daily routine is akin to watching Chaplin or Keaton in one of their silent films. He has a definite routine, developed after so many years alone on the planet, that it is fun to discover what he does. We meet his pet cockroach. We see what he does for work. We see how he has adapted to the harsh living conditions. We even see where he lives. Then, when EVE enters the picture, his eyes get a little wide and we instantly understand. He is in love.<br /><br />As he follows EVE around, he watches what she is doing, scanning particular objects, looking for something. Initially, he stays hidden because he doesn't know how to react, but when they meet, their romance blooms.<br /><br />Then, when EVE finds a sample of what she is looking for, he body goes into autopilot and she summons the ship to return for her. Wall-E doesn't know what is going on, but when he sees the ship return, he knows he has to tag along or he might lose her forever.<br /><br />As Wall-E rides through outer space, it almost looks like the filmmakers took real footage of outer space and used this for their backgrounds. This sequence is truly beautiful and almost worth the price of admission alone.<br /><br />The ship returns to the mother ship and we meet the humans who escaped Earth over 700 hundred years ago. We see how they have adapted to life in outer space, how they have changed, and living with robots that cater to their every whim. They meet the Captain of the ship, who realizes what he has to do and this sets off a series of adventures between Wall-E, EVE, the humans and the other robots on board.<br /><br />The second half of the film is very different in tone and feel from the first half and it is a shift that almost derails the entire film. The filmmakers have been very inventive in creating this world, showing us how humans would evolve and adapt to a very lazy life on a cruise ship, their every whim provided for by highly automated robots. And they have created a whole series of robots, designed for every purpose.<br /><br />When the humans first appear, the animation shifts and we start to see more traditionally animated characters. They also are a little more amusing, maybe because they aren't that far removed from our current reality, and they speak. So there are a lot of very different things going on in this new part of the film.<br /><br />And Wall-E and EVE have to work to make things right, to finish EVE's mission. As they do this, they become closer and EVE realizes the true extent of Wall-E's feelings towards her.<br /><br />\\"Wall-E\\" is a very good animated film, but it is only a good Pixar film. The two halves of the film work well, but because they are so different, they almost fail to come together and this requires the viewer to shift along with the tone and feel of the film. The first half, involving Wall-E and his courtship of EVE is almost a little magical and unlike anything we have ever seen in a film. The second half is busier, louder, more inventive and more action packed. It is interesting, but not nearly as magical and it is difficult to see the two halves as a whole.

B0013FXWX8|4.0|Po (voiced by Jack Black) is a Panda who works at his father's noodle stall. Po has dreams of greatness and looks at the Furious Five, a group of five kung-fu masters, Tigress (Angelina Jolie), Mantis (Seth Rogen), Crane (David Cross), Viper (Lucy Liu) and Monkey (Jackie Chan), all of whom are under the tutelage of Shifu (Dustin Hoffman). Shifu learns Tai Lung (Ian McShane, TV's \\"Deadwood\\"), a fearsome tiger and onetime prot&eacute;g&eacute;, has broken out of the maximum-security prison designed to hold him. Tai Lung wants the Scroll of Destiny. It is up to Shifu's master Oogway to determine which of his Fearsome Five will fight Tai Lung. Eager to see the demonstration, Po garners the attention of Oogway (Randall Duk Kim) and he determines Po will receive the scroll of destiny and fight Tai Lung. Shifu groans because he has a lot of training to do.<br /><br />\\"Kung Fu Panda\\", the newest animated offering from Dreamworks Animation, the folks behind \\"Shrek\\", \\"Over the Hedge\\" and others, is perhaps their most beautiful film yet. The backgrounds are universally beautiful and very pleasing to watch. The attention to detail is striking and a lot of research and work clearly went into depicting this environment, a mountaintop village high above the clouds in China. You really get the feeling you are watching events unfold in rural China, many years ago.<br /><br />Po, a large Panda, lives with his father, a duck, above their noodle shop, and the attention to detail continues here as well. When Po wakes up, he bangs his head against the ceiling, knocking some pots and pans around. The noodle shop is small and outdoors and this is clearly a rural village. All of this detail is used to great advantage and shows the lengths the filmmakers are willing to go to make a believable, beautiful film.<br /><br />While the story is also involving and well plotted, it contains few laughs. And this is surprising given the inclusion of Jack Black. I was honestly expecting this film to be funnier, but it is a surprisingly dramatic look at one panda's journey to become an adult. It almost seems like the filmmakers were attempting to make a powerful coming of age story. They have succeeded well in this regard. We feel the need for Po to become a part of the Furious Five. We feel his idol worship and his desire to have some excitement in his life. This leads him to desperately seek a spot to watch the competition between the Furious Five. Then, when he becomes the chosen one, he is naturally reluctant; he doesn't see how he could possibly equal anything close to what his idols already have achieved, what they already are, but he recognizes the call to duty he has received and puts a game foot forward.<br /><br />As Po trains, he spars with Shifu, voiced by Dustin Hoffman. Both are good, they just aren't that funny. I think the key problem is everyone is taking the film very seriously. This would be great if \\"Panda\\" were an animated drama, but it is clearly meant to be funny. There are a few humorous moments and an ongoing joke about Po's need for food, but too much of the film is very serious.<br /><br />When I told my dad Dustin Hoffman does one of the voices in this film, he asked why an actor of such high esteem would even do such work? Hoffman has, in recent years, taken on a much more diverse range of roles. An actor who used to be known as an Academy Award magnet now regularly takes wacky, supporting roles in films like \\"Mr. Magorium's Wonder Emporium\\" and animated work. I think a large part of this is because Hoffman is seeking to become more accessible to more people, he wants his work to be seen by more people accounting for the larger variety of roles. Hoffman has always been known for sinking into a role, becoming the character so completely his performance becomes memorable. While the success of his performance in \\"Mr. Magorium\\" might be debatable, he uses his voice to great effect in \\"Kung Fu Panda\\". He has a quiet exasperation to his voice when he learns who his new disciple will be. Quiet, because he can't possibly question his master who knows all and his decisions are always right. Exasperated, because he realizes what he has to work with and knows it is all but hopeless. But he presses forward.<br /><br />Ian McShane is the other standout in the cast. As Tai Lung, a fearsome tiger who is currently imprisoned in a special facility, to keep him away from the rest of the community, he is especially villainous. This is the first DreamWorks villain who can hold a candle to some of the great Disney animated villains, like Captain Hook, the Wicked Queen or Jafar. But again, he plays it mostly straight. Shifu is so afraid he might escape this special prison; he sends one of his emissaries to inform the head guard, an armor plated rhino (Michael Clarke Duncan, \\"The Green Mile\\") to increase the guard. When the emissary arrives, the guard laughs and explains the safeguards in place to hold Tai Lung. This gives us a glimpse of this special prison and all of the booby traps and safeguards designed to hold this prisoner. Of course, Tai Lung escapes, leading to one of the most elaborately animated, exciting sequences I have ever seen in an animated film.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is good, but not great and this is one of the factors keeping this film from attaining the greatness it so desperately wants to achieve. Jackie Chan does a good job as Monkey, but his voice is so recognizable, he simply is the character. The same can be said of Lucy Liu, who plays Viper. Each is simply their character, doing a good job of performing the role without bringing anything to it. To be honest, I had to wait until the credits to find out Angelina Jolie plays Tigress. Her performance is extremely low key and unmemorable. In recent years, a lot of animated films have been marketed based on the A-List stars providing voices, included simply for their name value. Many, in turn, simply read their lines, adding little to the characters because they are unable to add to a character using simply their voice. Because of this, many films have suffered. \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" has examples of this, but Black, Hoffman and McShane save it.<br /><br /> I recently read that each of the members of the Furious Five practice a different kind of Kung Fu, disciplines that are actually named for the animals they are. This is not something we would probably pick up with the naked eye, while watching the film, but this also points to the level of detail the filmmakers went to to help create this world. It is a beautiful world to travel to. I just wish those travels involved more laughs., because he can't possibly question his master who knows all and his decisions are always right.

B0011N1WE8|4.0|'Penelope' is a charming, if odd, tale. It tells of the cute heiress Penelope (Christina Ricci) who possesses a pig's ears and snout. She was doomed generations before her birth by a curse to ancestor. The spell, to be cast on the first female descendent, can only be broken by \\"love from one of her kind\\" (or something like that). Hence, her mother (Catherine O'Hara) sets about to have her meet thoroughly shallow blue-blood suitors and keep Penelope in doors. But difficulties ensue. What if Penelope's secret gets out? Is Penelope's damaged self-esteem reparable? Is her curse breakable?    Characters are well sketched and entertaining. Penelope herself is a genuinely lovely and sweet soul, and her most appealing suitor Max (James McAvoy) is thoroughly likeable and attractive. Though I am not a fan of most movie romances, I was rooting for them to overcome the odds and get together. Penelope's mother is simultaneously sympathetic, monstrously enfuriating, and hilarious. Simon Woods is also funny as a repulsively repulsed suitor, and Peter Dinklage is subtle but amusing as a reporter determined to photograph Penelope. Reese Witherspoon is great in a small role.    'Penelope' is a strange mixture of genres, but its unpredictability meshes with its fanciful plot. Even the gorgeous setting, peppered with colorful costumes and a variety of accents is indeterminate. The good nature, humor, and sweet simplicity of the story and its message are truly winning.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My wife and I watched this sweeping epic about the founding of my country this weekend. We found it to be fascinating, both well written and well acted. Portrayed in this mini-series is a grittier and dirtier America at its birth, less flowery, but in the end more inspirational because of it.<br /><br />This story tells about a great man and the great woman who allows him to be great. It tells about how different men have different gifts, and how different men with different gifts were able to accomplish what was so improbable, that impossible seamed a more apt description.<br /><br />What I found most remarkable and memorable about this saga, is the incredible sacrifice of service great men were asked to offer, and that they accepted and fulfilled the request. Duty, Duty, Duty. That great men are pulled from their preferred occupation to serve in government reluctantly, out of duty because no one else willing (or is capable to) do the job needed.<br /><br />Where are those great men today?<br /><br />If you are in the mood for an inspirational if lengthy bio-pic, John Addams is a good way to spend 5 Hours!

0694003611|5.0|I got this book from friends several years back and thought then that it was cute, but now that I have a one year old son I think it is GREAT! My son absolutely adores this book and we have to read it to him every evening before he goes to bed. He also carries it around with him during the day (first thing he picks off the shelf in his room), and it seems to give him a great sense of comfort.  Personally, I love the way the book is set up with the repetition of the same motifs and the gradual darkening of the room. So clever! The repetitiveness also is great for fostering cognitive development. My son now recognizes a few items in the book and points them out as I read it to him.  I can't wait for the moment when we can together say goodnight to all the different objects in his room at the end of the day. What a great way to end a child's day and help him get comfortable in his room and ready for the night.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|Having heard quite a bit about Duffy's rockin album Rockferry, I finally snagged a copy for myself and gave it a listen. The girl can definitely sing, the tunes are catchy, and her brand of soul feels a lot less manufactured than say, someone like Amy Winehouse.     Duffy's sound is a mix of 70's soul, motown, funk, and disco, with 50's/60's doo wop and pop, and a splash of modern brit pop rock style. Don't expect the same level of brash lyrics as found in Duffy's contemporaries like Winehouse or Lily Allen - her words are mostly sweet and from the (broken) heart.    Despite the popularity of Duffy's first soul-packed single \\"Mercy\\" (which ironically is the \\"yeah, yeah, yeah\\" to Winehouse's \\"no, no, no\\" from 'Rehab') don't expect the rest of the album to sound the same. \\"Mercy\\" is by far the most upbeat, danceable, bankable single - but the rest of the album is excellent as well! In fact the first three tunes are my favourite, in particularly the soaring \\"Warwick Avenue\\". Tunes 4-6 are a bit on the forgettable side, while \\"Delayed Devotion\\" is the most similar to \\"Mercy\\" in its super 70's take. The final two songs are alright, but again, nothing uber memorable.    Overall Duffy's album is a glimpse into what promises to be a big new talent on the scene - it's a bit on the short side and only 5 of the tunes are truly stellar (1-3, 7&8), but it's an enjoyable listen to have on repeat.
B0013N4AT0|5.0|I've been listening to these guys on and off for about 8 months now, and they never did anything for me.  I first got Ghost Reveries, but it put me to sleep, and I've probably listened to it a couple more times afterwards.  I bought Watershed when it came out, liked it, but never really thought of it as genious.  I picked up this remaster of Still Life mainly for the DTS mix.  I finally listened to it this morning, and I'm completely blown away.  This music is made to be in surround sound.  The actual album is killer, and is way better than their recent releases, in my opinion.  Hopefully there will be more 5.1 releases in the future.
0307120007|2.0|This book is not as great/classic as it is proclaimed to be.  I look at Alborough and Boynton books before I look at this one.  The art is horrible, its too european (mummy), and too blonde haired and blue eyed.  My daughter likes it, but not as much as her other rhyming books.
B000WGWQG8|1.0|I have watched the series first DVD so far and I am sick of the movie studios and HBO policy, which seems to think it is alright to force the buyer to watch ads for the first five minutes of each disk. They do not allow you to skip these ads and they waste my time and annoy me. So far, I have not gotten to the later disks for this reason. Buy the book. It is excellent.
B0018S6YOE|4.0|First off, I'll admit that I am not a fan of \\"Umbrella,\\" Rhianna's monster hit; thus, I'm glad that it is the first track on the CD and can be readily skipped.<br /><br />Now that I can get that one out of my system, as well as my ears, I can proceed to consider the rest of the album.  I must admit that I was actually impressed by the songs and Rhianna's delivery.<br /><br />Even though the young singer's vocals aren't the best, the song selections fit her range and experience.  The album, as a whole is typical pop and has songs that should appeal both kids and the parents.<br /><br />Actually, \\"Don't Stop the Music,\\" with its heavy sampling of Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Something\\" is tight enough to appeal to us older listeners.<br /><br />Like other reviewers, I find \\"Breakin' Dishes,\\" with its killer rhythm and straight-to-the jugular lyrics, to be the best track on the entire release.<br /><br />I don't know if the singer had the intention but \\"Take a Bow\\" is very similar in content to Madonna's hit from a decade ago.<br /><br />Other good cuts are the title track, \\"Disturbia,\\" \\"Hate That I Love You,\\" \\"Rehab,\\" and the collaboration with Maroon 5 on the group's \\"If I Never See Your Face Again.\\"<br /><br />The bonus DVD included shows why the singer has visual appeal, possibly the greater measure of her success.
B00140PK6O|4.0|This production of Cranford is very good, although it is a little slow going for a while.  Once it gets into the second DVD the action picks up a bit, and the ending is very satisfactory.  My wife and I enjoyed it and I would recommend it to anyone who is patient and loves period productions.  One note:  The acting is superb.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|...because they get in your head and get in your soul! I know that sounds cheesy, but it's true.     Except for the first album (which I instantly loved), this is how I usually listen to a Coldplay album:    1. Listen to it and like some tracks, dislike some and am indifferent to others.  2. Later in the day find myself humming one of the songs I \\"thought\\" I didn't like. Become puzzled.  3. Listen to album again and LOVE every track!    I don't know of any artist that has this effect on me. Sometimes I need a second listen of an album, but I've never had such a consistent \\"180\\" on songs I initially didn't like.   And, I don't see that as a knock on Coldplay, I just think that because their music isn't too poppy and catchy (a GOOD thing), their stuff needs to settle in before it can be truly appreciated. And trust me when I say that I have very eclectic tastes and Coldplay is far from the most abstract stuff I listen too. I just think they have a good mix between mainstream and thought provoking.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I honestly never write reviews but this was one of the best books I have read in a long time. The original idea of using the dog in the first person gave this book an interesting twist that could not happen from the \\"human\\" perspective. The book was entertaining, with some rough patches for the characters along the way. However, the ending gave hope that with faith and determination, all things are possible. This book hasn't gotten much press and seems to be a summer sleeper. At any rate, a book worth the time to read.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I am happy with the overall experience. I ordered this and received it within five business days. I especially enjoyed the apparent care and attention given to historical accuracy. Great mini-series!
0525950079|4.0|I liked the book.  And I'd give it a full five stars and gush more about it if it didn't seem almost as if a template was lifted from \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and dropped over Kingsbridge two hundred years later.  Still, I enjoyed it enough to read it in just a few days.<br /><br />My chief complaint--as others have noted--is that he sometimes uses modern day slang when accepted English would have done just as well and been much less jarring.  It stunned me that such an experienced writer would do this.  Stunned me even more that it would get past a good editor.<br /><br />My other criticism is that he wrapped things up very abruptly.  Almost as if mom had shouted into his room, \\"Ken, dinner in fifteen minutes--you need to finish what you're doing.\\"<br /><br />If nothing else, I enjoyed it more than I would have enjoyed picking up \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" and reading it a fourth time.<br /><br />All criticisms aside, it's a good book and I'm glad I read it.
B000RZIGZ4|5.0|If you own an hd dvd player this is a must have for your collection. Great movie! Great Price! If you have a surround system with a DTS mode, select Dolby 6.1 DTS and be prepared to be blown away.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Sultry. Easy to overuse term until you hit this jazz, lounge, retro stylistically perfect CD. god, what a voice and a sound. The simple, straight-n-chaser jazzclub sound. Unrelentant, unrepentant clarity that cuts into the soul like Tom Waits giving up his once-grand ability to reach in and hold your heart in his hand. classic blue jazz imagery that frankly, is magnificent.<br /><br />I heard one track and had to have it.<br /><br />Just about the coolest CD you can buy right now. Ms Gardot, you've blown me away.
1427202834|5.0|The Audio CD is wonderful! The narrator does an excellent job of making the incredibly fast-paced story come alive. If the rest of Jeffrey Archer's books are like this, I've got my summer reading lined up. Very clever!
B0013J30XG|5.0|Have critics become nothing more than corparate shills like the rest of main stream media? Are they dissing this because it doesn't try to sell toys or cars, but delivers a message about fighting for what is right? A very unique movie, unlike anything you have seen. Of course it is based on the original cartoon, so that's what you get - good and bad, but the visuals, and what they did with that scenario, are amazing.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is an oilman, pure and simple. He searches for it, buys, cheats, or steals the land where he finds it, and then he drills for it. He has little patience for human realations, but sees everything as a magnificent struggle, with the land, with the oil, with the workers he must hire to drill for it. You wouldn't like this man, but you'd respect, or at the very least, fear him. He is like a force of nature, and only pretends to have normal human feelings in order to negotiate a better deal when he is buying, cheating, or stealing land on which to drill for oil. Daniel Day-Lewis has really thrown himself into the role, and he aims to play the role to the hilt, without caring at all about the audience liking his character. In fact, the less you like him, the better he is doing his job. But it can be lonely, and when he thinks he has found a long lost brother, Henry Brand (Kevin J. O'Connor), he confesses his feelings:<br /><br />Daniel Plainview: I see the worst in people. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. I've built my hatreds up over the years, little by little, Henry... to have you here gives me a second breath. I can't keep doing this on my own with these... people.<br />[laughs]<br /><br />He adopts a son, if only to have a friendly face to distract the people when he comes to buy, cheat, or steal their land. When the boy becomes ill, he sends him away. A preacher from the Church of the Third Revelation, Eli Sunday (Paul Dano .... Dwayne in Little Miss Sunshine) is trying to manipulate him into giving money to his church. Eli sunday tries to make him feel guilty in order to exploit him.<br /><br />Eli Sunday: So say it now- I am a sinner.<br />Plainview: I am a sinner.<br />Eli Sunday: Say it louder- I am a sinner!<br />Plainview: I am a sinner.<br />Eli Sunday: Louder, Daniel. I am a sinner!<br />Plainview: I am a sinner.<br />Eli Sunday: I am sorry Lord!<br />Plainview: I am sorry Lord.<br />Eli Sunday: I want the blood!<br />Plainview: I want the blood.<br />Eli Sunday: You have abandoned your child!<br />Plainview: I have abandoned my child.<br />Eli Sunday: I will never backslide!<br />Plainview: I will never backslide.<br />Eli Sunday: I was lost, but now I am found!<br />Plainview: I was lost but now I'm found.<br />Eli Sunday: I have abandoned my child!<br />[Plainview glares at him]<br />Eli Sunday: Say it... say it!<br />[Plainview mumbles]<br />Eli Sunday: Say it louder... say it louder!<br />Plainview: I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my child! I've abandoned my boy!<br /><br />The Sunday farm is only fit for growing weeds, and raising goats. The soil is alkaline, and the water is salty but there is oil. The only problem for Eli is that his brother Paul Sunday (also played by Paul Dano in a dual role) has already sold the land to Plainview.<br /><br />Eli Sunday: Daniel, I'm asking if you'd like to have business with the Church of the Third Revelation in developing this lease on young Bandy's thousand acre tract. I'm offering you to drill on one of the great undeveloped fields of Little Boston!<br />Plainview: I'd be happy to work with you.<br />Eli Sunday: You would? Yes, yes, of course. Wonderful.<br />Plainview: But there is one condition for this work.<br />Eli Sunday: All right.<br />Plainview: I'd like you to tell me that you are a false prophet... I'd like you to tell me that you are, and have been, a false prophet... and that God is a superstition.<br />Eli Sunday: ...but that's a lie... it's a lie, I cannot say it.<br />[long pause]<br />Eli Sunday: When can we begin to drill?<br />Plainview: Right away.<br />Eli Sunday: How long will it take to bring in the well?<br />Plainview: Should be very quick.<br />Eli Sunday: I would like a one hundred thousand dollar signing bonus plus the five that is owed with interest.<br />Plainview: That's only fair.<br />Eli Sunday: I am a false prophet and God is a superstition. If that's what you believe, then I will say it.<br />Plainview: Say it like you mean it.<br />Eli Sunday: Daniel...<br />Plainview: Say it like it's your sermon.<br />Eli Sunday: This is foolish.<br />[long pause]<br />Eli Sunday: I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition!<br />[pause]<br />Eli Sunday: Is that fine?<br />Plainview: Those areas have been drilled.<br />Eli Sunday: What?<br />Plainview: Those areas have been drilled.<br />Eli Sunday: ...no they haven't...<br />Plainview: It's called drainage. I own everything around it... so I get everything underneath it.<br />Eli Sunday: But there are no derricks there. This is the Bandy tract. Do you understand?<br />Plainview: Do you? I drink your water, Eli. I drink it up. Everyday. I drink the blood of lamb from Bandy's tract.<br /><br />[How can this be? Plainview is really taking delight in turning the tables on the 'false prophet.']<br /><br />Plainview: Drainage! Drainage, Eli, you boy. Drained dry. I'm so sorry. Here, if you have a milkshake, and I have a milkshake, and I have a straw. There it is, that's a straw, you see? You watching?. And my straw reaches acroooooooss the room, and starts to drink your milkshake... I... drink... your... milkshake!<br />[sucking sound]<br />Plainview: I drink it up!<br /><br />There Will Be Blood is a tour de force performance from Daniel Day-Lewis. You might not like the character he is playing, but you have to admit that he is totally commited to that character, and matches Plainview's intensity, pound for pound, every second he is onscreen.<br /><br />The cinematography and settings are magnificent. The composer of the film's music was Jonny Greenwood, primarily famous as the guitarist for the British rock band Radiohead. There is some Brahms and music from other composers, but the bulk of the music was by Greenwood, and it really adds to the epic granduer. This is an epic of man against nature. There are long stretches where there is no dialogue at all, just man battling against nature, struggling and striving to pump that oil out of the ground. Living in Bakersfield, an oil town, I see oil derricks all around me. Some of the action takes place right here, for instance, scenes were shot in Santa Clarita, and they talk of a pipeline through the Tehachapi Mountains. That is right down Kern Canyon. We have a Kern County Oil Museum, and other historic sights in Taft. All that history is right around us, and it made me curious about how they got all the oil pumping.

B000ZN802W|4.0|A compelling story! I've wondered time to time about the \\"why\\" behind these characters we've all run across in life. I thought the director did a great job in asking us all to really question the way we've chosen to live and have compassion for those that choose differently. The movie did drag a little in parts and I did wonder how much of it really was true, but overall, worth watching.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Wonderful acting! Every American should see this miniseries, and rememeber what our forefathers did for our country! Loved it! 5 Stars * * * * *
0316067598|3.0|Let's face it -- reviewing true stories of military heroism is tough; you really have to remember to separate the story from the writing.  We are all awed by the first part, because each story of heroism stands on its own and is what makes this Country great.  As for the second part, however, I will say this once again: there are great warriors and there are great writers, but great warrior-writers are few and far between.  \\"Lone Survivor\\" proves to be no exception to this rule.      \\"Lone Survivor\\" is the story of Marcus Luttrell, a U.S. Navy SEAL (or Special Forces sailor).  While on a mission in Afghanistan in June of 2005, Luttrell and three other SEALs comprising the combat team to which Luttrell was assigned come under murderous fire, killing the other three SEALs and launching Luttrell on a journey of survival that is harrowing, gripping, amazing and just about any other adjective you care to throw in there.  I'm not going to spend time telling you about what happens because so many other reviewers have already done that.  Suffice to say that the fact that this guy is even around to tell his story is no small miracle.  Luttrell's survival is a testament to his training, his skill and his dedication to the mission.    If the whole book was just about the mission, I would give it five stars.  Unfortunately, the mission part is tied to a \\"how did I get here\\" part, which is mostly a complete recap of Luttrell's training to become a SEAL.  This dramatic mechanism -- introducing us to the main character through a formative event -- is old, especially in the military genre.  Watch \\"Full Metal Jacket\\" if you want to know what I'm talking about and want to see it done well.      If you're not committed to doing it, however, it wears on a reader.  The training Luttrell underwent was amazing, but there is not any reflection or enough reflection on how it changed or affected Luttrell to make it a worthwhile part of this book.  Basically all we learned is that he wanted to be a SEAL his whole life and he passed the training and guess what -- he became a SEAL.  There is no discernable change on Luttrell's outlook on life, himself or what he is about to do.  Instead, you get the sense that it's just filler to make this book long enough to be worth the money.    Essentially, you could tear this book in half and you would still have just as good a book, if not better.  I don't blame Luttrell for this; he's a Navy SEAL, not an author.  And I can't tell you how happy we all should be that we have men and women like him who are selflessly dedicated to preserving our rights to do things like, oh, review books online without having to worry about someone from the government showing up at my door with a bullet for my head.  But I think Patrick Robinson, the \\"Contributing Author\\" of this book, sort of dropped the ball on this one.    Bottom line -- get this book for the second half alone; you won't be sorry!
B00005JPD0|1.0|I'd sum up the experience of seeing this mediocre film as: predictable, you have seen it all before, and it's a thin story idea.

(A friend lent this to me, so I'm glad I didn't buy it.)

1400032717|2.0|\\"The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" by author Mark Haddon, is the story of Christopher John Francis Boone, a fifteen-year-old boy who discovers his neighbor's dog dead and sets about to solve the mystery of who killed it, making many other discoveries along the way. In this book, readers are treated to a unique voice, not only in literature, but in life, as Christopher is developmentally disabled. He doesn't like other people and he doesn't like being touched; as a result, when confused or angry, he often screams, groans, or physically attacks others. In giving Christopher a voice, Haddon succeeds in making us identify with his protagonist for his similiarities, but not for his differences, and ultimately fails to recognize what makes Christopher special.     By allowing Christopher to tell his own story, Haddon shows us that Christopher isn't really all that different from the rest of us, despite his disability.  While outsiders deride Christopher as \\"special needs\\" and an \\"elf,\\" because we are allowed inside Christopher's mind, we can see that he is not a freak. In describing one of his episodes where he loses control, Christopher says, \\"I felt giddy. It was like the room was swinging from side to side, as if it was at the top of a really tall building and the building was swinging backward and forward in a strong wind . . . I rolled onto the bed and curled up in a ball.\\" Hearing about Christopher's outbursts in his own voice, we feel compassion for his experience instead of fear. While obviously he is different from us - he can multiply 251 by 864 in his head, he counts prime numbers when he is upset, and he lacks imagination - he is also similar. Like us, Christopher feels happiness and sadness. He is happy when he can pretend he is the only person in the whole world and sad when he finds the dead dog. Also, Christopher, like the rest of us, has dreams: he is going to pass his A-levels, take more A-levels, go to the university, and become an astronaut. In fact, by the end of the book, after he has passed his A-levels, made plans to take further A-levels, and finished his book about who has killed his neighbor's dog, he knows he \\"can do anything.\\"  Like the rest of us, Christopher has dreams, and his determination to make his dreams comes true makes him a character that we cannot only identify with but also root for.     Unfortunately, though, in highlighting Christopher's similarities, Haddon never recognizes Christopher for his differences.  When he acts out, his mom and dad both hit him, and when he is mocked by his father's friend, his father - his primary caregiver, the one who cooks his meals, cleans his clothes, and looks after him - doesn't even defend his own son:  \\"I don't like it when Rhodri laughs at me. Rhodri laughs at me a lot. Father says it is being friendly.\\" In fact, at one point, his own father mocks him, asking him, \\"How stupid are you?\\" Even worse, though, is the treatment of other students at Christopher's school.  While we are supposed to object when Christopher is mocked as \\"special needs\\" and a freak, Christopher treats his own schoolmates with similar contempt, particularly Joseph Fleming, who \\"eats everything,\\" including \\"one of the little blocks of blue disinfectant which hang inside the toilets,\\" \\"a 50 pound note from his mother's wallet,\\" \\"string and rubber bands and tissues and writing paper and paints and plastic forks,\\" and also \\"bangs his chin and screams a lot.\\" Just as Christopher is shunned when he is at the train station, Christopher himself shuns Joseph.  Christopher sets himself as different not only from this boy but his entire school, as he says, \\"All the other children at my school are stupid.\\" He is not like them, he is not stupid, because he is going to pass his A-levels, which in fact he succeeds at doing.  Christopher becomes acceptable, then, because he is not a Joseph Fleming; he is more like \\"one of us,\\" so we can find him tolerable.  He can communicate with us and he is not stupid. We admire him in spite of his differences, not because of them, and in the process we fail to recognize Christopher for what makes him truly special.    In giving Christopher a voice, Haddon succeeds in making us identify with his protagonist for his similiarities, but not for his differences, and ultimately fails to recognize what makes Christopher special. Because we are able to get inside Christopher's head, he does not seem so different from us; he is someone who can, to some extent, communicate with us, and someone we can learn from. But what about other mentally disabled people whose voices we don't have access to, like Joseph Fleming's?  Is it ok for us to shun them? In the classic book, \\"Flowers for Algernon,\\" we come to like the disabled protagonist, Charley Gordon, not because he is similar to us, but because he is different. His differences are what make him special, and when he loses these differences, his character becomes almost unlikeable. In the \\"Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,\\" however, we come to identify with Christopher because we can see that he shares some of our qualities - he is good at math, or he likes dogs, or his parents are having problems - and we choose to ignore his differences.  In truth, though, we probably shouldn't like Christopher for how he is one of us, but for his differences. In the end, a book like \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" makes a stronger point: we should not, as \\"Curious Incident\\" suggests, find the developmentally disabled tolerable because somewhere, somehow, they are like us, but instead we should recognize them for their differences, because that is what makes them special.
0143038419|1.0|This book has gotten a lot of hype and prominent bookstore placement...based not on good writing but likely a great publicist. Here's a narrator you can't even trust, let alone tolerate. Her skimpiness on the details for her ruined marriage gives readers the impression that the truth is being hidden from them in order to shape their impressions of her. Most likely this is the case because she fears readers might think for themselves instead of just listening to her side of things. Strike 1.     She's also an unreliable narrator because her circumstances are so uncommon to what most people experience in a divorce. It's rare for anybody to be able to flit off around the world with a wad of money when they feel that life has become too difficult. No, most of us experience tragedy (tragedy we have not caused, unlike Gilbert), and we have to muddle through. She doesn't acknowledge this or approach her writing with any recognition that yes, there are worse things in life than the problems she creates for herself. Strike 2.    I couldn't even finish this book, though I really tried. I can't immerse myself in a book where the narrator is so jarringly set on focusing you on herself. And the view is not great, it's irritating. The impression I get of her is that she is overwhelmingly, unshakably amused by herself. She's like a spoiled child who has been doted on and therefore expects others to automatically love her and agree with her skewed self-pity. \\"Don't you HATE that I had to give up my Manhattan apartment and my nice big house in the suburbs??\\" Strike 3.    Her \\"insights\\" about God and spirituality are shallow and depend on things that make her feel warm and fuzzy.  I read The Diving Bell and The Butterfly while trying to read Eat Pray Love...the books are like night and day. Someone with no real problems going all to pieces, and someone who has lost everything and remains optimistic. I think I'll learn my lessons from Diving Bell!
B00006JKOL|4.0|This is a nice release from 1975 that essentially established the proggy folk rock/hard rock blend that would characterize many of their subsequent albums.  Surprisingly, a near-epic is included on Minstrel in the Gallery (the four-part, 16 minute long Baker St. Muse suite).  This is surprising in the sense that following the lambasting of the prog epic A Passion Play, the group turned around and released the comparatively lighter album War Child.<br /><br />Musically, Minstrel in the Gallery includes a nice mixture of progressive rock, early English folk music, folk rock and hard rock.  The quieter passages played on acoustic instruments nicely leaven the thunderous, proggier sections.  There are some great performances by all of the players and drummer Barriemore Barlow is in especially fine form throughout.  This would be the last album with bassist Jeffrey Hammond-Hammond, who was replaced by the fantastic John Glascock.<br /><br />This remastered effort is pretty nice and reproduces the LP fairly accurately...well, based upon what little I remember of my old LP from a billion years ago.  The sound quality is pretty good overall (even on the bonus live tracks).  Speaking of which, I thought the bonus tracks were very nice, although I find myself \\"hard-wired\\" to stop listening when Grace ends.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album that nicely merges prog, folk and rock together and is recommended along with similar albums including Songs from the Wood (1977) and Heavy Horses (1978).
B000MV9026|1.0|Wow, just wow.  And not in a good way do I mean Wow.  This was bad, really bad.  I guess it was going for cutesy, but come on!  This was just lame.  The storyline was horrendous.  The singing was dreadful.  And if there had been a pencil or a sharp object anywhere near me...well, nevermind that.  If you want good animated movies that both kids and adults will enjoy, go for Pixar.  This one was just awful.

B00122M2QU|4.0|Thrashing, battering and flogging their way into your cd player is Cavalera Conspiracy's new cd \\"Inflikted\\". For the dilettantes out there, Cavalera Conspiracy (CC) is a groove/thrash metal band with a United Nations flare as the band features members from Brazil, France, and the United States. Veteran thrashers may be especially excited that the band is a reunion of the Cavalera brothers after a12 year hiatus and this marks the first time they have made music or shared a stage together since the infamous Sepultura break up twelve years ago.<br /><br />Featuring Max Cavalera (Soulfly, ex-Sepultura) on vocals and rhythm guitar, Iggor Cavalera (ex-Sepultura) on drums, Soulfly guitarist Marc Rizzo and Joe Duplantier (Gojira) on bass \\"Inflikted\\" is not only true to thrash with its speed riffing , in your face, down your throat aggression, and fast, percussive and low-register guitar riffs, coupled with very impressive shredding-style lead work from Rizzo, it manages to lend a innovative sound and feel that some thrash bands rarely reach, unfortunately staying in the predictable mire- this is not so with CC.<br /><br />\\"Inflikted\\" benefits not only from the perfect temperature melting pot of the Cavalera brothers with Rizzo and Duplantier but the engineering and co production of Logan Mader. The result is a tight, unyielding 11 track cd, with notables such as \\"Black Ark\\", `Hex\\" and \\"Nevertrust\\" that showcase the band in total but Max's unforgettable vocal style.<br /><br />Touring worldwide and with Judas Priest in September of this year; if Cavalera Conspiracy is as good on stage as they are on \\"Inflikted\\" then for those about to thrash, Cavalera Conspiracy salutes you.<br /><br />4.5 Stars<br /><br />Review by Kim Thore All Access Magazine
B00004XONN|3.0|To examine Kid A's influence (and it is influential), let's look at \\"The National Anthem.\\" This song starts with a simple bass line, not even a bass line so much as a very basic bass rhythm. This rhythm is then played unswervingly for the rest of the song. No other melodic elements are ever added. Where a rock band might gradually raise the tension with a developing guitar solo, where a club-oriented dance band might build up many different layers to crescendo, Radiohead adds a whole bunch of blaring trumpets, squealing cacophonously all at the same time all of a sudden. The surprise and the volume attempt to make up for the lack of music.    In recent years, this sort of thing occurs all the time in popular music, when albums are largely defined by the adjectives assigned to them in reviews or interviews, and their musical content consists of very common, basic stamps, simple stand-ins for the explanations offered in the reviews and interviews. You know the type, when \\"musical diversity\\" means that someone bought a couple of exotic instruments, strummed a few idle and disconnected notes, then tweaked them in ProTools until they sounded palatable. \\"Making nonsense seem profound,\\" to paraphrase the editorial blurb, is the defining quality of popular music throughout the 2000s. If you want to see the downside of Kid A's influence, listen to something like Blur's 2002 album Think Tank. \\"Crazy Beat\\" is a more ingratiating take on \\"The National Anthem,\\" based on the same exact kind of dull repetition.    This approach is heavily inspired by the \\"artistic\\" trend in nineties electronica: Aphex Twin, Autechre, Bjork, etc. This type of music was already extremely susceptible to adjectives and mystique, even in the nineties. Look at some of the essays written about the Warp Records catalog in the early nineties, and you'll see what I mean. Kid A synthesized many of those sounds and made them mainstream. Put Bjork in front of the microphone in \\"Motion Picture Soundtrack,\\" andyou get an absolutely typical example of one of her \\"harpsichord songs\\" like \\"Cover Me\\" or \\"Like Someone In Love,\\" where she sings over incidental strumming. \\"Idioteque\\" recalls Autechre with a mechanical dance beat that you can't dance to, with a few dissonant, droning synth waves (again, no other melodic elements) laid on top. And just about any electronic band has done something like \\"Treefingers,\\" a moody ambient drone with no musical progression.     The title track, in particular, is a flawless Aphex imitation. He did this kind of playful/wistful music-box lead many times, both before Kid A (\\"In The Glitter Part 2\\" from 26 Mixes For Cash) and after it (\\"Nannou,\\" on the Windowlicker EP). The distorted, croaking vocals, half-creepy and half-innocent, as well as the jittery drumbeat, are also straight out of his playbook. I guess it's a testament to how deeply Radiohead buried themselves in the part. But, in Radiohead's hands, this stuff became oblique enough for countless adjectives, and sounded serious enough to create mystique.    The best musical moments occur in the mid-tempo tracks, where it's possible to ease into the mood and zone out. \\"Everything In Its Right Place\\" is quite original in the way the moody piano is arranged into an oscillating loop, backed by buzzing vocal samples and Yorke's neurotic lead. \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" takes the quiet acoustic guitar from \\"Exit Music For A Film,\\" and adds whale-song synths to match the drifting vocals -- pretty and detailed for a rock band, inventive for a techno band. \\"Optimistic\\" also has a pretty simple guitar line, but the aggressive rhythm section creates a powerful churn. 'Churn' is one of those meaningless rock-journalist words, but here it's apt. There's a chaotic and ramshackle feel to the song that gives it the energy that was lacking in \\"The National Anthem.\\" Of all the songs on the album, this one is closest in spirit to OK Computer. \\"In Limbo\\" is quieter, back to drift mode, but keeps that chaotic churn, now given form by a faint keyboard line.    Take those four tracks, add \\"Kid A,\\" and you have five very good songs that genuinely make use of some of the strengths of Warp-style electronica. But the album's reputation claims so much more. The lyrics play a key role in the mystique of Kid A, and here too, we run into some trouble.    Lyrically, Yorke's focus has constricted to oblique, demonstrative statements of isolation, things like obsessively repeating, \\"there are two colours in my head.\\" OK Computer is also an introspective album, but most of it somehow reacts to the outside world: to lovers (\\"Exit Music For A Film,\\" \\"Lucky\\"), politicians (\\"Electioneering\\"), insufficiently sensitive bourgeois (\\"Fitter Happier,\\" \\"The Tourist\\"), or outside events (\\"Airbag\\"). By contrast, Kid A shuts out everyone and everything other than Yorke. The only reaction Yorke has to anyone other than himself is stated in the first song: \\"What, what was that you tried to say?\\" Any possibility of meaningful communication is immediately, categorically denied.    Yorke's exclusion of the outside world is so total that it begins to sound very deliberate. The loneliness of modern man is no longer enough to explain it. It takes a sustained, deliberate effort to drown out the outside world so completely. This type of thing has its appeal, in one's self-pitying moments (\\"the best you can is good enough,\\" Yorke reassures in \\"Optimistic\\"), but it's important to realize that it's not all that sympathetic. And then, one can't help but get a bit fidgety. Gentle reader, are you really patient enough to want to help someone who seems to delight in rebuffing your efforts?    Kid A is not so much an \\"experimental\\" work as it is a collection of many then-contemporary ideas in electronic music. In a way, it set the tone for the decade. However, one might wonder if that was entirely a good thing.
006112429X|5.0|This novel offers such a provocative and creative insight into two minds, that of parent and child.  And does she pick an \\"easy subject\\" e.g. divorce, abuse, abandonment?  No, Lionel Shriver goes for the kill, literally.  Kevin is a school killer and even that subject she twists into the most compelling puzzle. Kevin is not bullied (or the product of divorce, abuse or abandonment).  So what IS he?  As the novel grows closer and closer to \\"Thursday\\" as Kevin's mother refers to the day of the killings, the frustrations mount as no one seems any closer to the answer--not even Kevin.  By far the best book I've read this year and a terrific book club recommendation.

There is a lot to discuss-from the family life to the unrest that is pertinent to what was once Rhodesia and is now suddenly thrust into the spotlight as Zimbabwe. Ms. Fuller takes you to a place that few in today's world will experience. She is honest in her depiction of her family and one is caught up in each of their personalities.  I wish more books could offer such insight and descriptions that will both educate and entertain at the same time.      Gail Boyd, Washington, Ga.

B00164DWEA|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this flick.  Saw it in the theater in Charleston, SC. Lots of great action and computer work.<br /><br />The incredible hulk is a great flick.  Modeled after the TV series starring Bill Bixby, and the comic book series too, I believe.  The basic premise is:  He gets mad and turns into a huge green thing. Great animation.  The flick is filmed in NY, Rio, and Toronto?  Ed Norton does a great job as The Hulk, as does Liv Tyler as his friend and former girlfriend.  William Hurt plays a hot shot General, who wants to disect whatever is making Ed Norton turn into The Hulk, so he can use \\"it\\" as a weapon.<br /><br />An experiment goes haywire and Norton (Bruce) turns into this huge green thing, whenever he gets really excited.  He runs off to Brazil, to hide out from everybody and try to figure out how to control his body chemistry. (You think you got it bad when your deodorant fails.)  Anyway, he is off in Brazil, wearing a heart monitor wristband and trying to keep his heart rate below 200. He tries anger management through breathing techniques. Meanwhile, he is quietly working in an old delapidated bottled soda/juice factory, hiding out while he searches for a cure from gamma ray poisoning. When a drop of his very special blood accidentally gets into a bottle on the line and makes a man sick, the government finds out and the chase is on. As he is being chased across the rooftops of Brazil, his heart rate begins to increase. The story line has him next in Guatemala and then Mexico and still being chased.<br /><br />Dr Elizabeth/Betty Ross (Liv) now has a boyfriend. Bruce returns to the US and stays with an old friend for a couple of days, then Betty sees Bruce. (Yep, she still likes him.)<br /><br />Great action storyline and setup perfectly for a Part 2.

B00005JPTK|2.0|Get the single disc, most of the extras on the two disc are only viewable on a Windows PC via the internet and are only \\"valid\\" till March 2009 - i.e. they'll expire and won't be hosted on the web after that!  2 Disc = Rip Off.  While I enjoyed the movie, I was expecting to have the normal two disc extras available on the 2nd DVD to watch on my DVD player.  Well, the only thing on the 2nd DVD is an alternate ending to the movie.  All of the good extras (how it was produced etc.), are only viewable (not save-able) on a Windows Computer (uses MS specific stuff) that you hook to WarnerBros through the internet and will only be available through March of 2009, at that point those extras go poof and you won't be able access them - nice.  I wouldn't have bought the two disc version for just the alt ending and having the extras not viewable on my TV and then expire in less than a year.

0452289963|5.0|I began reading A New Earth during a very dark and confusing time in my life.  I was looking for something to help me find strength and positivity in myself so that I could be a better person for those that I love.  I looked forward to reading even just a few pages each day to lift my focus on life.  I have recommended the book to so many others.  While it does read a bit clinical in some areas, it forces the reader to read slowly and really take in the message of hope.  I have notes and highlights on nearly every page throughout the entire book.  My new mantra is living in the NOW.

B00140PK6O|5.0|I found this series to be powerfully dramatized. Like many series the first episode is not as strong as the following four episodes as the actors discover their characters and the writers unveil their intertwined plots. But Cranford ends with a moving conclusion that avoids cliche while delivering hoped-for satisfactions. The cast is absolutely superb and the writing excellent, incorporating many favorite 19th century conventions revitalized by an artful screenplay.<br /><br />If you enjoy the writing of Charles Dickens and similar adaptations by the BBC you will almost assuredly enjoy this production.
0143113100|3.0|I have a general professional interest in psychology and brain science, which often leads me to be frustrated by the tendency towards reductionism and exaggeration.  This book looked promising to me because the author is advertised as a psychoanalyst--something that usually does not mesh well with neuroscience.  I was intrigued to see how Freud might think about modern psychology's biological determinism.  On that score, I found The Brain That Changes Itself reasonably satisfying; the chapter on how neural plasticity can help us understand the impact of psychotherapy was among the best in the book.  I very much appreciate the emphasis on how experience (including talk therapy) and culture, not just genes and drugs, shape the brain.  That is something that is easy to miss in viewing the pretty brain scans of contemporary popular science.  I also found the appendix on how culture works through neural plasticity interesting, although I don't find it helpful to define culture as Doidge seems to--something akin to cultivation and taste (a definition that leads to a problematic hierarchy of cultures based on somewhat arbitrary criteria).  It is, however, important to recognize that culture and the brain have a reciprocal relationship.    My main concern with the book is that much of the argument seems to imply that the brain is infinitely malleable with the right exercises and effort.  Though Doidge does note at points that plasticity is not infinite, he also seems to endorse the very American cultural script that individuals have total control over everything that happens to them.  If babies are properly stimulated they will all be geniuses!  If ADHD children go through the proper attentional exercises they will suddenly excel!  If the elderly go to brain gyms they will never lose their memory!  These, unfortunately, are primarily openings for marketers rather than scientific realities.  Of course we have some control, and the key findings of neural plasticity research have been helpful in supporting that, but there are some things that are not just about effort--but also about care and community.  Overall, I did find this book interesting and worth reading, but also found myself worried about what seemed to me strategic exaggeration.

0307237702|5.0|This is a wonderful way to learn more about the man who is the democratic candidate running for the President of the United States.  It offers insight as to how Barack views the world, politics, and relationships.  It provides the opportunity to understand how Barack approaches issues and obstacles and his general outlook on life.  This book is both enlightening and inspiring.  I would also recommend reading, Dreams From My Father by Barack Obama, first which gives the background of Barack's upbringing and puts his views and style into the context they originated from.  Both books will remove any uncertainty readers may have about the man we see today.

1400082773|5.0|This book is a wonderfully written description of Barack Obama's life in his own words.  It offers insight into the man who is now the democratic candidate for the president of the United States.  It provides the chance to know Barack before he entered politics, as he was just returning to Chicago after finishing Harvard Law School, in a way that generally only old friends or family do.  It is a must read for anyone who will be voting in this presidential election or is just looking for a great summer book to read.

B000ZN802W|4.0|Sean Penn as a director is at least as interesting as is his work from acting and this movie proves it once again. It is the true story of Chris McCandless, wonderfully portrayed by Emile Hirsch, who, graduating at 22, seems to have a very promising future ahead of him being admitted into Harvard Law, but instead chooses not to fulfill his parent's dreams for him but pursue his own. In doing so he wanders through the US after leaving behind his worldly goods, including giving away 20000 dollars of savings to charity.  He breaks off all contact with his family and in the voiceover of his sister we gradually are handed pieces of the puzzle that lead him to do so. After more or less 2 years the trip ends in Alaska, after we've enjoyed a number of his interesting encounters with other people and many beautiful landscapes that made me want to pack my bags right there and then for another one of my cross country hikes.  The development of the rather naive Chris is both fascinating as well as moving and Penn treats his journey as a classic novel, even up to dividing his movie into chapters with titles like \\"birth\\" or \\"adolescence\\", for those who weren't quite clever enough to pick up on it.  What annoyed me the most about the movie was the music, which tries too hard to convey a certain atmosphere which distracts more than makes you focus. Penn seems to forget at times that old lesson that less is more and that the story is so powerful, it doesn't need this artificial boost of sentiment, but I guess being American, he just couldn't help himself, it is a national affliction after all.  However it's one of very few issues I had with the movie that signifies a marvelous contribution with full adherence to the rules and laws of a traditional road movie.  It's obvious that Penn has a lot of respect for this intelligent young man whose mind lives in his treasured books of writers like Tolstoy and Thoreau from whom he receives his life's lessons that serve to fuel his dreams of apure and uncompromising life far away from anything materialistic and the corrupting influence of society. Unfortunately our hero is not able to see that all his philosophizing and travelling is just a self-deception to avoid dealing with the legacy of the dysfunctional past with his relatives and rather embrace a romantic philosophy of life in general and himself in particular. It is tragic that he eventually paid such a high price for this delusion.  Until quite far into the movie Sean Penn doesn't take any critical distance from his subject but rather chooses to immerse his movie in romantic notions and atmospheric photography and rather trite repetition  of the same adolescent ramblings.   As a viewer however this doesn't bother you at all and on first viewing you're eager to embrace the dramatic events and dreams of youth, passion and hope that we all want to catch again, even though at a certain point we learn that, though not an illusion, at least for those that have not yet sought refuge in misanthropy (a flight just as effective and opposite to the one Chris McCandless took), there is a more noble, though less attractive on the outside, heroism in defying the mud of day to day life in the midst of it rather than seeking oblivion in the remote wilderness. It's a little too easy and a bit like giving up of whom we are in our most fundamental level of being: a social animal. Chris McCandless too, in his last note, in one of his treasured books between the printed lines that so inspired him, comes to this conclusion and it is truly a heart breaking moment in the film.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I watched this when it aired on PBS and I thought it was amazing. I had never read the book and never really wanted to. This show did a wonderful job in geting the audience to want to read the book. While I recently read the book (which was amazing) I found it, in comparison to the movie, quite different with a different feeling to it. No matter, it captured the essence of Jane Eyre's character and her story and did it in a wonderfully artistic manner. I would recommend this to anyone who loves to read the Bronte sisters or Austen.
0307386171|5.0|This book is so transfixing it's as if, instead of your reading it, you feel like you're being read to. The tension builds at a steady, uninterrupted clip, reaching mesmerizing, excruciating levels. McEwan has hit a flat-out grandslam with this novel.
B000P0J02E|3.0|I loved the music from the film, and I can tell when some of these tracks were played in the movie, but it was like a lot of the more instrumental soundtracks - a bit more repetitive than I was expecting.  It's not bad, but knowing what it's like I wouldn't buy it again.

It is good and I did like it, but not nearly as much as I enjoyed CYKAS and the Shopaholic series.   I would really give this book 3.5 stars, but that's not possible and I don't think it was bad enough for 3 stars so I bumped it up to 4.       I did not like the ending of the book whatsoever.   It left me thinking - okay, what's next?  What did they decide to do?   I would love to have some sort of closure, but it didn't happen at all!      However, it's still a good story and worth checking out!

Yet the story was tainted with cheap sexual references and  shady characters set in a \\"resort\\" full of actors being paid to fall in love with the visitors. The reader is aware that there is no genuine character through the entire story .     Perhaps the real reason for my low rating is a reflection of how  bitter I feel about the end. Most chapters begin with a comical synopsis of Boyfriend number whatever, so when the story concludes with Jane, the heroine, finding her true love, I expected him to bear the title of Husband, or fiancee at the least. There is zero reference of the future for them. all that can be expected from the narration is that Jane found just another guy to shack up with. Which means, she never did find her Mr. Darcy. A true disappointment.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|Dead Man's Ballet is my favorite while all the other songs are great as usual.
B0014Z4OQG|2.0|I liked it. I didn't mind the wobbly camera thing (I barely notice these things any more anyway).  The thing that made me annoyed was seeing too much of the monster!  The first couple of glimpses of him are enough, but instead we get this kind of idiotic American-movie 'got to see him over and over' and reach the climax we do.  I was expecting the tricks to spook me and when they came I failed to get spooked because I had predicted how I would get spooked. Well everyday sort of hack filmaking - but still not a bad effort.
B0012QE4Q2|3.0|The Other Boleyn Girl is a fabulous book.  I believe I have read it 3 times.  I live overseas and didn't see the movie in the theater, I was so looking forward to this movie on DVD, I preordered. Couldn't wait to watch it when it arrived. The first 20 minutes I kept waiting for it to get better, it never did. The costumes were sumptuous, scenery was gorgeous, acting was shallow, plot line limped along.  If you are not a big fan of the book, don't bother with the movie.  Try Anne of a Thousand Days instead!
B000RPTQ1C|2.0|Two of the tracks reach the bar of Coldplay's past efforts.  The rest are rather predictable and therefore rather forgettable.  I expected a bit more...  Brian Eno softened up a band that was already far enough down the road of Soft Rock as it \\"needed\\" to be.  Maybe next time--keep trying guys!  I'll buy your next one too.
0553582461|4.0|I have learned that I often don't like the endings to R. Hobb's books, but still while reading them they become my books, so I have to read them. And I will continue to read R. Hobbs books for the beginnings, which she does very well, and the middles, and hope that on some of the books she will let them go in the end. The ending for  Fool's Fate was not happy, the last 100 pages was a dreadful slog that took almost the same time to read as the first 800, which I read slowly and savored. The ending was where she beat it to death so no one else could take it from her. I sometimes wonder if ego and inspiration fight for the same room.
B000002TYL|5.0|is it wrong to hold a candle for your first love? in this case most deffiantly not. its hard to even start with saying anything about this group of songs that hasnt already been said a million billion times before.     it starts out with This is a Call which is highly ironic but at the same time completly rocking and sounding nothing like the band Dave used to play drums for.     you cant not mention Nirvana when talking about this CD (if you talk about music with anyone).     it still amazes me to this day that Dave is such a strong song writer is like having the ability to win the lottery twice! i mean the recording of nevermind brings Krist Novoselic to tears when he talks about recording that album but how do you think Dave feels for having recorded this master peice all by himself with a gibson lespaul and his nirvana drum kit!    if i had to recommend this CD to someone id give it to someone starting out with playing guitar and possibly someone just getting into music or maybe just someone who wants an awesome 90's rock record that knows about music of the last 15 years or so.
B00008EY7H|5.0|I've seen a few Cirque du Soleil shows live, and this is the next best thing.  I wasn't sure how my children (ages 6-9)would like it, so this was the cheaper version than taking them, and they really enjoyed the show.  The show was amazing, and even my mother-in-law enjoyed it.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|This cd is well worht the purchase price. Its Al Green really throwing down! The cd reminds me of back in the day, when Al was turning out hit after hit. All the new songs have the Memphis sound that made all of Al Green's songs hits. Im glad to have purchased this cd. I highly recommend it to all Al Green fans, and all old school music lovers. This cd is excellent.
B00005JPD0|3.0|Deja Vu starring Denzel Washington is an effective film even though this plot could never happen in real life. The supporting cast makes this film worth watching, James Caviezel and Val Kilmer are excellent in their very different roles. This film deals with the effects of time travel, this aint no Back to the Future but this film is grossly engaging.
0316113506|5.0|I knew next to nothing about the brain's physiology and less about the physiology's relationship to the rest of the body.  While I remain no expert in the realm of neuroscience, I found `Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain' a captivating read.  For the novice - meaning me - I learned something about the value of exercise in maintaining, on occasion improving, the health of the brain.  Ratey approaches, and grows, his analysis by topic (learning, stress, anxiety, ... , aging).  It all made sense.  As a migraine sufferer I'd liked to have seen something on migraines and exercise.  I guess it's up to me to put on my running shoes and see what happens!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Great movie about a great man and lady. Something we no longer teach in the schools since the government has taken over education. A lot of great people worked hard to give us what we have. We should stop wasteing time and stand up for what is right. We as a great country need to stop the crazy ness and get back to what our for farthers showed us. Big government is getting way to big and out of hand.    Please show this to your family and friends.

B0006GAOBI|4.0|Imagine you were going to be killed but you could see another future for a few days. A future where you are relatively happy and life has some meaning. But in even that future bad things happen. I suppose this is just a slice of everyday life with an alien that looks like a big rabbit given evil shots. I enjoyed the movie but it is by no means entertaining. When a young man has no future even in a dimension where he survives a jet engine hitting his room, but his girlfriend is ran over and killed, I think you get the point. Although this has a cult following it does have limited watchability by the general public. Most everyone will be glad they saw it as the acting and directing are excellent. The movie's story on the other had is a little strange and may not suit all tastes. We see a few days in the life of a teenager struggling with typical problems but hanging over his head like Damocles sword is his life, the life of a girl he loves, and the life of another man that kills someone by accident. Good soundtrack. Good quality DVD with good replayability to fans. - C. Luster
B000OVLBF8|1.0|This movie is great, if U like candy coated turds!!!!! Whatta load of grass clippings!!! (no PROFANITY) The start of movie was actally pretty good, the orgin of Johnny and his dead father (actually touching) and the intro of the villians wasn't bad!!<br />  What happened??? where did this movie go wrong. Bad characterization??? Devil/hell rules and regulations??? Need a schith to dissolve demons??? What??? WHere??? How???<br />  Okay. At least it wasn't Electra (the worst of all Comic book movies, Marvel or otherwise!!!!)!!! That ain't sayin' much.<br />  And, what's worse, is the movie sold very well. So, look forward to GRII!!! And don't get me started on the first HULK (w/Eric Banana)fiasco!! He looked like green jello!!! The HULK is not made of green jello!!!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|it might be a little abstract for some, but there's a great message behind this film so you should def. give it a shot.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Before watching this movie I heard rumors that Wall-E is too dark for kids. It is not. If this is a dark film then E.T. is as well. The truth is this film is much much better suited for little kids than other truly scary Disney films like Snow White and Pinocchio.    Like all great films, it takes risks. In the first half of the movie there is hardly a spoken word of dialogue. Some people are going to be turned off by this, but there is plenty of communication going on through facial expressions.    It's strongest aspect is, without question, the animation. And though I'm not an expert in this, Wall-E feels like a revolution in animation. I absolutely love the effect of some parts of the screen being out of focus and others being in focus at the same time (for example, the background being in focus but the foreground isn't just like a real camera sometimes does). There are some scenes that are so well made that I had to remind myself that it was computer animation!    After animation, I would say the next most successful thing is the love story between Wall-E and the probe robot Eve. These two robots can hardly say anything more than each other's name but in every scene I was able to decipher what each robot was feeling and trying to do/communicate. I've heard that most of human communication is non-verbal and I guess Wall-E underscores that.    The most surprising thing about Wall-E is it's not a comedy, which is what most Pixar films are. Though it does try to make you laugh, that doesn't seem to be their top priority. There is A LOT of slapstick comedy but it's more cute than funny. Strange as this may sound, the opening skit involving a magician and a rabit (which lasted only a few minutes) got more laughs than the entire Feature Presentation.     I don't think this makes it a lesser film. It's just that I think it has a different set of goals. And people who buy/see this film should not expect to laugh themselves silly. But they can expect to stare in wonder atsome of these fantastic scenes. My favorite scene is when Wall-E and Eve are gliding through space (if you've seen it, you'll know what I'm talking about). There's something about that moment that's so simplisticly beautiful. I wish that all movies had at least half of the imagination that went into making Wall-E.    This might be the best science fiction movie since E.T. It certainly is the most ambitious.
0307388840|1.0|One of THE most boring books I have ever read. Yes, the descriptions are lovely, yes the atmosphere is \\"lush.\\" But there is virtually no action, and when something actually happens it is so stifled in pretentious adjectives that it is difficult to discern what has actually gone on.  A total waste of time. I hope the movie is better.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|...After all John Rambo received 4 Movies. Indiana Jones received 4 Movies. After 235 years how can John Adams finally receive his first movie as a true American hero. This is an excellent account of a great American, As nerdy as a John Adams was, his role was pivotal, in helping secure Washington's Troops. Learning patriotism doesn't begin or end with George Bush' definition of \\"Patriotic duties\\". After watching this movie I have a much clearer appreciation for the contributions of our nations second president. The acting of Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney is believable.
B000HCO83Q|2.0|Like many have already pointed out, this one falls short of the first two films, having seen the original years ago, I just today rewatched it & for the first time saw X2 & X3, & felt that X2 was on par with the first film, I never really kept up with the comics, but really did like the second film as a sequel, but I was really disappointed with this third film, as many have pointed out, the themes of the other two seem to get lost here, for instance Cyclops, who is by far a fun character with awesome powers gets shafted in the first 10 minutes, of course I knew why, the actor James Marsedan went with Bryan Singer to do \\"Superman Returns\\" which I hate to admit was probably a smart move seeing that X3 fails as a sequel, also Patrick Stewart's Xavier is killed off, which really sucked, imagine Yoda being killed off in \\"Star Wars\\" Ep III\\", then Rebecca Romajn as Mystique is done away with, the only saving grace here is seeing her real nakedness breifly, & the one thing that always irks me is when fashion idiots think they should make over the actors, both Halle Berry & Famke Jansen get unattractive makeovers, & speaking of Jansen, was it necessary to bring her back?, & I won't even get started on Anna Paquin's Roque being shafted here, in the first film she was an integral part of the story, here she is just in the background, at least she didn't get a screwy makeover, only Hugh Jackman & Ian McKellan are the same as before, but they both just didn't seem to be into it this time around, Jackman had just done \\"Van Helsing\\" & seemed bored with \\"Wolverine\\" & McKellan had just scored with \\"LOTR\\" so he looked bored in his role too, also as one reviewer noted, there are shades of \\"Matrix\\" & \\"Terminator\\", I could go on & on, but clearly this one failed to grab me like the first two did, I call it laziness on the part of the writers & studios!
B000BCKFWK|5.0|Great two disc set with graphic novel.  The extras CD is the one to watch.
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I have always enjoyed Emmylou's music, especially her ballads.  On most CD's there may be one or two cuts that are just so so but not this one. I love all the songs.  They really make you think about life and relationships. \\"Sailing Round the Room\\" is really thought provoking.  I found this CD to be very spiritual. It was also nice to see that she wrote many of the songs.  If you are looking for music that will make you think about life, this is it.<br /><br />Iseweb
0307387178|5.0|I needed a few books for a class.  I selected this book because of the low price. It was better than expected. There were no marks or bent pages. It is very important that nothing was highlighted.
B00002EPJH|4.0|Keith Jarrett is surely one of the more interesting jazz pianists around. I have his recording of the Shostakovitch 24 Prelude and Fugues and am full of admiration of his courage in straddling the divide between classical music and jazz. That recording is a superb account of one of the great classical piano compositions of the 20th century.<br />  In this CD, we find Jarrett, recovering from a serious illness, in quiet, contemplative mood. This account of standards is almost minimalist. Jarrett presents the themes with little ornamentation and hardly adds much in the way of improvisation. Instead, he lets the tunes breath, enveloping them in quietness. The left hand adds few harmonies -- the mood is almost religious.<br />  This is a good recording to listen to late at night when you're feeling weary and dreamy and would like to drift softly and slowly away.
B0013D8LOU|3.0|I bought the special edition of Sweeny Todd recently because I'm a big fan of Tim Burton films such as Ed Wood, Corpse Bride, The Nightmare Before Christmas, etc., so I thought that this one would be just as good as the others.  The songs are very good, the story is interesting, and all of the characters are connected to each other.  The reason I gave this movie three stars is because it has A LOT of gore.  I can't stand watching a lot of blood in a movie, but that's just me.  If you can tolerate seeing gore, you'll probably like the movie more than I do.  Other than that, it's a film worth seeing, but if you can't stand seeing blood or gruesome things, I would not recommend this film.
B00006I53S|5.0|I was hoping to find a 28-200 like Nikon has, but once I received this lens, I knew I didn't need any more zoom than 28-135. Great everyday lens, perfect for taking one lens on vacation. if there is a down side, it would be that the lens a little heavy.  GREAT LENS for the price period!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|I seem to be one of the few that thinks that Felt Mountain was a beautiful album and Seventh Tree is just a step up from that album. Both just take me to a different world. Agreed thats it's not the Goldfrapp that we are used to as in Black Cherry or Supernature, but her voice just takes us there, no matter where that \\"there\\" is.
B001BKV9TE|1.0|I had expected 10K BC to be on the order of Gladiator or another epic movie - even Quest for Fire.    However, after popping in the disc and watching the first 5 minutes, I knew I was in for a horrifying waste of film and time.  Boring dialog, horrible intros, you name it - it had it.    I ended up fast forwarding through the entire movie.  Skip, listen, skip and listen again.  All in all, this film isn't worth the 10 minutes it takes to skip through all of it.    Save your $1.99 - this film sucks and should be forgotten.
B0013FNC38|5.0|this is a much better cd than the last,just couldn't get into the last cd jason did.
B0016HMYEQ|1.0|This movie is so bad.  When I say bad, I mean bad as in not cool and not good in any way shape or form.    I read the reviews and I thought this could be a really great movie - only to be extremely disappointed.  The camera action (jitter) was probably put in afterwards to hid the fact that this movie sucks.  Its boring, the dialog is horrible and a waste of time.    Thankfully, I skipped forward to get through it.  Unbearable.  Its a movie so bad the movie pirates skipped it.  That's how good it is.
0679736646|5.0|In this futuristic sci-fi tale of life and death and cold-sleep, Glen Runciter (with the counsel of his quick-frozen wife Ella) runs a company that supplies `inertials', people whose proximity suppresses the psychic powers of others, ensuring their clients' right to privacy in a world where telepaths and pre-cognitives can too easily violate it.  After Runciter is murdered, Joe Chip (the best tester in the business) and his counter-psionic companions struggle to survive in a world where time seems to have drifted backwards and death is striking out of nowhere.  Is their dreaded nemesis the telepath Hollis trying to destroy them?  Or is Joe's beautiful and dangerous wife Pat behind it all?  Or could there be some still darker force at work?  Their only hope lies with the fragmentary messages they receive from the absent Runciter, and the promise of the all-pervasive but ever-elusive product known as `Ubik'.<br /><br />As the above summary may suggest, this is not your usual sci-fi adventure, even granting that it's from the inventive mind of Philip K. Dick.  Not atypically, this book is crazy, dark, explosive, suspenseful, and yet still manages to be very funny.  After the frantic pace of the first few dozen pages, the second half of this novel may seem to drag a bit, but the book is short enough that most readers will simply race through Dick's unpretentious prose until they get to the stunning conclusion, which, as always, will not please everyone.  But then, life doesn't always come doled out in neat little (spray-can) packages.
0684833395|1.0|Why is this a so-called \\"classic\\"? Got me. I have no idea. Another reviewer said that you could skip chapters and not miss anything. I agree. I first attempted this novel a few years ago. I quit in less than 50 pages, so bored was I. I picked it up again recently, and I'm now less than 50 pages from finishing. What an unfulfilling reading experience this is. There is no central unifying theme or plot - other than that war is hell and the military rarely makes sense. But we knew that, right? As for the whole catch-22 business, sure, that is amusing the first twenty times, but it gets old quickly. This story could have been told in 50 pages and even that would have been too much.    Why then, if it is so bad, am I about to finish it? You know how it is. You start reading, and you become determined to complete it, just to say you did. There is no enjoyment in it though. I am looking forward to getting done so that I can read something else. My advice? Don't read this novel. Read the ingredients on food packages in your cupboard instead. You'll have more fun.
B00169XU8I|5.0|EXCELLENT!!!  AS ALWAYS, Madonna takes a licking and keeps on ticking........decades of Madonna music, and she goes ocer the top still!!!!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!!
B0013FBS20|1.0|I don't normally write reviews but this movie made me very upset.  I almost walked out after a scene that I will not mention for those of you that still wish to see the film.  I was so disgusted by the plot, the effects, the inability to make anything actually seem real.  I like Will Smith and hope that he continues to make good movies in the future but I would have to say that this was a huge waste of money, time, and effort to go to the theatre.
B00005KB9R|4.0|From the opening song to the closing this album offers revolutionary cuts. Peter tosh and Bunny wailer are magnificent in their involvement and Bob's soul is laid out nicely on this album.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Before WALL-E starts, there is a cartoon short. This cartoon features a baby bunny who works for a magician. The bunny wants a carrot, and most of the cartoon is spent on bunny's efforts to get the carrot. The magician is able to put his hand into a bag, and have it come out of his hat, even when his hat is 20 feet away from him. At one point, the bunny is off to the side of the stage and holding the hat. The magician stuffs his hand in the bag, and it comes out of the hat, but when it comes out it touches an electric socket. The electric shock causes the magician to dance. A couple of members of the orchestra take out a banjo and washboard and play some rapid-fire bluegrass music, to accompany the magician's clogging dance! Yee-hawwww! At another point in the cartoon, a rope hoists a piano up above the stage. As one might expect, it later crashes down with a bang. The bunny-rabbit cartoon is colorful and features many crazy angles. The bunny cartoon is a masterpiece. The bunny cartoon is filled with action, attractive colors, and clever antics. FIVE STARS for the bunny cartoon.     Now this is about WALL-E. The movie called \\"WALL-E\\" is a severe disappointment.    The film begins with a robotic trash compactor working in a trash dump near a big city, perhaps Chicago or New York City. The robot lives in a little metal house, situated on the site of the garbage dump. The little house has many interesting things inside, such as amusing knick-knacks that the robot finds and collects, during his daytime job of compacting trash. The robot also likes to watch a Broadway musical (Hello Dolly) that features corny singing and dancing. I liked this part of the movie. I liked the clever knick-knacks in the robot's house, for example, the Rubik's cube.     Then, the love interest arrives. It is a probe robot, sent by a colony of humans to seek for plant life on earth, in order to determine if it is safe for the space-bound earthlings to return to earth. The probe robot successfully finds a little plant, provided by Wall-e. The little plant is kept in a child's leather boot. The probe robot has violent instincts, and causes widespread destruction around the trash dump, by way of a ray gun. For example, the probe robot destroys a row of large oceangoing ships, destined for compacting. In fact, Wall-e cringes in fear at the probe robot's indiscriminate use of the ray gun. It is not at all clear why Wall-e falls takes a liking to the violent space probe. At any rate, Wall-e does.     When it comes time for the lovely female space probe to return to the mother ship, Wall-e clings to outside of the shuttle ship, and joins the humans on space colony. At this point, we are introduced to the humans who, for 700 years, have done nothing but gain weight, watch television, and eat junk food. There are some typical fights and chase scenes involving Wall-e and the robots in the space station. Another source of conflict is that the automated computer running the space station attempts to take over. (This part of the plot does not fit into the basis premise of the movie. This part of the plot was arbitrarily copied from the Stanley Kubrick classic, 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY).     Other reviewers have pointed out that WALL-E contains no dialogue, aside from chirps/squeak sounds of Wall-e and the female space probe. What bothered me was the lack of interesting scenery in WALL-E. Much of the movie is spent in an ugly garbage dump. The garbage dump is a monotonous light brown or orange color. WALL-E dwells extensively on the obesity, consumerism, laziness, excessive eating of junk food, and excess television watching of the people in the space colony. Although there is a grain of truth to this (especially as to obesity), I would not characterize human beings, or American people, as lazy and prone to eating too much junk food or to excessive television watching. Because of the movie's constant dwellings on obesity, laziness, consumerism, and excessive TV watching,I found most of WALL-E to be an insult. The writers of WALL-E failed to understand the virtues of subtlety. WALL-E is simply not cut from the same cloth as other Pixar films, such as Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo, or Toy Story 1 and 2.
B0014NDXGA|5.0|I have used a skycaddie for two years.  In fact, both only lasted about 6 months before they broke. In a panic, I bought a Bushnell V2 w/ Pinseeker the day before going to Pinehurst and played 4 rounds of golf with it, three of the courses I've never played before.  It does everything Bushnell claims.  Its very easy to use and the Pinseeker mode works perfectly.  It never gave me an incorrect reading.  One day I was with a Pinehurst member who had a laser designed to work specifically with a reflective element on top of all the Pinehurst flags.  Every reading on every par 3 was exactly the same as his to the yard.  If you have never used a Rangefinder or skycaddie, I'd recommend the Bushnell range finder.  It does everything a skycaddie does AND you can laser anything on the course, not just the geographic references the skycaddie has in its course memory.  I'm bitter about my skycaddies expenses, but this thing works better.  When I get my skycaddie back, I'll use it but won't spend the money to renew the annual membership this fall.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|[[ASIN:B000WGWQG8 John Adams (HBO Miniseries)]]  My husband and I totally enjoyed the historical docu-drama and the casting was perfect! Our adult children enjoyed it on HBO, we have friends waiting to borrow.  The price via Amazon.com was amazingly low as I've learned to expect. We watched the entire 7 hrs in 3 early evenings and my husband watched ALL of the extra footage provided.  Too bad the main actors aren't able to receive Oscars for a HBO series.
1558908323|4.0|i absolutly LOVE this movie! the reason (s) that i like it so much are the following:  -its acctually scary  -great special affects  -great acting  -OK plot (though, its got lots of plot holes...........but who cares!)  i apsolutly reccomend this movie for tose who enjoyed such movies as:  -arachnophobia (spelling?)  -arachnid  -and other creepy crawly movies
B000FGGE5Y|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I love Milla Jovovich, but this movie stank so bad, I can still smell it a year after after the fact.<br /><br />First of all, the plot was mind-numbingly boring and the dialog was just plain crappy. Just because the movie is supposed to be based on a Japanese comic, doesn't mean the story has too be so cartoonish and one-dimensional.<br /><br />Secondly, to say that there was an over use of CGI would be an understatement. I think every scene was comprised with some element of CGI. It made the movie seem cartoonish, and totally unrealistic. Does anyone remember TRON? In many scenes it looked liked they just didn't even bother to super-impose realistic looking exteriors or interiors (Furniture, Architecture, etc), over the \\"virtual\\" environment they had created.<br /><br />Another fault of this movie was that they underused or misused a great character actor like William Fitchner (Invasion, Prison Break, Contact, Perfect Storm, etc.).<br /><br />Last but not least, the most serious offense is the untapped potential of Milla's sexiness. I don't know if it was the unflattering costumes they put her in or what. They should have dressed her in something skin tight or revealing to really show off of that great body of hers. In fact, there is one scene in which she is propelled through a corridor in the process of changing her clothes. The director purposely shied away from showing any skin whatsover.<br /><br />I give this movie a requisite \\"1 star\\" since it has Milla Jovovich in it.
B0016AJU2C|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Alanis' albums, even while the world turned their back on her. Yes, they weren't all solid, even, and tremendous on first listening as Jagged Little Pill was, but they all grew on me to a point where I really enjoyed them. This new album is Alanis grown up, with a new sound mixed in with the old. I can't stop listening to it, I haven't changed my playlist in a week. Thank you Alanis for making a record I have to listen to over and over because I keep hearing new things and I am singing them in my head during the day!    If you are a mature listener (over 30?) who enjoyed Jagged Little Pill, I can not imagine you not loving this after a few listens. I downloaded this instead of getting the CD in the mail. Instant gratification! Wonderful!  Brilliant grown-up pop!
B0019OU7AO|5.0|To quiet the thoughts in your mind - this book is the answer.  It is a metaphysical spiritual approach to the issue.  I would recommend it to people who want this type of approach.  It works for me.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Wall-E is great entertainment.  It is a funny movie for both adults and children -- the perfect movie to take children or grandchildren to see.<br /><br />The use of minimal dialogue is a challenge to the viewer.  With the limited facial expressions available, the makers of this movie did an amazing job of conveying the plot and the emotions.<br /><br />The obese people were a sad insightful comment on our eating and exercise efforts.  It affected me!  I had a low-calorie salad for breakfast!<br /><br />I have two negative comments about the movie.  One is that the message seems to be that human beings are ruining the earth.  I think placing this message in a children's movie is a cheap shot.  This bad feature is redeemed in the conclusion by the return of humanity with an effort to green the planet.<br /><br />The other is that the movie tended to drag after the half-way mark. I had the feeling that more plot or less time would have helped. The redundancy of the action placed our eyeballs on a treadmill while our bodies sat and watched the fat people watch their screens.  Maybe I felt that way because the movie motivated me.  I was ready to get up and move.<br /><br />Despite these problems, it was a good movie, worth going to see.  We had a good laugh.
B000059TEQ|3.0|This film is sad.<br />This film is arrogant.<br />This film is simple.<br />This film is edited poorly.<br />This film means never having to say you're sorry.<br /><br />These are just a few random thoughts conjured up while recently watching the 1970s blockbuster hit, \\"Love Story\\".  It is the summer of blockbusters, and while $10 or more is a bit like paying for gas at the local Cineplex, this critic decided to watch old blockbusters in the comfort of his cool, quiet, and subdued home.  Having read the book many years ago, I was eager to see how exactly it would translate onto the bigger screen.  There was little action, little conflict, and even a smaller plot - it was, simply put, a \\"love story\\".  Two Ivy-leaguers meet, they argue with their parents, they marry, and suddenly tragedy strikes.  It is simple, like love - and it does translate well onto the screen with our two leads being Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw.  Together their chemistry is shattering, bring to life a small piece of Americana, and the depth of life.  As Jennifer and Oliver pour their literal hearts out on screen, the issues of \\"Love Story\\", while not many, do break free and run rampant throughout.  The lacking development, the clutter of language, the electric music, and the cheapened edits all culminate as utter distracts to this film.  These errors pull from the story, creating a mediocre tale that could have been the greatest love story ever sold.<br /><br />Let me begin by saying that as much criticism as I give \\"Love Story\\", it still (and probably will with another viewing) brought a tear to my eye.  It is ultimately a story about the power of love, and even if you can see through the clich&eacute; language, parts of this film will remind you of a love you have or once had.  It has sentimental value that presses on the right heartstrings at the right time.  We can thank, and denounce at the same time, writer Erich Segal for this.  His story takes us to love, but his words violently pull us away.  Throughout this film, one cannot help but wonder if O'Neal and MacGraw read their lines off cue-cards behind them, or if the words coming from their mouths were to be staples of clich&eacute; for decades of romantic films to follow.  In one corner we have a witty, independent woman who is not afraid to speak her mind, in the other corner, we have a guy who takes direction well - OK - I get that, but what else is there about these characters that we could learn about.  If this is to be a talking film, let the words they speak to each other express their emotion stronger - or at least develop a subplot around them that allows the viewer to see all the dimensions of both Oliver and Jennifer.  I knew their connections, but I finished this film without really knowing them.  From the book, one could hear their inner-voice, without that in the film, we were lead on a one-sided voyage through love without any potholes or pitfalls.  Each and every time a conflict occurred, simple words were spoken, we were taken to a new city, and we began our story all over again.  With conflict comes resolution, and one cannot resolve with just one phrase - \\"Love means not having to say your sorry\\".<br /><br />Clarification.  The simplicity of this story is what kept me glued to the screen the entire hour and a half.  The acting force behind O'Neal and MacGraw was consistent throughout, providing me with excited moments, emotional moments, and a heavy cardboard aftertaste.  While their characters were enjoyable to watch, they lacked the depth needed to really pull further at my heartstrings.  I knew what sort of characters they were, but they needed to take one more step to fully make me believe they were who they were pretending to be.  Earlier I used the word arrogant when describing this film through free association.  I use this word because I believe writer Segal and director Hiller knew what they had for audiences by the end of their film, they knew that if they kept these two one-dimensional characters together long enough; they would have the audiences coming back by the third act.  To me, this ploy seemed arrogant of them.  Give us more, give us characters, give us at least impressive scenery - but instead we were handed one phrase and tears.  Not enough.<br /><br />Not complaining, but the music could have benefited from either a dedicated theme song or a better composer, the strum of the piano chords never quite hit that level of emotion I needed to bawl my eyes out.  The music was potent at first, but by the second act, it felt stale of overplayed.  It wasn't the theme music of Oliver and Jennifer's love that could have further strengthened their relationship.  Coupled with elaborately bad edits, our film stands solely on the doorstep of the actors.  They are good, not quite great, but worth viewing merely for those small moments of joy where you feel like you are watching a film, not being a sinister voyeur on their lives.  \\"Love Story\\" is a sad love story, alas, it needed something more - a stronger element that would have shown Oliver's hatred for his father, his dedication to his life, and his ability to discover love anywhere in life.  One needed a few more chapters of the book translated to the screen to make these characters full bodied enough to bring that climactic ending to a stand still.  Instead, Hiller's direction just made it feel like an opus of clich&eacute;s.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Love Story\\" was worth the singular view, but repeat viewings will not be needed.  The choice of casting Ryan O'Neal and Ali MacGraw was superb, these were two people that could carry the weight of this world on their shoulders, but Hiller never gave it to them.  There was never that \\"oh yea\\" moment in the film, where we suddenly realized who these two were, and why they were together ... mind, body, and spirit.  Not thinking about the dreadful \\"A Walk to Remember\\", this film could benefit from a facelift.  Build the two characters stronger together, introduce more problems for the two to solve, really illustrate the confusion between Oliver and his father, and I think you would have yet another blockbuster on your hands.  This is a rich film, executed poorly, but the groundlings are there.  \\"Love Story\\" felt like a cold flat soda - it still quenches your thirst on a hot day, but it just misses that punch.  Worth at least one viewing for that romantic settling down in all of us.<br /><br />Grade: *** ½ out of *****they would have the audiences coming back by the third act.

0553582453|4.0|\\"Golden Fool\\" book 2 of \\"The Tawny Man\\" series by Robin Hobb.<br /><br />FitzChivalry recently and reluctantly returned to Buckkeep after rescuing Prince Dutiful from the Piebalds. As he always feared his duty to the Farseer crown is never done as he is asked to take up the position of Dutiful's Skillmaster all the while playing the role of servant and helping man to his friend The Fool who continues his masquerade as the noble Lord Golden. Fitz must also assist Chade as the eyes and ears of Buckkeep as Prince Dutiful's betrothed arrives for their betrothal ceremony which complicates all aspects of Fitz's life. Fitz attempts to juggle all of his Buckkeep duties while at the same time trying to keep his adopted son Hap reigned in as he struggles to adjust to town life and with his new duties as an apprentice. As if this wasn't enough for Fitz, the Piebalds are lurking in the background seeking revenge...<br /><br />This was another great effort by Hobb. I am constantly amazed at her ability to take typically banal situations and write them in an interesting manner. Golden Fool chronicles roughly the year that follows the events taking place in \\"[[ASIN:0553582445 Fool's Errand (Tawny Man, Book 1)]]\\". The usual Hobb plot twist and turns are ever present as is her spectacular writing and characters. Also of note is that a connection is made in \\"Golden Fool\\" between the stories of the Farseers, The Fool and the events that take place in \\"[[ASIN:B00127UT4C Robin Hobb's Liveship Traders Trilogy (3 Mass Market Paper Backs Ship of Magic, Mad Ship & Ship of Destiny)]]\\". This was a great meshing of sagas and if you haven't read \\"Liveship\\" it might not be a bad idea to read that sage in between reading \\"The Farseer\\" trilogy and the \\"Tawny Man\\" Trilogy. If you don't, you will miss something special in this book.<br /><br />The Good: It is always hard to expand on what makes a Robin Hobb book good. The stories are not overly complex and for their length their isn't a substantial amount that takes place. What continues to bring me back to her stories is her writing ability and the characters that she writes with such great depth. She manages to make even the tritest situations interesting as she displays them through her main character's eyes.<br /><br />The Bad: Nothing memorable.<br /><br />Overall: If you have enjoyed Hobb's other works pick this up and give it a try!What continues to bring me back to her stories is her writing ability and the characters that she writes with such great depth.

B00006IU73|4.0|The majority of PT fans believe this is their best album to date and are in love with it. But I do believe it is over hyped. The album does not seem to flow as well together as the rest of their albums...and at times it seems all over the place. Here is a track by track detail:    1. Blackest Eyes - Its a really good opener...I like the pause toward the end of the song and the chorus is very catchy.  2. Trains - A spectacular song and one of PT's most beautiful pieces to date, a song that everybody should really like.  3. Lips Of Ashes - Amazing display of vocal harmonics....sit down and just listen to this song.  4. The Sound Of Muzak - Once again another song with a very catchy chorus.  5. Gravity Eyelids - Hard to describe this song or my liking for it. A lot of PT fans love this song, but I don't get too excited when listening to it. It starts off quiet and slow, then has a hard riff section then back to the slow part.  6. Wedding Nails - A heavy instrumental, and a great one.  7. Prodigal - The best song on the album in my opinion. It is perfectly scripted.....great song!  8. .3 - This song is up there with Prodigal, very nice and soft song.  9. The Creator Has A Mastertape - Very different from anything PT has done, very fast and upbeat.   10. Heartattack In A Layby - Another amazing display of vocal harmonics, this song will blow you away.  11. Strip The Soul - Great song, you can see where PT is heading with their future albums based on this song. It is heavy.  12. Collapse the Light Into Earth - Very slow/mellow song with piano and vocals....I think it drags a bit much.    Great album, but like I said the music is sorta all over the place. I am not sure if it was recorded at different times which could indicate the different sound through out the album. Or if the introduction of Gavin Harrison caused some late decisions to change some songs up (as the album was written before Gavin came to record the album).    Either way it is a fantastic album by PT, I don't consider it their best...I see it more as an experimental album for the band themselves, as they were trying to find the next direction (that was only imminent) that they would go in. But every PT fan should get this album as it does have several classic PT songs and it is an important phase in Porcupine Tree's history.     PS: This album also produced a few really good B sides such as \\"Drown With Me\\", \\"Futile\\" and \\"Chloroform\\".
0312330537|5.0|Finished the book last week and it's the best book I've ever read. I LOVED it so much I started reading it again for all the beautiful insights a few days later and I'm half way through the book again.  This is one of those books that changes something little in your life in a good way.  It's a great story which includes philosophy, some very very funny moments and some very sad moments.  You find it all in this book because that's what life is.      I wish I could tell the whole world about this book.     BTW, Gregory David Roberts does go to Leopold's a few times a week and if you go there and ask the proprietor of Leopold's he'll tell you when he comes around so you can catch him.      I also want to mention how I found this book. I was traveling in India and found this book in a bookstore.  I was too long and thick for me to carry around so I put it down.  Then I forgot the title.  I was reading Amazon reviews of another book by Vikram Chandra and someone recommended Shantaram.  When I read what it was about it was the exact book I wanted to get in Delhi but had forgotten the title of.  It was pure fate that led me to read this.  I truly believe that.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I bought this CD on the basis of just one song \\"Mercy\\"; but the entire CD is worthwhile.  She reminds me so much of a 60's singer by the name of Dusty Springfield - very powerful voice, very soulful and moving.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Great movie, unlikely story of course...but that's the beauty of this movie. If you want to see a movie that's more realistic about life then watch a documentary because people who criticize this movie obviously have no imagination and should drop the whole \\"I'm gonna take every movie i see literally\\" mindset, and to give it one star?...in the words of Gob Bluth \\"COME ON!\\"
B000002IZ4|5.0|When Stone Temple Pilots hit it big in 1993 with their debut \\"Core\\", the band's rather obvious attempt to align its image with the then-popular grunge scene earned them derision.  However, once you looked beyond frontman Scott Weiland's dyed hair, goatee, and somewhat Eddie Vedder-esqe vocals (although it was more due to their mutual appreciation of the Doors), songs like \\"Plush\\", \\"Sex-Type Thing\\", and the almost joyous grinding pop-metal of \\"Wicked Garden\\" all indicated that the band had a canny understanding of hard arena rock.  Indeed, the slick production values and unwillingness to indulge in aimless alt-rock/grunge noise jams belied an ultra-professional approach that just required some stronger material to fit between their singles (notwithstanding a couple of quality deep cuts such as \\"Where the River Goes\\").  The question was whether Stone Temple Pilots would, as one of the first bands to so obviously jump on the grunge bandwagon, simply be another one hit wonder to join the scrapheap of forgotten bands trying to cash in on a trend.    It was with their self-titled second album, also known as \\"Purple\\" to most, that Stone Temple Pilots showed that they could transcend the cheap image gimmick they used to get their foot in the door.  While it's not that likely that you'll find a lot of demand for grunge copycat bands such as Bush, Silverchair, the Kennedys or others of the age to mount a comeback, the fact that the Stone Temple Pilots 2008 reunion generated excitement is in no small part due to this album, and the eclectic blueprint it laid out for their subsequent releases.  While both Scott Weiland and the rest of the band attempted to find success independent of each other, it's the combination of Weiland's unpredictable charisma (part David Bowie, part Jim Morrison, and part chemical ingestion) and the hyper-professional musicianship of the DeLeo brothers and Eric Kretz that brings forth their best.  Even someone like me, who's more likely to be listeningto German heavy metal or Eighties pop than grunge, can't help but salute STP for delivering the goods better than even original grunge bands such as Soundgarden and Pearl Jam, which both ended up exhausting their inspiration within a few years, and released albums laden with self-indulgent yet poorly performed filler tracks that managed to not even be experimental in a good way.  Compare the plinking and pointless droning all-too prevalent in Soundgarden's \\"Down on the Upside\\" with the professional, multi-faceted sounds found on later STP albums such as \\"Number 4\\" and \\"Shangri-La-Dee-Da\\".    On \\"Purple\\", STP dropped the uniform, single-minded production found in \\"Core\\", and roughened things up a bit, while still keeping things quite listenable and appealing to a broad audience.  It was this album that pretty much confirmed that the band actually understood what made Led Zeppelin tick.  Larger than life anthems such as \\"Still Remains\\", \\"Big Empty\\" and the megahit \\"Interstate Love Song\\" mingled with the acoustic, exotic \\"Pretty Penny\\" (a song that would've fit in well on Led Zeppelin III), and the psychadelic \\"Lounge Fly\\".  Faster, aggressive songs such as \\"Vasoline\\" and \\"Unglued\\" also helped propel this album's popularity, while slower, heavy numbers such as \\"Meatplow\\" and \\"Silvergun Superman\\" channeled a Sabbath vibe.  Throughout all these songs, a melodic, catchy sensibility is the common element linking them together, with a subtle, contradictory love of prog-rock lying just below the surface.  The band would continue to mine their devotion to the concept of maximizing the effectiveness of the album medium on subsequent albums.    While Stone Temple Pilots are far from original, they never claimed to be world-changing.  Nonetheless, they're far from the mere bar-band with freakish success that some critics think they are. In the end, it's perhaps their devotion to being entertainers first and foremost that keeps people like me intrigued....when they're not busy going on hiatus or breaking up that is.  Let's hope that the reunion lasts, and that the new STP album carries on the tradition they started with \\"Purple\\".

B000QQFKYE|3.0|David Lynch is one of my favorite filmmakers, so when I first heard that he was filming \\"Inland Empire\\" with a DV camera, I was doubly excited.  Any time I hear that Lynch is working on a new project, it's cause for celebration, and the fact that he was filming the movie with a camera accessible to almost anyone made it all the more intriguing. Knowing that Lynch is an artist with little inclination to spell things out or dumb anything down for his viewers, I was aware that the 3 hour film was going to be a trip.  As I have discovered with most of Lynch's projects, the trip is often the entire point in appreciating the film, rather than the conclusion, or any ending summation.  However, with \\"Inland Empire\\", the trip is often rocky and fraught with an obtuseness that appears to be thrown in, not for art's sake, but for the sake of seeing how far the viewer will go along with it before heading for the door (or the STOP button).      I love the way the imagery turned out--the DV camera has served Lynch well, and though there are some exceptions, most of the film looks as though it was filmed with professional equipment.  This should be especially encouraging for aspiring filmmakers, to whom I would recommend this film for that reason alone--it demonstrates how much can be accomplished without a great expenditure of money.    The acting is also worth mentioning.  Laura Dern gives an exceptional performance as a film actress trying to revive her career by starring in the remake of an allegedly cursed film in which the two leads died. She alternately plays the role (in the film within the film) of a lower class woman stuck in a bad marriage (something that Nikki, the actress, is familiar with).  Dern is never less than riveting, even when it's unclear whether or not she knows where her character(s) is headed.    Jeremy Irons makes an interesting film director, with Lynch regular, Justin Theroux, believable as the male lead in Nikki's film (and later, in Nikki's bed).While the film is being shot in Los Angeles, there is an alternate storyline involving a woman whose abusive husband has her locked up in a hotel room in Poland, forcing her to watch increasingly disturbing television programming.    To be honest, three hours seems a little excessive for these personal dramas that, eventually, do interconnect, and therein may lie a big part of the problem.  Because \\"Inland Empire\\", for all its worth as the product of a great artist and filmmaker, is never more than the sum of its parts, and those parts, in this case, aren't intriguing enough to warrant a lengthy treatment more befitting an epic.  I don't hate \\"Inland Empire\\" in the way that I've hated some of the other movies I've reviewed here, but I didn't love it, either.
B00008WT49|1.0|The sound on this is very anemic. The bass is almost non-existent. I've read this in other reviews but I had to see for myself since I love this album. It's true. Stick with the regular CD.  Later Edit: I've decided it's not as bad as I first thought. What I said previously still applies but you won't be wasting your money on this.

B000OCXMAE|5.0|Quite a number of people have been really pissy about this album. Especially because it sounds different from Linkin Park's previous albums. I've listened to this album numerous times and I personally think it turned out to be a really great album. I think it was cool that they stepped out and tried something different with their music (and Linkin Park isn't the only one who people have complained about changing how their music sounds). Because really, it would probably start to sound a little boring if they just did the same stuff over and over. So I think this album was great whether people think it sucks or not.

My arms are thinner, more defined, and my stomach is flatter... I only wanted to lose about 10 pounds, and I am certain this video will help me get there. I eat the same too, I never changed my diet.  This is also coming from someone who never thought she could get herself to exercise...but you also have to really want it to stick with it.  Good luck, you will see results.. you have to stick it through beginning to end.  Drinks lots of water!

B00006CXSS|5.0|I teach American History in high school and this DVD gets the point across to students in a way that no documentary or the standard two-hour movie.    The strongest points of the movie is it is completely true and story-lines not inserted to make it appealing to the public and it does not create super hero types though Major Winters and Mathew Settle's character showed the true spirit and toughness of the American GI.     I do not mean to single out those two as more heroic because Richard Winters sums up the role of every man in Easy company with his parting letter to his grandchild. Anyone not moved by Winter's letter has no heart nor understands how war bonds men.     I knew a man who was a paratrooper, not in Easy Company, who was twenty-five years older than me and we spent hours talking about his experiences after D-Day and the march into Germany. He was another silent hero and told me that he had never talked to anyone about his experiences in World War II until he crossed my path.     His name was Dick Morgan and we met in Savannah, Ga. in the early 1970s. At that time, he was selling office products and I was one of his customers. He tolerated fifteen years of my pulling information out of him. He died in 1988 and since I began teaching school in 1991, I have made a point of every class knowing who Dick Morgan was and what he did during World War II.     He earned that just as all of the veterans of World War II did with their service to our country. Anyone reading this review will have to excuse my addition of Dick to it but he is someone that all Americans owe a huge debt and someone I will never forget.
B0017I1FNK|4.0|This is a very short review. I wanted to make a comment regarding those people who find the sad, soulful music in the album to be a \\"downer\\" and speak of winding down and such. I've been cheated on and divorced more than once, I've broken so many bones in my back I am in constant pain. My son went through a windshield and is in a coma these last 8 years. My father died, perhaps by overdosing on the morphine they gave him for the pain in his gut and now my mother is slowly dying. In the pit of despair, real pain, and real sorrow, the soft clear voice of Emmylou Harris telling of life, death and other people's pain has smoothed my brow and calmed my sinking heart. You don't always need or want a ho-down or a driving bass. Sometimes you really need to sit down and listen to great beauty lifting you away from your pain. That's all.

May I just say that the actors all do a terific job in this film and that Shia Laboeuf is aspecialy good lookin' in this one ! Great job to all and happy movie watching!
B000Y7U98C|5.0|In the nearby future - 2057 to be precisely - the sun is dying. The only hope for mankind to survive is to ignite a gigantic atom-bomb in the core of the sun in order to rekindle her energy. The Icarus II is on her way to the sun to deliver her payload.<br /><br />A few of the key-role players are Dr. Searle, a psychologist played by Cliff Curtis, Dr. Capa, a brilliant thirty year old physicist played by Cillian Murphy and the excellent Benedict Wong in the role of Dr. Trey the brilliant mathematician but responsible for huge problems with the<br />Icarus II.<br />John Murphy and Underworld are responsible for the excellent and quiet electric guitar music.<br /><br />The first thirty minutes are slow paced and maybe a little tedious, with an emphasis on brilliant special effects (one of the strongest points of this movie.) But after that the tension and drama are gradually build up to the dramatic end sequence.<br /><br />It's one of the best SF-movies I ever saw. It can compete with \\"Space-Odyssey 2001\\", \\"Solaris\\", and \\"Alien\\".<br /><br />For those who want more background information about the meaning of several scenes in the film, and are interested in astronomy and astrophysics, I would strongly suggest to play the movie a second time with the audio-commentary by the English physicist Dr. Brian Cox of the University of Manchester.
076790382X|5.0|After quite a number of years living and writing in England, Bill Bryson returned to his native land, the United States, with his family and apparently continued his writing career.  Mr. Bryson wrote a series of weekly articles, a column, for a British newspaper, recording his experiences, thoughts and observations on his native land and his return after a long absence.  This book, I'm A Stranger Here Myself is a collection of these articles which were printed in that British paper.<br /><br />I like Bryson.  I enjoy reading his books.  This one was no exception.  I suppose the first thing I like about this author, is that we both have the same attitude toward life.  We are both rather inept in many ways.  We neither of us seem to take ourselves very seriously.  I can relate to that.  One of the big differences between is though, is that he has the ability to articulate his thoughts, attitude and experiences, in a way I never will be able to.  They guy can write and he can write well.<br /><br />When I first picked up this book, I did with a bit of a sense of dread.  I did not want another \\"lets get together and bash American\\" book.  I need not have worried.  Yes, he does point out some funny, amusing, odd and silly things about our culture, but he is just a quick to point out that these different little oddities can be found around the world, only in different forms and customs.  Let's face it, there is a lot a bout this country that is absolutely great, in fact, most things are.  The author is quick point this out.  On the other hand, there is much about our culture, our people, our government and our lives in general that is, if viewed from a certain angle, absolute hilarious.  Bryson is quick to point this out too.<br /><br /> Everything is free game in this little work.  Everything from the postal service, cars, diet, computers, holidays, work, play, language, government, family relationships, and so much more, are free game to his pen.  Through all of his work though, he is constantly laughing at himself more than anyone else.

0743290119|2.0|Okay, so when someone states that this is a \\"Backdrop to Sex and the City\\", that's an understatement. Although the book was entertaining, I was not so pleased with the lack of originality. Too many things were not just close to Sex and the City, but the SAME. So 3 ladies are in NY, so what. Problem is, the book just switched around the characters a bit, and didn't add a 4th. Adi gets around quite a bit with the men (Samantha), starts her own dating advice column (Carrie), is produced into a movie (Carrie), and she moves to LA (Samantha). Her fiends Emmy and Leigh visit her in LA and run into a man Emmy met in Paris. All the cities that were used, were already used in SATC. It's a Harry Winston ring they're after, rather than a Tiffany's. Then you have the pent house appartment in NY from Adi, just like Charlotte had. Emmy had the tiny apartment the she didn't own just like Carrie.   It was just a little too close too SATC for me. Not because I don't adore SATC, but because I love it so much that I'm a bit territorial of it and don't like it to be copied because there is the one and only SATC.
B000063JDE|5.0|\\"Blue Velvet\\" is a take on film noir with typical Lynch weirdness, unique atmosphere and breathtaking cinematic work. Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) comes home from college to visit his sick and bed-ridden father who had a tragic accident. Having made a startling discovery (to be more exact, a human ear lying in the grass), out of sheer boredom and driven by passion for adventure Jeffrey decides to proceed with this mystery and gets involved with a night-club singer Dorothy Vallens (Isabella Rossellini) living in a shabby apartment building, which is somewhat incongruous to the sleepy suburban paradise of Lumberton.<br /><br />Dorothy, a queer mixture, of \\"damsel in distress\\" and \\"femme fatale\\", is in a middle of a life and death situation involving her husband and son. She is subjected to sexual abuse and other forms of violence by a psychopathic man named Frank Booth (Dennis Hopper) and his demented associates. Jeffrey's further investigation reveals that one of the police detectives is also involved in the criminal activities of the gang, and that means that he will have to deal with these people using his own resources. He confides in Sandy, a good-natured and sweet blonde, whose father is a hard-working and honest policeman.  Sandy is obviously fascinated by Jeffrey's recklessness, but her level-headed nature prevents her from becoming his full-time accomplice and ditching her boy-friend, at least, not until later on.<br /><br />Stylistically, Blue Velvet is a precursor to Lynch's notorious collaboration with Mark Frost - TV series \\"Twin Peaks\\". These creations share a lot of elements including the small town setting, a dangerously attractive brunette, oldies often played under disturbing circumstances, dreamy angel-like singers (remember Julie Cruise in Twin Peaks), flame and even the famous red curtains. Although \\"Blue Velvet\\" is just a thriller without any supernatural context, somehow you expect the Dwarf to pop up and start dancing at any time.<br /><br />The blue velvet is a leitmotif of the film. \\"Blue Velvet\\" is a song that Dorothy has to perform in a club every night looking straight in the eyes of her tormentors. Dorothy also wears a blue velvet gown at home, and Frank has a fetish for blue velvet using it in his perverted sexual games. Blue velvet is a symbol of mystery, obsession and hidden passions lurking beneath the exterior of men.<br /><br />Lynch uses different colors for the scenes taking place in the normal world of American suburbia versus Dorothy's apartment or Ben's house. Lumbertown is depicted as idyllic joyful place with bright yellow tulips against the white fence and  bright green grass. Everything involving Dorothy or the criminals is shot either in the darkness or unnaturally striking colors. The director makes an interesting application of the contrast between the two women in protagonist's life. Dangerous and seductive Dorothy is a voluptuous brunette wearing blue or red gowns, whereas Sandy is a slender blonde, your typical American next door cheerleader.<br /><br />Kyle MacLahlan is cute, adorable and gives an incredibly convincing performance. His love-making scenes with Rossellini are tasteful, beautiful and disturbing at the same time. Rosselini was quite adequate, especially if we take into account the complexity of the character, but I couldn't get rid of this thought in the back of my head that Sherilyn Fenn would have been much more memorable. Perhaps, I am irreparably spoiled by Twin Peaks... However, Rossellini's was Lynch's favorite at the time, so we can understand being a little bit biased here.<br />Dennis Hopper is way over the top as Frank Booth, being psychotic, violent and pitiful at the same time.  His every appearance on the screen is a an avalanche of emotions, swear-words and craziness. He is a dangerous man and Jeffrey who stepped in his way knows that the only way for him to stay alive is to eliminate Frank.<br /><br />Lynch decided to end this flick on a joyfulnote. Everything goes back to normal in Lumberton, Jeffrey and Sandy will probably go on to have a long and wholesome life together with children on the way. Dorothy is hugging her son in the final moments of the movie, and the robin as the symbol of good is devouring the bug just as in Sandy's dream.  However, despite the obviously happy ending and triumph of the good over the evil, the final scenes have such a dream-like and surreal quality that one cannot help suspecting that something bad is doomed to happen again.

B000092ZYX|5.0|I hate the 00's. Centuries or even decades from now a more unified and faintly utopian world will look back on this primitive time and shake their heads. And they'll also probably want to know what it could be like to live back then. Well, if I were to make a suggestion to them, I would tell them go listen to `Hail To the Thief', by Radiohead. For no other record has captured the dark atmosphere that has settled over this era like a \\"gloaming\\".     The Sound and the Atmosphere:  This album is a continuation of the sound they began with 'Kid A'. Or, more concisely, think of the songs 'Optimistic', 'You And Whose Army', 'Pyramid Song', 'Idioteque', and 'Like Spinning Plates', and you'll have a very accurate idea of what this album sounds like, only taken to a new level of sonic and melodic intricacy. EVERY song here conveys a dark atmosphere, and it's certainly not an uplifting listen, but it is a very engrossing and haunting one.     The Words and the Message:   Like the melodies, the lyrics here range from VERY depressing and angry, to resilient and hopeful. The main message the words convey here is a feeling of helplessness in the face of an intolerable ignorance that is powerful and has authority. But there is also a message of quiet resolution to stick with one's own convictions and ride out the storm.     The Songs:  '2+2=5' (The bands best opener to date. Guitar driven, it starts out slowly and then explodes halfway through, and then ends abruptly.)  'Sit Down, Stand Up' (A fast piano-driven song. fantastically builds to a piano bridge that collapses into a cacophony of electronic bleeps.)  'Sail To the Moon' (EXTREMELY dark atmosphere. Another piano song, slow-paced this time. Very haunting.)  'Backdrifts' (Electronic, yet very melodic. Fast-paced. Great guitar embellishments and piano solo.)  'Go To Sleep' (A fast-paced acoustic song that really has a great climax.)  'Where I End And You Begin' (One of Radiohead's very best. Very fast-paced with an incrediblyhaunting atmosphere. A blend of guitar rock and electronica.)  'We Suck Young Blood' (A little over the top, and the creepy atmosphere seems a little forced. Slow-paced for the most part, but it breaks into a excellent piano solo towards the end.)   'The Gloaming' (An electric loop, just a bunch of noise in my opinion. Has a VERY haunting atmosphere and imagery, however.   'There There' (Another one of the best songs the band has done. A very fast-paced, catchy, and guitar-driven song. Features the best climax of any Radiohead song.)  'I Will' (A slow, quiet, and lovely little acoustic song. A sort of dark lullaby. Hopeful yet melancholy.)  'Punch Up At a Wedding' (Almost a funk/reggae song. Slow and piano driven.)  'Myxomatosis' (A rather annoying bunch of noise, imo. Sounds like a million zippers being pulled up and down at once. But the tune is there.)  'Scatterbrain' (A great reflective kind of song. Slow, with a gentle guitar accompaniment. The only real upbeat song on the album.)  'A Wolf at the Door' (A dark closer about a hostage situation, a very fitting summation of the sound and content of the album. Pounding and very fast-paced.)    Overall:  This album is one of the definitive albums of the 00's in my opinion. There are three weak songs on the album, and even though the album could have done without them, as-is they still lend to the whole dark atmosphere, and thus enrich the listening journey. And most of all, this record upholds the assertion that good music usually transcends whatever legacy may be left of the period it came from.
1400079179|1.0|Dan Brown is an illusionist. It attracted, like all good writers successful thrillers American audiences. The ingredients are familiar: Action brutal murder in the singular and plural (serial killing), incomprehension, investigation, doubt, lack of knowledge, tenacity (alone against all), happy ending. Passion thrillers (see my listmania), I know the ropes most used to give the maximum chances of a successful sale. On the \\"thriller\\", \\"Da Vinci\\" is lourdaud.<br /><br />Dan Brown is a forger doubled a liar. How can one argue that the Bible (and therefore the Old and New Testament) was a work commissioned by the Roman Emperor Constantine in the fourth century? How can you write that the \\"Priory of Sion is a secret society founded at the end of XI century by Godfrey de Bouillon\\" who knows the truth about marriage with Mary Magdalene and the descendants of Christ and therefore lies founder the Church? ... then it is a supposed French association under the 1901 law declared in 1956. And how many other pearls ... like the androgyny of Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa) ... I still laugh.<br /><br />Dan Brown is a man who has faith hatred of the Christianity in general and the Catholic Church in particular. He is a descendant - representing heresies fought with accuracy since its inception by the Church. These are called heresies the arianism, Catharism and Jansenism. They say that God is a pure spiritual being therefore could not have had a Son of a similar nature to him. But Jesus Christ is fully man and fully God. That is what the Church professes, in full transparency, everyone. The profession of faith of the Church is radically opposed to any elitist philosophy - elected on the one hand and esoteric on the other.<br /><br />Dan Brown has mixed genres: the thriller, the invention sometimes committed to history, sometimes lies, and hatred skillfully distilled the Church.<br /><br />I invite the reader critical read the excellent book by Jesuit Father Bernard Sesbo&uuml;&eacute; which dismantles this horror: \\"The Da Vinci Code explained to its readers.\\" (in French)Code explained to its readers.\\" (in French)
B000W4D94I|3.0|For a blu-ray disc, the video quality wasn't as impressive as I expected it to be.  I hope this isn't a standard the studios start doing, re-releasing a movie quickly just to make some money on it and not put some effort into the quality.  The movie was as good as it ever was though, a fun movie to watch as always.
0316143472|2.0|I've always been a big supporter of David Sedaris, but sadly this latest addittion falls short. The writing seems less sharp and incisive overall, with moments of inspired hilarity coming few and far between. Hopefully Sedaris will be able to bounce back from this and wow his readers again.
B000I8G5NA|1.0|The plot completely ruins the sweet and touching ending of the first.  Patrick Warburton character and Smith's love interest are completely unnecessary and sometimes annoying.  The villain pales in comparison to the cockroach guy in the original.    By the end of the movie, you simply do not care how it turns out.  Terrible, Terrible, Terrible.
0756404746|5.0|Name of the Wind is simply a beautifully written book.  Smart, well-chosen words, clean.  Nothing rings false.  Buy it.  Read it. Pass it along.<br />  I'm just irritated that I have to wait about 3 years to finish the story.
1400063515|4.0|I listened to the audiobook. I think the idea behind this book is very, very interesting - life is shaped more by random (non-predictable) events than by anything one of us can foresee. That being said, the author has filled the book with several anecdotes that are somewhat meaningless (eg, the fictitious Russian author) and/or irrelevant (autobiographical details of his life) - hence the 4 stars, rather than the 5 stars the idea deserves. It appears that at times, he is trying to be too clever by half, and destroys the rhythm of ideas by being too verbose. Some of his sentences are very convoluted, and I found myself having to rewind and listen to some sentences more than once to figure out what he means by what he says. I found the parallels with Asimov's futuristic science fiction [[ASIN:0553803719 Foundation]] series- where Harry Seldon constructs his of mathematically predicting the future, but is thrown off by the unpredictable appearance of the Mule (=a black swan). It is odd, especially in the context of this book, that over so many millennia that the Foundation existed, why only one such even that was so enormously disruptive occurred. According to Taleb, they should be occurring much more commonly.  Had this book been written better, I would have given it 5 stars.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never in my life gotten results like I have with Jillian's 30 Day Shred!!! I stumbled across her videos on my \\"On Demand\\" menu from Comcast and have been addicted ever since! All that was available on my TV was the phase 2 and 3, so I actually never even saw phase 1 when I started :0<br /><br />I am not in the best shape in the world. I used to play sports but have not in the last 7 years. I am only about 10 lbs overweight but am looking to lose about 20 lbs and to completely tone up.<br /><br />So... I get my mat and my weights out, (I use 3 pounders), and start phase 2. Umm ya, I thought I was going to DIE!! This is a really intense workout but I did however stick with the full 20 minutes. You do really have to push yourself, Jillian says that your body can not adapt to what you want it to do if you do not push it! I do not think I have ever sweated that much in my life!<br /><br />Yes there are some basic moves in this seris but I have to say that they are pretty darn effective. I did 6 straight days of phase 2 and got increasingly better with each passing day. (Do not get me wrong, I still sweated up a storm and wanted to quit). After those 6 days I had only lost about 2 lbs but I could see a MAJOR difference in my body. My arms were firmer, my abs felt tighter, my love handles were a little smaller, my legs were stronger and my back... oh the best part, my back was ripped! People were also telling me my face was thinner! My clothes also were fitting better and even feeling a little loose.<br /><br />I had to take a week off which sucked, but I ordered the DVD and it is just fantastic. I started back up again and never bothered to look at phase 1 since I can already do phase 2. I also have only WATCHED phase 3 and have yet to actually do it but it looks hella intense!<br /><br />I see no problem doing part of this video everyday. Just listen to your body and be responsible, you know its limits. I actually had very minimal pain and that is what led me to do it everyday; I was barely sore at all!<br /><br />I have tried many things to get in shape but nothing, absolutely nothing, has given me results like this!<br /><br />Please do not forget that with any exercise program you must incorporate a healthy diet. If you want results you have to make sacrifices. In a world drenched in fast greasy foods, oversized portions and processed garbage galore it is hard to make good choices. Do your best to eat out less, to cook more healthful meals, to use lots of fruits, veggies, and whole grains, to drink a minimal amount of alcohol and to try and drink a lot of water.<br /><br />You can do it! Commit! I really mean it! You have to give it your all!<br /><br />Good luck and I will keep you posted, I am doing 30 straight days!!<br /><br />0_o<br /><br />lol :)!

B000YABYLA|4.0|So much heart and comedy. Juno was a sweet and hilarious surprise. The writing was clever, and Ellen Page's acting was stellar. I loved the whole movie (so many great lines to memorize), and I cried at the end. I didn't realize that this would be one, but it was a feel-good tear-jerker, and those are the best kind. I will probably buy this later. See it!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|Judas Priest has been my favorite band for 30 years, and \\"Nostradamus\\" shows why. While it would be so easy for them just to keep remaking \\"Painkiller\\" or \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\", Priest has always been willing to tackle new ground. They knew this would cause debate amongst the faithful, but they went for it anyway. This album is different, but it's a great musical journey. It really takes 3 or 4 listenings all the way through to really appreciate what all's going on. That's why even though I bought the CD when it came out I'm just now writing my review. You cannot snap judge this album! When I was growing up an album was something you listened to front to back, enjoying it in it's entirety. But the iPod generation has ruined this by turning albums into singles downloads which are nothing more than a loose collection of songs. \\"Nostradamus\\" brings us back to an album as a complete work and designed to be listened to that way. And it's worth the time spent! However there are still great songs on here you can play just for themselves. Just to list a few: \\"Prophecy\\" is a great strong rocker that starts the album is fine style, \\"Visions\\" is another great little rocker, of course the previously released title track \\"Nostradamus\\", which is a more \\"Painkiller\\" era rocker, and my personal favorite, which I'm playing as I write this, \\"Death\\". This is a heavy, dark, foreboding tune who's light and shade reminds me of early work like \\"Dreamer/Deceiver\\", Beyond the Realms of Death\\" and \\"Victims of Changes\\". Glenn and KK sound great throughout and Rob's vocal work on here is superb. Ignore the naysayers, get it yourself and enjoy the ride!
B000PKG7TI|4.0|While I'd heard many songs by Nightwish, I hadn't purchased any of their albums. I decided to purchase this DVD as it was the final performance for their lead singer with the band. Musically, this band is as good as any out there. The melodies ebb and flow nicely, with great themes. While I enjoy Tarja's voice on some songs, on others it's just too much. Didn't ruin my overall enjoyment of the concert, but, the operatic style tends to wear thin after awhile. Still, I thoroughly enjoyed the concert and will enjoy it many more times in the future. Perhaps more of the bass player singing would have pushed it to five stars. If you enjoy this type of music, then this is definitely for you. Special Features are kind of interesting, if you speak Finnish. Following the band on the last 3 weeks of the tour would have been much more interesting if there was subtitling so you knew what they were saying. Overall, I would buy this DVD again and will prompt others to buy it.
140003180X|5.0|This first came to my attention as an audiobook. I was checking out the public library for suitable listening material for my two youngest children, and noticed this intriguing title on the adults' audiobook shelf. Hmmm. What on earth could a book with such a title be about? Well, one way to find out, and fortunately it's free at the library, so I took it home with me.<br /><br />Two chapters later and I was hooked on the #1 Ladies' Detective Agency. Incidentally, if you have not yet heard the audiobook, I recommend it, too. It's read by Lisette Lecat, a talented South African actress who does all the voices and accents, making you feel as if you were really there. In fact, all the books in this series are available on audiobook read by Miss Lecat.<br /><br />I still recommend \\"The Kalahari Typing School\\" as a first-read when telling people they really HAVE to discover this series. However, I will say that as in several other well-known series, it doesn't much matter where you start, since each book subtly refers back to the previous ones throughout the story. This is especially helpful when encountering the main characters for the first time in each book.

This is Led Zeppelins best period of time and when they sounded the best and were the best. All eight songs on here are great and this album should be bought by any fan of rock music.<br /><br />1. Black Dog, a nice start too this album and has good blues singing(Robert Plant), and plus the beat on here is very cool and that guitar sound is very nice. Great song 5/5 stars<br /><br />2. Rock N Roll, this song has one of the coolest drum intros of all time and its riff and beat cant be sold. A classic song that so many people today still download. Nothing else too say except its a great song and if you havent heard it than download it now. 5/5 stars<br /><br />3.

B0001DI0FI|3.0|I've never watched Master And Commander before, there's always been something in the way. The length, it wasn't \\"appropriate\\" to watch it at that particular moment in time, and the fact that I couldn't (notice the past tense) stand Russell Crowe. But when you're thinking that you'll never agree on a movie to watch, out comes the one that you've never had a chance to watch yet.<br /><br />The thing about M&C is that it's very much a movie aimed at men. There is only one scene which features women, and it's very brief. The rest of the movie features men - manly men, wimpy men, rugged men, MEN. Now, while us ladies like our men, it can be a little bit overpowering especially in a 138 minute long movie. And when some of the cast look like they should be appearing in Oliver. But when you consider that the rumoured love interest for Russell's character was supposed to be Keira Knightley - I'll stick with all the men thanks.<br /><br />But back to the movie. For a 138 minute long movie, I'm surprised that it actually went by so fast. Even the setting didn't get boring - 90% of it is set on a ship after all. And the other setting was Galapagos Islands (I still don't know how to pronouce it).<br /><br />There's a pretty basic plot, but at the same time it's pretty involving, and at one point I was clenching my fists, desperate for the right ship to win. My only quibble was the cast - there was so many of them, I eventually lost track of who was who, and didn't even recognise Paul Bettany, despite having just watched him in Wimbledon. (I thought it was Jason Isaacs - duh.) The cast was very impressive, and all of them played their roles very well - even though I still have no idea who was who. A few of the cast could have easily walked off the ship and straight into a production of Oliver, which made me smile quite a lot.<br /><br />Russell was surprisingly good as well. I tend to stay away from his movies, as I just don't see the appeal. But he's not a terrible actor, and his portrayal of Capt. Jack Aubrey was excellent.<br /><br />There are a few sad moments in the movie, and I started second guessing the ending - but thankfully I was wrong. In my opinion, the ending did fall a bit flat, and it wasn't what I expected, but it was better than what I was expecting. If that makes any sense what so ever.<br /><br />Overall, M&C was an excellent afternoon movie, although I did fall asleep straight afterwards - but fortunately not during! - but just make sure you set aside plenty of time for it, and possibly don't watch when you're in a man-hating mood.y was excellent.

0143038419|2.0|I was really excited to hear about this book. The title is catcy and seems to invite readers to what could be an inspirational book about the true meaning of life. I received it from a good friend as a gift and although it was written very well I could not have disagreed more with the author about the \\"meaning of life\\". The main character (or author) seems to be very self absorbed and almost possessed by selfish and self-defeating thoughts. Why would you leave a perfectly great marriage because it no longer suited your needs (the author didn't want kids!!!) then have the nerve to write a book about it? I think its great the things the author realizes throughout her journey but in this case the ends does not justify the means.    Here is my advice to the author:   -Notice some people live to eat but many others eat to live...  -If you want to pray please don't do so in the bathroom.   -Love is not just about loving yourself or about your human need for love, love can be about loving someone else so as to sacrifice sometimes. As first lady Nancy Regan said relationships are not always 50/50...sometimes they have to be 100/0.     The only reason I'd suggest reading the book is to find out for yourself on which side of this controversial book you'd be on...
B000641Z90|4.0|While this dvd is packed with extras, the concert is the only thing I have a problem with.  The performance is good, but not the best.  His past concert videos display much better energy and rawness...  The problem is with the set list itself.  It's pretty much a \\"greatest hits\\" album done live..and didn't we have this in 1991 with his album \\"Serious hits live\\"??    I would have liked to have heard some lesser-played album cuts in the set like \\"thru these walls\\", \\"Inside out\\", \\"I cannot believe it's true\\", \\"Don't let him steal your heart away\\".  Why does Phil think people just want the obvious, over-played \\"HITS\\"?    (the same thing happened with the recent Genesis tour--too many hits--but that's another review..lol)    Ironically, the best thing on the entire DVD is the \\"wild card\\", which is a 20-minute SIZZLING performance of AWB's \\"Pick up the pieces\\" with 5 stellar sax players--PUTTING IT DOWN! as well as George Duke on piano..who churns out an amazing solo as well.    The dvd is worth it for this performance and the videos, but not so much for the concert.    Reeno  King of Electrofunk

0061537934|3.0|Should you want some real-life guidance from a doggy who uses the racing game for an metaphor, you will enjoy Garth Stein's novel. It's funny in places but mostly about a champion racer who is forced to fight the battle of his life and you will begin to notice he has the perfect \\"silent\\" partner in his struggle.
0446677450|5.0|This must be one of the most controversial business books that I have read.  Many criticize Robert Kiyosaki's best selling book, stating that they doubt he has done any of the things that are written within its pages.    I began reading this book with an open mind.  I feel that his writings are sincere and knowledgeable.  Yes, he is cruel in his presentation of the Poor & Middle Class, but he is doing so for a reason, to illustrate the philosophies included within the book.  He says that your home is not an asset, I can relate with this statement.  Because he says that a true asset is one that provides income, although a home can be used as an asset for a loan, it does not provide income.  In fact in many cases it sucks up your income through the need for repairs and improvements.    I feel that people are free to their opinions, but I think that many of the people who harshly criticized this book probably never read it, or if they did, they read it with their mind closed shut and unwilling to understand the teachings that Robert was attempting to pass along.    Lastly, Kiyosaki was criticized for his lack of detail in how he made his way to the top.  The problem is that this book was not intended to be a detailed account of what he did to become successful.  It was to open up your mind to the possibilities and opportunities that lie in front of each and everyone's face.  Opportunities are everywhere and you must have the 'Rich Dad' mind set to take advantage of them.    I recommend this book and support the efforts of the rich dad team.

B000WGWQG8|5.0|How very lucky we were to have those men at that time!! In these days of superficial debates about flag pins and flip flops and other nonsense items and accusations about relatively meaningless things like who's more arrogant or whose preacher is more offensive or who panders more to whom, it is especially poignant to be reminded about the great stakes we had then and have today and an vivid example of a much more effective way to address our challenges and find ways to work together. These imperfect men gave us a tremendous gift - one we would be wise to treat with greater care than our current political diatribe demonstrates.
B000OT6V00|4.0|Ah, Hellboy. Great movie. Specs wise, this transfer does the job. Crisp colors, and not too grainy, although that is how some movies are intended to look. Had no complains about the audio, although the case is... different? Many new releases (Narnia, I,Robot, Cloverfield) have a slightly taller and rounded off case. This probably happens with everyone, just pointing it out.

0316143472|2.0|Unfortunately, the title of this anthology is the most interesting thing about this latest Sedaris literary offering.<br /><br />The problems with this anthology can be traced to Sedaris' own success.<br /><br />One of the pitfalls of literary popularity such as Sedaris' is one's fans tend to scour the Net and greedily devour any of his writings.  So, I cannot be alone in having tracked Sedaris's essay output over the years in various periodicals, so reading the same essays in this collection is a bit anti-climactic.  Worse, the essays have been edited so that -- in my opinion -- some of the best bits have been excised or reworked into a bland semblance of their original published versions.<br /><br />Secondly, this mellower, more subtle collection reflects Sedaris's greatly altered status in life. He's no longer the struggling house-cleaner cum Macy's elf cum mover, scraping by to make ends meet. Rather, literary success has given Sedaris an undoubtedly materially comfortable life.  He has attained the type of fame that might,indeed, allow him to rub elbows with his favorite soap stars that he wrote of in \\"Naked\\" or \\"Barrel Fever.\\" As a result, Sedaris's life has no great challenges, no need for truly quirky incidents and reflections that were so strong in his lean years.<br /><br />So I'd recommend this collection to those who haven't combed the Net for Sedaris material, but be advised, many of the stories are watered down.

B0015XASFS|5.0|I have been a Josh Groban fan from the first time I heard his voice 2 or 3 years ago.  First let me say at the outset that I am not a great fan of popular music.  It's OK, but it doesn't make my putter flutter.  Nonetheless, it seemed that this young man was destined for greatness even if he veered away from the classical repertoire.    Awake is a mix of classical and pop, but it is surely aimed at the pop music fans who filled the Salt Lake City auditorium where this was recorded live at a concert.    This recording is a large sample of the songs he sung there, and there isn't a clinker in the bunch.  If this is your first exposure to Josh, then be prepared to become a fan.  If you are already a fan, this album marks a further progression in the professionalism, training, and just plain talent on display here.    Buy it.  You won't regret it.

And a fairly crap job, and friends who I had a laugh with, and a cozy little flat.\\" - Lexi Smart<br /><br />\\"I gaze into the mirror and my twenty-eight-year-old face stares back. How on earth did I get from me ... to her?\\" - Lexi Smart<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella is author of the enormously humorous - and frivolous with a capital \\"F\\" - SHOPAHOLIC series starring Becky Bloomwood, spendthrift shopper extraordinaire. I know; I've read them all. In REMEMBER ME?, Kinsella takes a more sobering, but just as enjoyable, tack. I devoured it over the July 4th weekend, stopping only for unavoidable chores that I couldn't unload onto the wife.<br /><br />Here, the heroine is Lexi Smart, who awakens in a hospital bed several days after suffering a severe crack on the head. To her dismay, the past three years of her life are totally forgotten. During that period, she had apparently morphed from a fun-loving but unremarkable, low-paid drone in Deller Carpets, where she worked with her chums Fi, Carolyn and Debs while dating Loser Dave, into a gorgeous, poised and driven senior executive of the same company and married to Eric, a handsome and charming multi-millionaire property developer. Her new existence contains everything beyond her wildest dreams, if only she could remember how she got them.  But, as she gets acquainted with her \\"new\\" self, her apparently ideal lifestyle begins to show frays around the edges that threaten to unravel towards the center. Perhaps it's not so perfect? Indeed, Fi, Carolyn and Debs now snub her horridly. And what is Eric's reference to \\"Mont Blanc\\" all about?<br /><br />For the reader who may wonder where life went wrong and wishes one could go back again, REMEMBER ME? demonstrates that, at least in fiction, it can be done. Like Becky Bloomwood, Sophie conjures Lexi with a fierce affection for the persona while putting her in situations that threaten to spiral deliciously out of control. Like Becky, Lexi has the core intelligence, goodness, and strength of character to muddle through.<br /><br />Kinsella writes chic-lit par excellence. But even this male continues to be charmed.has the core intelligence, goodness, and strength of character to muddle through.    Kinsella writes chic-lit par excellence.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|What I think that keeps me hooked on this show, more than any other TV show I've ever watched is the fact that alot of it has to do with your own imagination. Much in the way that the original Twilight Zone could at times, only I think Lost may even do it better. Some things in this season especially, I will say, are only as real (or unreal) as you want them to be. Much of the premise is left widely to interpretation, especially in this season, where the pacing of the show has changed a bit.  We now have almost no sense of what \\"real\\" time actually is, and can see into the future time events of our characters, as well as the past.  As one reviewer already explained, the issue with time is a lot more relevant now, then it had been before, as it seems that things that happen outside of the island, happen at a different time pace than things on the island.<br />The season is very short (14 episodes) and in those fourteen episodes we span about seven days on the island (real time [?])  we cover clips that span the survivors rescue from the island, to about three years in the future (which is 2007, since real time events all take place in 2004) and the flashback sequences continue to become more tripped out and frenetic as they go, a steady pace that has been rising since the first season. We get one flashback that may not actually be a flashback at all, one flashfoward that is actually a flashback, and a time line that is now more of an explosion and dissaray of time all together. What exactly is time anyway?... I don't think our magic island really cares about all that.<br /><br />People on Lost island start having some weird dreams... and i gotta tell ya, as a viewer of the TV show, I had one or two weird dreams about the show myself, as it is completely in my head. Which is a little F'd up. But the show still RULES, and as far as i am concerned, the best TV drama ever created  (sans MAYBE the Twilight Zone)  Expand your imagination peeps.

B000068FUS|4.0|Having bought up all of the available Drive-By Truckers music from eMusic, I had to get this one too.  Good album, my faves are Zip City and Plastic Flowers.  There are plenty of other good tracks too and of course, a few clunkers.  It's a concept album, what do you want?  The Wall has its share of clunkers too.  But it's nice to listen to the whole thing all the way through every once and a while.    This is a great band.  Some call them alt country, some call them southern rock.  I am not sure what they are, and I like that they don't fit into a box.  In fact, this is probably one of my favorite bands that I have discovered in the last five years.  If you don't know about them, a good place to begin would be any of the later albums.  Don't miss this one, but maybe it's not an ideal starting point.  Once you have listened to The Dirty South, A Blessing and a Curse, or Decoration Day, you'll want to snag Southern Rock Opera.

0316143472|3.0|It was a no-brainer buying this book - I knew I'd enjoy it. The only question was how much? Sedaris' voice is strong and true and funny, as always. Having heard him read twice now (with tickets in hand to hear him again this fall), I now hear his voice in my head as I read along. He auditioned several chapters of this latest book on a previous tour and fine tuned them for the new collection. They're still funny but not his most hilarious ever. The book was entertaining and provoked numerous chuckles - no belly laughs this time around for me.
0321544080|5.0|The cover copy of The Moment It Clicks by Joe McNally says that the book has \\"one foot on the coffee table,\\" and this is fair enough. Joe is a top shooter of the National Geographic, Life Magazine, and editorial assignment ilk. I throughly enjoyed looking through the photos in this book, and reading the stories behind them. I thought Joe's general advice was invariably accurate (\\"If you want something to look interesting, don't light all of it.\\").<br /><br />Those are the pros (yes, pun intended). The con for this book is that unless you have mega access to celebrities, lavish budgets for sets, and assistants to schlepp all kinds of lighting accessories around with you, this book won't help you much with pragmatic issues.<br /><br />I also wish Joe would swim a little more with digital. You know, the answer isn't to always do it in the camera, or to always do it in Photoshop. It's to figure out which is best and easiest in a specific situation. Joe could save himself some grief at the shooting end if he better appreciated what Photoshop can do.<br /><br />This is a superb book, and I recommend it for every photographer's shelf, despite the quibbles found in my review.
0786715103|4.0|What can I say about this book... It is not an easy read and it is important to realize that it is written from the point of view of the General Dallaire, the Force Commander for the operation. The writing is simple and straightforward and it essentially covers Dallaire's life and career first with the Canadian armed forces and later as the head of the ill fated United Nations Assistance Mission for Rwanda (UNAMIR). Dallaire assumes the blame for the numerous failings of UNAMIR while also pointing out that assistance form the UN and from member states was not forthcoming. In a sense, the book makes it clear that since Rwanda has little strategic value to the world, no member nation, other than one or two ex-colonial powers was interested in putting its troops in harms way to prevent the genocide. What is surprising is the fact that the UN and its member nations were acutely aware that the country was headed for an ethnic cleansing and chose to do nothing about it. In the case of the UN, one can't help but feel that the organization was not only sidelined but also manipulated by various Rwandan political parties, ex-colonial powers and UN member states. All in all it makes for an excellent description of the UNAMIR mission as long as one realizes that it only presents the viewpoint of one person
B000006MV8|5.0|When I think of Badfinger I think of passion. For all it's perfect production qualities, Todd Rundgren and George Harrison could not drown out the passion of Straight Up. From beginning to end, the heart, soul & passion of this masterpiece comes through. Yes the sound is hauntingly Beatlesque. But there is so much more depth here that it would be a shame to place Straight Up in that Beatles box.     Badfinger was behind the eight ball from it's inception. Being compared to the greatest rock band of all time can only finish in tradgedy. If you sound too much like them, you loose. If you sound similar to them you can never come out from under their immense shadow and thus are never given any credit for originality.    Straight up is a great record. Badfinger could have been a great band, had they been given half the chance to let it be.
B000EYK4GW|5.0|I have various Disney movies and this is the best one for toddlers as it does not contain the thematic and real violence of a Peter Pan, nor sibling bickering like in Cinderella nor a too-hip attitude.  Instead it is innocent and very positive in its message of overcoming your weaknesses and of self-esteem.  (In fact I read an article that a company in India uses this movies to motivate its employees.)  Aside from this, this movie is a masterpiece for people of all ages.  The next best ones for toddlers are maybe Cinderella and The Jungle Book and when they are a little older Little Mermaid and Alice in Wonderland.  For Aladdin and Lion King I'll maybe wait until my little one is maybe 5.
B000F6YPXW|3.0|This is one of those albums where the rating I slap on it is really insignificant and totally dependent on my mood. My opinion on it can best be represented by a conversation between the physical aspects of the opposing views I hold on this album: the Finulanu who despises it for its unlistenability and amateurishness, and also hates people (AKA F1); and the Finulanu who admires it for its daring, audacity, and influence, and also loves people (AKA F2). Here it goes...<br /><br />F1: God, I hate this album. It's a noisy, pathetic mess. All of the ideas fail. What the hell? The group's other three albums are much better - in the case of the first album, the noise is used to make a point, rather than just for the sake of having noise; in the case of the third and fourth, Lou Reed proves himself a tremendously able songwriter. One star for this thing.<br /><br />F2: But wait! You're forgetting how creative this album is! Nothing, and I mean nothing, approaching this album has ever been made before or since! It's a daring, experimental classic - not as good as the surrounding albums, I'll grant that, but arguably more distinct and creative than any of them! That's gotta count for something. And besides, its sloppiness was a big influence on the punk scene.<br /><br />F1: Maybe so, but any Clash album, even Cut the Crap, one of the most hideous records ever made, kicks this record's butt. And besides, influence isn't always a good thing - look at Rush!<br /><br />F2: You got me there. But how can you call Cut the Crap better than this album?<br /><br />F1: Cut the Crap doesn't have anything as bad as \\"Sister Ray\\" or \\"The Gift,\\" that's how.<br /><br />F2: Okay, NOW you've gone too far. \\"The Gift\\" isn't a particularly great song, but how can you dismiss something as weird as a short story-meets-R&B-jam out-of-hand, just like that? I thought you liked experimentation! And as for \\"Sister Ray,\\" it's such a travesty, such an awful mockery of what a song should be, that it's beyond criticism! It actually becomes kind of good!<br /><br />F1: \\"The Gift\\" is an example of experimentation gone out-of-hand, and how can you call \\"Sister Ray\\" enjoyable, even in the \\"so-bad-it's-good\\" sense? It's so pathetic - two grimy chords, guitars distorted so heavily it makes the ears bleed, and an electric organ that sounds so bad it would make the organist at the hockey rink cry. And yeah, the lyrics about kinky sex, dangerous drugs, violence, and all that other fun stuff are groundbreaking, but far better songs about similar subjects can be found on VU and Nico! So there.<br /><br />F2: Okay, whatever. But what about the other four songs? The title track is a great garage-rocker; \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" has a superb riff and ends up being a cool duet between John Cale and Lou Reed; \\"Here She Comes Now\\" is really, really pretty; and \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" rocks!<br /><br />F1: No, no, no, and no. The title track is a painfully primitive, idiotic disgrace of a song; \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" is ruined by Lou's awkward vocal interjections; \\"Here She Comes Now\\" is too underwritten to be considered a song at all; and \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" isn't much more than a shortened \\"Sister Ray.\\" You really don't have a clue, do you? Nobody sane can listen to this.<br /><br />F2: Maybe you just don't get it. Maybe it's beyond your narrow-minded reaches. Maybe if you broadened your tastes, you'd get it.<br /><br />F1: You know full-well my tastes are broad enough already. And besides, I hate you and your smug, \\"hipper-than-thou\\" attitude. Now get out of my face before yours ends up looking like scrambled eggs.<br /><br />Oh, wait, I just threw my sanity in question there, didn't I? CRAP! I hate it when I do that! Anyway, I myself am unsure whether or not I even like this album - it all depends on my mood when I listen to it. It is the weakest and least accessible of the group's four albums, that's for sure. Why? It's loud. There's lots of feedback, distortion, and screaming, especially on the second side, which consists of \\"I Heard Her Call My Name\\" and \\"Sister Ray\\". This also happens to be one of the most polarizing records in all of history - for everyone who considers \\"Sister Ray\\" a masterpiece, there's one who utterly, absolutely despises it. I don't know if this album is good, bad, mediocre, or what, and I only slapped the three-star rating on it because it seemed appropriate - if sometimes I love it and sometimes I hate it, a score in the middle seems appropriate for my overall impression, I guess. But the rating really is meaningless here. Point is, it's weird. Oh, and play it back-to-back with Loaded (as I did last time I listened to it, about a week ago). It's an interesting experience. How a band can change so much within two years is tough to grasp. Is it because John Cale left, Doug Yule joined, or Lou Reed wanted to find himself a fanbase? Oh well, getting back to the album in question, I don't know what to think of it. It's the VU album I play the least, so I guess that may make it my least favorite, but it's also, on a technical basis, more interesting than Loaded - which, on a song-by-song basis, is probably a better album.

B0007Y89ZM|2.0|I enjoyed reading Don Felder's book, Heaven and Hell.  In this book he described some of the behind the scenes issues of this performance.  When he was asked to be a part of this event and of re-joining the Eagles, he did it.  When Glenn and Henley came back, there became this huge control thing happening.  At once, the equal pay amounts were thrown out the Window.  They were all told where exactly to stand.  Felder was moved to the extreme right.  If you watch this video, you seldom even see Felder.  When he is seen, he is the one who is smiling and enjoying it the most as well as Joe Walsh.  When Frey Sings he never sings to the audience but moves to the side which makes me gather that he is and was trully uncomfortable with this part of performing.  Henley is way too monolithic.  Just way to serious.  The performances were ok but not relaxed enough.  Also, the show starts way to slow....
B0013FXWX8|5.0|We saw this with our three children (ages 9,6 and 3) and all of them loved it.  While the animation doesn't approach the level in Wall*E or other Pixar films, it approximated anime and felt very right for the subject matter.  The film didn't try to be overly self-indulgent, but rather stayed true to a simple story with straightforward humor and basic human lesson:  believe in yourself.  The movie was quite funny from start to finish with some absolutely hilarious parts.  And Jack Black was made for the voice of Kung Fu Panda -- some of the hilarity in my mind is directly attributable to Jack Black and his intonation, style and personality that he brought to the character.  If you have young kids, this is unequivocally a 2008 must see film.  Even if you don't, this is still a film you shouldn't miss.

B00003W8NM|4.0|Fight Club is one of the most beloved movies of all time.  As of the writing of this, it currently sits at #23 on IMDb's fan-voted greatest movies list.  Its Keyser Soze ending is even more famous than than the actual Keyser Soze ending. (If that last sentence means nothing to you, consider yourself priviliged to still have such a great cinematic discovery in front of you, and go rent The Usual Suspects).    I do not contest that Fight Club is great.  It's unflinching in its portrayal of inner chaos manifested as brutal violence.  It weaves a tapestry of cinema that simultaneously constructs two realities.  It's a movie truly deserving of second viewing just so you can observe how intricately constructed the film is, particularly in ways you might not have noticed the full way through.    And yet, I walk away from a second viewing a little underwhelmed and with a few questions.    Why did it have to be so violent?  Shock value does not make for good repeated viewings.  That's why There's Something About Mary is one of the best comedies of all time only the first time you see it, but not so much after that.  Perhaps the violence has some thought behind it and is there for thematic purposes?  I can see how an argument would be made that the physical violence is a carefully constructed metaphor to the inner violence that takes place within Edward Norton's character.    But the movie is so gruesome that it's sometimes unpleasant to watch.  I've made it through some supposedly hard-to-stomach scenes like the opening of Saving Private Ryan with nary a flinch, but I had to close my eyes or leave the room for a few scenes watching Fight Club again.    And the argument that the violence is symbolic doesn't sway me much, either, for a couple of reasons.  First, even if some element of a movie serves a higher thematic purpose, it shouldn't be painful to watch.  The scene when Edward Norton repeatedly smashes in that one guy's face could as well be Hemingway's Old Man and the Sea, and I still wouldn't think too much of it.  I don't want to see bloody, fractured remnants of a face no matter what.    Next, I've decided that Fight Club does not work too well as a movie with any moral or underlying purpose.  It's pure plot-driven entertainment.  As a thoughtful movie, it is a poseur, continually touching on philosophical issues without delving too deep.  Just as it starts to get close to being penetrative and insightful, it takes a left turn and beats in a dozen different thoughts that contribute little, until all that's left is a mere bloody pulp of a thoughtful movie.    Every time I tried to get more out of the movie than just white-knuckle action and clever plot twists, I came away disappointed.  But nearly every time I allowed myself to just get absorbed into the masterful stylistic experience, I had a blast.  To credit the careful construction of the movie as anything less than masterful would be an unfair insult to it.  Hollow though it is, Fight Club is still a great movie.
9562911640|2.0|I was not very impressed, after having read other reviews, I expected more.  Think and Grow Rich or other books do better job in my opinion.
0061438294|4.0|Tremendously valuable information for public speakers (know when the audience is bored), interviewers, sales people, organizational change agents, and those of you who just plain want to know when you may be being lied to, or causing distress in the other person.  Well written, to the point.  Also, just a little bit fun.

B0013FDM7E|1.0|This movie is not for animal lovers.  There are sceens that JUST DONT NEED TO BE THERE.  I am upset with myself for finishing this movie.  If someone would have warned me I NEVER would have watched it.  It left me feeling horrible all night and VERY angry!  WATCH OUT ANIMAL LOVERS!!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Kelly Clarkson has established herself as one of the great all-time singers of her generation, and released smashing hit after hit with her first two albums.  My December has a few worthy tracks on it, but those bright moments aren't enough to hold the album to it's high standard of previous one by Miss Clarkson.      With Breakaway doing so well within the United States and around the world, many Kelly fans were expecting bigger and better things out of her third album.  Instead many fans were left wondering what had happended to their \\"Since You Been Gone\\" power tracks.  I personally felt that the album was nothing more than a medium strength \\"sophmore\\" album.  With the fighting against her record label and wanting to put out more meaningful and personal tracks, Kelly lost many fans and the album just didn't hit the standard she had previously set.    The only really note-worthy songs on the album are \\"Never Again\\" and \\"Sober\\".      \\"Never Again\\" was the first and only real chart contender from \\"My December\\".  It has that same rock undertone that \\"Since You Been Gone\\" had, and really got you hooked from the first few lines.  The song eventually lost steam, but is still a fun track to play every once in a while.    The more relatable track for every person who has a beating heart is \\"Sober\\".  The song is very lyric driven and speaks from the heart.  Personal struggles are shared and solutions are found, and the song is really one of the only songs out today with any sort of substance to it.  If you haven't heard it, listen now! You won't be sorry, and if you really listen to the message behind the words, you might find that Kelly was touching on something deep and complex instead of some simple dance beat about partying all the time.
B00164KYS2|5.0|This movie will move you in ways you never dreamed of.  I always loved the series but the movie had me laughing and crying.  It was like a rollercoster.  I HIGHLY recommend watching this movie alone and with your girlfriends!!  I have seen it three yes three times and I still can;t get enough!  I will tell anyone that will listen go and get CARRIED AWAY today!!
0823015033|5.0|This book taught me tips and techniques that has really helped in my newest craft/art endeavour
0452289963|1.0|This is the first.....and last.....book I'll ever read from the<br />Oprah Book Club List. It was repetative, redundant, and<br />self-absorbed. If the ego is the enemy, then why do we<br />even have one? Maybe I missed the explanation of this as<br />I was attempting to wade through all of the spiritual quotes<br />and anecdotes. Tolle would have helped more by writing<br />a book geared toward developing healthy egos rather than<br />suggesting we eradicate them altogether. Our ego is what<br />connects us to.....and helps us function in.....the corporeal<br />world. No one would suggest the ego is the only component<br />of the human psyche, but I'm wondering why Tolle has such<br />an all or nothing attitude toward it. In any event, I read a fair<br />amount of metaphysics and found most of this to be an overly<br />simplistic rehashing of attitudes from other faiths mixed in with<br />the relentless babble of the author. If you are looking for a deeper<br />examination of consciousness and the nature of reality, I highly<br />recommend the Seth books by Jane Roberts. A New Earth did nothing<br />for me personally other than reinforce how much power Oprah has<br />over the minds and hearts of the hungry, vulnerable masses.
0385340567|1.0|I have been a devoted fan of Lee Child's since his first book, waiting each time with eager anticipation of a new release. I was so glad to get a copy of Nothing to Lose and set aside time for me and Jack Reacher to have our unique adventure together.    As others have noted, the book starts out with a fair premise -- classic pitting of good and evil.  However, the further I got in the book, the more unsettled I became. I was not expecting a treatise of the Iraq war, one that varies greatly with my value system. I was unhappy that the storyline was sacrificed for a dogmatic political view that he hit over and over again. At 3:30am I finished the book, wondering if I will ever read another Lee Child book.    For a very loyal fan, that's saying a lot. I felt that he forgot that he has a band of loyal readers. He seemed to be writing for himself and not for us.    Wish I had the hours back I spent reading this book.
B000JJRIN4|2.0|Two stars are awarded for the three most listenable tracks<br />on the disc (Sweet Escape, 4 in the Morning, Early WInter).<br />The rest is immature, non-melodic, syntho-pop/rap garbage.<br />This is not a mature album, nor is it much of a stretch for Gwen<br />Stefani, who, now being a 35 year-old mother of two, can't seem<br />to harness the power or maturity of her chronological age and<br />apply it to her work as an \\"artist.\\" Note to Gwen:  the bubblegum<br />rap/pop/syntho gunk about boyfriends and cell phones that your<br />adoring 12-18 year fan  base swoons over isn't broad or appealing<br />enough to keep you singing much longer.

B00199B2Z8|5.0|Having made previous aquaintances  with some of Bryson's work I think that I can confidently say that this is a work of comical genius, from the completly accurate complaints of such things as spell check and setting up a computer to the zany tangles with attick hatches, Bryson keeps the reader engaged and laughing.  Well done, Bill, well done once again.
B000NTPDSW|3.0|Don't be fooled Godfather fans.... forget all the bells and whistles bluray has to offer, not until bluray gets it right and includes all the edited scenes and bunches it in chronological order, will you get the best Godfather experience.

B0018QAHA8|5.0|1976's 'Crystal Ball' was the first to feature Tommy Shaw with Styx. This record is a great record. Released on A&M Records, Styx proves they know how to be a soft rock, progressive rock and hard rock (sometimes even crossing the line into classic heavy metal) here with 'Crystal Ball.'    The Southern rock sound of 'Shooz' is classic. Tommy's vocals here are superb; the slide guitar work here is very well done as well. This is a very enjoyable song indeed.    How could you not love 'Mademoiselle'? Another great song featuring awesome vocals from Tommy. The backup vocals from Chuck, J.Y. and Dennis are also great.    And of course, there's the big hit here, 'Crystal Ball.' This was a single, and unfortunately, it never charted or really hit it big, but Styx fans like myself really enjoy this tune. A classic indeed.    'Jennifer' is very underrated. I don't understand why. It's a great tune, maybe a tad dreamy at times, but a great tune nonetheless. It's one of my favorite songs.    If you don't own this record, you're missing out. This isn't Styx's finest moment (in my opinion, 1977's 'The Grand Illusion' and 1978's 'Pieces of Eight' are), but it's a masterpiece, nonetheless.    Highly recommended for the Styx lover like myself. ENJOY!!!
0061122416|3.0|\\"Simple things are the most valuable and only wise people appreciate them.\\"    This book is enchanting when you read it, you will get wrapped up in it and possibly finish it in a single session. After you have finished, wait a week. Then try to remember anything about the book. Truth is, you probably can't. Now go and pick up a copy of Siddartha by Herman Hesse. Read that. Wait a week. See if you can remember anything about it. Chances are, you probably can.     The story centers around the journey of Santiago, who dreams of seeing the Egyptian Pyramids, and his journey to find them, and through observing and following omens it follows a general \\"rites of passage\\" which has the same feel to it as the One Thousand and One Arabian Nights.    This book gives you a quick fix, very similar to the inspirational feel you get when you thumb through a self-help book in the bookstore, and become inspired by. Equally, now, you probably cannot remember the name of the self-help book, but is that a bad thing? Who can tell. As Coelho demostrates \\"when you really want something to happen, the whole universe conspires so that your wish comes true\\". The book bubbles with similar sentiment.    Therefore, not a great book, but a quick read and not likely to do any longterm harm.
0756404746|5.0|Simply stunning - best book I've read in years.  In the first 5 pages I made my mind up that I was not going to like Name of the Wind (It manages to hit every single fantasy stereotype all in the first 5 pages).  However, 5 more pages and prejudice gave way to curiosity, 5 more pages and I was hooked, and within 20 pages I couldn't put it down.  Stunning!  5 Stars and a \\"Job well done!\\" - it seems cruel now to have to wait so long for the next installment.
B000002KBA|5.0|For those of you who are unaware this was the second incarnation of Deep Purple, the most notable change being the vocalist Ian Gillan with his screaming, howling and soulful vocal chords. Faint of heart beware, this could have been the founding point of heavy metal (Speed King). They went in an instant from being an art rock band to being a hard rock band. The three pronged attack of organ, vocal and guitar make this album see-saw between brooding and frantic. However, nothing can be taken away from the very tight rhythm section of Ian Paice and Roger Glover. This is really the best of Mark II, and in the later albums of this grouping most of the songs are done better on live versions (especially Machine head - Smoke on the Water is pretty lame as the studio version).
0452289963|5.0|I absolutely love this book and I love that its commercial success is bringing into the mainstream the message that the Transformation of Consciousness has become a possibility for humanity and the planet.  The concepts are laid out very simply making them very accessible.  Every short chapter is a gift that supports you in understanding the nature of your mechanical behaviors and in developing the awareness necessary to be Present and in the moment rather than lost in your thoughts, your emotions and the story of your life.    So if you can take 3 books to a deserted island this summer, I recommend that you put \\"A New Earth\\" on your list, along with 2 others which have also had a momentous impact on my life: [[ASIN:1888043180 Being Here: Modern Day Tales of Enlightenment]], [[ASIN:1888043040 Working on Yourself Doesn't Work: A Book About Instantaneous Transformation]].  In those 2 books, the authors, Ariel and Shya Kane develop the concept of Instantaneous Transformation, which is the shift which takes place when one lines up with the Moment and becomes a « Presence » rather than a sum of mechanical thoughts and behaviors.  Those 2 books, like Tolle's, have the rare quality of transforming lives on impact and should be added to your must-read list.
B000002P6R|3.0|The Who went on a three year hiatus after the death of drummer Keith Moon, but eventually re-grouped with former Faces drummer Kenny Jones being added as the new member of the band.  The result was \\"Face Dances\\" an album that is very average by Who standards.  The album was produced by Bill Symczyk who is probably best known as the producer behind The Eagles string of successful albums in the 70's and early 80's.  Kind of an odd choice and his effect is definitely felt on this album.  \\"Face Dances\\" produced one of the band's best singles in the opening track \\"You Better You Bet\\", and there are a few other highlights like \\"Did You Steel My Money\\", and \\"Another Tricky Day\\", but the album also has clunkers like \\"Cache Cache\\" and \\"Daily Records\\" here too.  John Entwistle contributes two songs with his autobiographical \\"The Quiet One\\" as a rocking album highlight.  \\"Face Dances\\" is a decent enough Who album and worth owning for fans, but for a band with the legacy that this one has the album is simply average.
B000003CMB|5.0|Allman Brothers at their peak, and by Allman Brothers I mean the original six cats that brought us this great music..Duane Allman was finger tapping while van halen was in diapers.. This whole cd is amazing from beginning to end..Duane pushing the whole band, them pushing back..showing their greatness track after track..Oh my I can't stress how important this is to have in your collection, not just for ABB fans but for anyone who is a fan of guitar, jazz, blues, rock, fusion and all inbetween. I will keep this short as others have already pretty much explained it, but to all.. REMEMBER DUANE ALLMAN
B000002P2V|5.0|The Who took several years in between albums before putting out this one in 1978.  During this time most of the band members worked on solo projects that were met with different levels of success.  \\"Who Are You\\" is best remembered for it's title track that featured one of Daltry's most gritty vocal performances shouting out Pete Townshend's diatribe to punk rock.   The track remains a classic rock radio staple to this day and I still crank it up when it comes on the radio.  The album would be the last done by the original lineup due to the death of Keith Moon shortly after the album's release.  This disc gets mixed reactions from Who fans, but I have always really liked it.  \\"New Song\\", \\"Sister Disco\\", \\"Guitar And Pen\\" and \\"The Music Must Change\\" are all good Townshend songs.  Playing the role of unsung hero on this album is John Entwistle who contributes three songs \\"Had Enough\\", \\"905\\" and \\"Trick Of The Light\\" which all are good.  Going back through these old Who albums remind me that I need to check out some of Entwistle's solo stuff.  The guy really was an underrated songwriter overshadowed by the genius of Townshend.  I don't think \\"Who Are You\\" is in the same league as \\"Who's Next\\" or \\"Quadrophenia\\", but I do think it is a very good Who album and should be an essential part of any fans collection.
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Too bad Tarantino (obviously) tried to balance serious work with parody.<br />Didn't quite work. The movie is excellent when it takes itself seriously and very bad when it tries to be a 70's spoof.<br />The characters are exceptionally well made and memorable. Three days after seeing the movie, I'm still constantly thinking about Stuntman Mike and the girls.<br />At the same time, though, there are some very silly plot elements that simply break the rhythm of the movie rather than contributing to the feeling that you are watching a 70's piece.<br />Btw, Rodriguez obviously did not have the balancing dilemma - Planet Terror is a plain awful and unoriginal zombie movie.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|Truly a masterful work of film making from P.T. Anderson, who has clearly found his footing as one of our leading directors. Daniel Day Lewis delivers a commanding performance as the oil tycoon Daniel Plainview, who creeps in on unknowing farmers to claim his prize. Based loosely on Upton Sinclair's 'Oil!' There Will Be Blood is masterful in its rich colors and textural sounds. It is a highly engaging allegory about the hypocritical bargain between the bourgeoisie and the church. It is at once a tragedy and an excruciatingly painful portrait of the demonic underbelly of the American dream.
B000F9RB94|4.0|For the life of me, I don't understand why so many dog this movie.  It's entertaining, well acted, and the plot is fairly original.  As far as rough and tough police movies go, this one is solid the whole way through, with believable action, all sorts of spectacular gun play, and enough machismo to fill a police station armory.<br /><br />Old-school sergeant Hondo (Samuel L. Jackson) gets a chance to put together an elite S.W.A.T. team, he snatches up the rebellious Street to go along with other police force lepers Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez), Deke Kay (LL Cool J), Michael Boxer (Brian Van Holt), and TJ McCabe (Josh Charles) hell-bent on proving everyone wrong.  (Absolute great casting for a tough-as-nails cop drama!)<br /><br />The jist of the action revolves around Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez), a criminal who makes an on-air promise to deliver $100 million dollars to whoever frees him.  Naturally, every delinquent, desperado, and dreamer sees dollar signs, thereby initiating the cat and mouse game between good guys and bad guys.<br /><br />Samuel L. Jackson is superb as always, dominating every scene in which he stars, and solid performances are turned in by Rodriguez, LL, and Farrell.  The ending sequence is full of intrigue and excitement, with the best (only?) car/plane chase seen in cinema history.  S.W.A.T. delivers what it promises: a hyper, cop tale with plenty of fast-paced action sequences, cool, likable characters, and a pretty exciting ending.
B000UJ48V8|5.0|I have previously owned the standard definition DVD of Full Metal Jacket and only purchased it because I was unable to find a wide screen version. Well, the HD-DVD version is now available and is exactly what I wanted. It is shown in it's widescreen glory, and the image quality is crystal clear in the high def format. The sound quality is first rate as well. If you purchased an HD-DVD player as I did, this is a great addition to your movie collection.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I waited with great anticipation for the release of this film.  The book is very well done with only a couple of minor flaws---BUT the movie is an appalling disappointment!! First, as a professor of Tudor History and a specialist on Henry and his wives to be exact, I was very disgusted at the inaccuracy of this film...not to mention that they leave out the best parts of the book!! [The very parts that make it worthy of a film!]Had they portrayed Jane Seymour opposed to the Character of Anne with the sister between them there might have been a story of what happened to Anne---and a story of what became of Mary because of a grabbing family---BUT there was nothing to hold the viewers attention---FIRST OF ALL, HENRY VIII WAS A \\"GOLDEN PRINCE\\" AS A YOUNG MAN AND RED HAIRED MAN AS HE DREW INTO ADULTHOOD---LOOK AT THE PORTRAITS! ERIC BANA WAS THE WORST POSSIBLE HENRY VIII, AND NATALIE---WHATEVER HER NAME IS----THAT'S HOW IMPRESSIVE SHE WAS.  The court was the richest in Europe rivalling France....the scenes in this film make it dirty and  way too modern looking.  The costuming is inaccurate--for one, Anne never wore a Gable hood as Queen, it was her predacessor's style!!! She wore the \\"French hood\\".  There is such a lack of real detail and accuracy it is a wste of time to comment further---there is no rival to Keith Mitchell's Henry VIII, and Eric Bana  certainly falls short by a mile.  Scarlett Johanssen's Mary might have been a better develped character and she was a better actress....but this film is waste of time, money and effort.  Don't bother, it is not accurate and not even interesting because it is so poorly created---the book is supurb, the film is no good!!  They left out the best parts....and even the real facts!!! Sadly, not even worth one star, but it was the lowest grade I could give it!
1596680296|5.0|Great book!!  I borrowed it from my library and realized that I wanted to own it.  Anyone who wants to knit socks should buy this book.  It is the best one of its kind.
B00102F5WK|4.0|would I have the courage to stand up for my principles if it meant that my career would likely be permanently damaged - if not destroyed?      could I truly risk my personal & professional comfort in order to help another - without having 100% certainity that I was doing the right thing?    these are the personal questions Rendition left me asking?     it's easy to get into the abstract Sunday morning talk show debate about US definition & policy on torture or to revisit the freshman-year philosophy class regarding whether the \\"means justifies the ends\\".    but how about you? me? what are we willing to stand up for?  how much risk are we willing to take?  are we willing to help someone... but only as long as its not too uncomfortable?    use Rendition to take a ride to the Washington DC cocktail party circuit and a Morrocan prison to see what answers and questions you find in your gut.    great performances by Jake Gyllenhaal (newly promoted CIA station chief in Morocco), Omar Metwally (the Egyptian-born, American-living, young father & husband who has been \\"renditioned\\" to Morocco), Reese Witherspoon (the distraught & confused but determined spouse) and Meryl Streep (the wiley, self-righteous, overly-confident Washington beauracrat).
0060899220|5.0|I was a frequent viewer of Mr. Bourdain's program \\"No Reservations\\" on the Travel Channel so I purchased this book already knowing and loving his style as an edgy chef/traveler.    This book did not dissapoint.  Bourdain reveals some of his history as a \\"low-life\\" (he would not object!) struggling to make it in the food industry.  He discusses his early life as a child and later cutting his teeth in the world of food. Much of the book is Tony passing along some hilarious, and some shocking, stories of the restaurant biz during his time in the kitchen.    I recommend this book for anyone with at least a marginal love of cooking or eating.  Basically everyone!
B0002IU988|4.0|Good heavy rock sound just as the old Creed albumns had. The differences in my opinion are added sophistication in the volcals and the guitar playing. This guy can sing... great power, great range, though a bit comercial sounding (think young Sammy Hagar but better range). The guitar playing, while always good is better with lots of power and plenty of impressive leads. If you were into Creed, you'd be into this.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|Well I looooove this film, and the dvd is pretty good. I haven't seen the special edition one, but this one's got a behind the scenes video, so it's not bad. Audio can be in english, french and spanish and with subtitles in any of these languages. Hope this works! =)
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Not one bad song on the whole CD.  I love music that makes the whole cardio thing painless, and this is it!!!  The music moves you, and also helps move the clock forward.  You do not have to be a big Madonna fan to love this CD.  You just have to love a strong beat, and great workout music.
B000LE1GVW|5.0|The artist has brought a new genre of smooth jazzy type charisma to the music industry, the best thing yet is that he's from the Scotland, UK, undiscovered talent is not long shadowed by the overseas 'considered to be rivals'. His name would suggest a smooth jazzy Italian pop star, when in fact he is a soul-influenced adult alternative singer, after being discovered at 18 and now in his early 20's he has developed to the likes of all. Check out 'These Streets' album. It's fantastic.

0385340567|5.0|Thought this one was probably among the top five or so of the Reacher books, all of which I have enjoyed.  Utterly implausible, of course, but was anyone really looking for reality?  I have said it before, these books are \\"24\\" within covers, and I love \\"24,\\" too.  I thought Reacher's relatively few statements on current politics, military, and war were utterly in character, not out of character.  Not necessarily my own politics, by the way, but I am not a 6' 5\\" giant ex-military trained superman roaming the country with no ties whatsoever beating and killing, whenever it seems appropriate according to my own inner code.  Do we all really think that Jack Bauer would not have an opinion about current politics?  Are we all 100% confident that it would be \\"my country's elected politicians right or wrong\\"?  Not exactly talking about folks that stayed in the system and worked their way up, which would have been far up indeed given just how talented each is.  Does not seem credible to me to have characters that pay no mind to government and morality, but to make an exception for the Iraqi war, where they support the current elected officials without out question, right or wrong. My two cents, anyway.  I think Lee Child writes a heck of a story.
B0013D8LOK|3.0|First of all, I'd like to give the actors an A for Effort, as we see how, even though they are NOT singers, they trained in ways they could for the movie. I usually don't mind movie soundtracks, but unless I'm watching this particular movie, I'm not going to listen to the soundtrack.    I'm not familiar with the Broadway version, but I did feel that this film was lacking in the humor department. Sacha Baron Cohen was comic relief early on in the film, along with Mrs. Lovett's dream, and later, Mrs. Lovett's ending (the sequence of events leading up to it probably had something to do with it). I love black comedy, I kept feeling like there should be some macabre humor mixed in, but it just wasn't happening.    The film was too dark. I don't mean dark as in thematic elements - as I enjoy \\"darker\\" fiction written by classic authors (Bram Stoker, Edgar Allan Poe, Federico Garcia Lorca, etc.) - but the lighting was too dark. This is probably so we can focus on JUST HOW MUCH BLOOD is spilled, which was too bright, and took me out of the story thinking of what fake blood they used... in other words, it was distracting. Hell, I can't even identify with those who complain of too much blood - it was so fake-looking, people SHOULD be complaining about ruining good fabrics with orange paint. I think the film would've been just fine had they left the colors as they were.    However. I enjoyed the film. Not because it's particularly memorable, or astounding, or even because I empathize so greatly with Barker/Todd (though the transition of happy, loving father to vengeful, hateful sadist is a tragic, and plausible, one). I like this movie because I take it with a grain of salt. Sweeney Todd at the beach, or his awkwardness in kissing Mrs. Lovett, were great moments. I could laugh at the hodge-podge character Pirelli was (mixture of Spanish, Italian and French it seemed like), and the irony of Todd/Lovett's demise. I could also shake my head at how gullible Mrs. Lovett's customerswere, that NOBODY (except for Toby) ever caught on that it was dear neighbor Henry for dinner tonight.    The bottom-line: Rent this movie, be sure you're loaded up on soda and popcorn. Do NOT take this movie seriously, and remember kids - it's just paint.
B00113N6KQ|3.0|Got to get drunk to find this film fun, plain and simple. Do that and its hilarious; don't and its bullox.
B000002LEE|3.0|A lot of people describe this album as having elements of funk. I don't hear that as much as I hear Led Zepplin like guitar. On certain  songs I hear them trying to be funky but it comes across like a distorted JEAN LOVES GEZEBEL than anything else. Please ladies and gents don't get me wrong! I have respect for this, but overall this is just to loud for me and I don't mean artsy loud like JESUS AND MARY CHAINS' PSYCHOCANDY but annoying \\"turn down that music\\" loud. So start with Ritual De La Habitual it blends the loud and better grooves.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|Wilco-Sky Blue Sky *****<br /><br />Enchanting isn't the right word, just the first one to come to mind, but it just might work. Sky Blue Sky is easily the most inspired and greatest work Wilco has ever put forth. While not the experiment that [[ASIN:B00020P7TM A Ghost Is Born]] was, it works in their favor that way. Not cluttered with what should not be. But not so minimalistic that it doesn't feel like Wilco.<br /><br />Sky Blue Sky is the groups first album since vocalist, and (underrated) guitar god, Jeff Tweedy kicked his habit. Hence the title. A clearer sound than on their previous works also is a reflection of this.<br /><br />'You Are My Face' is eloquent and coarse adding a texture and  fresh feel to the bands sound. 'Impossible Germany' is a great idea, accompanied with one of the more subdued and better guitar solos of this decade. The title track serves as the focal point even though it is the most unmemorable track on the album. Remaining low key until you reach it than it absorbs you like nothing you have ever heard. 'Shake It Off' evokes the Grateful Dead at the height of their power before they became a parody of what made them great and original.<br /><br />Tweedy's lyrical inhibitions have been set free on Sky Blue Sky making for Wilco's most personal and inspired album to date. Mikal Jourgenson becomes more than a vital part of the group on this album as he shines more than ever before with his masterful key work. His restrained approach breeds great life into the music.<br /><br />Sky Blue Sky is one album that breaches genres finding a niche in every collection offering it a home. Highly Recommended.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The entire cast is incredible.  A good historical film adaptation - as far as they usually go (pathetic).  Historical assumptions have to be made in many areas and if they are off we can't know; though the film is made so well that you could hardly care in the moments when you're watching it.  Excellent cinematography, as well.  I purchased the DVDs because I missed the beginning of the HBO viewing and but caught the scene in which Adams has an audience with George III.  It's a rediculously good scene and it's still my favorite after watching the whole mini-series.  Watch with a history-loving friend, and enjoy.
0786948523|1.0|First off, I have played a session with the new 4E rules, unlike a lot of the other reviewers here.    I must admit my reviews of the DMG and PHB were made before I played the game, but sadly, my playtest did not improve my thoughts of either book or the game as a whole.  And to add to my general displeasure with 4E, the Monster Manual is even worse than I thought during my first read through.    To its credit the Monster Manual provides players every stat that they will need to run a combat encounter. The book is an excellent resource of statistical data.  The bad side of the book is that the monsters contained within have been boiled down to just that, statistics. Gone are many of the imaginative characteristics, attacks and background information on societies/ecologies of the various monsters.  Yes, this does leave it up to the DM to create unique backgrounds for his own campaign, but it doesn't do much as far as providing a starting point, or just making the book itself more interesting.    In the end I would say that the Monster Manual reminds me of a video game manual, all stats, no flavor.    I would recommend this book only if you were going to write your own adventures for a 4E campaign.  If you are going with only published adventures there is little to no need for this book, or the DMG for that matter.
B00127RAJY|5.0|After my second child, the weight wouldn't go anywhere and I was getting frustrated that I didn't have the time or the equipment to do a workout that I thought was necessary to see any results.  So, after ready reviews, I figured I could justify 20-mins a day (while my kid was napping) and bang this out.  I started out on level one having felt like I haven't really worked out in 2 years.  It showed.  It was tough but not too tough that there was no way to get through it.  Level 1 was the perfect amount of intensity to keep me going.  I have a plan to track my progress and hopefully help others.     As much as losing weight is important, remember muscle weighs more that fat so as your are burning, you are bulking.  I am going to track weight loss and inches loss (in hips, thighs, waist, and arms) over the next 6-weeks.     I just started yesterday and I have recorded my starting weight and inches.  After two weeks (6 days on 1-day off then repeat), I will chart my progress, then move onto level 2 for two weeks, chart, then so on till my 6-weeks ends will level 3.       I hope this will help you get motivated as I know this is what works for me.  Remember, when you stick with it, it's inevitable you WILL see results.  Just take it day by day.  God Bless and talk to you soon.
B0000509C4|2.0|The raft is the best of the three. This is the only one that creeped me out! This is creephow right? Then why didn't the others short movies pull it off? Story #1 was more about teachin us a lesson of what goes around comes around, which is fine but make it scary. That silly story with Sephen King from creepshow one was more entertaining than this one. And that last story was just too predictable. So go with creepshow 1 first and if u do decide to try this  skip to the RAFT it was scary, nasty, gory and downright disgusting. Picture being surrounded by the BLOB but it can't get to u cause its in jail but if u visit the jail or fall asleep where or when the inmate can get u. That's the raft!
B000002NE4|4.0|Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds-The Boatman's Call ****<br /><br />More stripped and raw than his previous work. Less accompaniment than ever before; which is both good and bad. Sometimes less is more, but there are places here which could benefit greatly from more of a backing.<br /><br />Though it has something to say for it, The Boatman's Call. This is refreshing in all meaning of the term. When originally released in 1997 this was like a new start for Cave. Unlike anything else he had ever released and yet it sounded more like him than almost anything he had ever released previous. His influences are more prominent as well, hearing Tom Waits more than ever but with an injection of post VU Lou Reed.<br /><br />'Into My Arms' ushers in the album very much like Patti Smith did [[ASIN:B000002VQQ Horses]]. \\"I don't believe in an interventionist God/ But I know, darling, that you do..\\" Dark, and warm, almost down playing Smiths take on 'Gloria.' 'Lime-Tree Arbour' feel anxious while 'Black Hair' as subdued as it is would have been right at home on Reed's own [[ASIN:B000002LGA New York]]. 'Green Eyes' closes leaving more to be wanted as it should.<br /><br />The Boatman's Call is a rare work in such an artists canon. Cave would try to recapture this again on following releases but to no avail. This, his most personal work lets us in to a doomed existence, or what he wants us to believe is a doomed existence, but one with quit and crawling grace. And for that, The Boatman's Call is vital.
B0018S6YOE|4.0|Good girl gone bad reloaded is superior to the orginal in every way . 3 bonus tracks do add to album . Take a bow and disturbia are really good and when you take umbrella,shut up and drive, I hate that I love you from the previous release make this a very good album . The dvd is interesting because the live tour footage is pretty good and it seems tobe a nice way of getting to know Rhianna alittle more as she comes off very humble and that is refreshing if you don't have either of the verisons this is easily the best verison so if your a Rhianna fan go out and get this
1564148793|3.0|This is an excellent book with tremendous information. The one problem I have with this book is there are no phonetic pronunciations for the words used in the rituals. In fact, just about every ritual or spell is loaded with all types of words that one cannot pronounce. In fact, you are calling on spirits to aid your spell work without any background information on the spirits used. You are also left to sometimes guess how to pronounce long incantations without any pronunciation guide at all.<br /><br />I find it surprising that NOT one review of this book mentions the lack of a pronunciation guide. The rituals seem to use incantations from Latin, Greek, Voodoo, and a variety of other languages. To be honest, if I had known this in advance I would have never purchased this book.<br /><br />Why did I give the book 3 stars?<br /><br />The author put a lot of work into this book- it will be obvious the moment you start reading. The book is loaded with excellent tips, and it really does give you something to think about. However, if you can not pronounce the spells your in trouble and here lies the problem.<br /><br />I just wanted other readers to be aware of the high and low point of this book. Now you have the facts, you can decide for yourself.
0553573403|2.0|Not that anyone will ever find this review in the amazingly long list of reviews, but I feel I must write it anyway.  This book is what I consider as junior fantasy.  It ranks on par with David Eddings and all of the Dragonlance books.  Decent story, decent writing, but the depth just isn't there.  There is very little character development, the plot is more or less predictable, and there's little original about the themes.  One of my rules of thumb is that if I ever hear an adult raving about this book or any of Eddings' or Weiss/Hickman's works, I can be pretty sure that they really aren't that experienced in the world of fantasy fiction.  1000+ cheering reviews for this book shouldn't fool anyone but junior high kids.
B00127RAJY|3.0|I have three other Biggest Loser Instructor DVD's--The Biggest Loser Season 1, The Biggest Loser Cardio Max, and The Power Sculpt.  This is my least favorite of all.  First, I think a 2 minute warm-up is not sufficient for the workout (6 circuits of 2 minutes strength, 2 minutes cardio, 1 minute abs) that follows. Personally, I wish the the ab work was a standing ab type circuit only because after the cardio circuit, your heartrate if fairly high and then you pop right on your back for abs...I'm not a fitness expert, but I have about 100 exercise DVD's and most allow your heartrate to decline before doing floorwork.  It's too much strain on your heart.  I also think that the circuits are too short to really burn enough fat to lose weight.  If this DVD were customizable (like the Cardio Max and Power Sculpt) then the viewer could do 2 circuits in a row (excluding the warm-up in between) and get a good workout.  There are good points to the DVD--good instruction, using upper/lower body moves at the same time to raise the heart rate, and no annoying chatter, but when compared to the other Biggest Loser Series Instructors, this is the least useful for me.
B0002A2WDQ|4.0|I really enjoy this film. The fascinating legend of Blues pioneer Robert Johnson, and his alleged deal with the Devil at the Crossroads, is the backdrop of this story. With fine performances by Ralph Macchio and especially Joe Seneca this movie is a delightfully entertaining journey. Eugene (Macchio) takes Willie (Seneca) down South to Willie's old stomping grounds all in hopes that Willie will teach Eugene the \\"lost\\" Robert Johnson song that no one has heard. Willie was a friend of Johnson's in their youth. Eugene is a talented Julliard trained guitarist with an obsession for the Blues. Along the way, they meet Frances, a runaway 17 year old girl who joins them. Played by a stunning 20 or 21 year old Jami Gertz, Frances is determined to get to L.A. to start a dance career. After Eugene falls for her, she then leaves during the night causing Eugene to get the Blues. He then has a guitar battle (with Steve Vai) to retract the contract that Willie also made with the Devil. Entertaining all around.
0805082662|2.0|This particular book has an included CD. The CD sleeve was glued upside down to the back cover so that when you open the book it falls out of the book. It is not worth it to me to send the book back to the seller for replacement, but it does sour me on the Amazon experience.
0385338910|2.0|Jonathan Tropper's \\"How to Talk to a Widower\\" is better than the awful \\"Plan B,\\" but that isn't saying much.  In fact, I thought most of the book merited 3 stars, until I hit the dreadful ending (the part having to do with a gun and the wedding that follows) which sent the book into a nosedive (down one star).      Can you say \\"Deus Ex Machina?\\"  The way Tropper creates plot is utterly cliched, contrived and predictable.  One of many examples: the protaganist, Doug, goes to an empty movie theatre during a weekday. There's one other person there, and, wouldn't you know it, it's his new love interest, Brooke!!!  (How she can simply leave her job as a guidance counselor in the middle of the day is beyond me).  Or, Doug is pretty badly hurt and in the hospital.  But don't worry, he manages to slip out of the hospital and attend his sister's wedding, all so the author can conjure up one or two extra dramatic scenes.  All the characters \\"grow\\" in their own special way.  Even Doug's father, who sustained a severe stroke which caused significant brain damage, is Dr. Johnny on the spot when he needs to be.  How touching!  How dramatic!  How contrived.    And Doug is surrounded by beautiful women.  Not just \\"beautiful\\" -- I mean Cindy Crawford in her 20's beautiful.  I mean Halle Berry coming out of the ocean in that James Bond movie beautiful.  Whether it be his sisters Clair and Debby, his mother (ok, in the past), his voluptuous firey red-headed married lover, his dead wife, his new love interest, or even a girl he's sitting next to in a high school waiting for his new love interest -- all beautiful . . . BEAUTIFUL.    To be honest, I didn't think the story was bad, and the book, to a certain degree, kept my interest; but, in my opinion, Tropper has some incredibly annoying ways of driving the plot, and describing women, which just drove me crazy.  And don't go by the cover of the book -- most of it is about a young man grieving over his wife who was killed in a plane accident.
1594489505|3.0|I LOVED THE BOOK, ALTHOUGH \\"THE KITE RUNNER\\"  WAS BETTER.  IT HELD MY ATTENTION THROUGHOUT. THE CHARACTERS WERE REAL AND WELL DEFINED. THE RECENT HISTORY OF AFGANISTAN WAS INTERESTING.  WORTH READING
0380733358|5.0|One word came to mind after finishing this book. WOW! I believe this is the best spy thriller I have ever read. He was cunning and so devious, he kept outsmarting all those who were trying to find him. But in the end he was no match for the adversary Ken Follett put him up against.<br />I have read Mr. Follett before and he has never disappointed me. I look forward to reading more of his works.<br />If you like a book that keeps you on the edge of your seat and you don't want to put it down, you MUST read this one.

B000VNMMQG|4.0|Uplifting story of William Wilberforce's battle to abolish slavery in England in the late 18th/early 19th century. Well-acted film plays fast and loose with the facts for dramatic licence but this is only a slight quibble of an excellent film.
B0017XFBMG|5.0|I'm generally not one to gush on music except in rare cases like this when high expectations are met with an even grander result.  This box is full of some of the best Pogues you will ever hear.  How it wasn't released earlier on is beyond me, but it's here now and you must own it if you like the Pogues.<br /><br />The remastering on many of the cuts is spectacular.  You can tell this music isn't just enjoyed, it's loved.<br /><br />Phil Chevron's notes are well worth the read and give many insights into the madness that is The Pogues.<br /><br />This box set is well priced and worth twice as much.
B000FC10WU|4.0|I have been an Agatha Christie fan for years. Ms. Christie's  writing style & novels are fantastic as she is truly a master of the mystery genre.     \\"The Body in the Library\\" is a wonderful example of Ms. Christie's writing technique. The characters, the plot, and dialogue are all wonderfully developed in \\"The Body in the Library\\". And as with most Agatha Christie novels, I am always left guessing who the true killer is until it is revealed at the very end of the novel.
B001AD3NIM|5.0|With all of the artists from bygone days that have been releasing new material this year (Cyndi Lauper, Donna Summer, B-52's, REM - the list goes on), this newest album from Alanis Morissette has got to be the best release of them all.    Not since \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" have I been so enthralled by Alanis' music.  \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\" is absolutely fantastic.  The angst is still there, but more tempered, with several gorgeous ballads to even it all out.    If you purchase this album - by all means, get the Bonus Tracks edition.  The 5 extra songs on it are well worth the extra $1 it costs, and quite frankly are some of the best work on this newest album from Morissette.    I can honestly say that I love every song on this album, but by far \\"In Praise of the Vulnerable Man\\" has got to be my favorite - it's simply beautiful.    \\"Citizen of the Planet\\", \\"Straightjacket\\", \\"Versions of Violence\\", and \\"Moratorium\\" all harken back to that angst that so defined \\"Jagged Little Pill\\", yet all of these songs are so new and different you won't be dissappointed at all or get caught up in thinking that Alanis is just relying on that successful formula.    \\"Underneath\\" really sounds like it came off the \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album, so much so that it could easily slide right in (or Underneath so to speak) the songs off that album. But, it's a song that really shines on its own, and helps tie Alanis' current music to her unique style that she made so famous with her previous work.    \\"Not as We\\" just punches you right in the heart.  It's such an emotional song with lyrics that ring so true for anyone that has been through a breakup.    \\"Orchid\\" is one of the most beautiful songs on the Bonus Tracks edition.  Alanis can really sing a ballad with beauty and grace, which some may find hard to believe.  She has a few of them on her newest album, including \\"Torch\\", another heart wrenching song, \\"Tapes\\", \\"Madness\\", and \\"Limbo No More\\".  They are all stunning songs full of emotion andheartfelt sentiments.    \\"Giggling Again for No Reason\\", \\"Incomplete\\", \\"The Guy Who Leaves\\", and \\"On the Tequila\\" are all very unique and seem to step away just a bit for Alanis' extremely unique and recognizable style.  They are all welcome changes for this fact and once again, not a bad song in the bunch.    Honestly, there is not a single song on this album that I don't like.  Alanis has done a really good job of putting together a new album that is overflowing with many flavors - all quite deserving of a listen (or taste), over and over again.    I am overjoyed that she has put together such a wonderful collection of new songs.  I was having to rely on listening to my \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" album over, and over again to get my Morissette fix every once in a while, since I am not really fond of any of her work since that album.  Now, with \\"Flavors of Entanglement\\", I am set for a long time to come, as I'm sure this latest album of hers will provide me with many years of listening pleasure.
B000002552|4.0|Fascinating double-album of the legendary basement sessions with Dylan and The Band. One has the distinct feeling of eavesdropping on the creative process rather than listening to a fully realised album. Like a master sculptor's workshop - there are plenty of off-cuts \\"Please, Mrs Henry\\", \\"Apple Suckling Tree\\", works in progress \\"Katie's Been Gone\\", \\"Goin' to Acapulco\\" and the odd fully realised masterpiece \\"Tears of Rage\\", \\"This Wheel's on Fire\\".<br /><br />An absolute must have for all fans of Dylan and/or The Band.

B0013J30W2|2.0|I was watching this movie thinking to myself: So, this is what you would get if you combined The Matrix, Fight Club and Office Space?     A dorky accountant, Wesley, seems to be insignificant. He hates his overbearing boss, his dirt bag friend is cheating with his girlfriend, and he can't get any search results when he types his name in google. This all changes when he meets up with a sexy assassin of the Fraternity, Fox (Angelina Jolie). She informs him that he is being followed by the man who killed his father. From here, Wesley becomes introduced to the world of the Fraternity, led by Sloan (Morgan Freeman). The Fraternity's mission is to restore \\"order\\" to the world by taking out certain people (these people are chosen from a loom which prints names). Who are these orders coming from? Fate, of course. Wesley suddenly feels important, and now he has a mission in life: to destroy the man who killed his father. But, first, he needs training to become the perfect assassin. From here Wesley tries to carry out orders given to him by Sloan, but eventually there is a little twist of fate that Wesley is not expecting. While the twist was somewhat inventive, the rest left little to be desired.     There are so many problems with this movie it is hard to know where to start. First of all, the \\"good guy\\" protagonist is one of the least likable ones I've ever seen on the big screen. Not only is this guy a loser when he's a loser accountant, but he's also a loser when he's an assassin. And somehow he goes from being Supernerd to Rambo in the course of a short training program that makes Fight Club seem like Camp Disney. Our hero projects the mantra that unless you go around beating up everyone, or screaming profanity at your boss, or telling off your good-for-nothing friend or shooting curve ball bullets (with the help of your mind) that you are a no one or \\"have done nothing.\\" Even when it seems that the character is trying to follow his \\"destiny\\"  (which is to go after theman who killed his father), it seems unnecessary and pointless. Another annoyance was the over-the-top violence, such as the scenes where people are shot. (The director must have had a thing for this, as we see it forwards, backwards and in ultra-slo motion with blaring tunes.) Also, the characters aren't build up at all, being prototypes of a clichéd assassin family; they are as cardboard as those ones you see entering the movie theatre. The only moment when see an inkling of character development is when Jolie's character is telling her story to Wesley about her father; other than that, pretty much zero focus on anything worth substance. This film's shallowness seems to hide behind its stylized action and violence.     This is a movie that revels in blood, violence, slo-motion effects and physics-defying preposterousness.  And this isn't even to mention the ridiculous plot.     Other than a little bit of a twist at the end, I didn't find much to like in this movie. At the end of the movie, I just wanted to say \\"So what.\\"

B00005R62N|5.0|There's good cheese and bad cheese; at their best, Judas Priest was the former, and this live offering from 1978 in front of a crowd of adoring Japanese shows them at their very best. For those not familiar with the Metal Gods, Unleashed in the East is the best introduction. Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath may have created the framework for Anglo Saxon Heavy Music, but the Priest, by ditching the blues changes for baroque prog structures, adding a second guitar, and playing at blinding velocity, may lay claim to being the first true Metal band, progenitor of speed, thrash, power, and sadly, hair metal, the latter being weird because the lead singer was bald and proud of it. (Halford's willingness to opt for close cropped hair in the mid-'70's when all metal folk had to be hirsuit always seemed to me more courageous than his coming out of the closet years later...)Evidence of why they are not merely kitsch: their inspired choice of covers. JP lay waste to, of all things, Joan Baez's kiss-off to Dylan, \\"Diamonds and Rust,\\" and turn it into molten metal. Their version of Fleetwood Mac's \\"Green Manalishi\\" makes Peter Green's ode to a succubus into the purest Gothic horroshow imaginable, blood-curdling. This disc contains only the fastest and most relentless songs from their early albums, when they seemed to inhabit some sort of Lovecraftian dystopia and before they began writing the mindless MTV party anthems that put them in the Top 40. For pure onslaught, Motorhead was their only competition. Secret weapon: Rob Halford's banshee shriek, he gives Robert Plant a run for his money in the titanium-throated operatic male soprano department. I just found out that Judas Priest is touring with Motorhead this August and will be in my state -- this is one King Kong v. Godzilla show I am not going to pass up.
0446402389|3.0|Slow and tedious most of the time.  Basic story theme good and interesting - just hard reading.
038533348X|4.0|Enough zaniness and dark humor permeate Cat's Cradle to keep a reader entertained, but there's still a point to Vonnegut's odd comedy--the destruction and danger of nuclear-type weapons, the criticism of society and their motives, and the general stupidity of mankind. To say Vonnegut takes a pessimistic viewpoint might be an understatement, but at least he can have fun doing it. In many respects, I actually found Cat's Cradle to be a little more enjoyable than Slaughter House Five, which seemed to be a little darker in nature.     The story begins with Jonah studying and researching the late Felix Hoenikker, a renown scientist responsible for producing the atom bomb and a dangerous liquid substance called ice-nine. To do this, he interviews various people and colleagues of the late doctor, finding out, while Hoenikker had innocent intentions, he was careless with both his family and his inventions. In his quest, Jonah comes to identify Dr. Hoenikker's three children--Newt, Angela and Frank--a very odd group of kids. Angela is very tall and lanky and has to play the role of parent because of her father's neglect. Newt is a midget, who comes to find love with a midget Russian performer. And Frank leaves the family, disappears, and later emerges in San Lorenzo, being the supposed architect of San Lorenzo's \\"master plan.\\" Eventually Jonah and a group (including Angela and Newt) embark on a trip to San Lorenzo to see the island of San Lorenzo, it's population \\"all fiercely dedicated to the ideals of the Free World\\" (Jonah learns from the pamphlet on the plane).  The irony of much of what is discovered on this island is that the people's religion--Bokonon--is mostly based on lies (as it says in its introduction). From here, Jonah becomes adjusted to the people and their customs, meets the island's dictator, \\"Papa\\", hears more rumors about the mysterious Bokonon, falls in love with a goddess-like woman Mona, and becomes president of San Lorenzo (he learns from Frank that this is his ultimate destiny, or his \\"zah-mah-ki-bo\\"). Eventually, there is a major event that Jonah must deal with, and this happens at the book's conclusion. Wacky as it is, the plot seems to be just a vehicle to get across much of Vonnegut's satirical points about human existence.     Much of the fun of this book is the exceptional comic voice by Vonnegut. He can seemingly take the most serious issues, like religion, politics, nuclear threats, and turn them upside down. One bizarre part is when Julian Castle looks at Newt's \\"Cat's Cradle\\" painting (which Newt professes should hold a message for everyone), regards it as \\"garbage\\" and throws it out into the waterfall. A moment prior to this Jonah had been musing over the painting's meaning, and this act by Castle seems to fit right into the nonsensical mentality of the island. There is also the \\"last rites\\" scene with \\"Papa\\" and Jonah, where \\"Papa\\" leans over and whispers to Jonah to tell Bokonon that he is sorry he didn't kill him and his philosophy of lies.       If you can take all of the author's jabs in a light way then this will be an enjoyable read; if not, then you might want to pass, or at least sample the book before purchasing.  I wished I would have read this one before reading Slaughter House Five (as Cat's Cradle works better for an introduction to the author).
0767827791|5.0|I love this movie, it's one of my favorites.  I am a fan of William Holden.  He was handsome, charismatic, a great actor.  Known for his popular films, such as World of Suzie Wong, Love is a many splendored thing, Sabrina, Bridge on the river kwai, and others.  I loved him in this movie as Hal the drifter, who catches a freight to Kansas to see an old college friend of his, whose father owns the grain mill in town.  Hal ends up falling in love with Madge, his college friend's girlfriend, which breaks up the friendship.  I think the best part of the movie is when Hal and Madge dance to \\"Moonglow\\" at the picnic, and it seems like that is the moment when they first fall in love.  Hal has to run out of town and catch a freight train again,  because his ex-friend is furious, because he suspects that Madge and Hal have fallen for each other.  Madge's mom who doesn't believe in marrying for love, since the man she loved, Madge's father, left them after she had Madge's sister.  She wants Madge to marry Hal's friend, because the friend is a rich boy, and member of the country club.  She wants Madge to be treated like a queen, and live the good life.  She wants Madge to always be adored by everyone for her looks.  Madge is the prettiest girl at the picnic and wins the beauty contest there.  Madge just wants to be loved for who she is, not for the way she looks, and of course Hal is attracted to her looks at first, but loves her for who she is.  In reality though, it isn't realistic usually for people to fall deeply in love instantly. But if you love romance, Bill Holden, a beautifully made film, good acting, and a good cast,  you will love \\"Picnic.\\"  And if you love the song \\"Moonglow\\", you will definitely enjoy watching William Holden and Kim Novak dancing together to it.  The only question is will Hal and Madge end up together?  Will she marry Hal's rich ex-friend?  Will she go with Hal or follow him out of town to be with him, \\"the man she loves\\", or will she stay and makeher mother happy?  You will find the answer of course, if you buy \\"Picnic.\\"  I think this is a movie one will not regret purchasing, as long as you love old romantic films, William Holden, and of course, \\"Moonglow.\\"  This truly is one of my very favorite films.  Also I wrote a review on Marie Antoinette, which I also love.  I love most of William Holden's films, such as Love is a many splendored thing, World of Suzie Wong, and Sabrina. So check out these other films, if you haven't seen them already, I don't think you will be disappointed.  I believe you will love them as I do, and they will be your top favorite films too!

As long as the people watching it are old enough to understand that it is fiction and that they can't walk through subway walls and they aren't going to have there mail delivered by owls, or that it's in any way okay to have children living in the cupboard under the stairs, it's great fun.
0385247125|5.0|For all those people who choose to believe the crap that's written about Michael Jackson, I suggest you all take a look inside yourselves. This book Moonwalk is a a wonderful book giving Michael's point of view of his rise to fame, his family, and his relationships. This book was written in 1988, several years prior to the madness that surrounded him. I'm insulted that the people who are selling this book are actually selling it for 1 cent! That is ultimate disrespect for a person who has given us so much joy and great music for 40 years of his life. He deserves to be seen as a human being, not the freak that the media and the American public make him out to be! This other book that the so called critic is recommending \\"Be Careful Who You Love\\" is just another smear campaign. It's bad enough this man's life has been in shambles the past few years. But all the public wants to do is to continue to beat him into the ground until their's nothing left. Michael Jackson is simply a man who has tried all his life to help others. Now he's being crucified because of the lies of some very greedy people. Try reading all the facts before you continue to judge someone.
B001676320|5.0|I had a real good time with this blu-ray that features a great PQ (AVC coding) and amazing AQ (DTS-HD MA 5.1/2.0). I almost felt like \\"being there\\". The combined showcase from Chicago & EWF is very entertaining and enjoyable. You can't just sit down and watch; you will find yourself stand up and shake your body (like all the audience in the Greek Theatre)! I have been a big fan of EWF's and the band is simply amazing in the concert even without Maurice White. Philip Bailey is such a great musician with his great voice and covers M. White's spot very well. He also can play the kalimba as Mr. White does! V. White, who is co-leader and plays the bass, makes us smile and happy with his passionate gestures. As for Chicago, I have to admit I wished Peter Cetera had been there. They are still good but, to me, not enough without the former lead singer. Before I watched the concert, I had no idea what had made these two bands do a concert together. Now I know they have some connections: both of them are brass bands and EWF's \\"After the love has gone\\", which the both bands sing and play together, was co-written by Chicago's Bill Champlin.     Here's my conclusion: get this blu-ray and have a great time especially when you want \\"cheer-up\\" and dance!
0756404746|5.0|I can honestly say that this is my favorite book of all time. I'm a big fantasy nut, but this one beats all the rest down with an M1-A1. The book is long, yet so engrossing, it's a fast read (and this comes from a guy with dyslexia!). Note, it's not fast read because it's simple, but because it's just that good.  The only problem, is the ending. Basically, what you need to know is that this is a character retelling his life in three days, and, as the name implies, this is just the first day. This basically means you only get a third of the story. Trust me, after reading it, you'll be counting down the days until the next book's release (273 as of right now!).

061891868X|4.0|I jumped at this title when I saw it among my Amazon recommendations (Sometimes they do get these things right.) thinking to myself, \\"Ah, finally somebody out there (besides Feynman) has had the courage to state the obvious and actually write a book about it.\\"  And this Smolin does here in language I think most people with a basic science education can understand.  Good show Lee!<br /><br />But I do have a couple of somewhat minor problems with it.  The first problem is, as far as I'm concerned, Smolin IS stating what has always seemed obvious to me.  Indeed, ever since viewing the PBS special on String Theory and reading Brian Greene's book regarding it, I've been saying to myself:  \\"What a lot of twaddle!  This isn't science.  It's more like some terribly bad mixture of mathematics and philosophy, making for bad theories in both fields.\\"  Actually, Smolin states as much here:<br /><br />\\"Nevertheless, it seems to me that any fair-minded person not irrationally committed to a belief in string theory would see this situation clearly.  A theory has failed to make any predictions by which it can be tested, and some of its proponents, rather than admitting that, are seeking to change the rules so that their theory will not need to pass the usual tests we impose on scientific ideas.\\" P.170<br /><br />Exactly!  It truly baffled me that PBS would spend all this money on what was obviously a scientific farce.  One might as well watch a rerun of Jeeves and Wooster.  It's much more entertaining and Wodehouse, unlike Greene et al., knows himself to be a farceur.  Anyway, the minor problem is that for me the above quote is all that need be really said about it (One might throw Feynman's in for good measure.).  A whole book would seem to be unnecessary.  But, obviously, there are scads of others who don't see that what Charlie Rose in his interview with Greene rhapsodized about as \\"The Theory of Everything\\" is not even a Theory of Nothing.  It's not even a theory.<br /><br />But Smolin did write this book, which brings me to my second problem here.  Smolin is what I suppose I'll call an Einsteinian, but with a twist (no String Theory pun intended).  As another reviewer has pointed out, this book has two parts.  The first debunks String Theory.  The second rails against \\"group think\\" and the state of current academia, in the States, anyway - All good and well, so far - But the last chapters are a bit odd for a book about physics, methinks.  Here, Smolin reveals himself to be, for lack of a better word, a Romantic.  He loves citing examples of people whom he calls \\"seers\\" rather than \\"craftsmen\\", of which Einstein is the best exemplar.  People who hole themselves up alone and work things out based on some mystical insight.  In particular, he cites one particular physicist who, during a hike in the mountains, had a vision that \\"time is unreal\\" and has spent the rest of his life working things out to prove that this is so.  Exactly what it would mean for time to be unreal he does not elucidate.<br /><br />This brings to mind Bertrand Russell's famous essay, \\"Mysticism and Logic\\" where he notes that the unreality of time is key to almost all mystical systems and philosophies.  It is not confined to physicists; indeed, it is more associated with poets.  Avers Yeats:<br /><br />\\"For one moment<br />While on that grey stone I sat<br />I knew the One is animate<br />Mankind inanimate phantasy.\\"<br /><br />Russell, in his essay, concurs with Smolin, as I understand Smolin anyway; pointing out that almost all great ideas start out with some sort of mystical insight of this sort.  But the way the book concludes, citing all these lone anchorite physicists, toiling away in their cottages and flats, is just a tad odd for a book debunking a notion because it's unfalsifiable and lacks empirical verification.  Smolin seems to concur with Thoreau here, \\"No one ever followed his genius until it misled him.\\"<br /><br />To sum up, Smolin, in these latter chapters, seems to be a sort of Thomas Carlyle of 21st Century physics.  He's an admirer of the Great Man/Great Idea interpretation of the history of science.  This view certainly has its attractions.  And, certainly, we associate all scientific revolutions with particular names: Galileo, Kepler, Newton, Maxwell, Einstein, Feynman etc. I suppose they all qualify as \\"seers\\" in Smolin's view.  Still, it doesn't quite square with the empirical approach, and this view of history in general has peculiar consequences.  I can't get out of my mind the image of Goring reading a German translation of Carlyle's account of Frederick the Great to the Fuhrer as the Soviets close in on Berlin.<br /><br />True story.'s an admirer of the Great Man/Great Idea interpretation of the history of science.

006085880X|5.0|I could not put this book down! It was one of those books that you always want to know what's going to happen next, even when it's 1 in the morning and you know you really have to get to bed but you keep telling yourself that \\"just a few more pages won't hurt\\".<br /><br />I loved how Picoult took the story back and forth from past and present.  Just when you think she'll complete the entire story of the past it jumps back the present, but that keeps you on your feet. It's great!<br /><br />I've been recommending this book to all of my friends because it's definitely worth reading. Not a complicated read that will take long, but it's worth reading!
B000N4SHPS|4.0|Growing up, the classic series of Rocky boxing films use to be a piece of Americana. After a sixteen year sabbatical from Rocky V in 1990, the latest film, Rocky Balboa, was released last Christmas to theatres. Rocky Balboa is played by Sylvester Stallone, and the film takes place well over a decade since Rocky V and a few years after Rocky's wife, Adrian passes away.     Rocky is having trouble living life after boxing; he cannot connect with his son, and is still coming to terms that his wife is gone. That all changes when ESPN has a computer generated fight predicting Rocky Balboa defeating the current reigning champ, Mason \\"The Line\\" Dixon (played by retired boxer, Antonio Tarver). This motivates Rocky to get back to the ring and make a George Foreman-esque comeback for the ages.    Sylvester Stallone is a natural as Rocky Balboa. He plays the role as perfectly as he did decades ago. The storytelling is done remarkably well compared to previous Rocky movies. Stallone directed this too, and he did a wonderful job with the narrative transitioning Rocky on the verge of a nervous breakdown to coming around by finding new friends and family to making his comeback to the ring. Admittedly, it is pretty formula, but if you have seen past Rocky films than you know they are not known for breaking new grounds, but more on delivering feel good moments. Rocky Balboa accomplishes this in spades.      The DVD itself is nicely put together. The film transferred very smoothly and looks great even on my standard definition television. I was expecting a double disc special edition release, but Rocky Balboa has basic packaging, and a decent offering of extras. The three documentaries provide an insightful look behind the scenes of the film, and on the choreography of the fights. There are also some interesting deleted scenes that help explain some miniscule gaps in the film, and an alternate, more feel good ending. Finally Sly himself provides commentary for the film.      If you're a fan of sports films, or have seen any of the older Rocky flicks than you got to get Rocky Balboa on DVD. I got a feeling this one may see a special edition release sometime down the road, but it still has a good amount of extra features to make it worth your while.   [[ASIN:B000N4SHPS Rocky Balboa]]

B000003TA4|5.0|Nevermind is a fascinating, strange, grumpy old creature.  If you think that means I think it sounds dated, you're wrong.  I KNOW Nevermind sounds dated, don't be fooled.  Some just think that   \\"It aint dated, man.  It's just classic, it's just influential!  Don't ask questions.\\"  That's absolutely fine and appropriate. But I KNOW it sounds dated, .  Why does this matter.    Some say \\"well, duh, it's narrow, it's un-spectacular.  It's too loud, it has nothing to say. They're Not even musicians.\\"  I think their right, but I also think that such people enjoy their favorite music like many enjoy fallatio; extremely customer-biased, with not much to say but witha  whole lot of work to be done.  But this band is a punk group.   However, the latter group of idiots is totally right and first group is wrong :-(  But, obviously, the latter group is the real jerk.  Nevermind is the first album I've heard whose dated sound is  a reflection on its listeners rather than itself.  I say whose, because the album is such a fun-loving punk rock mentality.  It matched the sentiment of society that was done with nonsense-music.  And  in spite of it's affinity to (not for) nimrods as well as its inaccessibility to ( and for ) anal musical bores-it makes fools of those who hate it, and makes villains out of those who can't explain it...it stands on its own and watches the debate boil over time, smiling bitterly.        The record is a born punk, a cranky older middle-aged man in album years.  Obviously the punk's brain is Cobain and obviously its limbs are Noveselic, Grohl as well as Cobain.  People say Nirvana is terrible because they're overrated and are being called the new Beatles. It didn't want to move a million or re-define the counterculture, but it did.  And this is what dates it so cruelly just like Sgt. Pepper-it's true-also has an expiration date ranging in or around the mid 1960's.  It hasn't aged gracefully into a new era, because punk rock is a hell of a think to fitinto any sort of mainstream filter.  Yes, It's a guitar-driven record that corals much of its songwriting chops from someone who doesn't ably blow away yesteryears guitar-heroes.  And yet, he doesn't want to.      Kurt Cobain was a snot-nosed punk who would much rather blow such people off in favor of outdoing  70's icons ultimately more respected then his -extremely-talented contemporaries like Soundgarden and  Alice and Chains.  This is the first time I've reviewed this album, but I feel it's duly worth noting that Nevermind sounding dated is less a reflection on the album itself and more a reflection on the listeners.  It perfectly connects punk rock senselesness with pop sensibility.  And for some inane reason this equation equals reality, like a new world discovered on the other side of the black hole.   Nevermind, don't be fooled, is a masterpiece; the kind that judge you more than it tries to impress you.  Smells like Teen Spirit, Lithium, and especially speedier works like Territorial Pissings and Breed are catchy, but not flashy, two very different things.  I'm not afraid to say it, Nevermind is frustrating to understand.  Scathing lyrical attacks on a reuniting of old friends/enemies a la \\"Come as you Are\\" hint at a terrifingly huanting and blurred core beneath the fantastically poppy drums.  The beautifuly scarce solo is basically the ghost that crashes the part.  If it was any more techinically proficient or any less, the song would be cut down.  This is the sum of the albums parts, just enough to fool, terrify, and label you better than you can label it.
B0014QNGA0|4.0|If anything, this recital shows Florez to be in even better voice than in his last album \\"Voce d'Italia: Arias for Rubini\\" (see my review). Despite the beauty of Florez' singing there, a few top notes showed signs of strain; here, the voice is more easily produced, sweeter and more characterful than ever before. For me, the plum item is his newly minted account off that old warhorse \\"Una furtive lagrima\\"; he sings with power and delicacy, managing some heart-stopping diminuendi and maintaining seamless legato. The Italian version of Florez' calling card aria with the nine high C's is as thrilling as ever and the more interesting for being less frequently heard. The choice of repertoire is judicious: a preponderance of Donizetti but a very varied selection of his arias, then two excerpts from Rossini and one by Bellini ; five are solo arias and the other five are each with a different \\"guest artist\\". I cannot, in all honesty, say that I am as impressed by any of those five other singers as I am by Florez himself; Netrebko sounds very like Freni at the beginning of her \\"Puritani\\" duet but the voice lacks the older artist's delicacy and nuance - fine singer though she is. The Polish baritone Kwiecien and Patrizia Ciofi are both fine, if nothing special; Ciofi's attractively smoky, slightly breathy voice combines well with Florez in the romantic duet from \\"Linda di Chamonix\\", and Kwiecien sings ably but ordinarily, with a rather lumpen sound and a wide vibrato.  I positively disliked Daniella Barcellona's rather clumsy, laboured singing as the Marchesa Melibea in the duet from \\"Il Viaggio a Reims\\" - her voice really does not match his. Placido Domingo, in the \\"bonus aria\\" from Rossini's \\"Otello\\" proves that, despite a little straining, his voice is a miracle of preservation.  Perhaps inviting distinguished guest artists is a confirmation of Florez' standing in the operatic world today and perhaps Decca wished to avoid the charge of monotony which a whole disc of one beautiful, but intense tenor voice can provoke, but the fact remains that the raison d'etre of this recital is Florez himself, and the solo items are the best things on this CD.<br /><br />The bonus DVD has a not very interesting talk by Florez about bel canto in general, his fellow singers, and the specific repertoire he has chosen to sing on this disc, then two excerpts from RAI and Zurich productions - the former being, of course, THAT aria - this time in French, the second being, rather disappointingly, only the recitative before the big romantic aria \\"Cerchero lontana terra\\", not the aria itself. However, rather confusingly, the cover states that we are to have the aria, too -but it doesn't feature on my copy! (I would be interested to know if other purchasers' DVD's have the same flaw - or maybe it's just my copy. I don't think so, as the aria is not mentioned on the menu.) The trailers for the DVD's are quite good for giving a flavour of their quality, giving quite extended snippets, but it's the recital I wanted, not the extra fripperies.utiful, but intense tenor voice can provoke, but the fact remains that the raison d'etre of this recital is Florez himself, and the solo items are the best things on this CD.

B0002IQNAG|5.0|I had been waiting for this set many a year.  I remember it was said online (around 1999) that Anchor Bay was pulling together all known cuts of Dawn to form the most complete version ever.  While that doesn't happen here, there's very darn little you won't get.    First off, the transfers.  They look good, the colors are bright and vibrant.    Sound: It gets an \\"A\\" from me.  I don't have a 5.1, so take that into consideration, but it still sounds good to me.  You get the theatrical version released earlier as a single disc, then the \\"director's cut\\" that had been released a few years back, the \\"Argento cut\\" AKA European edition AND Roy Frumkes' Document of the Dead.  Special features abound, interviews, multiple commentaries (one per movie, just to clarify) and featurettes.  The only thing I really found missing was Mr. Frumkes' commentary on Document, but that's pretty minor (and probably would have raised the price).  All in all, pretty much everything a Dawn fan would need or want.

B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This is the kind of Coldplay sound I've been waiting to hear.  I'm a Coldplay fan, and through their first 3 albums I could not help but be a little frustrated with each release.  While I thoroughly enjoy all of their work, they were always a band I felt could be so much more.  The songwriting and musical talent were obviously there, but there was a wall that they weren't busting through even though they had the necessary tools to do so.  For all the accolades [[ASIN:B00004U9MS Parachutes]], [[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]], and [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] recieved, there were tracks on each that seemed to be dull fillers that made it onto the album because they had that \\"Coldplay Sound.\\"      This album has no dull spots.  This is what happens when a band experiments successfully.  This is what happens when a band tweaks their sound for the better.  This is what happened when Coldplay busted through their wall.

I keep waiting for it to be upgraded so I can buy it and hear it as it deserves to be heard.

1590270126|4.0|A Christmas Carol / 1-59027-012-6    I adore this edition: a crisp, clean hardcover binding with a lovely burgundy cover. \\"A Christmas Carol\\" is a well-known classic, and has been remade into dozens of movie and television versions. The well-known story is that of a bitter man, taken back through time to examine the consequences of his materialistic life. Only in retrospect does he realize how truly lonely and miserable he is, but he is brought back to the present on Christmas morning with the beautiful realization that it is never too late to start fresh. Here Dickens shows his true talent as a writer, and this delightful tale is meaningful for adults and children alike.     ~ Ana Mardoll
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost literally has everything, from suspense to humor to drama to science fiction to romance to DEEP characterizations of all of the lead cast. But the absolute best attribute to LOST for DVD buyers is its AMAZING re-watch value. After watching through the first four seasons of LOST, you can go right back to the first episode and start watching again and pick up so many clues and pieces you NEVER picked up on the first viewing...    Season Four does not disappoint. In my opinion, this season was amazingly tight. In spite of fewer episodes, the episodes that exist pack more of a punch. Personal favorites of this season include: The Constant, Ji Yeon, and the ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE The Shape of Things to Come. Rounding the season is a fabulous three part finale There's No Place Like Home.    In spite of a writers strike, the team on LOST held their act together, kept the pace tight, and drove the story toward the final two seasons (5 & 6) in a story that has a definite beginning, middle and end.

B000002GK1|4.0|It doesnt get much better than Chris Cornell for rock singers, and Kim thayil/Matt Cameron are pretty much virtuosos.  This album is the first step in the right direction towards Soundgarden becoming one of the most formidable rock bands ever created.  Their previous albums are pretty good examples of that true \\"grungy\\" slow churning metal sound, but only a few songs (Hands All Over, Flower) on those records stand the test of time for me personally.  This album has some great ones though.  It starts off really strong, but loses steam a little towards then end.  My personal favorite tracks are \\"Rusty Cage\\", \\"Outshined\\", \\"Jesus Christ Pose\\" \\"Slaves and Bulldozers\\" and \\"Searching with My Good Eye Closed\\".<br /><br />But Superunknown is still the flawless album u want to get if your just getting into Soundgarden, then perhaps this or Down on the Upside.  But Badmotorfinger is still great and is a bridge for that classic \\"Grunge\\"  sound to Soundgarden's true diverse musical identity.  But as always, the vocals are INSANE.
0553381687|5.0|I've had people recommending this book to me for a while.  Good people, people I trust.  I don't know why it took me so long to get started.  The first few chapters started slowly and it took me a while to get into the book, but once I did, wow!<br /><br />The characters are well-designed and genuinely interesting.  There are enough of them that some may be seen as derivative, but Martin keeps them fresh and unique.  The plot is intricate and textured and has plenty of twists and turns to keep you flipping the pages.<br /><br />I strongly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the fantasy setting.  Don't wait like I did!
0061537934|4.0|What do you call a first person story when it is told through the eyes of a dog? In this case fun, intriguing, and touching.    A sweet little parable with sad and hilarious moments. And somehow the dog meets car racing metaphors do work.
B0017MO10U|5.0|Watched the movie. I enjoyed it very much. It's like the old time Stargate. Grandfather paradox and Goa'uld. I wished the movie was longer. I pre-ordered one for my collection.
0689853491|4.0|This is apparently a classic camp song - not one I ever heard growing up, though.    My nieces request this book a *minimum* of once a week (and usually, once they request it, they want me to read it over and over again to boot!), and we love it every time. Then they often want me to help them reenact the story - I'll be the bear, then they'll be the bear, then the teddy bear will be the bear....    If you're paying attention as you read it, you can even see the various members of the family change their mood as the story goes on and they get hit with various forms of minor disasters.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I haven't finished watching John Adams but it is frightening how close we came to losing the Revolutionary War.     The acting is superb and the story very well told.    I highly recommend it.
067088278X|4.0|This is a good book of a few rhyming couplets featuring fairy tale and nursery rhyme characters, perfect length to catch the attention of a young child - and enough detail in the pictures to keep the attention of an older one!    For those people who are concerned about this sort of thing, there are some references to \\"the Wicked Witch\\" (she's not shown being any more wicked than anybody else, and she eats pie with her neighbors at the end. Wicked is just her name, I guess) in the book, and there are also a few images of the three bears being very careless with guns while hunting. I don't find that this hampers our enjoyment of this book, but if these are sensitive topics for your family, you may want to check the book out of the library before committing to a purchase.
B0018QCXGY|2.0|What a shame.  Great story. Good acting.  Lousy camera work!  The CONSTANT shaky camera with no let up makes for a NOT AS MUCH FUN AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN experience.  Too bad.
067144901X|4.0|This is one of those \\"what do farm animals say\\" books, except that some of the animals are a bit... weird (rhinoceroses? Singing pigs?), so Hilarity Ensues.    This is, like many of Boynton's works, a very short book, perfect for babies and for toddlers with a low attention span. Unfortunately, the short length means that your kid will more-or-less outgrow it by pre-k (except as an occasional filler), but that's the price of having a book your baby will sit through.
0786948523|5.0|Well I am very dissappointed in the new 4E, it plays more like a video game. But the art in this book is A-1. I love the additionon Minions, they add a cool feel to the game. The Monsters are well detailed but seem to lack some luster in ability since everything has to fit into the new 4E framework.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Very realalistic with clear history of the times.  Not much has been written about Adams, so this gave information rarely seen in history books.  Wonderful to watch.  Great acting.
B0018AK9RA|4.0|When I heard about this album and its title, I honestly was really turned off!  After all, concept album idea has been used so many times in the past with at best mixed results.  Some work such as Dio's \\"Magica\\" or Savatage's \\"Dead Winter Dead\\" contains some good material but was quite unsuccessful, which I think was partly related to the \\"concept album\\" idea.  The second problem I have is with the album's title. What an overused heavy metal cliche!!! It is as un-original as Ashley Simpson's record \\"L.O.V.E.\\".  The title is slightly better \\"Kings of Metal\\", \\"Fists of Fire\\" \\"Evil Sensation\\" or \\"Gates of Hell.\\"  I can think of millions of such stupid heavy metal titles as I am obviously not an artist!    Despite all that, after the first listen to \\"Nostradamus\\", the music on this disk simply blew me away!!! What an amazing work.  Rob Halford's voice is at his best. Just like good wine, his singing gets better with time.  The prime example of that is on the song \\"Death\\" or \\"Nostradamus\\" where he display an amazing range.  The lyrics here are also above the group's average \\"we are metal gods and will party till we die\\" crap that infect otherwise great albums such as \\"British Steel\\" or \\"Defenders of Faith.\\" The guitarists Glen Tipton and KK Downing put out some of the most amazing riffs, harmonized dual melodies, shredding solos, and most solid musicianship ever recorded by Judas Priest.  You can definitely appreciate here how versatile and mature they have grown to be over the years, both musically and techinically.  In fact, in addition to embracing more modern approach to metal guitar, the album shows them intertwining neo-classical style, thrash metal, hard rock, progressive and blues influences with the signature Judas Priest sound.  My favorite guitar interludes are in the title cut and the song \\"Persecution\\", where they trade arpegiated melodies at killer speeds.  Generally speaking, the music on this record can be best described as progressive, neo-classical, melodic heavy metal with extended musical interludes, complex structures, guitar harmonies, and orchestrations.  I don't care for the reviewers who bash this work on the account of use of synthesizers.  I would like to remind them that synthesizer is a \\"musical instrument\\" if used properly and it is utilized very well on this album.  Some people are enslaved by one or two concepts that in their minds defines \\"true metal.\\" They are therefore unable to accept anything different.  Those, who like being surprised and are able to think/hear outside of the \\"box\\" will find that \\"Nostradamus\\" is a truly amazing masterpiece that builds on over 35 years of experience that this band has and shows the group of talented musicians, who continue to mature and challenge themselves with new concepts instead of re-hashing old ideas.  After all, how many \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\" or \\"Painkillers\\" can there be. I think that these albums are great because they are not copied note for note on the subsequent releases as some so called \\"big fans\\" would love to hear. That makes these records truly unique and memorable.  Overall, I highly recommend \\"Nostradamus\\" to anyone with an open mind and love for well written and well recorded MUSIC.    I have been listening to Judas Priest for the last 25 years and have to admit that they have never disappointed me.  I truly enjoyed every single album they released, which till today surprises me with great songwriting and new, fresh ideas at a time of release.  Without exception, they have not made one record that would disappoint or try to imitate their previous work!!!  I give this work 4 stars instead of 5 because of stupid title and a \\"concept album\\" cliche.  Aside from that, music on the record is truly outstanding as the band has created some of the strongest work they ever recorded. In my mind this is one of the best albums of 2008.  Keep up the good work boys!!! You have bought my soul!!!  I am already waiting for the nest amazing release from you.  Heavy metal is well and will never die ;-)
B000007638|4.0|I wanted to see this tour so bad.  Being only 10, I could not go.  I listend to this album so much.  I just gave it a listen after a long time, and it stands up to time.  If you are a Paul McCartney fan, this is a must to own.
B0002XL35G|4.0|It has been almost 25 years since this film won the Cannes Film Festival prize.  You know this film was made a while ago becuase in one scene we see one of the characters smoking while on the air flight from California to Texas.  It is a story of a man who has been missing for four years.  He has been wondering thru Texas until his brother was notified about his wheeabouts.  It is a reluctant gathering between the two brothers particularly once it becomes obvious that the missing brother has 8-year old child that has been cared for by his aunt and uncle for the last four years.  Emotions, family ties, future are all at stake.  There is a mystery about marriage break up of the older brother and almost simultaneous disapperance between himself and his wife.  As story slowly unforld we learn about strong and passionate love between two people that brought them both destruction and separated them from their little boy. It is also a story about the things that we most strongly imagine that become frightening reality.  Can it be that our thought and actions are so powerful that things we fear the most can become reality?  Well this film certainly shows that is quite possible.  As Travis (main character) is found by accident, the only way he can give his family a second chance is if he disappers again.  Because his love for Jane, his wife, is still strong, but he knows well by now that it has destructive powers to it. Emotionally charged movie that requires certain sense of maturity from its audiences.  Definitely an acquired taste.  Nastassja Kinski is so young and beautiful!
B000002UAI|5.0|This starts out with \\"No Reply\\", a barn burner of a sweet song.  A great version of Buddy Holly's \\"Words of Love\\".  Who can forget \\"Babys In Black\\".  The album is heavy on cover songs, which always had me wondering why when The Beatles were the best songwriters then and have not yet been matched.
B0019MU6HU|5.0|I have been in love with Nikki Sixx since I was a kid.  This is a great book.  Love how he opened himself up in it and let you see the real Nikki.  How he was and how he overcome his addiction.

If you are looking for a fashionable, faddy, flashy Seth-Godin-type mantra to chant, you will be vastly disappointed and fantastically bored.    To those who are serious students of business and it's execution and are willing to do what it takes to be leaders, this is one of probably 3-5 books on the required reading list.

B00005ASOC|5.0|Finding Forrester (2000)<br /><br />Sean Connery is William Forrester, a brilliant novelist who published one book and then stopped publishing. Newcomer Rob Brown is Jamal Wallace. He is a black kid, or man of 16 years, living in the Bronx. He lives for basketball, but is a voracious reader, and he writes in journals. He keeps them in his backpack. He thinks he is a basketball player, but he was born to be a writer.<br /><br />On a dare, he is supposed to sneak into some old man's apartment, and steal something. He roams the house and takes a knife. He's about to leave when startled, he leaves his backpack behind. When he later recovers it, the writings in his journals have been red penciled. So begins an unlikely friendship. Or perhaps more of a student to teacher relationship.<br /><br />Meanwhile, when he excels on his test scores, he is offered a scholarship at the top prep school. It doesn't hurt that he is good at basketball, either. F. Murray Abraham is Prof. Robert Crawford. He is a bitter failed writer himself. He doubts that a basketball player from the Bronx can write so well, and he accuses him of plagerism.<br /><br />To further complicate things, Anna Paquin is Claire Spence, the daughter of a prominent faculty member. There is a lot of chemistry, biology, and physics, going on between them, if you solve my equation.<br /><br />Busta Rhymes is Terrell Wallace, Jamal's brother, who dreams of rap glory, but works in a parking lot. He is keeping it real.<br /><br />Sean Connery as Forrester is fabulous, always giving sage advice at unexpected times. Like this:<br /><br />Forrester: The key to a woman's heart is an unexpected gift at an unexpected time.<br /><br />Besides advice, the best thing Forrester does is encourage Jamal to write. He is like an athletic coach in his approach:<br /><br />Forrester: Punch the keys, for God's sake!<br /><br />I read somewhere that writing is the hardest thing to show in a movie, because it's not very dramatic to look at people typing. This movie breaks that rule, and gets away with it. It is the best type of typing scene since David Bowie danced on a giant typewriter in Absolute Beginners. And Forrester still with the pearls of wisdom teeth flowing:<br /><br />Forrester: No thinking - that comes later. You must write your first draft with your heart. You rewrite with your head. The first key to writing is... to write, not to think!<br /><br />There is a bit on Saturday Night Live with Will Ferrell as Alex Trebec, suffering through Celebrity Jeopardy, where the questions are dumbed down to the point that actors, not squirmy and obsessive fact nerds, can get them. Sean Connery is always depicted as a total bufoon. It was a recurring bit, and it always featured a parody of Sean Connery, who was always the most severly stupid contestant of a slew of Celebrity Jeopardy numbskulls. There is a scene where Forrester and Jamal are watching Jeopardy:<br /><br />Jamal: I'll take poor assumptions for $800, Alex.<br /><br />Such sweet, sweet, irony.<br /><br />Sean Connery gave a stellar performance. Wise, sage, but also an agoraphobic curmudgeon subject to the frailties of the flesh.<br /><br />Rob Brown more than kept pace with the seasoned pros. He was believable and authentic as a kid from the Bronx, on the basketball court, but he was just as believable in the classroom, as a literary enfante terrible.<br /><br />F. Murray Abraham was most excellent in his portrayal of Jamal's nemesis, Prof. Robert Crawford. Bitter and disappointed about his failure of a novel, he is jealous of Jamal's talent, and accuses him of plagarism. He is like Mozart's Saleri, a man of lesser talent who yearns to bring the angel Gabriel down. A man consumed with envy. I last saw him in Might Apphrodite, a Woody Allen film, and he was good there, too.<br /><br />Anna Paquin turns in her usual fantastic job as Claire Spence. There is an unspoken romance and unmistakable attraction, but nothing is ever acted on. Somehow, all the more tantalizing, but also a loose end that should have, could have, been sewn up.<br /><br />The music was fantastic as well. Lots of first rate Miles Davis music compliments Finding Forrester. It's a generous sampling of Davis's early 1970s work with side helpings of Ornette Coleman and guitarist Bill Frisell. With the help of Ron Carter, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, and Tony Williams, Miles Davis molded his second \\"classic\\" quintet into a earthshaking concoction of fonk and ruck far beyond the confines of the farthest reaches of fusion. Both \\"Recollections\\" and \\"Lonely Fire\\" are from Miles' Bitches Brew sessions and offer an atmospheric cocoon of cathedral ambience. This combined with Davis's polyrhythmic funk--\\"Black Satin\\" from On the Corner--Ornette Coleman's alto sax--and Bill Frisell & Co's artful guitar noodlings make for a pleasant soundtrack indeed.<br /><br />SONG LIST OF THE SOUNDTRACK<br /><br />1.

B000GIXE4K|4.0|Pretty much the best Nightwish live effort thus far, easily outstripping the Over the Hills...collection in terms of performance, quantity and the actual excellence of the songs. The set list cherry picks from the earlier albums and mainly centres on the more communicative numbers such as The Kinslayer and Wishmaster and welds these rockers with a bevy of tunes from Century Child and, of course, the excellent Once album.<br /><br />The pacing of the music is very good, only on a few occasions does one start to lose focus as too many mellow numbers line up after one another. But one of the great aspects of this double disc live album is the lively delivery of the numbers, the professionalism with which the band operate and that is really surprising given how tenuous the inter personal relationships were at the time.<br /><br />The production is good here, the sound very clear. The booklet has few snippets of info, merely a collage of live shots from the gig. However given Nightwish always include lyrics with their studio albums this isn't a major problem. Of course we all know this is a band heavily dependant on mini disc but that shouldn't preclude applauding the musical skills on display, Nightwish growing into the sort of band that could realise their earlier potential. And one has to assume that there can't have been too many overdubs...well not of Tarjas vox at least given the parting of the ways after this gig.<br /><br />Personally I find this a very good album, the sort of live album that actually improves some of the songs and this is particularly welcome in regards to some of the earlier tracks sent forth here as the 2006 version of Nightwish were a much more majestic beast than the band that recorded some of these tunes way back when. And The Phantom Of The Opera - seriously, this thing was meant to be done by a metal band like Nightwish. And when you throw in the focussed rockers from Once into the mix juxtaposed with tunes like Ever Dream....the release just works.<br /><br />Pretty much an obligatory purchase for the hordes of Nightwish fans out there and really not a bad introduction to the band for the uninitiated though I'd also heartily recommend buying this gig in the DVD format which is an excellent release and probably an even better introduction to this band as the visuals definitely add a theatrical element to proceedings even given Tarja being noted for her somewhat stilted crowd interaction. A highly recommended buy.y much an obligatory purchase for the hordes of Nightwish fans out there and really not a bad introduction to the band for the uninitiated though I'd also heartily recommend buying this gig in the DVD format which is an excellent release and probably an even better introduction to this band as the visuals definitely add a theatrical element to proceedings even given Tarja being noted for her somewhat stilted crowd interaction.

B0000YB7Z8|4.0|Good to see this has been remastered and given a proper reissue.<br /><br />I actually have the original one-disc release of this CD, which I originally got to replace my LP. On that edition, not only were a few songs dropped to keep it down to one disc (an all-too-common practice back in the day), but the edits were *utterly* artless. There are literally jarring jump cuts between some of the tracks.<br /><br />I hope it was also remixed so that the double-tracking Anderson did with his vocals is a little less obvious. I mean, just how did he manage to sing harmony AND lead at the same time in concert? And hey, while I'm at it, did they restore Anderson's naughty words during his witty repartee? Mine were actually bleeped. BLEEPED! HAH!<br /><br />But I digress. If you are a Tull fan, of course you need this release... Probably already have it... and are reading this review to find something to take issue with.<br /><br />If you are a new Tull fan, you should have this set, as opposed to any of the countless budget comps out there. It really is a classic lineup and a representative sample of their classic music.<br /><br />Casual Tull fans, however, will not find much here in the minor live variations to recommend above the studio efforts (sit down, Tullhead, I'm talking to the casual fan). You'd probably be happier with \\"Living In The Past.\\"<br /><br />I consider myself a Tull fan -- but apparently not a rabid one -- Since I myself am still trying to decide whether I should bother to shell out for a THIRD TIME for this release. Maybe I'll wait for a 24-carat gold edition with extra tracks and a bonus limited edition weather balloon.
B00005A0N5|3.0|This album comes out of the blocks with two absolutely charming and brilliant songs. Stargazers and Gethsemane were on heavy rotation at my place in the months after I bought this album I can tell you. Really, if your uninitiated in the ways of Nightwish I'd have to recommend you download MP3's of those two songs as they are very much intelligent songs both musically and lyrically and truly show the depth of thinking in this bands creative engine room.<br /><br />As the album unfolds we get other songs that while not in the same league are also interesting in setting out the bands stall such as The Pharaoh Sails to Orion and the single Sleeping Sun. The whole thing is nicely produced and all the players slot into their places and get their respective jobs done. The booklet includes all the lyrics and the cover artwork also gives you a good idea of what the band is all about.<br /><br />All up I'd wholeheartedly recommend this album to anyone who heard Once and wants to explore the back catalogue, just don't expect the same kill factor here as on this album the band were only progressing to the orchestral metal monster they'd later become. And admittedly nowadays it virtually never graces my stereo given that when I want to listen to this band, this ain't the album I reach for. It is a touch twee, naive and Tarja is singing so high this disc will always be a bit of an acquired taste. But as one of the fore runners and front runners of the genre Nightwish had something goin' one almost from the word go.
B001ANE3EA|5.0|The twelve track that we had appreciate one year ago more six extraordinary bonus tracks. ''If I Never See Your Face Again'' featuring Rihanna is an explosive mix and tracks like ''Story'' and ''Losing My Mind'' are simply beautiful.  And what say about the DVD? Songs from ''Songs About Jane'' mixed with the new songs from ''It Won't Be Soon Before Long'' result : an incredible show! The live versions of ''The Sun'' and ''Sweetest Goodbye'' are great, and the live version of ''Little Of Your Time'' will make you dance around with his rhythm.
B00024BHTC|4.0|So close to five stars I'm fully expecting negative votes for this review from rabid Nightwish fanatics and I can fully understand that. But I stand by my four stars because there is some filler here and some parts that make you squirm. The former is represented by Higher Than Hope and White Night Fantasy - songs I've heard a number of times and can remember nothing of. The latter would be represented by Creek Marys Blood. I mean, I don't mind a bit of world music from time to time but the idea of a Finnish orchestral hard rock/metal band doing the whole `trail of tears' paean to the plight of North American Indian cultures is a bridge too far for me.<br /><br />But it would be churlish to dwell overmuch on the negative because on this album there is some truly outstanding positives. The band have at last learned to create succinct blasts of metal - Planet Hell being visceral and possessing brilliant male/female counterpoint vocals. The band have also learned to do the same with songs solely with Tarja firing away such as the first two songs which let's face could pretty much strip paint at 100 yards such is their musical and emotional fury, Tarja really maturing in her ability to vocalise emotion and giving a more rounded performance. Whatever her overall contribution may or may not of been (for more on the subject read the book Once Upon A Nightwish) in terms of her vocal performance she is spot on here. And finally all the parts of Nightwish are tuned into perfect synchronicity with one another meaning full use can be made of the excellent musical nous of the band members and their special weapon - Tarjas voice - can be given the musical vehicle it needs to really bring things into focus.<br /><br />An album blessed with good production, another booklet with all the lyrics and also blessed in time and space to take full advantage of the female fronted metal explosion, a scene Nightwish were one of the progenitors of. And the band was justly rewarded with hit singles - in particular the excellent song Nemo, a song that swoops and soars and has a truckload of emotional content with the requisite goth twinges (and not a clownfish in sight).<br /><br />The album that really broke Nightwish into the mainstream of the hard rock/metal world rather than being a big fish in a small pond, opening up all sorts of possibilities for other bands to follow in their footsteps to more expansive realms and one listen from end to end will show you why.cular the excellent song Nemo, a song that swoops and soars and has a truckload of emotional content with the requisite goth twinges (and not a clownfish in sight).

0312321376|5.0|Just one clearly knowledgeable witness may provide a preponderance of evidence over a dozen witnesses with hazy testimony.  What Jim Tucker and associates have collected is 2,500 young witnesses with hazy testimonies.<br /><br />Now you and I both know that there is far more compelling evidence supporting reincarnation than there is, for example, supporting a historical walking-talking St. Peter in fisherman's shoes.  Yet, people will persist in believing whatever they choose to believe.  This is where Jim Tucker shines - despite the body of evidence he presents, there is no requirement from him for us to have a belief about this issue one way or the other.  The jury is still out.  Where believing starts, thinking stops and this issue requires just a bit more thought.
B0006BLJ26|5.0|I was so close to giving the standard version of Once the full five stars. But didn't based on the presence of some filler. But the extra value located in this special edition release of the album tips things over the edge into the uncouth realms of butt kicking. Not only do we get the Once album in all it's glory - The wondrous semi ballad lament of Nemo, the blazing one-two punch of openers Dark Chest of Wonders and Wish I Had An Angel and the metal of Planet Hell but also a few tidbits and it's these that I'll focus on since I've already reviewed the plain jane version of this album elsewhere.<br /><br />Firstly we get the bonus tracks of White Night Fantasy and Live To Tell The Tale. Neither is earth shattering and in fact in some territories these tracks were part of the normal issue of Once. But both are OK tracks. We also get the video clip for Nemo which ain't all that bad at all.<br /><br />Further there is the CD single of Wish I Had An Angel which is bolstered by a few odds and sods sure to make the Nightwish fanatic happy. We get an instrumental score of Ghost Love Score, the b-side Where Were You Last Night and a demo version of ....Angel. In addition there is a photo gallery section for the teenage fan in all of us.<br /><br />And the whole thing comes in a nifty little presentation box (as per, say, Stratovarius' Elements Pt1 and Pt 2). Which admittedly looks kinda cool on your CD shelf.<br /><br />So there you have it, quality, quantity, nice presentation and some great music by a band that stood outside the mainstream until the mainstream came to them.
0804115613|5.0|I read this book maybe 10 years ago and saw the movie version again (not as good as the book) this evening on HBO. So I picked up the book again and remembered how I love this book and considered it as one of my favorite. I love the 4 main characters (esp. Ruth & Idgie) as well as the secondary characters, Big George & Sipsey. You could really feel the love, devotion and depth of their friendship. This is a must read. A classic!
B000W4D94I|5.0|I love this movie.  I love the flying cow and the rolling house.  (\\"I think we're going in!!!!!\\")  I love the evil meteorologists.  I love the special effects, though really Blu-Ray actually makes them a little less believable.  I love Dusty and Aunt Meg.  I love, \\"That's no moon - it's a space station!\\"  I love the exploding tanker truck.<br /><br />Fine art?  Maybe not.  Plausible?  Again, not so much.  Hyperactive, over-the-top fun?  Oh yeah!  You have entered the suck zone - a land where houses roll and flying tractors are considered, \\"debris\\".  Was that another cow?  Actually, I think it's the same one.<br /><br />If you're willing to suspend disbelief, I mean, seriously suspend it, you'll love this movie.  It's got its own sort of logic, though seriously, if a downdraft and microburst can tear up a drive-in movie theater, how come an F5 tornado doesn't break the leather strap at the end?  OK, maybe it doesn't follow its own logic much, but it's fun!<br /><br />Oh, and if you ever get the chance to do the Twister \\"ride\\" at Universal Studios Florida, it's well worth it.  There, you got a bonus review, too.
B0013D8JB0|5.0|Rule #1 of great art is from the first, you know exactly who is producing it.  Jesus and Mary Chain created and carried a sound unique for the 80s that carried its power through the intervening decades.
B00139W3NE|4.0|The Golden Compass is a very ambitious film based on a very ambitious book.  If you haven't read the book, and you liked this movie, you must go read the book.  That said, this film really did seem rushed and a lot of the appealing aspects of the book are left out.  However, most of what they changed made sense to me (like switching the order of events at Svalbard and Bolvangar) and made the flow of the movie work better.    My main problem with this movie is the same one I had with David Lynch's Dune:  You really wouldn't know what's going on unless you've read the book.  I saw the movie before I read the book, but my wife, who was watching it with me, had just finished the trilogy and she was able to explain a lot of what I was seeing - much like when I watch Dune with someone who hasn't read the book.    So in the end, The Golden Compass suffers from being too complex and fast-paced in order to do justice to the book it's based on.  Yes, I liked the movie a lot (enough to buy it for my library), and it inspired me to read the fantastic novels, but those who haven't read the book may be confused by what they're seeing.    I wholeheartedly recommend this movie, but I really recommend reading the book first to get everything out of it.
B000002BBY|5.0|Music, like movies, tends to go into a lot of phases with many people latching onto a certain genre or artist deeming them the saviors that will rid the taste left in our mouth of the predecessors. With the drugs and excess and party-with-every-and-any-girl lyrics of the 80's metal bands, in comes the so-called \\"grunge\\" movement which was more introverted and coming from a place of hurt and angst. In comes Oasis during the so-called \\"Brit rock\\" movement which dealt with more uplifting matters like the love of rock and roll music. Sure it's derivative but who gives a you-know-what when it's a top record from top to bottom.    Hello: Fading in with the Wonderwall chord progression, the song then transforms into a big rousing rock track with loud guitar chords, Liam's trademark vocals and while it's not really single material, it gets the album to a big start. 8/10    Roll With It: One of the catchiest tracks on the album and one of my favorites. What makes it standout is just that it's one of the more upbeat and livelier tracks to listen to and one can imagine doing a road trip with this blasting. 9/10    Wonderwall: Let's face it: you're bound to have heard this at some point. From its memorable chord progression to its tasteful use of piano at the end and cello during the verses, this is definately one of the 90's best songs. Small but irrevelant complaint: it does that typical Oasis outro of repeating the chorus then repeating it again then again but without lyrics. But again, no harm done. 9.5/10    Don't Look Back in Anger: Well they always said they were just as good as them and so we have an \\"Imagine\\"-esque piano intro before the song starts. Sung this time by Noel, he showcases his more range-y vocals which are different than Liam's more emotive ones. All in all another great song and the chorus soars. 9.5/10    Hey Now!: Not really a big fan of this one, it just sort of plods along and even though it's loud, it doesn't have the fun qualities of Roll With It or even rock-with-your-****-out quality of Rock N' Roll Star from Definately Maybe. But I guess every classic has a dud now and then. 6/10    Untitled Track(The Swamp Song): It's basically a really quick (44 seconds) ditty of a distorted riff over a solo. An alright piece on its own but in the context of the album, it's kind of useless so I can't really rate something this short. n/a    Some Might Say: A big loud rock song and another one that's uplifting and sing-along ready and even though the lyrics are kind of wtf? (\\"sink's full of dirty fishes, she's got dirty dishes on the brain\\") it's still a great tune. But then again that repetitive outro curse happens again which lasts well over a minute. 8/10    Cast No Shadow: It's strange to say a song's by Oasis is \\"beautiful\\" but it's a great ballad with some wonderful use of background vocals, Liam's vocals and I don't think it was a single but radio would've killed it anyway so it worked out in a weird way. 8.5/10    She's Electric: A weird country rock feel with a more stomping beat and it's one of those weird cases where a song sounds fun to listen to only it doesn't really stay in your head. It's another Hey Now!-type song so meh. 6/10    Morning Glory: One of the most underrated songs on the album. While I don't like the rather noisy mix, it's hard not to get swept up in the energy and dare you not to belt out that chorus along with Liam. That siren sounding guitar line kind of ruins it halfway though. 9/10    (Untitled Track): Another rather useless track with sounds of running water and faint rock riffs and solos in the background. Meh. N/A    Champagne Supernova: I think I can safely say this song is simply one, if not their absolute best and while other tracks might hold your attention for awhile, it doesn't have the staying power this one has. Sure lyrically it's kind of nonsensical but musically and vocally this is an absolute classic for sure. 10/10    Couple of duds and iffy tracks but what's surprising is that the hits just seem to keep coming and arrogance aside and criticisms (some of them warranted mind you), can't deny they are a good band and this album proves it.
B0015XASFS|5.0|Once again, Josh has showed his amazing talent in this Live CD/DVD. His performance is more energetic, more mature, more relaxing than his last Closer Tour, and clearly indicated how he was delighted to be around his fans. His voice's definitely beautiful and the music is excellent. Certainly, Josh is one of the greatest performer in our times. This CD/DVD is a treasure for every Josh fan, especially for overseas fans that don't have any chances to see him live.
B00007BKVC|1.0|I'm no Gloria Steinem but as a woman I found this way to \\"men hating\\" and all that. To me, it made women look horrible and really stuck to the bad stereotype of women. Blah! Bad accents don't help either.
B0000667RO|5.0|This is a wonderful CD.  The company is wonderful to do business with and they ship things fast.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is a well written, well performed musical that has brought us many hours of viewing pleasure.  Andrew Lloyd Webber's score is incredible and the 100-piece orchestra lends it such grandeur.  This is the type of \\"opera\\" anyone will enjoy.  Also a lot of fun for amateur psychiatrists to analyze the characters.  We have literally watched it so many times that we have the whole dialogue (including song lyrics) memorized!
B0012Q732O|3.0|This was something like a cross between \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" with the evolution of cavemen, \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" with the beautiful travel to ancient foreign lands, and \\"The Scorpion King\\" with a man convincing many tribes to rise up against a sadistic ruler that is enslaving people. This is actually a decent family Summer movie. There is no bad language or sex, but some normal fighting violence. Even the violence is not the typical grossly spatter everyone with blood. I found the movie entertaining and the acting was actually pretty good. I would have given it three and a half stars if I could of and I even considered four stars. In fact with a bit more money this might have rivaled \\"Apocalypto\\". This may not have had the budget or directing capability of such a movie, but rating it with typical B movies like \\"One Million Years B. C.\\", with Raquel Welch, is ridiculous. Don't get me wrong I found even that one fun to watch. But this is far more entertaining than most caveman movies I have seen before, even if it is not entirely historically accurate. Considering recent discoveries about cavemen though this is not as far fetched as some would have you believe.<br /><br />The story centers around a prophecy of a man that is a hunter who speaks with a spear tooth (Sabertooth Tiger) leading people to their freedom. We see this man from childhood along with several others so we don't instantly know for sure who our hero will be. As a young boy he meets a beautiful blue eyed girl that was found by his tribe. They are linked from then on as he does everything he can to ensure her safety and make her his woman. The story, acting, directing, camera work, music, sets, and effects are reasonably good. The scenery is a key part as they travel from snow covered mountains through desert and jungle. The exceptional photography makes it stand out in detail. I would say most people won't be disappointed renting it and fans of the movies I mentioned quite possibly may want to buy it. Good quality DVD with decent replayability. - C.

B000000H48|5.0|Like so many other people here have said, this is easily one of KD's best albums.  Pure metal, no fluff.  Fantastic ranges of all instruments involved making it arguably a progressive metal album.  Soaring melodies in every minute of music.  You could waste you money on worse things than this or you could buy this metal work-of-art...
B00003CXAA|5.0|This dvd collection is great!  We received some super coupons with our shipment that were unexpected. Definitely a good buy!
B00004XQ83|4.0|If you have seen the movie, then you know the music is great!  This a fun CD to put in when your driving around with the top down on your convertible or riding in your jeep/old bronco.  Parts of the movie come to mind when you hear the songs.  Keeps you smiling.
0385338724|5.0|Time flies, yet, probably not as quickly as it has for Lexi Smart.<br />When she wakes up in a hospital bed, she discovers that it's three years later and things are very different from the way she remembers them to be.<br /><br />In fact three years ago, Lexi was a plain-Jane entry-level employee who was wallowing in self-pity, stood up by \\"Loser Dave\\" and about to attend her father's funeral. Fast forward to the present and she is now part of the elite senior management team at work, married to a gorgeous, rich and successful Adonis and her snaggle tooth smile is replaced by a pair of shiny and straight snow white veneers.<br /><br />The perfect life that she's always dreamed of came to fruition right before her eyes. But who is she? Frustrated with the fact that her memory is taking way too long to come back, Lexi solicits a little help from her new husband who unconsciously unleashes a slew of mysteries behind the part of her past that she can't remember.<br /><br />It seems that Lexi's trip up the ladder of success has been a wild one and as she begins to put all of the pieces together she discovers she's not too fond of the person she's become.<br /><br />REMEMBER ME? is a fun, light, and romantic read that is well written and full of hilarious moments. Miss Kinsella has definitely done it again!
B000PY52EU|5.0|This movie was painful, beautiful and full of soul.  What looks like a swanky sex story on the surface turns out to be a touching, spiritual journey.  The soulfull music chosen to accompany was a perfect choice as well, and Sam Jackson looked like he'd been born with a guitar in his hands. Christina Ricci plays a unique role, and very different from her 'little girl' days, as a damaged young woman clinging to an equally emotionally challenged young man played by Justin Timberlake. When her beloved leaves, the one thin thread helping her hold her life together is broken and she's back on the prowl, thinking sex is all that can save her from the wretched past. Beaten up and left for dead by the side of the road, Rae is rescued by a black man named Lazarus. It turns out Lazarus is a bit beaten up by life as well. I love how the 'chain' becomes a beautiful tether of love that helps ground these emotionally scattered people trying so hard to cope with all the pain in their lives. What a fantastic story!<br /><br />Chrissy K. McVay  - Author
1600241824|5.0|David Sedaris is my favorite author.  I always tell my friends to listen to his books because they are much funnier to hear in his voice.  This book was no exception.  I must say that I was laughing from the beginning and consistently through the end.  One of my favorite things about Sedaris is his ability to take everyday occurrences, and find the humor in them.  This is what had me laughing out loud in \\"When You Are Engulfed In Flames,\\" even more so than in his other books.  I will definitely be recommending this book to my friends and family.
0471603864|5.0|This book will get you from Griffiths' Intro to QM to Peskin & Schroeder's Quantum Field Theory.  Guaranteed.    But don't buy it.    Seriously.  The book was published in 1987 and a new edition is coming out this summer, in time, presumably, for the fall term.  Wait for that one (neutrinos will actually have mass in this edition).
0553582038|2.0|Yikes!  I just finished this book, and the negative reviews are not exaggerated.  I absolutely loved the first three, but this one was such a boring stinker, I could barely finish it.    The Ross Blackman review mirrors exactly how I feel.  This book was as tedious and laborious as trudging several miles through a bog in knee-high mud.  It was made worse by no inherent payoff at the end.  What exactly was the point of this book, aside from adding a host (no pun intended) of new characters we care nothing about?      I recently got into this series so I had the luxury of reading all four books back-to-back.  But with that said, I feel terrible for the fans who had to wait years to find out what came next, only to get burned by an asinine new volume that ignores almost all of the core characters, as well as the monumental cliffhangers that made the prior books so exciting.     If you're a die-hard fan of the series and must know all the intrinsic details, it's worth a read.  If you're a casual fan hoping to read more of the glory that was the first three books, save your money and read the spoilers on Wiki instead.  This book does not deliver and you'll save precious time and energy.    Here's hoping the next volume will make up for this disappointment...
B0018J2QB8|5.0|This sounded like a gorier CSI with an implausible plot, but it is nothing of the sort. The characters are fascinating, the casting is just incredible. You're rooting for and against characters all the time. Dexter himself is so fascinating, it's so cool seeing all of his layers. We can't get enough of Dexter.
B000WGWQG8|2.0|I don't get HBO at home, but I heard many positive reviews of the series on blogs (Instapundit and Volokh Conspiracy) and the radio.  I pre-ordered the DVD collection, which arrived in time to enjoy with Father's Day.  I certainly did enjoy the story and the acting.    John Adams is an interesting person to take us through the story of the birth of the USA.  You see the run up to the revolution, the union of the colonies, the war and post-war diplomacy, and the struggle to stay united.  And if your a law buff, you learn quite a bit about the basis of laws in the US, while enjoying a great production.    I give 2 stars because I'm annoyed with HBO commercialization of the DVDs.  They used DVD locking features, typically used to force viewing of copyright notices, to force viewers to see a 5 minute commercial for other HBO miniseries (actually includes segments of John Adams).  It's really bad that this was done at all, yet all 3 DVD's have the same required viewing before you can get to the menu.    I thought the point of HBO/cable was to pay money by the consumers to get product without commercialization.  I purchase DVD's of various network series, so I can see productions without commercial interruption.  Word-of-mouth was more than sufficient to get me to purchase this series.  Please, don't ruin a great product with crass commercialization.    If you want to put trailers for other series on the DVD, no problem.  Provide a link on the menu.  Many people enjoy viewing trailers, so certainly include them.  Just don't make them mandatory.
B00005JPNZ|5.0|that was perfect as expected, the only default is the \\"Kid\\", Shia did his role ok, I am not complaining about his performance, but I didn't like the idea of his existens from the begining, I even cannot imagine that he might be the next Indiana jones, please Lucas, don't do that...at least not in the coming \\"Indy 5\\", you don't know how Harrison Ford is so connected in our minds with the Indiana Jones character, there is that Chemistry, as if they are meant to be, as if the Indiana Jones character is created only for him, so at least exclude the \\"Kid\\" in Indy 5 after that you can do what ever you want...thanks

B000059TFO|5.0|It is my understanding there were folks in Mississippi who resented this film, saying it unfairly portrayed their state. History knows better. Blacks in that state as in other southern states endured murder, lynching,and having their homes and churches bombed or burned. The KKK was made up of \\"respectable citizens\\" who lived one way during the day and donned their hoods at night. There is a book COMING OF AGE IN MISSISSIPPI that was written by a young black girl who grew up there. She tells about the murder of her father who was walking home after working all day. He was shotgunned to death. No investigation was done, and no arrests were made. This move is one of the most powerful commentaries the deal with the terror and injustice that went on for decades. The three civil rights workers were murdered and \\"disappeared\\" on my 22nd birthday. That was a very turbulent time in our history.
0446402389|5.0|What a great mystery/thriller from a new author! I picked this book up and could not put it down. The setting is the 1950s in the Soviet Union. A Communist nation that tries to tell itself that crime and other sin is \\"not the communist way.\\" Leo Demidov, a member of the MGB, has arrested and seen torture of people that were considered \\"criminals\\" and he knows full well the system in which he works.    For Demidov, the tables get turned as children are found dead in certain patterns along a rail system. The state, of course, denies this is a serial killer, but Demidov begins to put the pieces together of a system that can't see the truth and a nation that lives and thrives on oppression. Can Demidov find the killer despite obstacles from his own government? This is a must read book.    The plot twists and turns and the character development is outstanding. I can only hope that this author writes another book(s) of this caliber.

0151008787|4.0|Amos Oz's A Tale of Love and Darkness is a memoir of his life and the life of his family up until the time of his mother's suicide at the age of 38 in the early 1950s.  Oz's mother's suicide, never treated fictionally in his other work (as far as I can recall) is treated here with great care and thoroughness: there is anger, guilt, shame, sadness, loss, a sense of regret, and penetrating understanding.  Without a doubt the book is strongest when Oz discusses his mother and her family.  His mother, brought up on a romantic, Hebrew education in Rovno, was not ready for the tawdriness of life in Palestine, \\"the rough terrain of everyday life, diapers, husbands, migraines, queues, smells of moth balls and kitchen sinks.\\"  The story of his mother's mental decline and suicide is also the story of the convergence and divergences of Jewish life in the 20th century; the outline of the gap between the real and the ideal of the Zionist dream.  That said, A Tale of Love and Darkness is generally overwritten.  There is much useless repetition here which drags down the trajectory of the memoir.  I do not recommend this work as the first work of Amos Oz to be read, but the last.  It makes for an instructive book end with Where the Jackal's Howl and Other Stories on the other side.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|If the Star Wars prequels showed us anything its that going back to making a prequel to a old movie is a BAD idea, and this film is NO exception. This Bond is supposed to be set pre Dr. No, yet there are:    1) cell phones, technology that did not exist then  2) laptops, again that did not exist back then (especially not a Sony VAIO which was shamelessly marketed)  3) Very elaborate tracking system, much more sophisticated than a radioisotope tracker used in Dr. No  4) Modern weapons  5) Texas Hold em, not Baccarat    Just to mention a few. Sure the acting may be great in parts, like the torture scene, but the whole movie just feels drawn out like they couldn't stop. Kids and first time Bonders will probably like this, but for thoes of us who have seen every Bond movie from Dr. No to Die Another Day (including Never Say Never Again), it is a movie that should never have been made, which is why they made Dr. No first and not Casino Royale.
B0018CWEYY|2.0|I really like LOST too and I never missed one episode, I also have all the dvd's but, I agree with the others who said it is to much money for so few episodes.  Look at the TERMINATOR TV series on Amazon $29.95, even cheaper on pre-order Like I said way to much money.........Well, maybe we could pick it up on ebay sometime in Jan. for far less.   Like someone else said.....are the writers and the company trying to make us pay for the money they lost from the strike or, maybe they think we just won't notice.  I always just buy the copies of lost........this time I'll wait, thank you very much.
B00005BKZJ|4.0|This is an offbeat, delightful film about the growth of affection and the overcoming of cultural barriers. The contrast of certain German (or perhaps more specifically, Bavarian) standards with American is a source of hilarity to the viewers that know both cultures, but everyone I've talked to agrees that the gradual rapprochement between all these quirky, essentially warmhearted characters is endearing. Yet it almost miraculously manages to avoid sentimentality and certainly avoids superficiality. The music of the soundtrack is also haunting. I would have given it 5 stars except that there is one scene with a musical number that seems unnecessary and drags down the flow of the story only at that point.  But otherwise it's a thoroughly charming, atmospheric film that I absolutely love.
0440237688|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read.  It's just as capable of inspiring adult readers as yound adults. I've been buying copies of this for my younger family members.

0525457585|5.0|Many reviewers have already given a synopsis of this fantastic story of a boy literally drawn into a book he is reading.  So, I wanted to comment on this particular edition.<br /><br />I was hesitant to spend so much money on a book that has been in print for so long and is readily available in cheap paperback copies.  However, this is a beautiful hardcover edition.  Collectible quality.  The dust jacket has lovely artwork.  But, the best aspect is the two color text.  The majority of the book is printed in green typeface.  Bastion's sections are printed in red typeface.  This allows for a smooth, but noticeable, transition between the two stories.  I think this makes is easier on younger readers to keep track of what's going on, as well as being visually appealing.  The paper feels thicker than in most books, and seems to be high quality.  Bright white pages showcase the color text very well.<br /><br />Fans of \\"The Princess Bride\\" would enjoy the story.  Book collectors will be happy to add this to their shelf.
0515142247|4.0|This is the second Jack Reacher Novel, by Lee Child. My Aunt sent me \\"One Shot\\" which I loved, so I decided to read the Jack Reacher Novels in sequence. I didn't like this as well as \\"Killing Floor\\" but still found it above average. Liked the Kidnapped Female Agent who is the center of the Novel. But I didn't think the book needed two traitors within the bureau. This book is a fun, thrilling read.
B000ZN802W|5.0|I had heard about this real story watching a TV talk show that the author appeared on and it intrigued me.  While it starts a bit slow the depth of it soon comes through and you are right there with CHristopher Johnson McCandless.

0312330537|1.0|The author's criminal background  in itself doesn't concern me, but the extremely poor writing in Shantaram (and web site!  and author's fan mail! and philosophical pointers!) strikes me as a successful con job.  There is not a single believable character, no depth or complexity in the author's observations, and the narrator's voice wears very thin very quickly.  Reading literature is always an option, though:  try Vikram Chandra, for instance.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|ah, a hot phantom, a most lovely girl and a prince charming adds up to a beautifully cinamated story.  I wish I could have helped with the editing though, snip-snip no Minnie Driver.  Likewise that business of \\"hands to the level of your eyes\\" -what was that about?  But I love it and if you don't you're just not a fan of fantasy and music intertwined.  Or maybe you like your fantasy and music done in animation ala Sleeping Beauty.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I grew up with star wars, I own 4 sets of the original trilogy on VHS, 3 sets of the trilogy on laser-disc, two set of the DVDs, and even the very rarely heard of authentic VCD set.    The last set of DVDs at least included the non CGI enhanced trash that plagues most of the recent re-releases. I was however let down that the \\"bonus discs\\" containing the original cuts in the las \\"go-round\\"   were less than I expected quality wise.     What we the true Star Wars fans crave is the original trilogy, cut like the \\"definitive collection\\" was on laserdisc...but with remastered picture quality and remastered HD surround sound like they used to do, but with todays equipment...with no CGI additions/extra scenes that were not in the original movies... Please George, don't distort our memories, we loved the films how they were. They were a masterful set of movies as they were. The only improvements should be picture clarity and audio quality / HD 5.2 mixing.  PLEASE !!
0143038419|1.0|What a waste of time.  This woman needed a hobby or better yet, to get out and do some volunteer work!    She is so stereotypical of what's wrong with America!
1401201911|5.0|Great story that really draws you in. I am not a very big fan of comic books, so it was a surprise to me when I could not put this one down after starting to read it at 2 am.. Had to finish the whole thing in one sitting. Pencil and coloring are also great. I wish they'd make a movie out of this Superman twist. I'd recommend this to both the people who are new to comic books as well as supernerds.
055358894X|5.0|This was an excellent read. The story was fresh, the characters were real, and the world was very well realized.    For the reviewers who complained of the level of profanity used through out the novel, all I can say is that it brought even more realism to the story when taking into consideration the class of society that the story revolves around. It's unfortunate that this could be offensive to some people, just understand that the whole world isn't as proper as the little bubble people have a tendency to form around themselves.    With that being said, This book does have a high amount of profanity in it. So keep that in mind!    Excellent Book, all around!
0143038419|1.0|My sister-in-law gave me this book.  She loved it and wanted to buy it for all her girlfriends.  I found Elizabeth Gilbert hysterical and shallow, and was incredulous that other reviewers described _Eat, Pray, Love_ as \\"wise and rapturous.\\"  Is this what passes for wisdom in our culture?    To be fair, Gilbert is a good writer.  She has a keen ear for dialogue. Her transcription of a Lazio soccer fan's monologue as he screams instructions at the players is funny, though full of Italian you could never use in polite company!  You meet a host of quirky characters, including Richard the Texan, who drawls \\"Man, they got mosquitoes `round this place big enough to rape a chicken\\" as he sits down beside Gilbert at the ashram refectory.    I most enjoyed Book Three because of the anthropological details.  Did you know Balinese parents name their children one of four names (Wayan=First, Made=Second, Nyoman=Third, and Ketut=Fourth), depending on birth order?  According to Gilbert, two Wayans can marry each other, and name their firstborn Wayan.  Not surprisingly, many Balinese have nicknames since you can imagine the confusion on the first day of kindergarten when the teacher calls out a name, and fourteen kids raise their hands.    In Bali, Gilbert befriends a local herbalist / healer named--yet again--Wayan, and raises $18,000 to buy her and her eight-year-old daughter Tutti a house.  I was fascinated by the cultural complexities of owning land in Bali (land gets sold by rumour) and disturbed by Wayan's unorthodox male fertility treatments (she has young stud taxi drivers impregnate wives since their sterile husbands don't believe they could possibly have a problem and it MUST be the woman's fault).    Now that I've gotten Gilbert's good points out of the way, let me tell you her downsides.  This book, while marketed as \\"rich in spiritual insight,\\" is about as insightful as your average teen magazine article--\\"Fake Tanning: Is it for you?\\"  Here are three problems with Gilbert's approach:    PROBLEM #1  Gilbert assumes \\"all religions are the same.\\"  This is her drumbeat theme.  In chapter 3, she explains that though she uses the word \\"God,\\" she could just as easily substitute Allah, Vishnu, Zeus, etc.  Her casual lumping together of things that are blatantly different is nonsensical.  For example, in chapter 46, she discusses the yogic tradition of \\"Kundalini shakti,\\" where a snake lies coiled at the base of your spine and you release it through the seven chakras (or wheels) of your soul until it explodes through your head and you achieve union with God. Gilbert describes the experience of union as \\"soft blue electrical energy pulsing through my body, in waves\\" (142).  Eager to link \\"kundalini shakti\\" to other religions, she says \\"Christians call it the Holy Spirit\\" (143).    I read that sentence and went, \\"HUH?\\"  Jesus talks about the Holy Spirit in the Gospel of John as a Counsellor who will \\"convict the world of guilt in regard to sin and righteousness and judgment\\" (John 16:8) and \\"guide you into all truth\\" (John 16:13).  Nowhere does the Bible characterize the Holy Spirit as a pulsating blue energy field or serpent. To the contrary, the serpent in the Garden of Eden represents evil.    PROBLEM #2  Gilbert has no core sacred text on which to base her beliefs.  She seems adverse, even hostile, to the idea.  She admits: \\"I have always responded with breathless excitement to anyone who has ever said that God does not live in a dogmatic scripture\\" (14).  And on page 143: \\"Every religion in the world has had a subset of devotees who seek a direct, transcendent experience with God, excusing themselves from fundamentalist scriptural or dogmatic study in order to personally encounter the divine.\\"  And again, on pg. 176:  \\"I'm irritated by spiritual prudence and I feel bored and parched by empirical debate.  I don't want to hear it anymore.  I couldn't care less about evidence and proof and assurances.\\"    The problem with Gilbert's approach is that there is no external check on her imagination.    Gilbert's God morphs from chapter to chapter, based on her emotions. I got confused because half the time it seemed like she believed God was merely a wiser version of herself: \\"Maybe the voice I am reaching for is God, or maybe it's my Guru speaking through me, or maybe it's the angel who was assigned to my case, or maybe it's my Highest Self, or maybe it is indeed just a construct of my subconscious, invented in order to protect me from my own torment\\" (53).    I started to feel that _Eat, Pray, Love_ was one long rationalization of Gilbert's selfishness, and that God was there to give her the green light on whatever she decided to do--whether it was leave her marriage or spend \\"a transcontinental airline ticket's worth of money ... buying enough lingerie to keep a sultan's consort outfitted for 1,0001 nights\\" (105).  Take this conversation with Richard the Texan about her affair with a younger man named David and her divorce.  Richard tells her: \\"David's purpose was to shake you up, drive you out of that marriage that you needed to leave\\" (149).  Wait: David was sent by the Fates on purpose to make Gilbert realize she had to get out of her marriage?  Have you ever heard such a whopping excuse for adultery?    17th-century French mathematician Blaise Pascal understood that human beings need a framework beyond their own mood swings to approach God: \\"Without Scripture, whose only object is to proclaim Christ, we know nothing, and we can see nothing but obscurity and confusion in the nature of God and in nature itself.\\"    Texts like the Ten Commandments or the Sermon on the Mount set standards we can't wriggle out of. \\"Jesus replied, `Moses permitted you to divorce your wives because your hearts were hard.  But it was not this way from the beginning.  I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits adultery'\\" (Matthew 19:8-9).  No wonder this \\"dogmatic\\" text makes Gilbert uncomfortable: it puts limits on her desires.  It prevents her from turning God into whatever she wants him to be.     Gilbert's consumerist approach and lack of systematic theology made me unable to take her seriously.  She cobbles together a shaky belief system of New Age mysticism, defending her incoherence: \\"I think you have every right to cherry-pick when it comes to moving your spirit and finding peace in God.  I think you are free to search for any metaphor whatsoever which will take you across the worldly divide whenever you need to be transported or comforted\\" (208).  She doesn't care what's true, merely what makes her feel good--which is ironic given her stated intention in the introduction: \\"Sincere spiritual investigation is, and always has been, an endeavor of methodical discipline.  Looking for Truth is not some kind of spazzy free-for-all ...\\" (2). If _Eat, Pray, Love_ is not a spazzy free-for-all, what is?    PROBLEM #3  Ultimately, this book has nothing to do with God.  It's a self-help book in disguise.  Gilbert admits as much in the last chapter.  \\"I was the administrator of my own rescue,\\" she explains as she lands on a paradisiacal island with her Brazilian lover after getting rid of a nasty bladder infection from having too many orgasms.  She cheerily dismisses all problems of evil, injustice, and divine retribution: \\"... there is no such thing in this universe as hell, except maybe in our own terrified minds\\" (328).      In Gilbert's world, no problems exist that cannot be solved by eating pistachio gelato or reciting mantras like \\"Om Namah Shivaya\\" (\\"I honor the divinity that resides within me\\").  My friend is an emergency room doctor in California who treated a two-year-old girl with a high fever.  It turned out she had gonorrhoea and had been infected by the mother's boyfriend.  Would a loving God be indifferent to the child's suffering, or blasé about the rapist's behavior?    If you're looking for books where writers wrestle profoundly with faith, read these instead:    (1) _The Brothers Karamazov_ by Fyodor Dostoevsky (translated by Pevear / Volokhonsky)  (2) _Gilead_ by Marilynne Robinson  (3) _Pensees_ by Blaise Pascal  (4) _The Habit of Being_ by Flannery O'Connor  (5) _Disappointment with God_ by Philip Yancey  (6) _The Little Woman_ by Gladys Alyward  (7)   _The Lord of the Rings_ by JRR Tolkien  (8) 1 & 2 Samuel (the life of King David); Acts (biographies of Peter & Paul)
B00168HARG|4.0|While this show isn't James Cameron calibur stuff, for television it is really well done with some nice acting and top notch visual effects. I was never a T3 hater, but after watching the first season of The Sarah Connor Chronicles, I prefer this storyline and will happily ignore everything in T3 (at least until the fourth movie comes out in 2009).<br /><br />Lena Headey makes a good Sarah Connor, but the real star is Summer Glau, of Firefly and Serenity fame, who plays the cyborg protector named Cameron. She is cute, funny when trying not to be, and downright deadly when in combat. Not to mention the fact that this series shows off Brian Austin Green's acting skill and succeeds. What did I just say?<br /><br />If your a fan of the movies, you will find much to enjoy here. It isn't up to par with shows like LOST or 24 just yet, but who knows what the future will hold?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|In watching John Adams, you will be living the early history of our nation through his eyes and experiences. The casting was superb, making the acting very believable such  one almost feels as though  he/she is watching the original characters in action. One is left humbled by the struggles and sacrifices that these founding fathers made for this new country, together with their sense of duty and committment to the cause, with John Adams obviously closely profiled in this mini-series. [Abigail was certainly a Founding Mother of sorts.] Given it was designed for television, each segment is less than an hour, so a couple of us were able to watch the first four at one sitting, taking a break between each. Just one word of tempered caution: All episodes are appropriate for children old enough to understand and follow the content.  However, in the last episode, there is a surgery executed without anethesia on  John Adams daughter (a mastectomy performed prior to the use of chloroform ... which made its more widespread debut during the Civil War era surgeries).  It is extrememly tastefully done, but even as an adult, I found it very hard to watch, and had to turn away until this part was past.  You may wish to skip this segment for children below highschool age.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|This product is great for tile floors.  I still use by big sweeper, but I love this for every day clean up.  It's great to take along if you need to.

0975991477|1.0|I don't think this book is worthwhile to the public.  The author borders on the edge of intelligent design and creates unbased analogies in his book about how things just work out.    I can't think of examples because I honeslty tossed this book in the trash and am just writing a review because for some reason Amazon has this book as one its recommendations for me.

B000VWE5OY|5.0|This show is incredable! From the first introduction of Gwen, Jack, and the rest of the Torchwood crew, the action is fast-paced and action packed. Every episode seems longer than it actually is because of the sheer AMOUNT of story the writers and actors are able to pack into each segment. The characters are real, beleivable, and sympathetic. Captain Jack Harkness, played by stage and TV actor John Barrowman, is charismatic, cryptic, mysterious, and absolutely ruthless is carrying out the mission at hand, wether it's capturing a \\"weevil\\", romancing a coworker, or executing a member of the Torchwood team who's become corrupted by alien technology.<br /><br />This series has several Dr. Who tie-ins, from the introduction of Jack Harkness in Season 1, to Jack joining the Doctor and Martha in Season 3 of Doctor Who, which on Jacks timeline occurs at the end of Season 1 and the start of Season 2 on Torchwood. There are also multiple episodes and references to Torchwood (albeit Torchwood London, which is not connected to Torchwood Cardiff, due to a breakaway alluded to by Jack but never fully explained, at least not yet) throughout Seasons 2 and 3 of DW.<br /><br />The budget for this show must be generous, as illustrated by detailed alien makeup effects, and by the Hub (Torchwood headquarters, concealed beneath the Millenium Center in Cardiff, Wales). Numerous locations in and around Cardiff are featured as part of the action, including generous slices of ordinary life for the people of Cardiff, who have no idea where their city lies on a grand cosmic scale, and what lies concealed beneath their feet.<br /><br />As Jack says in the title sequence, \\"The 21st Century's when everything changes. You have to be ready.\\" With those words, you embark on a rollercoaster journey that will have you challenged, confused, questioning, and ultimately wishing you could become a member of Torchwood.
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|I found Adele several months ago here on Amazon. I bought the CD, and honestly haven't stopped playing it since. It stays in my CD player at all times...REALLY..it's THAT GOOD!! Adele's voice is perfection... smooth, rich, elegant, powerful, smoky. Positively addicting. I haven't been this excited about an artist since I discovered James Morrison (and before that, David Gray). One of my top favorite CD's of ALL TIME!! It's THAT GOOD!! Every song on the entire CD is incredible...how often can you say that about any artist?!?!?
0385340567|4.0|Jack Reacher, ex-military cop, known to many fans of Lee Child as \\"one-man justice\\", is again on the road. He has nothing to lose and apparently nothing to gain when he ventures into the town of Despair, middle of nowhere. \\"You better leave now\\" - that's what he hears from the town's residents, from the bar owner, town owner and almost everybody else. Little did they know that for Reacher this is a direct invitation to stay, investigate and fight.    With this preamble, and Reacher's personality, Lee Child opens for himself an excellent opportunity for another fast-read, lots-of-action thriller. In my opinion, he mostly delivers on it and does it better than in his last two books (\\"Hard Way\\" and \\"Bad Luck and Trouble\\"). The main reason is that the plot itself is definitely more plausible than in those two books (as plausible as any thriller gets!), and even though in last 70 pages or so Lee Child hurried over to finish it and left some dots not connected or misconnected, the book is still a good read.      As for many reviewers commenting on plausibility of Reacher condemning the military politics in Middle East and army in general, I also felt uncomfortable with it for a moment. But then I realized - for all of you, Reacher's fans - didn't he leave the army because the situation in it was not acceptable to Reacher anymore? And , being independent thinker, Reacher never really liked politics and politicians, from left or right wings. As much as we like people to correspond to what we think they are, they are not comics heroes. People change.     Soldiers do go to the battles and die, even when they condemn the war itself or not agree with the reasons for it. But, being human, they may accept the decisions of others not to participate and not to die for something they don't believe into. I am actually glad that in this book Reacher is more human and interesting than any cartoon version of him that I imagined before. For me, it is something to gain.
B000OT6V00|4.0|I can only wonder what this movie would have been without studio interference. After just watching this i can say that it is still solid film-making and the bluray disc is a superb transfer. A must see for anyone who loves fantasy.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling took pun rock's \\"loud, fast, 'n' hard\\" aesthetic and turned it inside-out. From conception to execution, it's a blasphemous album. How else can you characterize a double LP full of stylistic variation, intelligent lyrics, raw musical skill, and concessions to mainstream accessibility that also happens to be a blindingly good punk record? Two years after the Sex Pistols, the game had already changed beyond recognition. Of course, the important thing about London Calling (or any album, for that matter) is the songs. Great albums are made out of great songs, and by that measure London Calling is pure gold. The first half plays like a greatest hits collection, full of such spastic classics as the title track, \\"Jimmy Jazz,\\" \\"Spanish Bombs,\\" \\"Lost In The Supermarket,\\" and \\"Guns Of Brixton.\\" Those first ten tracks see the Clash piling masterpiece on top of masterpiece, creating a series of flawless musical moments without so much as stopping for breath. The second half slows things down a bit, but the standard of quality is still generally high. \\"Train In Vain (Stand By Me)\\" and \\"Lover's Rock\\" see to that. Classic rock 'n' roll. Gotta have it.
0385338724|3.0|I picked up Remember Me? because a member of an online group I'm in suggested it.  That and I like Sophie Kinsella.  While her books aren't deep, they are fun.  I've read all of the Shopaholic books (and, really, who hasn't known a Becky Bloomwood?) but I loved Domestic Goddess.<br /><br />The premise is simple: Lexi Smart has a car accident and wakes up in a hospital thinking it's three years earlier. She has a husband she doesn't know and an entire life she doesn't recognize.  Nothing in her current life is how she would expect it because it's very out of character.  On the surface, it seems perfect: she's slimmer, gotten her teeth and hair \\"fixed\\", she has a millionaire husband, a beautiful loft and a great job.  As she begins to piece together her life, she realizes that things aren't as perfect as they seem.<br /><br />The characters are interesting, the story is fun and lightly suspenseful.  It's not an \\"on the edge of your seat\\" story but the reader does want to find out how the hell Lexi became The Cobra.  There is no surprise ending, but that's okay.  Kinsella's niche is stories that entertain and make us care for the characters. T his one is perfect in that regard.
B0012Q732O|3.0|Okay, I gave this movie 3 stars just for the laugh value. The effects were hilarous reminding me of special effects before Star Wars and the dialogue was worse, reminding me of those hideous Hercules movies that MST3K had on their show. Its movies like these that give history based movies a bad name.
B0018CMJPS|5.0|I have to say I adored this movie and was so glad to find a theatre that was playing it near me.  The scenery was astoundingly breathtaking.  It was by far one of the most visually stunning films I have seen in a very very long time.  I found it refreshing to find a film that combined true innocence, beauty, imagination and inner human struggle.  I wish there were more films like that on the big screen.   It was really a hidden jewel....something about googley, googley, googley...go see the film you'll understand:-)
B00007AJF8|5.0|Craig starts as a nobody Puppeteer until one day he finds himself as a well-mannered actor after discovering a miniature doorway where he works. It is a portal that leads to the mind and body of John Malkovich. For 200.00 Craig and his hard-to-get co-worker lets anyone access the portal; where love making with wild women and his daily habits can be experienced. Unfortunately for most it only last 15 minutes. This movie plays on many philosophical and psychological abstracts such as mind, consciousness, sub consciousness and private thought and diffuses them out with humor and sexual wits.
3836501910|5.0|Terry's world might be, hell, it's MEANT to be a little scary for alot of people! Not in the sense of depicting violence or even real depravity but rather in the near-apocalypitc vulgarity with which it depicts post modern-hedonism, where sexual pleasure is about as idealized as a Tijuana donkey-show.<br /><br />A man, laying half-passed-out on a bed, is seen puking, Terry (who appears in many of his own photos) pulls a tampon string out of a woman's vagina with his teeth, a guy pisses into his own mouth--you get the picture. It's a garbage-world where all the turn-ons are trashy. It is strangely arousing inspite of the yuck factor, but  whether that's because it's sexy or because I'm just so jaded I'm happy for anything that can jolt and shock my deadened nerves, is up for debate!<br /><br />Jolts and shocks are what Terryworld is all about. Terryworld is to erotica what Hustler was to Playboy. It's flat-out raunch,but with a fashion photographer's sensibility, which is to say that it does have some artistic merit beyond its novelty value, calling to mind the \\"provacateur\\" advertising campaigns of recent years, of which Terry himself has often played a part. His situation-heavy portraits are Tarantino-like movie stills from a movie I'm not sure I want to see.<br /><br />Which brings me to my point; In the end, after all the money's come in, all the heads have turned and all the word-of-mouth has been exhausted, what is the final value of shock?<br /><br />Remember when you were fourteen and looking at your stolen copy of Hustler, you felt kind of sick at the end of the ride. Your heart rate increased as you turned each page, your curiosity peaked to see the next lurid spectacle, you flipped faster and faster until finally it was over, you'd seen the whole thing--More, in fact, than your mind was capable of processing in one sitting. You were late for dinner,  had a pressure headache, and a faint desire to go to church.<br /><br />Welcome to Terryworld.
0345495004|4.0|I was so moved by this book. I was hesitant because the story was a \\"cheatin story\\" (as my husband refers to this type of book) and I normally do not read this type of story line.<br />However, I was touched by this couples love and sacrafices. I was moved by the bravery of this couple to make such a decision in the time that this took place. (1907) I felt that even though they had made decisions  that I cannot understand myself. They must have really loved one another to do what they did to their families and friends. I was not prepared for the ending and I felt sorrow for everyone involved. This book is an excellent love story and a good example of doing what you believe in right or wrong no matter what the consequences.<br />I may not condone what this couple did but I respect their decision to love one another so deeply.<br />I would recommend this book to my friends. Great Summer Read....
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|\\"Serenity\\" is a movie trying to accomplish the impossible - to weave a satisfactory conclusion to \\"Firefly\\" - truly one of the most amazing television shows ever made.  Unfortunately, \\"Firefly\\" didn't even finish a complete season due to network idiocy.  Still \\"Serenity\\" showcased wonderful characters with fascinating stories to tell, although there were some incomplete story lines which could not be told within the limited framework of a two hour movie.  Still \\"Serenity\\" is much better than nothing.  I only wish there had been more of the original television series, \\"Firefly\\".
B0019HQIFE|5.0|From the song selection, to the actual performances, to the audio quality to the video quality (this is the best looking Blu Ray disc I own). Do not hesitate to get this one even if you're just a casual music lover and not much of a John Mayer fan. This is an exceptional quality product and is a great concert to watch for anyone who loves music.

B000007VCM|5.0|This album from 1985 bridges the gap between the earlier and more gothic punk feeling 'Dreamtime' (1984) album, and the more rock-oriented, paired back 'Electric'(1987). Love keeps some of the gothic feel of the earlier album, while this brooding atmosphere is turned up a notch to 1970's style psychedelia. This album has a very consistent tone and feel to it at moves between brooding downbeat balads \\"brother wolf, sister moon, judith, hollow man, black angel\\" and more upbeat numbers \\"nirvana, she sells sanctuary, the phoenix, big neon glitter\\" and more upbeat balad numbers \\"revolution, rain\\".     For those of you who found Ian Astbury's voice gets a little jarring on 'Electric', this is a more tuneful / soulful album, without the drivelly sound of later albums such as 'Ceremony'. Also Billy Duffy is in fine form. While he will never be hailed as one of the great electric guitarists, here he is in very good touch with the songs and the guitar and voice complement each other perfectly.
0385338694|5.0|The Shopaholic series is fabulous, but in the Undomestic Goddess Kinsella takes a different turn on learning a life lesson in a fun, fluffy way.  In this book Samantha is high powered lawyer living in the city who has been working her way toward a partnership in her law firm. When this seems in grasp, her life takes a turn. She runs off the the country and is mistaken for a housekeeper, and she does not tell anyone else otherwise. In this new life she makes for herself she realizes what really is important is spending time with friends and family and having time for yourself.  This one will have you taking a step back and examining what you really want out of life.  A funny and uplifting read, I could not recommend it more!
B000000OQF|5.0|There will be little that is remembered about the 1980s LA scene 20 years from now except Guns N' Roses. This was a young band with fresh ideas and a very strong rhythm section. 'Welcome to the Jungle' 'Out ta get me' 'Sweet Child o Mine', 'Mr Brownstone' and 'Paradise City' were all instant classics. Rocket Queen becomes one on repeated listening.     The guitar soloing on this albumn is outstanding. Slash was influenced by many of the greats including Hendrix and Clapton, but ended up with his unique \\"double stop\\" guitar riffs, very reminiscent of Jimmy Page, but also with a nod to punk idol Steve Jones. Duff McKagan was more a product of the punk / alternative scene, and the bass lines reflect the same pumping energy of early punk. Izzy Stradlin is a strong songwriter, and his contribution to the bank was largely in securing the rhythm section while Slash went ballistic. In some ways his contribution to the band has been downplayed. Steven Adler was the best GNR drummer. While not as precise as Matt Sorum, on this album he played with an energy and intensity rarely felt.     Last, but not least, I turn to Axl Rose. This album tended to polarised opinion in the media given his unique voice. Given it is not necessarily the most accessable aspect of the band, I would say this is the area which would put you off if you describe your style as \\"adult contemporary\\". However, he is scarcely better than on this album.     If you knew the band the first time around, there is nothing I can now say to change your opinion. For those looking for classic rock, look no further.
0743298039|1.0|To counter the avalanche of praise heaped on this book, I'd like to add a couple of comments.  This book is an uneasy agglomeration of an Anita Brookner-style heroine/narrator and a gothic romance (more Victoria Holt, say, than Charlotte Bronte). Setterfield's prose style doesn't approach Brookner's level, and the gothic storyline seemed both underwritten -- particularly in terms of dialogue -- and mechanical.  SPOILER: I can't seem to read a novel these days without encountering incest as a plot device. Or strange twins.  Or strange Siamese twins. Yesterday's exotica is today's cliche.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This film is a masterpiece.  I will not pretend to analyze its deeper meanings, but if you've ever felt alone in a crowded room full of people you don't understand, you'll get it.  The soundtrack works flawlessly with the beautiful and sometimes haunting images that float through this film's landscape.  If you were a fan of truly alternative, clever music in the early eighties, then you will adore this lush soundscape.  To me, this film hits closer to the heart of people searching for meaning in a sometimes meaningless situation far more effectively than \\"American Beauty\\" attempted to or could have.  Have a glass or two of your favorite red, turn out the lights, and let this epic of jejune avoidance carry you away.
6305428220|5.0|I love this movie so worth getting shipped here, it's got everything except tear jerking moments (thankfully). It makes you hate people, laugh and jump once in a while. To me this is like the scream of invasion movies.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|Why there has been no sequel to this film baffles me.  It is an almost perfect depiction of life at sea during the Napoleanic Wars, and better yet, a multifaceted study of the human condition.  The acting and action is superb, the plot unerring, and if you love GREAT surround sound, it is as good as it gets.  I just wish they would continue the series.  If they can make 3 Spiderman films, why won't they continue this far more interesting vein?
B000V63BV8|4.0|this record follows to what i call the greatest album of all time appitite for destruction (1987) and gnr was still flying high of the album when they put out gnr lies. so there are two parts first half are live tracks off of the live like a sucide EP (1986) and the second half is acustic tracks that are very well played. for what it is it's good. Key Tracks  one in a million   i used to love her
B000HIVOI2|2.0|This I must say as a kid was my favorite movie. The Movie is good and that's what saves this. The reason I gave it two stars is because the video quality is horrible for bluray standards. I own other blurays and this is the worst I have seen. The special features are slim also. Back to quality of dvd the audio is great, picture is bad with signs of decent when there is light dark scenes look like standard early dvds. So just buy it on standard.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I bought Planet Earth Blu-ray for my dad for Father's Day.  We watched a bit of it together, and it was fantastic! The scenery is breathtakingly beautiful.  Even the kids loved it.  My dad has watched all of the disks and enjoyed every minute.  He will watch them over and over again.  Highly recommended, a must if you have an HD TV and Blu-ray player to really show off what your television can do!!
0634049011|5.0|I took lessons for about 5 years, and I have been playing guitar for over 20 years, took a couple year break, and got back into it. I had learned the scales and did a lot of improvisation, but I was never able to easily find the note I was looking for without searching for it by ear. After reading the 1st chapter or 2 and doing the exercises I am easily able to find the notes anywhere on the fretboard, I wish I had read this book about 10 years ago.
B000P2A256|5.0|This CD sounds nothing like songs about jane, probably because the band switched their drummer due to permant injuries. I do think this is a great album though. Both of their albums are great and very different. I think Adams voice is just as good as ever. This Cd has more of a funky sound then their last one. If you want to hear songs about jane 2 don't expect it from this cd. If you like funk, alternative, rock, pop and soul then this is a good cd for you.
B001AP11KW|5.0|What I really appreciate in this album, and in Consolers of the Lonely for that matter, is the contrasting vocal work between the power pop style of Benson and the Detroit Blues style of White.  Seldom do you see a group these days with one good vocalist but this band has two. They made really good decisions with who should sing on which song also.  I would compare it to Daltrey and Townshend except more evenly distributed.
031236198X|5.0|This bok is a quick read, probably less than an hour.  The book talks about how to recognize when change is needed, and how to manage a group through the process of change, but does it in a fun way.  The book is a fable, the story of a group of penguins who discover that the iceberg they live on is melting, and have to figure out what (if anything) to do about it.      While it sounds silly, and does contain some humor, sometimes a simple story can convey many important lessons.  This is one of those times.  In reading the story, I kept thinking back to teams I'd worked on, and seeing similarities between particular colleagues and particular penguins.    As the authors point out at the end, much of the power of this story is in it's simplicity.  By stripping it down to the essential details, it's much easier to follow the process.  They also point out that if a group of people are all familiar with the story, it gives them a common language to use when dealing with these issues.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|So far I have returned 2 DVD's due to corrupt sectors. The quality is extremely poor and the script could have been written by a fifth grader. The movie continues in the same mundane direction that caused the series to fail. I was really looking forward to the movie but am totaly disapointed.   The original Stargate movie was great. The series SG-1 was great up to sometime in season 7. And, YES, I do have all 10 seasons of SG-1 along with all seasons of Atlantis! If I coulld have entered no stars, I would have.   Rent the movie first and if you like it, then buy it.
B000RZGIOA|5.0|Face/off is one of my favourites and i was looking forward for Months to watch it in HD format. I must admit they did a fantastic job transferring this classic to HD ... if you like this movie, you will LOVE it in Blu-ray.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|ALL THE GREATS AS LISTED IN OTHER REVIEWS, BUT FOR THOSE WHO THINK ITS FULL SCREEN ON A 16X9 TV,(LABEL DOES SAY 1.8 ASPECT RATION-IS MIS- LEADING), IT'S NOT. WE JUST WATCHED THE RETURN TO PERFECTION AND IN PLAYS NEAR A 2.2 RATIO. YOU WILL SEE THE BLACK BARS TOP AND BOTTOM. THIS IS STILL A GOOD SERIES TO HAVE. WE WILL STILL LOOK FOR A \\"TRUE\\" 16X9 WIDE SCREEN RELEASE.

B0001L3LUE|1.0|The old boy is a war criminal, remember that! The fog was in his head, when he helped to lie the USA into attacking a country that posed no threat to the USA or anyone else. (Sound familiar?)
B000065AI3|5.0|Back in 1976, what ruled the airwaves and sales charts was the likes of [[ASIN:B000002KGT Fleetwood Mac's Rumours]] and [[ASIN:B000056JYC Frampton Comes Alive!]]. Soft rock with rounded edges was the norm. So when a leather jacketed kid dropped a tightly wound rock record that was both punky and rocking, it caused a lot of folks to sit up and take notice...even if it didn't catch commercial fire. Tom Petty's debut album with The Heartbreakers barely broke the 30 minute mark, but its perfect mix of Stones/Byrds rock and emerging punk fire straddled both camps with ease and swagger.<br /><br />\\"Breakdown's\\" Top 40 breakthrough was revolutionary, as was the fact that \\"American Girl\\" was making inroads on classic rock radio (and remains a staple some 35 years later). This was a classic album in the 'band' sense, with Heartbreaker core members Mike Campbell on guitars and Benmont Tench on keyboards making contributions to what ultimately became Petty and the heartbreaker's ongoing sound. But the main thing about this debut is just how engaging it was, and how it still sounds fresh and exciting. You can hear the traces of [[ASIN:B000002O1P Southern Accents]] grandeur on \\"The Wild One Forever\\" and the folk-rock of [[ASIN:B000002MUN Wildflowers]] on \\"Mystery Man.\\"<br /><br />In other words, all the coming greatness in Petty and the Heartbreakers' future work. For their debut (and on [[ASIN:B000065AI4 You're Gonna Get It!]] to a lesser extent), Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers embraced all that was great in both American and classic British rock and made it their own.
B000077VPU|3.0|Who in heaven, being a video editor could possibly think on taking these four acts off this concert? I remember when I first saw them, they were one of the reasons that put me into rock n' roll. The rest of the performances are quite good, but you really need Metallica, Guns, Def an Extreme to really enjoy this concert. If it was for rights reasons, Queen are multi-millionaires! and we, their fans, buy ANYTHING they put out (just take a look at all the people giving five stars to Hot Space). I demand putting out a new version of this concert in its entirety!
0316143472|1.0|first i thought i am missing something but as i read it became so painfully dull ,not funny and finally plain boring really ,at the end i was not really interested anything he had to say, i guess you cant judge a book by its cover.
0451191153|4.0|this book is not on the same level of entertainment as atlas shrugged, but i did still very much enjoy it.  i find myself aggreeing with what ayn rand writes and find her philosophy very interesting and compelling
B0013FSL3E|5.0|It seems that Pixar can do no wrong. Again they've produced another masterpiece with the release of Wall-E, which is as lovable, captivating, and entertaining as all of the other Pixar films thus far. In spite of this, however, audiences should not be expecting the usual Pixar style with this movie. The focus is not necessarily on dialogue or humor in Wall-E, but rather takes a new approach which delivers the story at an angle which puts more emphasis on a fascinating series of events, impressive animation, and discovering an innovative way of looking at its characters. With most of the main characters being robots with mannerisms and speech patterns very different from past Pixar characters (such as bugs, humans, toys, or monsters), the movie proceeds in a very different fashion but pulls off the effect flawlessly. Even a few non-animated segments are blended into the film, but setting aside the differences I was still able to enjoy another fantastic movie from Pixar. I connected a lot with the characters of Wall-E and Eve, and very much liked the plot and depictions of the future. From the trailers you can hardly tell what the plot will be, which made me even more interested to see how things folded out. I highly recommend this movie, and rate it five stars. Even though it's not my favorite Pixar movie (I'd say it's better than Cars and Ratatouille at least), it's still a classic and well worth watching.
0061537934|5.0|The book the Art of Racing in the Rain was given to me as a gift from my dearest love. I was hesitant to reading it, because as a dog owner and lover, I can not bear reading it if the ending may be sour.     However after reading the first 10 pages of Enzo's story I was drawn in to his world. His world of our world is an amazing written experience that teaches you so many lessons that we've all forgotten as we've grown older. Its a wake up call to all of us who take being human for granted, its perks, its downfalls, and its subtle pleasures.     I will read this book again and save it for a rainy day. When I need to remember that there is more to life than that which is in front of me.     5 stars for Enzo!
B0001HAISG|5.0|i have seen peter pan played by an adult woman (mary martin).  also played by an adult man  (robin williams). in the awful \\"hook\\" version.  peter pan was a \\"boy\\". (all boys grow up, except one) so  they finally got that right.  and everything else about the movie.   the special effects and especially the flying was superb.    beautifully made,  and i enjoyed it so much i am thinking of buying another copy of it.   i just wish there could be a sequel.
B000001A3H|5.0|Being a qotsa fan I was very eager to here one of kyuss's finest albums if not my favorite next Welcome to Sky Valley. The riffage is sick. I don't think people understand that Homme is really a prodigy-this album came out when he was just 18 or 19 years old and to be playing at this level at such a young age -even for the best guitarist-is just boggling. Buy it; love it and enjoy the exceptional and irreplaceble talent that was Kyuss.
B000002KY8|5.0|Wh many people will point at either Purple Rain or Sign 'o' The Times as his best albu, that title goes to Prince's 5th album, 1999. This album is not only His Royal Badness at his best, but in my opinion, is the greatest album ever made. 1999 put Prince on map and made him a crossover star, with the 3 hit singles \\"1999\\", \\"Little Red Corvette\\", and \\"Delirious\\".  But its not just those songs. Others include \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\", \\"DMSR\\", \\"Automatic\\", and so on.  Honestly, this album is perfect from start to finish. I recommend this for any R&B fan or Prince fan or music fan in genertal. Funk at its absolute best.
015603283X|5.0|Usually when I view a movie (in this case The Nine Gates), if I see it is based on a book, I read the book.  As usual, don't expect the book to be the same as the movie, although it comes close in some areas.  The book was far better and was more \\"gripping\\". However, you had to be familiar with Dumas' The Three Musketeers (not the movie, although watching that would help)to make the book come to life.  You can't go wrong here.  What is even better is the author gives you a bit of an biographical history of Dumas himself which is a plus.  You like this one.  Don't miss it.
B00000I9P0|4.0|It's not the best soundtrack from the eighties, but there are a couple of excellent songs on this CD. \\"Voice of America Sons\\" being the top notch, and maybe one of the hidden pearls of the eighties. If you like the 80's this CD also has one of the most influential songs in \\"Feel the Heat\\" which is a song featured on some techno [...] we hear a lot today in clubs. Maybe you hate the movie, but the CD is a great asset specially for those 2 songs.
0375703861|1.0|Smith's book starts out alright but quickly deteriorates.  I was not impressed with Smith's ability to tell a story or develop characters.  There are so many good writers to read-- old classics as well as new young ones.  I would not waste my time with another one of her books.
B0011NVC9I|4.0|Beowulf is a great movie, I think it's the future of animation, when I saw this on the big screen I was blown away with this movie, great scenes and from time to time you forgot you were watching an animated movie.<br /><br />Using the same technique as in \\"The Polar Express\\" but better, director Robert Zemeckis capture the live performance of actors like Ray Winstone, Anthony Hopkins, Robin Wright Penn and Angelina Jolie among others. On the movie \\"Polar Express\\" it was a bummer seeing Tom Hanks on almost every scene, here we enjoy a really good movie done in a proper way.<br /><br />The script is good, but the visuals is what captures you from the start.<br /><br />However my complain is on the extras, there are a lot of featurettes, some are very interesting, even if they are really short. The problem is a movie like this deserves commentary from the director which is nowhere to be found. Also there is little input on how Angelina Jolie delivered such a powerful character as Grendel's mother.<br /><br />There are deleted scenes, but they are more like incomplete scenes with no texture. I think it was kinda rip off.<br /><br />This DVD claims it has more intense scenes not seen in theaters, but the scenes are inserted on the full movie, there is no option to see the theatrical release and the director's cut, you only guess there are more scenes on there but you aren't really not sure because there are no commentaries.<br /><br />Buy it for the movie itself, still delivers !
1577314808|5.0|sometimes hard to get through but very good concept and oh so true. read through a few times till you get it
B00005JMYI|2.0|I wanted to like this film, I enjoy Will ferrell's work, but-----this film just doesn't cut it. Paul Rudd as the macho Geraldo like reporter is very good, (talking about how he was \\"in love\\") and Ron Burgendy says: \\"I don't think that's love.\\" etc..... so there are some good moments in the movie. Christina Applegate was a big drag on the film for me. She did not have the sexual chrisma that shows up on camera. She's pretty enough, but she does not have what it takes for the big screen. All in all, now worth any more time.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|Along with \\"Beautiful Thing\\" and \\"Yossi and Jaeger,\\" Shelter takes its seat as a likable and pretty love story. This is the second movie about gay surfers I have seen along with the Australian flick \\"Tan Line.\\" In what is considered a predominantly straight world, surfers, both of these movies explore the possibilities of gays among the ranks of these members.<br /><br />There seem to be a great deal of reviewers with huge amounts of information about the movie so I am going to be brief. The movie is about the love that develops between two surfers Shaun (Brad Rowe) and Zack (Trevor Wright.) Zack comes from a dysfunctional family with a sister who is a single mother and her son Cody. Zack pretty much plays a father role to Cody and babysits him a lot. Shaun comes from a rich family who has a house by the beach. They both grew up together but Shaun being older than Zack. Shaun's brother is Zack's buddy.<br /><br />Zack discovers he is gay after one night of drinking with Shaun. Shaun has just returned from LA who just broke with someone and was waiting to get a new place. Shaun kisses Zack and the turmoil begins.<br /><br />Jeannie, Zack's sister, decides to move to Oregon with her new boyfriend. She dumps Cody on Zack. Zack finally comes to grips with his sexuality and decides to become a family with Shaun who adopts Zack and Cody.<br /><br />Zack is a very talented artist who gets accepted to an Art College with a full scholarship. Shaun is a writer for Hollywood. And Jeannie abandons her son.<br /><br />That is the movie in a shell. I like how Zack is portrayed as a caring, selfless, loving young man. The movie also projects that a men gay couple can be loving parents, that is definitely a plus.<br /><br />This a good movie and a great love story. The men look very masculine, with Trevor Wright having that beautiful rough exterior. Wonderful cast and super job for the director.
B00006FM77|5.0|I've been a Chicago fan for a lot of years (primarily the first half of their catalog and for some reason I always held off on purchasing this live set.  I missed a lot of good music.  This is Chicago really cutting loose.  You can really see how much Terry Kath meant to the band as his amazing guitar work is all over this set.  The recording quality is excellent for a live show and the band does seem to stretch out a fair amount.  I strongly recommend this for any fan of the Chicago in their prime.  The bonus disc really changes this from a great package to an incredible value for the price.  Highly recommended.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|The Brits, who put us to shame when it comes to mysteries and complex characterization, hsve done it again with this brilliant miniseries. Cast is superb, although the Engish subtitles should be used to pick up the dialogue from the Scottish reporter. The multi-talented Bill Nighy stands apart as the wily editor. His sly mannerisms and droll humor are a hoot. Don't miss this exceptional DVD.
B000002JSJ|4.0|A local classic rock radio outlet favors lite songs out of the Zep catalog - \\"Over the Hills and Far Away\\" and D'yer Maker?\\"...nothing out of the angst-filled Presence makes the cut by that standard. This is Zep for after the party's over and the girls have gone home and you're just a guy who wants to conquer the world with his beatup six-string. And of course if you're a punk, retro or not, you want to stomp all over rich rock star angst with your gnarly thrash boots, even if the angst is heartfelt and produces an underrated rock gem.    \\"Achilles Last Stand\\" easily dominates this album, and quite a few fans will buttonhole you about the song's merits if given encouragement. Plant meditates on (rock) heroism and mortality (I like the caterwauling vocalizations), Jones fills all available sonic space with bass and (I think) subtle Rhodes piano. Bonham gallops and marches and plays the \\"lots of birds were flown\\" \\"boompity boompity boom!\\" figure. Page plays a nice solo, reminiscent of a heroic aria, and it fits right in with the tone of the song. Typically, Page introduces several distinct hard-to-reproduce-live guitar voices. Also, I think the song may have the best use of fade-out (and fade-in), and this was a time when a fadeout at the end of your ten minute rock epic was perfectly acceptable.    I understand Zep used some sped-up tape to move the pace of the song along, which I'm sure isn't proper speed metal protocol AT ALL, but I think this 1976 tune sent a lot of rock rhythm players to the woodshed to help spawn the \\"British New Wave of Heavy Metal\\" which in turn spawned Bay Area speed metal in the Eighties, and various metal/hardcore cross-pollinations thereafter.    Recommended. Album tracks range from excellent to okay, but \\"Achilles\\" is a must-listen for a young rocker who has ambitions about virtuosity, longer forms and deeper textures.
B001ANE3EA|5.0|I like the Maroon 5's debut Cd. I was wondering for a long time wether I should buy It Won't Be Soon Before Long. I'm glad I thought about it for such a long time because that allowed me to buy the deluxe edition. I love it. I liked all the songs instantly. But my favorites are: Makes Me Wonder and If I never see your Face Again. If you haven't bought this cd yet, buy the deluxe edition!
B0015FHDRW|5.0|All three members of Green Day, Tre on drums, Mike on bass, and Billie Joe on guitar and lead vocals! Foxboro Hot Tub's Stop, Drop, and Roll!!! is a throwback to Green Day's earlier music, with a bit of the 60's thrown in for good measure and variety.  The songs \\"Mother Mary\\" and \\"The Pedestrian\\" stand out and are catchy and charming.  Any fan of Green Day or the poppier side of punk will enjoy this album.  It's awesome!
055358894X|4.0|I've read many of the thoughtful and honest responses to the book.  Although I agree that there are too many flashbacks and some superfluous scenes, this book kept me rapt until I finished the last word.  A phenomenal first effort and a great mix of excitement, intrigue, and pure fun.  I recommended it to my brother (who is not a F&SF fan by any means) because it has the ability to resonate with non-fantasy folk. He LOVED it.  I couldn't help but get attached to Locke and his artful dodger antics.  Not a children's book, but appealed to the child in me.  I highly recommend it!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband read this book and, even though movie versions of books are usually somewhat disappointing, he really enjoyed this mini-series.  I thought it was fantastic, well portrayed and very enjoyable.
1846859816|4.0|From the outset, Wilkie Collins's 1868 \\"sensation novel\\" keeps the reader entertained and engaged as a priceless yellow diamond, stolen from a Hindu religious statue of the Moon God in India in 1799, works its black magic and controls the action. Rachel Verinder, heir of Colonel John Herncastle, who murdered to obtain the jewel during the battle of Seringapatam, inherits this possibly cursed treasure on her eighteenth birthday in 1848, only to have it vanish before she can put it into the bank. Drawing on sensational details--three Indian \\"jugglers\\" who approach the house to perform a juggling act, the disappearance of the jewel from an Indian cabinet during the night, the certainty that the theft was an inside job, a housemaid with a criminal past, and a paint smudge on night clothing--Collins creates a haunting atmosphere and builds suspense.<br /><br />Telling the story is Gabriel Betteredge, the house steward, a man who has been asked to set down his recollections by Franklin Blake, who was present in the house at the time of the jewel's disappearance, and who is in love with Rachel Verinder. Betteredge is a delightful story-teller, providing details, humor, and suggestions about what happened with a conscientiousness that makes him a reliable narrator. As the story becomes more involved and the characters take on lives of their own, other narrators take up the story where Betteredge leaves off and provide new information.<br /><br />The second narrator, Miss Drusilla Clack, Rachel Verinder's cousin, is a \\"poor relation\\" who is also a religious fanatic, and her commentary and her behavior provide some of the funniest moments in Victorian literature. Collins's use of humor, in fact, is one of the ways in which he surpasses his friend, Charles Dickens, in keeping an audience entertained. Franklin Blake, rejected by Rachel, provides additional commentary about the events, as do a doctor and his assistant, a local police sergeant and his investigator, the family lawyer, and a traveler to India. The use of multiple points of view is one of the great advances Collins makes in the history of the novel. The fact that this is widely regarded as the first of the great mystery novels (though not dependent on a single detective) is another plus.<br /><br />Overall, the novel is surprisingly modern in its ability to appeal to a wide audience. Collins is adept at manipulating his readership and in keeping suspense high. His characters are often engaging and frequently humorous, and in its ability to deal with social issues of the day, the novel provides pertinent commentary about colonialism, religious fanaticism, and class issues. Collins never forgets, however, that he is writing to entertain, and in this he succeeds admirably.

B0011NVC9I|1.0|This re-telling of the great tale of Beowulf is an utter failure in every way.  The animation is dank, dark, dull.  The characters look more like uncomfortable robots than imitations of living creatures.  The basic story is trashed and Grendel's mother (the animated Jolie) is ridiculous.  Read the epic itself* or see the movie, \\"Beowulf and Grendel\\", if you must see it on the big screen.  But skip this awful interpretation.      *There are decent poetic translation by Frederick Rebsamen and Dick Ringler that are worth looking into if you really want to get what Beowulf is about.  A dramatic recitation is given by Benjamin Bagby in Anglo-Saxon (with subtitles) and is available on DVD - excerpts can be viewed on Youtube.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|This is one of the best John Wayne movies that I have ever seen. Very funny and exciting to watch. This is up there with Hatari! I would recommend this movie to everyone.
081186510X|5.0|David Belisle must really be close to the members of R.E.M. to get such intimate photos of the band, especially frontman Michael Stipe. Who else could get photos of the band using urinals, Michael Stipe shaving his head or just photos of band members napping? There's more to the book than that. I especially like the images taken before the Rock n Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony where we can peek in on Michael Stipe getting ready--putting on his clothes and waiting patiently in what looks like the back kitchen of the venue. R.E.M. fans will love this  book.
B0019HQIGS|5.0|It is amazing to watch Mr. John Mayer and the musicians he hangs with.   Guys old enough to be his father but Mayer showing that respect that can only come from a true music man!    His respect for the different genres and players of those genres is very appealing!  And did i say he plays the hell out of a guitar - cheez - that boy is on fire!!!!    Go Johhny, Go Johnny - Go Johnny GO!!!
B0019FOC5E|5.0|First saw the stage show when it opened in London.  Will not tell how many times I've seen it since (somewhat embarassing).  Got the film CD today and it is quite good.  There are enough new tweaks to keep it fresh and it certainly makes me want to see the film more than I did.  Very surprised at how well Meryl Streep sings, and I am not on the \\"bash Pierce\\" bandwagon.  He does quite well on \\"When All Is Said And Done.\\"  Heck, Bob Dylan can't sing and no one complains.  This is a great summer listen.
B00005JPNZ|2.0|Yes, I could blame Spielberg or Ford for going along with it, yes I could blame David Koepp for writing such a crap piece of screenplay, but George Lucas not only forced his first three SATR WARS prequels down our collective throats, but he passed on Frank Darabont's awesome Indy script only to have Koepp take it and screw it up.  MUCH worse.  IJATKOTCS COULD have been a good movie - but there was bad dialogue, awful characterizations, pointless action scenes, and a severe lack of plot.  All of the scenes in this movie existed in Darabont's version, only they were fleshed out, well-written, moved the plot along, and were true to the orignal characters.  There was no Tarzan-son (no son at all, actually), Marion wasn't some stupid moron smiling in the Amazon after being taken by Soviets, Oxley (the wasted genius of John Hurt) was a feral interesting animal, there was a snake joke that wasn't insipid and pointless, the ants made SENSE, the plot made SENSE, the waterfalls made SENSE and even the alien stuff at the end made SENSE.  But no, Lucas has to make everything lowest-common-denominator.<br /><br />This guy used to be my hero.  He's now a talentless bloated money whore.  And the fact that my two uber-heroes, Spielberg and Ford agreed to make this version of the story is disappointing on a level I can't even explain.<br /><br />Anyone who thinks this was total fun and almost as good as RAIDERS (my favorite film of all time) doesn't understand story, character or quality cinema.  This movie should be called \\"The Mummy\\" and not have such A-list stars attached - then it might be forgivable.  As it is, it's just a crap piece of cinema.  And I'm very depressed.<br /><br />The only reason this gets more than one star from me is that I've been following the pre- post- and production of this movie and have been so excited for so long that part of me hopes that I'm in a nightmare and I'll get the Darabont version when it comes out on DVD.

0316143472|4.0|this group of stories are about David and his adult life.  they are less outrageously funny, but interesting and as enjoyable in their own way as his earlier ones.  they are also more reflective.  for example, he writes compellingly of fidelity. if you enjoy his writing, you'll enjoy these!
0316143472|4.0|When You Are Engulfed In Flames is a solid four-stars and damn near close to five; we'll settle for 4.5. But then again, I'm a serious Sedaris fiend.<br /><br />By now, you (dear reader) have already made up your mind about David Sedaris and have either worked your way through this collection or else long ago discarded him, irrelevant as an expended filter tip.<br /><br />So if you find yourself in the former category then by all means, read on.<br /><br />When You Are Engulfed In Flames makes Sedaris' previous collection, Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, seem like a disaster, a complete train wreck.  Which is unfair because I think that Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim is a strong collection with some exemplary essays. And also because I get the feeling that it was a more personal werk for him, that he's a bit more exposed and vulnerable in those essays.<br /><br />Thematically, When You Are Engulfed In Flames is a reprise of Me Talk Pretty One Day -- highly focused on language and style, on the humanity of humiliation and (to echo some other reviewers) those dark places where our sentimentality tends to get the best of us. But it's a counterpoint melody to Me Talk Pretty One Day -- arrogant where the other was modest, chagrined where the other took delight.<br /><br />Structurally, this collection is an echo of Naked, though perhaps a bit more mature.  As I wrote of DFW's Consider the Lobster, the essays are arranged well, jokes from earlier essays recurring, serving to inform your later tittering.  That said, the individual essays seem to follow a rhythm that is new for Sedaris. If this were an elementary school music class, I would say that his earlier essays have a rhyme scheme that goes ABAB, these are turned more toward ABCA.<br /><br />It seems a cop-out to recommend this collection.  Those that are already turned on to Sedaris are unlikely to be disappointed; those that didn't much care for him in the first place won't find anything to change their opinions.  Anyone with previous exposure is likely to see symptoms of his previous werks; I suppose the difference is whether you carry the antibodies?their opinions.

0793563836|3.0|This is a very good book if you already have the basics of reading music. Gives more emphasis to playing than practicing hand/fingering technics. Not realy for a first time player.

B00011F5DK|5.0|I recently got this for my boys, and our whole family loved it so much that I ended up getting one for both my step-father and my father-in-law for Father's Day!
B0013J30W2|5.0|Having become a tad disillusioned with the endless stream of mind-numbing action fare churned out by the Hollywood film industry, I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which boasts a terrific cast, is helmed by an accomplished non-American director, and though very loosely based on the Mark Millar / JG Jones comic series, still comes through with a coherent and compelling plotline, thanks to a team of great scriptwriters.    Special mention goes to Morgan Freeman and Angelina Jolie, who handle their roles wonderfully. I've always been a fan of both actors, but having them in the same film in close proximity is a huge bonus.    Director Timur Bekmambetov demonstrates artistic flair in staging complex, violent action sequences. He's quite the expert at hurling moving objects of various sizes in all directions ( already evident from his Night Watch days ), be it a locomotive, a sports car, or a shiny bullet engraved with the word \\"GOODBYE\\". It's still too early to know whether his creativity will stand the test of time, but for now, he's giving the Americans a run for their money.    Danny Elfman's soundtrack for this film is vastly different from his previous work ( e.g. Batman, The Simpsons, Desperate Housewives, just to name a few ). He has composed an outstanding score for Wanted, giving the movie that extra oomph with its hard-rock riffs and the occasionally playful guitar theme ( which you hear often in the trailers ). I don't know if many people even pay attention to the soundtrack when there's so much else going on, but I really loved it.    Of course, my final kudos go to none other than James McAvoy, who's always dependable as a dedicated character actor, and portrays Wesley Gibson perfectly. He has the right look ( a bit geeky, but boyishly handsome ), the right physique ( he's 5 ft 7 in ), the right voice, and those eyes - they beat Tobey Maguire's hands down.    Credit goes to those who were brave - and intuitive - enough to cast him in spite of his Scottish accent and previously unproven box-office power. McAvoy is clearly able to handle any role with ease, and he is a potent mixture of lovable, funny and sexy qualities here.     I'm going to pre-order the DVD the minute it's available.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My husband and I loved the book and couldn't wait for the miniseries to come out. We felt that the actors made the people come to life. The make up was so believable as the Adamses aged. We are history nuts and this film was a pleasure!
0743454537|2.0|It angers me that so many people seem to have enjoyed this book.  Personally, I found it cliché and melodramatic.  The author tries to use a provactive premise to hide shoddy writing and bland characters.  Those who know anything about court procedures claim that this book is devastatingly under researched.  I do not know anything about our judicial system, but the author's lack of research and fondness for clichés showed itself for me in another instance.  The male lawyer (I do not feel like getting up to find his name) was describing how attractive and unique he found the female lawyer and claimed \\"she's the only woman I've ever known who likes her tea with milk and lemon\\" (groan).  Anyways, this annoyed me to no end because it was obvious the author didn't realize that the reason people tend to avoid putting milk and lemon in their tea is not because of any sort of odd flavor that would result, it's because the acid in the lemon would curdle the milk.  It seems nitpicky but it made it clear that Picoult is an undiscipled writer if she's willing to make such a silly mistake.  As for that ending that everyone rants about, the rest of the book didn't make me expect anything better.  The melodrama and clichés did not lead me to believe that she would have anything intelligent to say in the end.
0060849827|4.0|put it in your pocket.it will fit.not comfortably ,but it will fit.better yet,put it in your fanny pack.wrapped in a ziploc bag.this is not the'be all,end all'of survival books.none is.in fact,i am going to make a recomendation that the publisher will love,though you may not.buy the larger text of this book.read it.over and over.along with your other books on the subject.you need a small library on any subject that interests you.why 2 copies? because reading the small volume will make it expand and loosen the binding(note to publisher..waterproof paper in the next edition).yes the text is small,but you have a magnifying glass in your kit(if not..read the bloody book again).also when out in the boonies...you have something to read.i know that sounds silly...but you arent always going to be chased by bears.even in a survival situation you will have 'down time'.use it.anouther 'extra' with this in your kit.you have something to burn(after you read it naturally).at this price and this size..there is no excuse not to have a copy in your kit.four stars..but it just missed five.happy camping.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|This Album is absolutely AWESOME!!! Every song is so different from the one it follows. I have been listening to it everyday since I bought it on May 20 and I just can't get enough of it. The different song styles never allows you to get bored of this wonderful album unlike some other singers that have also released new albums. Although they are pretty good albums the song styles are so similar that half way through their albums I lost interest. Each song sounded similar to the one before and the one after. That DOES NOT happen with \\"CRAYONS\\". This Album is DEFINITELY worth buying and by the time you listen to the last track \\"Bring down the Reign\\" you can't wait for the album to start all over again with \\"Stamp your feet\\". Donna's voice is still as STRONG as when she first started. This was definitely worth the wait, but I hope Burgundy Records and Donna Summer don't make us wait too long for a follow up to this Incredible Album.
0060594896|5.0|This comprehensive book is an encyclopedia of success principles unfolded in a logical sequence that will give anyone willing to put in the effort a blueprint for success. Canfield guides you through the 64 principles with plenty of examples, exercises, and real-life success stories that he is so good at telling.<br /><br />The formula he uses is an effective teaching method. A success principle is presented, then a story about how someone applied the principle, or an example of an application, and then an instruction for applying the principle by the reader.<br /><br />Many of the ideas I have read before but Canfield puts them altogether in one volume. He credits much of the material to his mentor, W. Clement Stone, as well as his coaches,  including Dan Sullivan. And he quotes many famous successful people throughout the book.<br /><br />Some of the book's principles that really resonate with me are \\"Take 100% responsibility for your life\\", \\"Reject rejection\\", \\"Ask for what you want\\", \\"Transcend your limiting beliefs\\", and \\"Make a 100% commitment\\".<br /><br />I think the material in this book is as valuable for the CEO of a big corporation as it is for a mother with a home-based business. Reading and applying the principles is like taking a course in self-development, success fundamentals, team building, money management, and motivational therapy, all rolled into one. My recommendation is to not only read and study the book, but also keep it on hand as a reference book, especially for the times when you feel stuck or challenged. It will pull you through the down times.<br /><br />And it wouldn't hurt to use this book as a textbook for high-school seniors. If they read this before embarking on their life journey, it would be a lot easier and more fun.

B000XUUQQK|2.0|Boogeyman 2 has nothing to do with the first movie. Unless it's supposed to be the kids in it, but I don't wish to go out and rent it again to find out.     So this chick enters a psychiatric ward cause shes afraid of the boogeyman. Her brother was recently there and it seems the boogeyman got to him. Some of the other patients in there are afraid of similar things and it gets worse for them when they start getting killed off one by one.    This is far from original, and I probably would have given it 3 stars if it wasn't supposed to be a sequel to a movie it has nothing to do with. It won't surprise me if there is a Boogeyman 3 in the works and a completely different story again. They should know by now those attempts never go over well, bad movie or not.    It goes for the typical done to death attempt at some kind of twist at the end, but like I said, it's been to done to death and does nothing for this film.    If your a fan of B-grade horrors, this ones pretty average. It might be OK for a one night popcorn flick, but once you've seen it, I doubt you will ever feel the urge to watch it ever again.    Just for the hell of adding it, the blond who gets naked in this movie made me want to puke... she can hold her head up high knowing now how much she helped this movie out by doing that... that was about the only thing scary to see in this movie.
B000YAA68W|4.0|PERSEPOLIS is a terrific film that portrays a young girl's coming of age process against the background of political change in Iran.  The rule of the Shah is finally overthrown amidst much optimism for a better life.  Instead, the Islamic Republic fundamentalists who take over turn out to be even more oppressive than the Shah.  As The Who sang, \\"Meet the new boss/Same as the old boss.\\"  The film stops short of extending its time-line to the current Islamo-fascists and nuke-happy nut-job at Iran's helm currently.    Not that the West comes off much better in this tale.  Marjane - the main character - lives part of her life in Western Europe but finds that it has its own problems, though torture and religious inspired oppression does not seem to be among them.  There are interesting and touching bits of dialogue between Marjane and God, trying to find meaning in the suffering that she witnesses.    PERSEPOLIS is a wonderful film that casts a dismal pall over man's ability to get it right in the realm of political change.  It is effective in spotlighting \\"man's inhumanity to man,\\" and portraying the conflicts of an Iranian woman who is both rooted to and alienated from her homeland.

0743290119|1.0|This book is a waste of time.  The characters are all unlikeable and for women on the verge of thirty they all seem to be more teenagers on the verge of 13.  Adriana is particularly childish in her reactions to her mother - screaming at her mother in one part of the book. The conclusion of the book says that they are all women now.  I beg to differ.  I slogged through this book but it was really terrible.
0060763892|2.0|I'm being generous and giving this book an extra star for its concept. However, there really is nothing to recommend about the story. It's another 'series' book in which the author doesn't really bother giving uninitiated readers a chance to catch up on who's who. Then again, it probably wouldn't have mattered.The characters are very shallow, even for such a 'heavy on action, light on characterization' story.  Things got even more convoluted, and less credible, near the end, and Rollins clearly struggled trying to tie everything together. At least it wasn't the 'Dan Brown' ripoff I was expecting it to be.  I think I'll pass on Rollins' other work.
B00006LJ72|5.0|This is a fabulous collection, with most of her amazing works.  Well worth  buying
B000W9MMPU|4.0|This is a good set to own, with Ocean's 11 being a classic and 13 being pretty darn good. Only Ocean's 12, which is fairly abissmal, prevents a five star rating.
B000P2A256|4.0|I don't follow this band, but I was listening to the newest cd and alot of the tracks sound like a newer version of a cd put out by Jackson 5.  Like a 2000 version of the Victory cd.  Especially the tracks - Make Me Wonder and Kiwi.  Most all of those songs have the a bit of that sound.  Well, maybe they did pull from the past.  Jackson 5 -- Now Maroon 5.  Sounds good though.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Maybe it is the fact that this was the first movie I have seen on Blu-Ray or the fact this is a Bond film with a new Bond, but I loved it.  The action sequences were awesome, they went back to Bond being a spy instead of relying on far fetched gadgetry.  Daniel Craig played the part well having the quick wit and the confidence needed to play the part.    On Blu-Ray this movie was amazing. The sound was extraordinary and the visuals something to behold.  The details were crisp and there basically no artifacts or broken screens throughout the film.    The only part about the movie I didn't like was for a spy Bond blew up a lot of things, and seemed to take to violence rather than stealth.  Oh well.  That's Hollywood nowadays!    Can't wait for the next one.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|As my husband and I were going into see Wall-E tonight a police officer who was in front of the movie theatre said to us \\"You'll love it.  I loved it, my mom loved it.  You'll feel all the emotions there are--laughing, crying, everything.\\"  I was a bit skeptical that an animated film could really have all of these things--not just shadows of adult emotions--but I was wrong, she really summed it up.<br /><br />My husband and I both really enjoyed Wall-E.  It didn't matter that there wasn't a lot of dialogue or that the humans were portrayed in an unflattering light (no Disney Princesses here!).  All of the emotions were displayed through the actions of the characters, and the animators did a wonderful job of creating a powerful narrative.<br /><br />That being said, I don't know if I agree with the reviewers who say that this is a good movie for kids.  Like last summer's Ratatouille, which my 4 year old niece said was \\"gross\\", Wall-E lacks lovable, cuddly characters, and is filled with the underside of life, in Wall-E's case, lots of trash leftover from human consumption.  The couple of children that were in the showing I saw seemed bored during key parts of the movie (they were probably about 3 and 7) and afterwards were complaining to their parents.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to adults and older children, but I would caution parents of very young children that this may not be the movie for them.  This is more than a kids movie with adult themes, it is an animated adult film.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I was impressed how good the quality was on the dvd's.  I wasn't expecting the compression ratio to be quiet as good as it was.  If you're a Star Trek fan you won't be dissapointed.
B000YENUI6|4.0|As most reviewers have noted, Viggo is the story of this movie.  He gives an award-winning caliber performance as Nikolai, a on the rise chaffeur to a Russian gangster in London.  What makes Viggo's performance great is the control and restraint he delivers as well as the anger and violence he exhibits at other moments.  My two complaints and reason for a four are:  (1)  I thought Naomi Watts was lifeless as a midwife that enters this unseemly underworld of crime.  At times, I was frustrated by her seeming naievete and cluelessness to the situations she put herself in.  (2)  Without revealing any of the ending, I was a bit disappointed in the ending of the movie.  While i don't like neat endings, the ending felt a little too abrupt in many ways and too tidy in others.  Lastly, I felt Cronenberg was more judicious in his use of screen violence in the film.<br /><br />While there were a few hard-to-watch scenes, they contributed to and added dimension to the movie, rather than being gratuitous.  The reality is the world of organized crime is a brutal and violent world and not reflecting that would have raised questions about the authenticity of the world he was portraying.  Additionally, the performances by Armin Mueller-Stahl (Semyon) and Vincent Cassel (Kirill) as father and son gangsters are top-notch.<br /><br />Overall, this is a movie worth seeing, especially for the powerful performance by Mortensen.
0142403873|3.0|My husband and I found the book very cute, nicely illustrated, and of course you can't beat the title.  No wonder there are no bad reviews posted.  It took our 4-yr old daughter to point out the obvious: the mouse lies to everyone to protect himself.  Which mommy and daddy have worked hard to convince her is NOT a good thing to do.  Oops!  I suspect we'll have the same issue with many of the world's folk tales...
1591841666|5.0|It's a short book, but I'll summarize it shorter:    If things start to suck on the way to being the best in the world at something, don't quit. Otherwise, don't even wait for things to suck.  Just quit. Because things will suck before they get great. But being the best is worth all the suck there is.     That's the dip.    So why buy the book?  Why go to church if you already know the story?  Why go to the gym if you've already been? This stuff is so fundamental and so NOT common sense that you just can't be charmingly reminded often enough.    I've bought it and given it away about ten times.    Get the dip.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I'm so glad that Season 1 has finally made it to DVD. \\"Mad Men\\" is insightful and smart as well as visually stunning. I loved the series, and wanted it on DVD, but wondered if I would actually watch it once I got it. The answer is a resounding yes! Watching it again, I find that I catch little details and snippets of background dialogue that I missed on first viewing. I got it yesterday and have already watched two of the four DVD's. It's even more delicious on second viewing. I will definitely watch this again and again. I can't wait for Season 2.

0316143472|5.0|This book is a collection of essays about the interests and experiences of David Sedaris.  He is a well travelled, intelligent, curious man.  My favorite chapter is The Smoking Section.  This is about the three months he spent living in Tokyo while trying to quit smoking, eating raw horse meat and struggling to learn the Japanese language.  I also liked the chapter about his strange tastes in paintings and how his family shared his love of art while he was growing up.  I also enjoyed the chapter where he talks about his fascination with giving names to spiders and keeping them as pets.  He talks about some people that made an impression on him.  He talks about a lazy baby sitter he had when he was young.  I also enjoyed reading about about a crusty old woman named Helen who Sedaris lived with when he worked in New York as a house cleaner.  She had a passion for Italian cooking.  I liked reading about his interests in crossword puzzles and his fascination with how people die.  He devotes a whole chapter about buying a skeleton for his boyfriend Hugh as a gift.  This chapter is pretty funny.  He spends a lot of time travelling on airplanes, so he talks about the people that he meets on them in several chapters.  I like the chapter Crybaby where he talks about sitting next to a man on an airplane whose mother has just died.  This chapter shows the compassionate side of the author.  I really liked reading this book.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season 2 of LOST is a solid follow up to the first season.  It had me glued to the TV set each night and talking about it the next morning.<br /><br />We get some answers, but double the questions are raised in this season, this becomes a pattern with the season to follow as well.  BUT, what the story did tell us, about the island and the characters, was fascenating.  Some of it even more so than the first season.  The reason I love LOST though, is that it's just the best drama out there!  It's so unique from anything I've ever watched.  It's unconventional and out of the box.  It's thrilling and fast paced.  It's spooky and shocking.  It's emotional and dramatic.  It's even fun and entertaining.  It's everything I like in a show.
B00003CX8N|5.0|This is a charming account of a long distance relationship built up over a number of years generated by a love of books. I love books and movies about people who are 4 dimensional, not just characters.  The actors are also favorites of mine.  Anne Bancroft, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Dame Judi Dench as well as the supporting cast make the characters very real and the viewer cares about them.   I wonder how many of us when we're involved in conducting some kind of business through the mail, over the phone or the Internet think about the person at the other end of the line or connection.  That person may have a wife/husband, children, may be caring for elderly parents or suffering from some chronic disability.  They, too, are human beings deserving of respect and concern.   They are not just voices or    dictators of a piece of mail.

Buy it you will not regret it.    I just feel they could have made it a little bit longer and more fighting at the end.    The Car and Truck accident in the movie is absolutely out of this world, I love watching that part about 3 times before continuing with the movie.    Just buy it!!!!!!!!!!
0060555661|5.0|Simple like that: if you are a layman investor and don't want to lose a dime, stop your investment actions right now and start reading this book immediately.    I've started composing my stock portfolio a couple of months, before reading this book. At that time, I didn't know any of the Graham's wise lessons and took many decisions, some Graham-complying ones and some not. After six months, all bets on companies in a strong financial position, with a dividend payment history of more than 20 years, offering shares with a discount as consequence of the market fluctuation, and so on, proved to be right, even during crisis time.    A must read book for anyone aspiring to be a fraction of what a true investor is.
B0009X7664|5.0|I viewed this movie on a 46\\" widscreeen Samsung LCD HDTV played on a Toshiba XA-2 HD DVD player that upscales to 1080p.  The image quality of this movie is without a doubt the best black and white presentation I have seen for a non-HD movie.  I sincerely wish all older movies looked and sounded as good as this one does.  As others have so adeptly pointed out, To Kill A Mockingbird is a classic American movie made from a classic American novel.  I can't think of any other movie that so completely captured the eloquence and ethos of a bygone era.  If you already know and love this move, this presentation of it is unparalled.  If you haven't seen it or if you haven't seen it in a long, long time, I assure you that are going to love it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The book was genius, and the HBO miniseries lives up to that standard from beginning to end.  The actors truly bring to life the author's \\"warts and all\\" vision of our founding fathers.  Everyday facts of life in the late 1700s will strike you in ways they never occurred to you while studying history - for example, when you read in school that John Adams spent years in Europe, first looking for supporters for the revolution, then representing the new country as ambassador, did it ever occur to you that he would return home to adult children he wouldn't recognize, because he hadn't seen them since they were toddlers?    Everything from the acting to the directing to the sets, costumes and makeup is perfect.  Don't miss this!
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Season 4 of LOST finally begins giving us some solid answers to questions that were plaguing us.  We also begin seeing \\"the future\\" vs. the past for the characters.  This season really renewed by love for LOST, which after season 3 I was beginning to wonder where this was going.  With Season 4, you'll have a much better idea where this is headed.<br /><br />Season 4 also introduces us to some new and interesting characters.  We also see some old familiar faces.  With each episode this season gets better and better.  Season 4 is a thrill-ride, a nail-biter.  The acting gets even better.  Yes, it's a shortened season, but I think even still this may be the best season since the first.  If you don't want to pay the cost to buy this DVD, rent it from your video store.  Either way, this is a great season that you don't want to miss out on!!

0375703764|5.0|So here we go.<br />I read some of the reviews before mine, and I must disagree with some of them...I first read this book when I was 19 and I didn't find it \\"challenging \\" in anyway if anything, this is the first literature piece that I have encounter , that makes you interact with it , to reveal secrets, and to be able to understand more, also it isn't scary in anyway as some people have described it. If I were to warn you about one thing, it would be that when you do read it, you feel emotionally strong enough, because it WILL definitely depress you , also don't get scared by the thickness of the book, since as you read, you'll find out that some of the pages consist of only ten words, some of one, and some of none at all...<br />I hope you are lucky enough to read this...Trust me you won't regret it.I have shared my copy with 13 people so far, and only 1 of them didn't enjoy it,but not because it was bad, but in his words simply\\" just, too depressive\\"
B0014I4KIK|5.0|I saw the video \\"Mercy\\", which led me to check out the CD.  Very few times does it happen that I fall in love with a CD from the first time I play it.  Usually it grows on me as I learn to appreciate certain songs.  This CD is HOT FROM THE START! All the songs are good, but some are brilliant. I am blown away by this girl and her songwriting team.  Thanks for the pleasure, Duffy!
B0010ZR160|5.0|A lot of people here said they hated this movie because they hated the ending.  That's how you're SUPPOSED to feel!  I love complicated stuff, and this movie is full of complications.  Issues of morality and what exactly is the \\"right thing\\" pervade the plot and really make you think.  Definitely a movie that carries a lot of baggage but doesn't seem to hit you over the head with it.  Love that.
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Not much can be added to the long list of superlatives I have been reading...    This is the third studio album and despite a few changes in personnel it has been a case of ratcheting up the ante time after time...! This band is doing the term ROCK every justice! This is brutally uncompromising powerful rock. The genre is richer for it. I have always enjoyed Shinedown, but this is one of those albums which has had the inevitable outcome of having me scratch around and revisit every song in the Shinedown archive...    The vocal and instrumental range is absolutely stunning. Lyrically not over complicated, but immensely immersive at times and simple where it's called for. This Band has for me just shifted from great, (kinda top twenty rock and alt metal outfits) to Awesome, top three !!    There is no question that every track will be committed to memory in the \\"know who this is, which album it is, the song name and where the song fits in the album\\" cabinet in my memory, unlike so much material which lands up in the \\"Know it but not sure who, which album, when..\\"    Truly an instant classic!    Shine On Shinedown
B00005JO9J|5.0|I think it was two episodes into the first season of Grey's Anatomy, and I was hooked!  Thank god...something better than all of the boring rehashed dribble they are putting on TV lately.  It was about time we had something original to watch- original storylines as well as unique characters.  Grey's is entertaining, intelligent, sexy, fun, thought-provoking and shocking.<br /><br />I think what draws so many people to Grey's is that it has a good MIX- a dramatic show with medical emergencies, but it also is about the love lives and professional careers of the staff.  They have a fine balance between the two where neither take over, and the same for the characters, they each get their own storylines.  The staff is so enjoyable because the characters are so diverse, it's not just a show full of only dating or all married people.<br /><br />Season 1 was a fine season to start Grey's Anatomy.  It's not my favorite season, but it was full of interesting stories both on the medical side and on the characters development and lives.  If you haven't watched Grey's, you're really missing out!
B0017I1FNK|5.0|I have been an Emmylou fan since Pieces of the Sky, and she's probably my favorite performer.   This collection of songs does not disappoint!  It showcases her talent as a songwriter (she wrote half of the material) and features some of her old friends -- Vince Gill, Dolly Parton, the McGarrigles.  I've listened to this CD several times, and it's really hard to pick a favorite song, but I am especially taken with Sailing Around the Room and Not Enough.  If you're a fan, do not miss this collection of songs!  Emmylou's talent is timeless and you will definitely find some beautiful and thought-provoking songs here.
B000UR9TQE|4.0|I got to see this on the big screen as part of the DVD promotion. If you want to see why LZ was a great live band, get the self titled DVD.     For years, the only live Zeppelin you could get were either bootlegs or this movie, but since Page opened the vault, you've had the \\"BBC Sessions\\" and \\"How The West Was Won\\" (also the beginning of the \\"Houses of the Holy\\" tour, TSRTS was the end of the tour), both of which decimated the original soundtrack. Until the rerelease. So do get the soundtrack CD even though you might think owning the movie alone is fine. It sounds great and you can throw those old copies away.      But the DVD is meant to be played loud on a surround system. The original film was shown in some theaters in Quadrophonic, so it was always intended to be heard that way. Bonham's drums, Page's guitars are all put to good effect in surround. But what you will notice is how clean the movie print looks, a lot more colorful and brighter than probably when it was originally shown in the mid 70s.      I thought they were going to add the outtakes into the movie, but they left it as bonus footage. And it would have been a nice option if they were able to set it up where fans could watch the concert itself instead of the \\"fantasy\\" sequences and the theft which annoyingly cuts into a great song.     Warning - the \\"PG\\" rating needs to be revised, because the other copies of the home video have the part with manager Peter Grant going off on MSG staff censored. On this DVD, there is no mistaking the 4 letter words. Not once, not twice, but 17 times. It would have been great to hear some commentary from the band and the director, looking back at it.     There are better concert films and there are some really ridiculous scenes in this,and the lack of continuity of what they're wearing is pretty hilarious, but the point of the film was to capture a band in its prime on a big screen and escape for a couple of hours. It's by far not their best performance captured on film or tape, but there are some great moments on stage where you're definitely feeling like you missed out on a great show.     I had seen this movie maybe 10 times, and I think this sorely needed remastered version will renew your interest in it for the first time in years.
B0017R5UAA|5.0|For me, I'm always skeptical about rave reviews, and this album  is getting them across the board. But for once, I'm in total agreement.  There is some definite magic going on with this album (the EP is  it's equal too).    If anyone remembers and digs the late, great band Grant Lee Buffalo  (specifically the Mighty Joe Moon/Fuzzy albums) then get this album  pronto. It's cut from the same rural, pastoral cloth... and has  that similar rustic atmosphere that sucks you in instantly.    I hope these guys don't get burned by the hype, and have a nice long  career ahead of them... I'm looking forward to it!    John
B000002VSN|3.0|I am not a big fan of Gospel music, the only reason for purchasing this album is for the Whitney Houston tracks. I was a fan of the songs \\"I Believe In You & Me\\" and \\"Step By Step\\". I didn't care for the movie, but the soundtrack wasn't all that bad. Whitney does sing the Christmas songs great. She should of released her own Christmas album, following this album. But she waited years later and that might be a reason why it flopped. Hopefully Whitney can get back to her roots and continue to sing with her beautiful voice.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|LOST is a show on high octane.  Once you get on this ride, you won't be getting off.  You'll be addicted as all of us fans are.<br /><br />Even if this season was not my favorite.  Even if we were given little answers and only more questions...I couldn't stop watching.  I guess I am invested in the story and the characters.  Every night it's on, I'm there in front of the TV and the next morning I'm discussing it with a friend.  LOST is the most original show out there.  By far.<br /><br />If you haven't gotten on the LOST bandwagon- do so before you miss out!!  I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|A wonderful modern opera.  Is there anything Johnny Depp can't do?  He is unforgettable.
B000X12QQ2|4.0|Well worth the long wait for a full release. Both stereo and mono mixes are included. A classic late '60's \\"concept\\" album...........The Zombies never should have broken up !!    [[ASIN:B000005YZM Odessey and Oracle]]
B0013FNC38|5.0|I bought it because of the hit song I'm Yours.  I was not impressed with the first song on the CD, but the rest are awesome!  It has a soulful sound with some jazzy songs as well as a gospel sort of tune.  He is a talented artist whose music has made me a Jason Mraz fan after purchasing this CD.
0312360266|2.0|I found the story to be okay; not riveting but I did not have to work to stay interested.  I did have to work to overlook the sub-par writing in this novel. As an example I cannot count the number of times Zoey, the narrator, said something in parentheses during her internal monolouge.  In addition the language used by many of the characters seemed forced and as a result the characters never developed a strong \\"voice\\" of their own. To me the writing did not seem polished or accomplished which makes me wonder where were the editors on this one.
B00186JBSM|5.0|Oh, hold on a minute... this is an album of new material. That just sounds like a greatest hits collection.   Well, I'm sure that, by now, most listeners already know the story behind that. Suffice to say that among this palette of varied - some might say conflicting - styles, the big, seven-minute disco workout I'm A Fire is worth the investment on it's own. But I'm getting ahead of myself - here's a track-by track-breakdown:     STAMP YOUR FEET From the opening whoa-oahs, there's no doubt that Donna's back in business with a radio-friendly belter of an \\"encouragement song\\" (as the lady herself describes it). The production signals a relentlessly modern approach, and boy, is this what's delivered over the next hour or so.     I LOVE MUSIC Kicks off all high-octane R'n'B in the style of Usher or Justin Trousersnake, and when she tells us, \\"I've got my iPod\\" in the opening line, it's hard not to wonder whether she's not just angling for a high-profile product ensdorsement. But it wins you over with its exhuberence. Perhaps moreso than...     CRAYONS, with it's nevertheless great lyric about celebrating diversity and a pleasant enough guest vocal from Ziggy Marley. Its skittering raggaeton vibe (think Rihanna's 'Pon De Replay) might be an already discarded flavour, but if you think Donna's already had one double espresso too many, she cranks up the pace even more on...     THE QUEEN IS BACK. \\"She wants a Toblerone\\". What the hell is THAT opening line all about? OK, I know she's singing something else, but it does sound uncannily like that. This rocking, tongue-in-cheek number seems based on a theme tune for a boxing flick like Rocky 6 or something, and you do get the sense that she's been limbering up in the gym for another sparring session with the `Industry'. Time for a bit of a rest between rounds? You've got to be kidding.     FAME rocks it out even more, with a jaded lyric about... well, the clue's in the title. Naturally, you're going to be put in mind of DavidBowie's eponymous hit; then your mind might wander to Tina Turner's cover of Bowie's \\"1984\\", with which it has more common, musically. Then it might hit you that Crayons is a comeback album on a par with Tina Turner's Private Dancer. And THEN, the actual songs just get a whole lot better, starting with...     SAND ON MY FEET A mid-tempo ballad in which Donna enjoys a seaside holiday with her hubby, to the accompaniment of an acoustic guitar. Nice - you could imagine Rihanna, Kelly Clarkson or Pink singing this... then feel all warm and fuzzy that Donna Summer decided to come out of \\"retirement\\" to co-write and record it herself.     DRIVING DOWN BRAZIL is a bit of a story song, and Summer knows how to tell a story - this time to a playful bossanova beat. One of the real highlights of the album and, although it probably won't be single, it should be.     I'M A FIRE - That voice! Reminiscent of her disco monsters of the Seventies and Eighties, the slick production is nevertheless very much of the Noughties (naughties?), and hits the bullseye in the same way as a contemporary production/remixing team like The Freemasons, when they use a reliable, warmly-voiced industry pro like Siedah Garrett. Donna teases us with the line, \\"Can you feel it? Do I need to say it? Can't you just feel it?\\" before the track morphs into an even more infectious latin stomper, skipping through some holiday Spanish, but in a soaring vocal deilvery which even talents as great as La India and the estimable Liz Torres could take pointers from. I've heard some remixes of this track, and most of them have tended to follow the tedious, dated, bangbangbang, Victor Calderone/Junior Vasquez-style tweaking of the US gay circuit party (nightmare!). This original mix (by Sebastion Arocha Morton, I think) is as near to perfection as we're likely to get, but I wouldn't mind hearing some UK mixes, all the same.     SLIDE OVER BACKWARDS is a backwoods, bluegrass number all huskily and lazily intoned like MacyGray - or \\"B.B. Queen\\"? Donna lives in Tennessee and she's clearly having a bit of fun here, singing as an alter ego called Hattie Mae Blanche Dubois(!) Well, if Tori Amos can do it...     SCIENCE OF LOVE. Rockiest track of the lot and very radio-friendly. Tipped as a future single, but I'd be surprised if it becomes one here in the UK. Her voice is especially strong on it, though.     BE MYSELF AGAIN is a piano-led torch ballad which comes across like the climax of some autobiographical stage show Donna might have penned - perhaps more hardcore fans could illuminate me on that one, if they know something I don't. Ms Summer always had an awesomely mature vocal style, but it just crackles away on this. It might be a bit too melodramatic for some but, if it is a showtune, then it's a Memory or a Don't Cry For Me, Argentina.     BRING DOWN THE REIGN Warm, slightly worthy ballad about the Darfur genocides, featuring a kiddies' choir. It's nice enough, but might have been a bit of a damp squib to close the album, if it hadn't been for...     IT'S ONLY LOVE Lucky European purchasers (and US fans intrepid enough to track down a special edition) get this bonus track, which is another seven-minute disco treat. It's not lyrically clever, and I can understand why it was left of the mainstream US release - daytime radio won't understand it at all, it's really little more than a groove - but its late-night hedonism will tear up any club set. The vocal is cool, soulful and while it puts me in mind of a Chaka Khan or a Rosie Gaines, it's still unmistakably Donna. Unlike in the US, a huge chunk of the UK population had its DNA chemically altered enough by the three \\"Summers of Love\\" in the late 80s for us to lap this up 20 years later. I can think of a few DJs and producers over here who'll be itching to get their mitts on the masters for remixes, too.     So that's it: sorry if I've made comparisons with other vocalists along the way, in order to try to describe the songs - I guess it just demonstrates how Donna Summer has been and still is a template for so many others. At 59, she wears me out at - ahem - let's say 39... and is more in command of her legendary voice than she ever has been. Somebody give the woman a freaking Toblerone - she's earned it.
0061139378|4.0|Coraline is a somewhat bored young girl in a new home. She's an explorer at heart, so she pokes about the new place - even into the dark corners best left undisturbed.<br /><br />A lovely book with a brave young protagonist, who takes matters into her own hands when things go awry at home, despite the warnings, dangers & the unknown. Only she could make things right.<br /><br />Meant for children, yes, but a nice, quick read for us old fogies, too.
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|I love Confessions, but this... this is a peace of Madge! The best album ever!!!!! Her voice is incredible... it remembers too much the 80's Madge. Each song makes you want to go to the dance floor... to dance in the bathroom, bedroom... even the classroom. Your feet can't stop shaking... even if you are the most powerful mind control person... or feet control for that matter. You can't stop listening to it. I bought it two weeks ago and can't stop listening to it! I can't believe she reinvented herself again! Yeah, Hard candy is a pop music album as everyone is saying. It is full of R&B and hip hop, but instead of they influence Madge, she influences them. It is Madge hip hop and R&B... nobody has done it before. Every song has a dancing, moving beat exclusive of Mad. She is the Queen! If you didn't buy it... do it. You won't lose your money!!!!
B000YIGNKE|2.0|The main complaint I have with this film is its photography. I don't know how they did it but it was like they attached a frame to the actors with a camera on it and shot several scenes like that. The result was like the actors were disconnected from the scene and the shots were jerky. I got a headache just watching them.    The idea of girl of the lower nobility running all over bath with out being horribly out breath is ludicrous.    Aside from that Anthony Head was excellent as a member of the aristocracy. The rest of the cast were good. The plot was OK even if it wasn't conventional though I didn't care for the Anne's looking into the camera in several shots.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is my favorite work out video that I own! To give you an idea, I have about 20 videos to chose from and I get bored easily so I only do a video once.. maybe twice then stash it in my collection never to see the light of day! But this one, not only do I feel like I'm getting a GREAT workout, but I've done it 4 times in less than a week, and I have every intension of doing it like it was intended, 10 times per level.. or at least, that's how I would imagine a 30 day work out with 3 levels to be used. I've done other 40 or 50 minute workouts that don't make me sweat as hard as this one does!  I've recommended this to everyone I know who wants a good work out video and I plan on buying some more later to use as christmas presents!     so over all. GREAT video..
B0017WI5VQ|5.0|i downloaded this album a month and a half ago and haven't skipped a day not hearing it.  this album is breathtaking (i haven't felt this way about an album since radiohead's \\"the bends\\").  her voice is beautiful and it holds \\"emotion\\".  her rendition of dylan's \\"to make you feel my love\\" got me teary eyed the first time i heard it.  she simply has the ability to sing each song as if it's a \\"real\\" story, allowing the listener to really feel what each song is about.      this album is worth every penny and although i want to keep adele a little secret (i have a thing about seeing my favorite performers in small venues, not stadiums - i was fortunate enough to do this with coldplay before their status went all crazy), but a talented gem like adele can't be kept a secret for too long.
0316067601|5.0|This is absolutely the best book I have read.  Marcus Luttrell is an American Hero.  He fought the fight like a dedicated warrior.  This book explains what type of atmoshere our troops are being put in and the dedication it takes to succeed.  He blast the liberial media and shows support for our Commander in Chief.  His men along with Marcus define what America needs from it's troops.  Great Read.

B0016NF06O|5.0|Everyone knew that this summit of master musicians would be special. The session was recently broadcast on National Public Radio's Jazz at Lincoln Center, and as we already have an Amazon video excerpt of the event, we can expect to see the entire meeting on PBS, with DVD as pledge gift. The CD, however, has had the opportunity for further electronic mixing and improvements by Delfeayo Marsalis and Jeff Jones. So what can we say about the quality of the music and the personalities? How many superlatives are there? But you first must be a Willie Nelson fan and you must be a jazz enthusiast who honors Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Jazz folk for their precision and urban sophisticated development of New Orleans roots. Thus if you are among that very large number of music lovers, you must own this recording. Even the insert notes and photos are nicely done. As for the selections, we have Nelson's own oft recorded theme song, Georgia on My Mind, and we also have Stardust, which was included in the album of the same title that demonstrated that Nelson was more than a country singer; indeed that album is his all-time best seller. I, however, enjoyed Rainy Day Blues and the other tunes that follow, which are what the album is supposed to be about: the blues. This album is simply fun. You will love it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|WALL-E is one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. I liked that there was not much talking throught out the movie. There were alot of refereneces to 2001: A Space Oddisey. There was music from it in the movie. One example is when The Captain learns how to walk they play the music from the begining of 2001. Another referece to 2001 is the robot Auto or the Auto pilot looks alot like HAL 9000 the main bad guy from 2001. WALL-E is right now, the highest rated movie of the year. I checked RottenTamatoes.com ALL-E is 97 Fesh. WALL-E has 168 Fresh reviews and a meseley 6 Rotten reviews. For any Noobs who haven't seen 2001: A Space Oddisey go buy it on DVD or rent everyone needs ot see that move too. Everyone should see WALL-E.
0375846735|5.0|Philip Pullman's series is like a mirror - what bounces back at you has a lot to do with what you bring to it.  It's no secret that the author is an atheist, and exposes readers to this often disturbing possibility.  Doubters will find it fascinating, even carthartic.  True believers will, on the whole, find it offensive.  But in the firestorm of enthusiasm or loathing, don't overlook the undeniable fact that this is a terrific work of imagination.  There are more delightful new ideas - ones having nothing to do with religion - in the first fifty pages than in most entire fantasy trilogies.      And while the third volume is the weakest - the pacing is badly off at times - it surprisingly becomes a beautiful coming-of-age story, realistically but tastefully told.  Who of us has not almost forgotten the poignant beauty of that time in their own lives?  Pullman brings it back to life with a sense of wonder.  Yes, I've read other opinions on this, but those who even suggest there's something prurient here reveal more about themselves than about the book.      Perhaps the most important thing to know about this story is that it's a STORY.  Pullman proposes dozens of \\"what if\\" ideas that tease our minds, sometimes in unsettling ways.  But that's quite different from saying that the story claims to be reality.  What if God's lieutenant got the upper hand for awhile? (That one sounds a little like the Bible or the Silmarilion).  What if God was not immortal, but rather a being who lived for eons and eons?  What if the afterlife isn't a pretty place, but you can opt instead for oblivion, returning your joyous energy to the universe?  Subversive, challenging thoughts indeed, but probably not Philip Pullman's idea of reality.  It's a story.    In the end, this is not a tale for people who fear where imagination might take them.  But for those who can conceive of vast new possibilities, then apply their inner experiences in Lyra's worlds to our own real world, the potential rewards are great.  And if Pullman is sent to Narnia when he dies, well then we can all have a good laugh over it.
1416955070|4.0|Well, I actually picked up the sequel to this one on the bestseller table, and I didn't realize it was the second in a series until after I bought it. So, after reading it and enjoying it, I bought the first one, which I thought was worse.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br />The beginning is intriguing. Clary, a slightly geeky teenager, is at a club with her best bud Simon when she meets a group of mysterious 'Shadowhunters' whom only she can see. It then lags a bit, going on about her personal life, which would have been better at the beginning, so that the action doesn't plunge. She then sees one of them again, in a coffee shop. They talk, and Clary is interrupted by an anxious phone call from her mother who tells her not to come home. So, being a teenager, Clary races home, followed by the Shadowhunter, Jace, who wants to take her back to Headquarters.<br /><br />She meets demon, the things the Shadowhunters are supposed to be slaying. It attacks her, and  she kills it buy luck. She passes out and is taken back to HQ by Jace. Well. Suspenseful, plenty of action, and a foreshadowing of a love triangle. Not a bad start, though it could have been written better.<br /><br />At Shadowhunter Headquarters, things get murky. Jace's adoptive family is quirky and interesting. The books never really become clear on Clary's feelings for Isabelle or Alec Jace's adoptive siblings. One minute she hates them, then she likes them, then she's neutral, then she hates them again. Isabelle and Alec are have far more engaging personalities than Jace, who switches between the victim and angsty teenager and the all-powerful golden boy. It soon becomes clear that Clary's mom was involved Shadowhunter politics and walking the line between following the law and being a criminal. She stole the Mortal Cup from diabolical Shadowhunter gone bad Valentine, who happens to be her husband and Clary's father. He kidnapped her and is holding her hostage for information. The Lightwood's (Alec and Isabelle and Jace) tutor, Hodge, a man with a shady past also linked to Valentine, tries to help Clary by taking her to the Silent Brothers, a powerful, cult-like, brother hood who delve more into the 'magic' part of the Shadowhunter world that the fighting part in which the Shadowhunters take part. This part should be fast-paced and exciting yet it meanders around, almost lagging, to make the reader frustrated.<br /><br />Poor Clary finds out that a lot of things in her world aren't quite what they seem. Her mother's almost-boyfriend and Clary's 'Uncle' is also linked to Valentine. Simon, meanwhile, hops back into the picture rather unexpectedly and is used by the Shadowhunters. He never actually takes part in the plans or makes decisions, though he tries. His anger doesn't quite hit the spot, though. Clary meanwhile, is a Shadowhunter, did I mention? Something that could have been suspenseful and made the romance between her and Jace and Simon more interesting is simply handed out at the beginning of the book. Tsk, tsk. Readers should be on the edge of their seats, waiting for suspicions to be confirmed, not quite sure, with plenty to argue pro and con. They shouldn't be handed things that are already obvious.<br /><br />Clary and Jace (sometimes accompanied by Alec, Isabelle, or Simon) race around New York looking for clues and getting into sticky situations. The go to a party by a funky and clearly gay warlock named Magnus Bane, who was the one who blocked Clary's memories (It turns out that Alec is gay. Magnus is gay. So...can anyone see something, just maybe?) Simon gets turned into a rat. Jace and Clary run off to rescue him from a houseful of vampires. Alec, meanwhile, is fuming because of Clary. He thinks Clary is putting Jace in danger, and told her that she is ruining the Lightwood's lives. Clary shoots back with the fact that he has a crush on Jace. Alec loses it temporarily. This was one of my favorite scenes because Clary doesn't need things explained and is on almost equal ground with Alec. Tension, tension.<br />This book is full of witty dialogue, mostly from Jace, Isabelle and Simon. The balance between the characters is all wrong, but seperate and in small groups they are funny and exciting. The arguments are fast-paced and and in some cases almost debate-like.<br /><br />Clary, though she has been a Shadowhunter only for a couple of days, practices her magic and finds out where her mother has hidden the mortal cup. Can they get to it on time? I liked the actual ending, but the way it was phrased and written was awful. The plotlines, characters, and the settings were all in place, but needed to be written differently. It is written in third person. I think it would have been better written in first person, with chapters from different peoples perspectives. This happens with the third person, but would have been cleaner and more description in the way mentioned earlier. A good non-fiction for those who love fantasy. Unexpected twist.tension.

B000V86OKG|5.0|After Dexter's first excellent season, I wondered if the show could possibly continue the fascinating, thrilling momentum of the series while offering up new storylines. But the second season starts off with a bang when Dexter's underwater graveyard of victims is discovered, and all of a sudden the Miami PD and FBI are all hot on the trails of a new serial killer ... him. Dexter's manueverings to avoid being caught occupy much of the season's plotlines, but the rest of his energies are focused on the women in his life. While sister Deb and Rita both find themselves growing out of their roles as victims and taking more control of their lives, Dexter becomes involved with a dark, dangerous woman named Lila. Once again, Dexter finds himself torn between a his deceitful \\"normal\\" relationships and a more authentic, yet completely destructive one.<br /><br />All in all the show delivers a second stellar season, and I'm left wondering ... what can they possibly do next?
B00005UEAR|5.0|I fail to see how anyone can say images and words is better than this album. I love the original DT as much as the next fan, but I actually feel everything after Awake almost outdoes anythign previous, especially this album and Scenes From a Memory. I'm not absolutelly in love with the 2nd concept cd in this set, but it has its moments. That said, the first cd with five nice, long DT style prog tracks is surelly some of the best in their catalogue. I honestly don't know why everyone wants to compare all their later cd's to Images and Words and Awake...those two albums just don't compare at all.<br /><br />I don't like writing a huge review about every track or anything to that degree, so all I will say is that, if you loved the Scenes... album, you will love this as well. This album quite possibly had the best production of any of their cd's as well. The second cd is somewhat weird at times and depends heavily on keyboards and unique melodies unlike most of their other cd's. The lyrics and whatnot are remeniscent of Scenes... in their context, but still different. I'm into DT for the guitar playing and killer drumming and their isn't too much of this except on about three of tracks on it, but, in the classic DT style, they never fail to impress even when giving you only a small snipet of their classic trademark progressive jamming.<br /><br />Bottomline: You need to own this album if you like DT at all. Hell, even if you don't like DT and are reading this, get off your rump and buy a copy, sit back and prepare to be astounded.
0385340567|1.0|Buyer Beware!!!  The author had \\"nothing to lose\\" because he makes money on ever sale - the READER has \\"everything to lose\\" by tryng to read this tedious, repetitive, childishly written sequeal to very good earlier Reacher novels.

B0007Y08QA|5.0|This movie is very good. A warning though, Christian Bale, is very difficult to look at throughout the movie. I had read that he dropped to 100 pounds to become the character of Trevor. Without giving anything away, Trevor is a machinist who has not slept in over a year. He is tired, lonely, and strange things start happening to him. He spends his time working, visiting a prostitue, Jennifer Jason Leigh, surprisingly good in this film, and having coffee in the wee hours of the morning at a local airport. The film is dark, sad, and ultimately a strong statement of the evils that men can do. Highly reccommended.

1594489505|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is an outstanding book. Mr. Hosseini has done some wonderful displays of mingling in this book, from flipping to two separate stories and bringing them together at the end. Eventhough this book is a Florida Teen Reads! nominee and will be in the battle of the books for Florida, it is hard to recommend this book to any student under the age of 15. There is a lot of sexual and brutal action in this book. At the same time, this book does the following:<br />1) Explains the harshness for the people pre-soviet occupation, post-soviet occupation and the Taliban occupation.<br />2) Lets students know how harsh war and factions can be on an country.<br />3) After 911, many Americans wanted to turn Afghanistan into a parking lot. This book will explain to Americans how the people of Afghanistan are innocent and how a small force ruled the masses.<br />3a) Also, this book will show why many of the countries that are war torn or dealing with rebel groups were left by the US, Soviets and/or Europeans in a state of chaos. It will be so easy to compare and contrast countries in Africa and South America.<br />4) Explains how refugee camps can destroy families.<br />5) Explains the culture and thinking of the conservative muslim's life.<br />6) Gives light to the plight of women under the burqa.<br />7) Lastly, this book allows you to go through a range of emotions, which allows emotions and passions from students.<br /><br />Enjoy this book and students should enjoy this book. Please have a discussion before and after the book. There is a lot that goes on in this book that needs to be explained.
0156027321|5.0|I'd heard a bit about Life of Pi by Yann Martel, not much, but the title was familiar. I wish that someone had said to me in 2001 when it came out that I needed to read this book. Seriously, shaken me by the shoulders saying: Read this book! Pi Patel is a serious minded 16 year old boy who is traveling with his family from India to Canada with a few of their animals from their zoo. But the Japanese cargo ship they are traveling on soon sinks leaving Pi alone in a life boat with an injured zebra, an orangutan, a hyena, and a Bengal tiger. The animals soon lay waste to each other until only the tiger, named Richard Parker, and Pi are left to travel 277 days across the Pacific Ocean. How does a boy who calls himself Hindu, Christian, and Muslim survive against a monstrous predator when he is the only prey within reach? Pi narrates his story with great humility. As he recounts each act he took to protect himself from the tiger and then provide for the two of them, you can't help but marvel at both his ingenuity and his spirit. This is one of those carefully crafted novels where each paragraph is a marvel of grace and fluidity. Martel upsets the apple cart a bit in the end forcing the reader to decide which story they would choose,  and in the end, which view of life as well. It's a powerful novel beautifully told.
B000002GYI|1.0|There is something inherently prosaic in this dead dull \\"music of der future\\".  Fortunately, man has still some sense of individualism, but barely, and Kraftwerk's fascist goal for music has not rendered vocals obsolete.  Listening to this, it harkens back to the techno geek 1970's when Germans laden in neo-fascist uniforms with thin ties and a pound of grease on their hair, showed no emotion on stage, acting like machines.

In my estimation, all crap.  A few American bands at the time tried the stale trend with deadly results, Gary Numan The Pleasure Principle (1979), Styx Kilroy Was Here (1983) , both tossed their careers away because of it.<br /><br />You'll be reminded of foolish telephone companies, lumbering computer screens, electronic wires, gay 70's discos, and moronic techno cabarets in smelly, dark German cellars.  So, unless you're a nerd or have little taste in music, forget this stuff ever existed.
B000AMJG4Y|4.0|I saw Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within a long, long time ago.  I don't remember much about it but I do remember that I enjoyed it and was particularly blown away by the beauty of the CGI.  There was no need to play the game and I thought that this would be pretty much the same.    The only place I was wrong was that this movie would have made a lot more sense, and had a lot more meaning, if I had actually played the games or followed the storyline.  Because I hadn't there were a lot of references that I missed and I had a tough time following who the good guys and the bad guys were.  But by the middle of the movie I seemed to be following things pretty well with an occasional shock here and there.    So if you haven't played the game, take it from me, this movie is still worth picking up.  The action is pretty intense, the voice characters are pretty good, and the graphics could not be done any better.  The storyline seems epic in proportion but if you pay attention I think anybody can get a basic understanding of the overall storyline and plot.    It makes me want to pick up the game and storyline sometime.

B0012X6FT4|4.0|If only for the great bonus live disc. I am sure they could have just released the concert on its own and sold it out many times over. Like another reviewer suggested, this is even more thrilling than the El Mocambo concert disc, but they could've fixed that also by releasing the entire Mocambo show, un-edited. Setlists being similar, we probably don't need both, but heck, Elvis could release them anyway. A whole passel of live show releases would be nice, for that matter...  Docked one star only because the bonus material on the first disc has already been reissued.
1406312614|1.0|I could not wait to get this set for my son. This is a story we used to say at home and church camp when I was a child and I wanted my son to have the same memories. When the shipment came in I couldn't wait to open. I read the book to my son who is 2 years old and LOVES TV so I thought the DVD would be GREAT. Well, we opened the DVD put in the DVD player and it would not play. AFter looking OVER EVERYTHING WE SAW NOTHING then my husband looked at the disk and there it was. The DVD is in a PAL format (UK ONLY) and not in NTSC format (USA format)so basically the DVD cannot be used. Had this been something that I could been told before the purchase I would have not made the purchase and would have looked for a USA format version. I will be returning this and disappointment my son.

B00009V7T2|5.0|This album by the Mars Volta is brilliant. The album starts with an energetic few tracks, and goes into a spacy jam of Cicatrez ESP. It ends quite abruptly feeling, but the ending leaves you satisfied. The story is about a man named Cerpin Taxt, who poisons himself, goes into a coma, has dreams about bizzare things, and then wakes up, and jumps off of a bridge. (Very dark sounding, I know.) The story is actually great when put into the song, and his story can be interpreted as you would like, and Cedric Bixler-Zavala definitely leaves alot of lyrics unexplained. Guest appearences include RHCP's John Frusciante for Cicatrez ESP, and RHCP's bassist Flea plays throughout. ATD-I band members make a step forward from the previous genre, paving a path of their own. If you are interested in the story, there is a storybook available on TMV's Italian fansite. (Im pretty sure thats where it is)
B000YABYLA|4.0|Juno is a phenomenon, there's no doubt about that. And it really does deserve to be, for shining the spotlight on teen pregnancy. However, I really liked- not loved- this movie. The cast is amazing, especially Jennifer Gardner, Ellen Page, and Olivia Thirlby. The movie is pretty funny, but does slow down in parts. All in all, however, it is a solid 4 star movie to watch.
0143038419|1.0|This is one of the few books I could not finish. It bored me to tears. I found the author very self-absorb, and irratating. She acts like she is the only person in the world who has every been depressed and experienced heartache. Save your money and time. Read a different book.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|What is there to say about Friends? It's basically TV perfection. Randomly choose any episode, and you're sure to find something (and in many cases, quite a few things) that you like. For me, it just got better and better as the seasons went on, leading up to a perfect series finale. Ross and Rachel! Monica and Chandler! Phoebe and Mike! Joey! Friends was a funny, touching, sad, heartwarming, and hilarious 10 years spent on TV, and this set does it complete and total justice.
B000Y35A94|3.0|While the set list is about as good as could be reasonably hoped for, I find the performance itself to be a snooze. The band seems to be either bored, tired, or just very worried that they don't mess anything up. There is no visible chemistry among the players until Home by the Sea, well into the second half of the show. The show cooks from that point on, but it is far too late.<br /><br />I suppose big fans (like me) will want to have this anyway, but if you only want one or two Genesis DVDs from the \\"trio\\" era, then Wembley is by far the best bet, despite an inferior set list, followed by the Way We Walk. Let's hope that the Mama tour and 3SL also make it do DVD sometime soon.
B000F8O35U|4.0|The Little Mermaid is my favorite Disney animated movie ever. Nothing beats the final scene of Ariel in her sparkly dress or the sound of her voice in the conch shell. Unfortunately, it does have some few minor flaws. The biggest of all, for me, are the steps. The hideous, hideous steps. There is a scene where Ariel rushes down some palace steps. The only problem is that the steps aren't animated- they're CGI. In an animated movie. They stick out like a sore thumb, and every time I see them I wince. I know it probably saved Disney a lot of $$$ while they were making the film, but I would've loved it if they had been reanimated for the remastered edition. Also, \\"Under the Sea\\" stretches a little too long for my taste and... well, that's about it. You really can't find t00 much at fault with such a classic.
B000ETQRCM|5.0|Ok, so it's been a few years since I've reviewed a PJ album... I've just been busy listening to this brilliant album, trying to find the words to describe the degree of it's AWESOME FACTOR. I won't be fancy, ladies and gentlemen... let's just say it's off the charts, and THEN some. It is the legendary band's answer to all the nay-sayers that claim their music has grown too mellow or \\"tired\\" sounding in the last several years. PEARL JAM is THEE most energetic album since YIELD. Period. While their last two LP's were more experimental and laid-back (but still GREAT in my opinion), this one is straight up in your face from beginning to end. Very aggressive, hard, energetic sounds that sort of bring you back to their earlier days... VS and VITALOGY in particular. That being said, the thing that sets this beauty apart from their entire body of work is this: the first 5 songs are HARD rockers to say the least. Not even VS can claim that. I won't go into each song here... just a few of the highlights (although the ENTIRE album is a highlight). Severed Hand begins with a riff and feel not unlike the beginning of Corduroy (VITALOGY), and it really gets the adrenalin pumping like nothing else. Marker In The Sand is one of the most funnest, greatest sing-along songs in the history of Pearl Jam. Big Wave has one purpose: to SHUT the mouths of all those pour souls that claim PJ have become old, tired, and boring. The last two songs are great ballads that are up there with the very best of PJ ballads... Come Back perhaps a great candidate for the \\"next\\" Yellow Ledbetter, and Inside Job has just a pinch of Stairway To Heaven's (Led Zeppelin) influence to it, starting off slow then building up to a frenzy. The only thing that may count as filler on this album (but it's damn good filler at that) is Wasted Reprise. Ending this masterpiece is a cool, short little blend of sounds that you feel you've just heard dashed here and there through out the whole album. Overall great sounding album with a ton of energy and expert musicianship backing it. Miss the old, glorious days of the early 90's?? Try this one on for size... you WON'T be sorry.

Instead my life has been changed by the lives and the LOST lives that were taken that day in 2005.     Mr. Luttrell gives the most riveting account of his experience in training as a SEAL (the first part of the book) and of his experience defending our country again radical Muslims who seek to destroy all Americans.  What an amazing book.  I cannot say enough that every American should read this story so that we truly understand how much these turban-wearing monsters hate us and how many brave men and women give their lives in defense of our freedom.    The only comfort I can imagine that comes for this courageous man is that his BROTHERS are forever walking in Heaven with Jesus and I just bet Marcus knows that someday he will see them again.    I hope that other proud Americans join in praying for this HERO, Marcus Luttrell, so that he can rest and have some sort of peace from the nightmares that haunt him.    GOD BLESS and KEEP YOU MARCUS.  KNOW THAT THIS AMERICAN WILL NEVER EVER BE THE SAME after having read your book.  THANK YOU for sharing the moments that only you can.  THANK YOU for serving our nation.  THANK YOU for the man you are.

The not recorded, however, all of a sudden very much alike 5th apocalyptic rider and feisty blonde Cathy Timberlake [Doris Day] as a convincingly attractive beauty queen beloved by men turns out to become a cracking revelation of it's funniest kind for a straightforward and by success badly spoiled women hunter to get used to.    Exciting dialogs, most bizarre confusions and highly gifted actors always will enchant us by this chaotic love story within simplest cinematic conditions and setups, a real pearl among comedies from the 1960th.

B0001WANCM|4.0|I love Kevin Costner in any of his movies, I have seen them all and haven't found a bad one yet. He is a great actor and I also think he is a very good director. \\"Field of dreams\\" is just another perfect movie of his can't find anything bad to say about it, loved it!

B000063V8R|5.0|This is the 3rd season of the TV hit series Star Trek: the Next Generation. This is probably one of the best seasons, with memorable and epic episodes like \\"The most toys\\", which deals with Data's kidnapping by an one-of-a-kind rare item collector,  \\"Who watches the watchers\\" in which Picard needs to prove to a primitive people that he is not a god, \\"offspring\\", with Data becoming a parent, \\"Yesterdays enterprise\\", to finally meet the crew of the Enterprise-C, \\"The Defector\\" a splendidly sneaky Romulan episode, \\"The enemy\\" a Romulan episode in the style of enemy mine, \\"Hollow pursuits\\" an entertaining episode about shy Lt. Barclay who recreates the Enterprise officers on the holo-deck in ridiculous scenarios to make them less threatening, and last but not least the 1st part of \\"The best of both worlds\\" starting the Picard/Borg story line that is concluded in the \\"First Contact\\" movie.  This season is a definite must for a Star Trek fan, but also a good entry into the show for more casual watchers.   Prepare to be entertained-Engage!

B00139W3NE|5.0|If you liked *Chronicles of Narnia* and *Stardust*, then you'll like *Golden Compass*.  The story takes place in an alternate universe where humans' souls are visible.  Their accompanied souls are daemons, taking the form of an animals.  The forms changes when humans are children but eventually chose a final form as humans mature.<br /><br />Lyra, an orphan, is intriqued by the mysteries surrounding by her uncle's secretive mission to locate the Dust.  Meanwhile, she's given a alethiometer, a golden compass, which can reveal truths.<br /><br />While following her uncle, she encounters Mrs. Coulter, who offers Lyra a job as a personal assistant.

When trouble arises when rescuing her friend and other children, Lyra's new friends come to the rescue.<br /><br />Overall, good story and wonderful special effects.  The ending isn't quite complete, which leads you to believe that there will be a sequel.<br /><br />I can see how there were controversy surrouding the film's themes on religion and whatnots.  But, hey, it's just a story.  Let's not get our [...] in a bunch.
B0015D3Z4O|1.0|Doesn't Madonna realize that there was a Counting Crows album entitled \\"Hard Candy\\" just a few years ago?  She's out of touch.<br /><br />Do we REALLY need to see a 50 year-old Madonna in psudo-bondage gear...again?!  Hello...1992 called...it wants its marketing gimmick back!<br /><br />BTW, didn't even listen to this piece of junk.
B00164KYS2|5.0|I couldn't decide whether to give *Sex and the City* 4 or 5 stars.  What the heck, I'll give it 5 stars.<br /><br />First of all, I loved it!  It was wonderful to be back into the lives and adventures of these 4 fabulous gals.  I loved the montage shown from the TV series, showing what these women have experienced, individually and collectively.<br /><br />Carrie and Big are still together and are looking for an apartment suitable for them.  However, a legal question comes up about property and rights.  When Carrie and Big get together to talk about, their conversation eventually lead them to marriage.<br /><br />The night before the wedding, someone says something to Big, which caused him to get cold feet on the wedding day.  Humiliated, Carrie and the girls retreat to Mexico (Carrie and Big's honeymoon destination) to recuperate.<br /><br />However, throughout the movie, I couldn't help but feel that Miranda and Samantha were really the focus of this film.  Miranda considers divorce from Steve as he reveals that he has had an affair.  Samantha isn't the same gal that we've grown to love from the TV series.  Samantha has now been in a relationship with Jerry for 5 years.  Meanwhile, men around her are just getting more gorgeous every day.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Charlotte discovers she's pregnant but is fearful because she has had a miscarriage before.  At the same time, she holds the biggest grudge against Big for the cancelled wedding.  As luck would have it, she encounters Big and ends up needing his help.<br /><br />When Carrie discovers that someone said something to Big before the wedding, she wonders if it's too late to save their relationship.<br /><br />I wish Stanley and Marco had more screen time.<br /><br />Anyways, *Sex and the City* is still fabulous.  Fashion galore!  Sexy!  Trendy!  And still as hilarious as ever!
B0010X73ZG|4.0|The Mist is Frank Darabont's rendition of one of my favorite Stephen King short stories. For the MOST part it exceeds in creating an atmosphere of paranoia with the resultant skewed judgement of several key characters. I've watched BOTH the color and the black-and-white versions. I prefer the BNW because it sorta captures the \\"essence\\" of old Twilight Zone and Outer Limits TV shows pretty accurately (not necessarily the \\"age\\" but more the \\"low budget enthusiasm\\"). The special effects are MOSTLY subdued (which is KEY) with the exception of the first \\"tentacle\\" scene which is pretty cheesy. The black-and-white version subdues this part of the film to an ALMOST acceptable level. Marcia Gay Harden puts on a \\"tour-de-force\\" as a religious zealot and the other characters are pretty well portrayed. My MAIN beef is with the ending. I guess Darabont was looking for something \\"deeper and more emotionally profound\\". I thought the short story (as King had written it) left us with an uneasy feeling of dread and uncertainess that was even more compelling. IN FACT...I can picture a scene (near the end of Darabont's cut) when the movie SHOULD have ended. I wish an \\"alternate ending\\" had been supplied with the DVD. If I had never read the short story I probably would have admired the ironic twist at the end. NEVERTHELESS...it is a good enough flick for admirers of \\"low-budget\\" sci-fi/horror to enjoy repeated viewings. 3.75 stars. ALSO...the \\"Collector's Edition\\" is the ONLY way to go on this one....the Black-And-White version is worth the price of admission alone. Cheers.
0061564893|2.0|Overall I did not like this book.  The premise is interesting, and there may be some truth in some of the points made in the book, but I was dissappointed with the weak reasoning, and the exaggerated tone of the book.  By half-way through I felt I was reading a book about \\"Bigfoot\\" or the \\"Yeti\\", rather than a well researched history.  I will avoid this author in the future.
B00000ICN5|5.0|Stevie Ray Vaughan was, without a doubt, the greatest Blues-Rock guitarist of all-time. However, I'd like to stress the term, \\"Blues Rock\\", and not \\"Blues\\". He was not a Bluesman. Being a Bluesman requires more than just playing Blues guitar licks very fast and accurately. On this album, his singing is solid, the music makes the listener move his/her feet, the guitar playing is frantic and a great deal of fun, and Vaughan simply comes across as having an original image and sound. The album is available for a very cheap price on Amazon.com, so you should definitely pick it up. This is Vaughan's best album. Although I detest him being considered \\"the best Bluesman\\", he was still a great musician and I would have loved to have seen him live in concert. His pre-mature death will remain one of the greatest tragedies in music history. \\"Pride And Joy\\", \\"Texas Flood\\" and \\"Rude Mood\\" are all excellent. Fenton Robinson also performed \\"Texas Flood\\" on his \\"Somebody Loan Me A Dime\\" album, and it sounds a great deal different than it does on this album.
B00012QLQ4|4.0|In the years since Akira was first unleashed, a lot has changed in anime - and movies in general, animated or not.  Animation has become more sophisticated, voice acting has gotten much better and I think Akira is a big reason why (along with the likes of Ghost In The Shell and Armitage III).    I picked this up a couple years ago, and was mostly happy with my purchase.  It sill looks as good as I remember, and the option to translate some of the grafitti and signs is nice for gaijin like me.  However, I'm not as fond of the new English dub.  While I don't remember the original dialogue line for line, this isn't the same.  Some of the voices sound *off* and I'm pretty sure some of the dialogue was changed.    I consider myself a fan of anime, not a fanatic.  I'm not familiar hundreds of titles, I don't know everyone's name and I don't worship everything that comes out of Japan.  I guess that's part of why I prefer dubs over subs.  Even with the best translations, you don't get the full meaning unless you're familiar with the original language, in which case you don't need to be using the subtitles anyway.  With the right voice actors and the proper way of translation and localizing the dialogue (and other things, if needed), you can convey the exact same thing, even if it's not a 100% accurate, word for word translation.  Subtitles can't do much beyond tell you what the person is saying; they can't tell you how they're saying it, what they're stressing, stuff like that.  Some things don't translate very well, and changing them to something that makes sense in the subtitles doesn't always work; you need something more, which English voice acting has a much better chance of doing.    But that's just a matter of personal opinion.  The English dub is the only thing I find flawed with this release.  Of course, the movie itself has issues of its own - namely the rushed feeling that the end that seems as though the Akira Committee started to run out of steam.  Some may point out that this doesn't tell the whole story that the manga version does or remain faithful to every detail in it, but that shouldn't stop you from seeing this movie.    20 years later, Akira is still a must see if you're into anime that's not of the non-sensical sort.  And even if you're not into anime, it should still be worth a watch or two.  Just go into this with an open mind and be prepared to see or hear something new each time.    Sure, it may not be the best anime ever, but it's still up there as one of the best around.  Top 10 material, even.
B0017TWUZG|5.0|Everything about this film FAR exceeds the first in the series. First of all, the actors are way more talented, in both their dancing and acting skills. Where Channig Tatum was practically robotic in the original, Rob Hoffman is charming and funny.  Brianna also adds a good element, because where Nora was the goody two shoes, Brianna's more tough, and fights for what she wants. And the dance sequences will absolutely blow you away.  Rather than looking overly rehearsed, the moves come across as smooth and amazing.  The plot as a whole seems to be less cliche-y as well.    I think that this is a movie that anyone can enjoy, but it seems that people are split on which is better.  Some think the first is better, while others prefer this newer, more hip version. Either way, this movie is DEFINITELY worth checking out!
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|Coldplay's fourth and highly anticipated album, \\"Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends\\" comes at a crucial point in their career as well as the business future of their label EMI/Capitol.<br /><br />During this day and age we have watched the gradual fall of the mega juggernauts of the music business industry as music becomes an increasingly digital media based enterprise, and the major labels are just slowly curling up and dying away as artists go independent or join up with indie labels.<br /><br />EMI/Capitol, Coldplay's major label keeper, are treading on precarious ground right now. They are in the middle of restructuring - company bought out by a private equity firm Terra Firma - new CEO Guy Hands is on board - A&R department cut by 1/3, and also with the dramatic departure and huge success of Radiohead and their subsequent 'free content' download offering back in 2007 with 'In Rainbows', the music industry world has been topsy-turvy. Now here comes Coldplay, super star success and carrying all of EMI/Capitol's hopes and dreams for a future. So it looks like EMI will not be looking for new bands, but rather be holding on dearly to its successes and saturate the market with them.<br /><br />That is a lot of pressure to carry, even for a Rock Giant such as Coldplay.<br /><br />Back in 2005 - with the release of their previous album X&Y - Chris Martin (the frontman of Coldplay) had said that \\"Shareholders are the great evil of this Modern World.\\" Back then, Capitol had taken great lengths to ensure that the album X&Y would have heavy sales to keep the business afloat, and once again, we find the band in the exact same predicament, unfortunately at this point the critics are leering on the side lines just waiting to pounce since many sophisticates were disgusted with Coldplay's last record. (NY Times, 'The Case Against Coldplay', June 5, 2005, by Jon Pareles) Pareles pointed out that, \\"It's supposed to be compassionate, empathetic, magnanimous, inspirational. But when the music swells up once more with tremolo guitars and chiming keyboards, and Mr. Martin's voice breaks for the umpteenth time, it sounds like hokum to me. \\" Even though, the sophisicates were repulsed, the rest of the world revelled in the album which sold over 10,500,000+ worldwide.<br /><br />Furthermore we find that after the commerical success of X&Y, Coldplay was almost near the end of being a band as well. Chris Martin in an interview with Brian Boyd (Columnist for the Irish Times) stated: \\"After the last album we weren't really talking to each other, we were falling apart. We didn't own ourselves: there were too many swanky dinners, too many award ceremonies. We could almost just have phoned in the songs for the new album from our holiday homes. I wanted to burn all the awards, erase the past.\\"<br /><br />So now we have, EMI's business at risk here, Coldplay's need to please both their existing fans and the naysayers, and now the very future of the band at risk with the potential of falling apart at its seams. With so much pressure riding on their success with this album, Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends, the title almost seems befitting. Is this the death throes of the band, or the 'Achtung Baby' of their careers?<br /><br />The band has been compared considerably to U2 and their arena rock greatness; they have even compared themselves to U2 a number of times; so for them to enlist Brian Eno in the production of the album - the ambient music genius - was a wise decision. Brian Eno is closely related to U2's fantastic soundscapes, and helped develop the band throughout their albums Unforgettable Fire, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby to name of few. 'Achtung Baby' for U2 was a grand departure from their earlier sound and proved a huge success, and now with Coldplay's Viva La Vida it proves to be a comparable counterpart since it has been labeled as an 'experimental' album for them.<br /><br />With Brian Eno onboard (who dislikes chords, and clever progressions), the album pushes more towards textures and rhythms... essentially more primal and less heady. The album overall musically, and presentation wise is a solid cohesive album. The influence of Eno is palpable (with world music galore) in tracks like Life in Technicolor (which uses a hammer dulchimer at one point), Lost! (which reeks of U2 with church organs and soaring Edge-like guitars); Reign of Love (Martin's classic piano with shimmering, humming ambient noises in the back); Yes/Chinese Sleep Chant (lots of middle eastern flourishes care of Davide Rossi and his violin arranging); Death and All His Friends and The Escapist (Life In Technicolor with Martin's wistful vocals.)<br /><br />Of the album my personal favorites are Strawberry Swing which is a great upbeat song filled with delayed guitars and anthemic choruses, and also Viva La Vida. I hate to admit it but the album's title track - string sections bursting, and the trademark anthems screaming- is infectiously catchy.... this track is almost a guilty pleasure since it is so blatantly poppy. Thanks to EMI/Capitol this song is going to be hounding the airwaves for at least the next two years - as well as TV with their Apple iTunes commercial spot.<br /><br />Martin's lyrics are as awkward and vapid as ever, but still catchy nonetheless. He is no Bob Dylan or great revolutionary song writer - but he has a knack for great hooks, and anthemic chants which could get any stadium full of thousands of fans roaring in response.<br /><br />So in the end - it looks like Coldplay came out of this career knot unscathed. After the initial sales of the album, the pre-orders on iTunes, and purchases since the albums release in June (316,000 copies sold on the first day of release), Viva La Vida sat in the no. 1 slot in the U.K., Japan, Australia, Canada, France, and Germany back in late June right after its release, so now at least EMI/Capitol will be happy for the next year or less.... until the inevitable threat of the future of the music industry knocks on their doors again.<br /><br />The problem with the album is that it tries too hard to please way too many people - by enlisting Eno they tried to give it an artsy edge to satisfy the critics (which sort of does, but not really, because you still have the same band as before); they try really hard to please the huge fanbase they already have (by including signature anthems and Chris Martin heart on the sleeve vocals), but it seems to still be over used; and they also need to please their major label masters by ensuring that the tracks have plenty of 'pop' to them for radio play and tv spots.<br /><br />So the album might not quite be an 'Achtung Baby' of artistic success and development, but they sure gave a valiant effort on their newest release.<br /><br />-Andrew D.B.

B000O179A4|5.0|I love DreamGirls it has a great picture and its definitely a movie you want to add to your collection.
B000VBIEXS|5.0|I first bought this on LP when in High school, and loved it right away; the work was innovative and hasn't lost its complex beauty in the passing three decades. I remember at the time seeing concert footage of ELP and Emerson playing a Grand Piano that was spinning head over heals.<br /><br />I loved the morbid love song \\"Still, you turn me on\\", and the funny \\"Benny the Bouncer\\", as well as the rendition of the Classical \\"Toccata\\", but strangely the song that stuck with me is the Church of England hymn \\"Jerusalem\\", I remember singing it without a hymnal, one Sunday in England, and the look on the locals faces, to see that I knew it by heart.<br /><br />I on occasion still blast this on my commute home, and am sure the people at the stoplights wonder what the heck it is I'm listening to.<br /><br />If you are interested in the subject of Avent Guard music from the 70's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" is a good place to look.
B0011QC9U6|2.0|This movie has great graphics, great actors/actresses (Hopkins, Jolie, etc), great writers (Writer of the comic, Sandman).... but it doesn't work.  It is like mixing pizza and ice cream together because they are your favorite foods.  Unfortunately.... Beowulf is a dog.  Avoid this movie unless you are renting.
B0017QDH3S|3.0|Jumper seemed like a great idea for a movie, so we did the Unbox download, which really gives an amazing quality picture for your movie watching.<br /><br />Jumper turned out to seem more like a pilot for a TV show that got away from the budget, and ran out of storyline. Not that it is revolting, it just isn't very good. There isn't any thing to learn from it, nothing to laugh at etc. I was never able to establish any empathy with any of the characters. The only redeeming factor in the film is the special effects, which are pretty cool, but still not amazing.<br /><br />So here's the deal.... If you are in the mood for a good sci-fi, read a book, because this isn't it
0151013837|5.0|This is an absolutely gorgeous edition of Yann Martel's 'Life of Pi'. The pictures are vivid and beautifully drawn. The pages themselves are heavy and quality. I'd recommend this as a gift for yourself or any reader. A young reader, especially, could get lost in the fable told between the pages of this special edition, both in word and drawing.
3551354014|5.0|I am learning German, so I thought buying a book that I have already read both in English and Spanish would be a nice experiment.

I do not think there is need to review the Harry Potter literature itself, I can just say I love this book in any language.

B0013J9KOO|5.0|Thanks to Downtown Comics, I was able to watch a sneak preview of Hellboy II.<br />---<br /><br />In the opening scene, a young Hellboy is told a story about a long-forgotten time when the mystical creatures were at war against the humans. The Golden Army was forged and given as a gift to the elf king to use against the humans.  But after the battle where all humans were slaughtered, the king decided never to use the indestructible Golden Army again. But the king's son, Prince Nuada disagreed and went into exile. And now, in present day, Prince Nuada has returned to reclaim the Golden Army and wipe humanity off the face of the earth. Hellboy and his fellow BPRD team members must protect humanity against the ruthless prince.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this sequel, and it actually lived up to my expectations.  The cast was, once again, stellar.  Luke Gross was particularly chilling as the evil Prince Nuada. Anna Walton plays his twin sister Princess Nuala with abundant grace and beauty. New BPRD leader, Johann Krauss, was a particular treat, voiced by Seth MacFarlane. Krauss exists in a gaseous form, contained in a bulky suit; but has a wonderful personality. His presence dominated each of his scenes. Jeffrey Tambor provided more comic relief in his role as Tom Manning of the BPRD. And, of course, Ron Perlman (Hellboy), Selma Blair (Liz Sherman), and Doug Jones (Abe Sapien) all reprised their roles to perfection. And I'm glad that Jones was able to voice the role this time around. He also has a love connection in the movie that is endearing and emotional. The character interaction is one of the things I love most about the Hellboy movies. They each have their own distinct personalities. And with Hellboy, there's no wishy-washy. He either likes someone, or he doesn't. And he's not afraid to show it. His disagreements with Manning and Krauss are some of the most humorous scenes.<br /><br />The creatures are in, writer and director, del Toro's distinct style. No pretty little creatures here. They're mostly dark and disturbing. And they definitely add to the ambiance and create an uneasy feeling. The action as well as visual effects stepped up a notch in this sequel. Luke Gross is particularly fun to watch has he fights Hellboy. Prince Nuada is all skill and grace, and Hellboy is brute force and muscle. All of this adds to the exciting, fast-paced, and dramatic storyline, making this a must-see hit. Hellboy II: The Golden Army is everything this fangirl could ask for in an action-packed, summer blockbuster.<br /><br />Go. See. It.They're mostly dark and disturbing.

B0019FOC5E|3.0|Many know or are familiar with the music; \\"Mama Mia!\\" is all ABBA; fun, whimsical, outright blissful and enjoyable. The question is how does this movie soundtrack hold up? The answer is that it's pretty good. Right off hand, I felt some of the movie versions of these songs were a bit too campy and lacked the hard-to-capture spirit of the original. The songs where Pierce Brosnan sings on made me cringe, really taking me as a listener out of the song and making me feel thankful that he isn't featured on many songs. On the other hand, the Meryl Streep songs are actually really good. Her voice is well suited for the music, playing into the simplicity and able to capture the innocence and vibe of the songs.<br /><br />For me, stand out tracks are \\"Our Last Summer\\", \\"Dancing Queen\\", \\"Lay All Your Love On Me\\", and the real stand-out on the soundtrack, \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" that features Meryl Streep really stretching her vocals.  In all, it's an enjoyable soundtrack but it's always hard to rate this and not compare it to the original or even the broadway version. Check it out.

0698115635|4.0|This cumulative tale goes quickly through the days of the week, each day featuring a different animal and a different food.

Not one of my favorites, but we do manage to fit it in a few times a month.
B001ADU4FM|5.0|bar none for me this is the Whitney Houston Album that to me is her best. vocally she is Soulful and getting ready to handle her business. How will I know, saving all my love for you, take good care of my heart with Jermaine Jackson and other songs are on point. Whitney Houston to me is the Most Important Female Artist over the past 25-30 years easily and she has inspired countless other females acts over the years. Whitney brought so much soul and depth on this album.from start to finish this Album for me is her best easily.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Truly a great movie that you can enjoy over and over again.  Acting is beautiful, scenery is just what it sounds like in the book.  The only thing I would have like to see is the ending with a little more aniticipation.  The sequence of finally finding Mr. Rochester and bringing him a glass of water should have been done with as much tension and anticipation as the rest of the movie.  I think had it been 1-2 more segments long like Pride and Prejudice, it would have made all the difference.  However, overall I adored this movie.

B00127RAJY|5.0|WOW! This video is amazing! I am a mother of 4 children, all one year apart. Despite not being back in my prime form, I am very athletic: I run, roller blade, take workout classes at the Y, do workout videos (Turbo, Tae Bo) in my basement. However, this video is challenging, fun, 20 minutes of constant movement and extremely effective...and that is only the first level! I have not made it beyond the first level, as there are three total levels. I was sore for days after my first time through Level 1! I can now pop in the video and immediately feel results. My goal is to do the workout daily, reaching Level 3 eventually and completing 30 straight days. Jillian is awesome!
B00102F5WK|4.0|I'm glad that this film was made. The issue covered in this film needs to be made public as many people don't know about `extraordinary rendition' and the ramifications of this government rule. It's maddening to know that you can be taken prisoner and tortured without a court order just because you have a certain name/ appearance.     The torture scenes are indescribably horrific but I suppose they needed to make the film as graphically `real' as possible. What I found most disturbing is that the incident that happened in the film has probably happened to countless people. The only part of the film which I found unbelievable was the ending; I sincerely doubt that there is a `light at the end of the tunnel' in reality.    The film was well-casted and the acting was so powerful, I needed to remind myself that I was watching a film and not a documentary.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|This season was somewhat of a disappointment after the thrill ride of season 1 and 2. With the introduction of the questionable characters Bella and Ruby and with the constant killings of demons instead of other folklore that made season 1 and 2 so entertaining, it's a bit lacking.    Don't get me wrong. I am still going to order season 3 and watch it over and over again. Supernatural is still by far my favorite show. Not only that but it seemed to get through the writers strike very gracefully. It is just not comparable to season 1 or 2.
0452289963|5.0|This book has opened my mind and heart to bring presence or awareness to each moment. The book discussed about Consciousness as well as ego in a profound, deep level. In reading this book, I have gained a totally new perspective of things and situations. I have become more in touch with (my) Soul. It is very enlightening to \\"awaken\\" and feel the oneness of all with Source. I feel like a new person --I've become more compassionate towards other people esp. to those who has too much hatred or fear. It is life changing in a very positive way. The online class on Oprah.com/anewearth is very much recommended as a supplement to reading this book. Any member of faith can gain an insight from reading this spiritual book.
B00005JKJA|5.0|This should be recognized as one of the greatest works of Art ever to be committed to celluloid. Lynch is able to plumb deeply into the sub-conscious of all of us and construct a story which resonates on a primal, visceral, instinctive, and altogether natural level.  Lynch shows how ultimate truth is revealed in dreams despite our feeble attempts to relegate our fears, insecurities and guilt to our subconscious during our waking hours.  In dreams, all of our emotions and thoughts are fleshed out for better or for worse.  Our dreams can amuse us when we do good, and terrify us when we do evil!  Perhaps good and evil are absolute concepts after all, and are non-negotiable!?    While the film is highly structured and self-explanatory (for those who view it repeatedly and carefully), like most of Lynch's work, and particularly \\"Inland Empire,\\" this film is so beautifully crafted that it can be appreciated solely on an aesthetic level, but ideally on an intellectual one as well.    MD is haunting, brilliant, and the work of a genius. Just when I was losing interest in superficial and banal modern film-making, David has given us a real diamond in the rough!    P.S - If you don't like challenging films which make you think and concentrate, or if your idea of a great film is about sub-woofers and explosions, avoid this at all costs.  If you are amazed at human psychology and drama, don't miss this!     ----------------------------------------------    Want to know who the scary, dirty homeless man in the alley may be?    Well, here is my take at least:    Most obviously, he is an element of her dream.  All of the characters that inhabit her dream are people Diane has met or seen briefly during her waking state. Some are significant characters and some are not.  Ever dream about the most absurd or trivial things yourself?  For instance, notice the mafioso type at the party at the end of the movie who Diane only briefly notices as she is wiping away tears?  He may have been asignificant part of her life, or he may have just been someone who caused her momentary embarrassment.  Here is the genius of Lynch.  He is demonstrating that nothing is too trivial or absurd that cannot be dreamt about.  This is why Dianne constructs the pool man farce in her dream after only a brief mention of him by Camilla's fiancé.    The dirty and horrifying homeless man, who is able to scare us with his abrupt appearance may represent the subconscious guilt that Diane is suffering through.  He is retribution personified, of having to pay for her crimes, through mental anguish.  This is possibly how he is manifested in her dream: When Diane is negotiating with the hit man in Winkies to kill Camilla, there is a tall, dark guy who Diane only briefly glimpses at the other end of the room.  He gives her a brief but intense stare.  This same character, now present in her dream,  gives the suspenseful anecdote of \\"the guy who is always there,\\" walks to the alley, is startled by the homeless man, and falls to the ground petrified.  At the brief moment when Diane sees him staring at her in Winkies, she no doubt felt fear and anxiety about planning Camilla's death, or being discovered, and therefore even seemingly innocent glances take on a more suspicious nature.  It is no accident that the unnamed guy standing at the bar morphs into a character in her dream that is obsessed and overcome with fear.  Diane is afraid of every bogeyman now, because of guilt, she is even pursued in her dreams.  Our dreams are often comprised of metaphors, and usually bizarre, but reveal general truths, in this case, in a very emotional (terrifying way).  She will not have peace until she has dealt with her sins and cleansed her conscience.  Then her nightmares will go away.    The dirty/scary homeless man can also be an archetype of the devil who metaphorically at least, dwells in places such as \\"sin city\\" or \\"Tinseltown,\\" where men lose their souls for wanting it all at any cost.  These are the places where men sell their souls.  Where they are promised the world, but are deceived by the great serpent and deceiver of old; the arch-nemesis of humanity.     Like any true art, Lynch allows multiple interpretations..

0061537934|5.0|Lessons through the Journey of Life as seen through the eyes of a Dog named Enzo. Enzo knows more about our place in the Universe than we do. He knows that death is not the end but rather a new beginning and, in the place where souls gather, you do live out your dreams and desires and you are free from the physical burdens that your body and living on Earth have placed on you. This book will teach you to be patient, tolerant, trusting, loving, and never give up hope, because if you remain true to yourself and others, your dreams will unfold in the proper time.  This is such a great book, I am reading it again (I never read a book twice) because I did not want to miss a thing.

B000VKJ6VS|4.0|Let me start by saying I have been a fan of Alter Bridge for a while now, I think since right after their first album was released. Blackbird is an album worth purchasing, but I think that One Day Remains is a much better album than Blackbird.    Maybe it's because I'm not a huge fan of the heavier songs, but on One Day Remains, every song was fantastic: musically, lyrically, and I think every song on it is \\"memorable\\" in one way or another. As for Blackbird, there were several songs on the CD that really stood out to me, but a few I didn't enjoy every much at all. I felt like the band was sacrificing Myles' talent for the darker, heavier backdrop. Brand New Start, Coming Home, and Before Tomorrow Comes sound more like the first album, and they're some of my favorites of the CD.    I'd highly recommend both of Alter Bridge's albums, but One Day Remains is a truly epic masterpiece I feel wasn't quite matched by Blackbird.
0345495004|5.0|Every once in awhile, I read an engrossing book that I don't want to put down.  \\"Loving Frank\\" is a page turner.  Outlining a short period of history when Frank Lloyd Wright was involved with a woman outside of marriage, this book is romanticised a bit, but otherwide sticks to historical fact.  The reader gains insight into Frank Lloyd Wright's character and his relationship with Maymah Cheney, a strong woman who in the name of love, rejects the life that society expects of her.          After reading this book, it is hard to move on to something else.  It's that good! An excellent choice for summer reading.

0020444907|5.0|This amazing book takes you on a journey to a fantasy world of animated excitement. It is an excellent read for young ones as well as adults. There's plenty of epic adventure, with a storyline of no dull moments. The detailed narration was so vivid; it was as if I was living through the characters experience all of the action in real life.     I loved the characters, the storyline and adventures. There were also funny scenes that any audience can appreciate. This was a very good book.
0143039601|5.0|A few decades down the road from its publication, Jack Kerouac's The Dharma Bums seems positively prophetic. The book tells of Kerouac's adventures with his Beat-Generation bohemian cohorts in '50s America, and we can see how they and other hipsters of the time paved the way for the social and cultural revolutions of the following decades.<br /><br />Originally published in 1958, the book covers events in Kerouac's life between September '55 and August '56. At the time, he had a rucksuck full of much praised yet still unpublished writings, and was soon to ride the whirlwind of fame that would be generated by the publication of On The Road. He was also trying to follow the path of Buddhism while shaking the demons of melancholy and booze, at a time when cocktails were served at business lunches and few in America had ever heard of \\"Zen,\\" let alone the Dalai Lama.<br /><br />There's not much to the plot: Ray Smith (standing in for Kerouac) visits his pals Japhy Ryder (poet Gary Snyder) and Alvah Goldbrook (poet Allen Ginsberg) in Berkeley, bounds up Matterhorn Peak with Ryder, explores Buddhism, attends a now-legendary San Francisco poetry reading (at the Six Gallery), and generally tries to find new kicks and follow his bliss.<br /><br />As it describes Ray's wanderings, The Dharma Bums is full of optimism and melancholy, and romantic in its own unique way: Goethe meets Han Shan in the land of Eisenhower. It is one of the alcoholic writer's last stabs at breaking through his sadness, trying to step through a door into a new life. He is close to succeeding but for the wine and his unshakable brooding and impracticality. The book swings between \\"wild, yelling, wailing, stomping\\" around with lusty excited optimistic talk and \\"all is emptiness anyway\\" sighs and renunciations. Unfortunately, it is a document of a personal transformation not completed and a last happy season before the storm. In real life, Snyder took off to study in Japan and Kerouac lost his steadying influence, and fame and success would drive the already shy writer further into his bottle.<br /><br />The Dharma Bums has great descriptions of places, attitudes, and people, including a marvelous portrait of the charismatic poet Snyder. The writing has a casual tone, yet is vivid and focused, and startling in its forecasting of cultural things to come. Kerouac was way ahead of his time with his evocation of Buddhism-in-action in '50s tract-home America.  And he articulates the discontent of Americans unhappy with their country's prevailing zeitgeist. The character Japhy says, \\"You know when I was a little kid in Oregon I didn't feel that I was an American at all, with all that suburban ideal and sex repression and general dreary newspaper gray censorship of all our real human values.\\"<br /><br />We feel the groundswell of the coming decade: of hippies, sexual liberation, the environmental movement, the Green Party, and college students backpacking through Europe or their own mountains. Japhy adds, \\"I see a vision of a great rucksack revolution, thousands or even millions of young Americans wandering around with rucksacks, going up to the mountains to pray, making children laugh and old men glad, young girls happy and old girls happier....Ray, by God, later on in our future life we can have a fine free-wheeling tribe in these California hills, get girls and have dozens of radiant enlightened brats, live like Indians in hogans and eat berries and buds...East'll meet West anyway.\\"<br /><br />It worked out that way for Gary Snyder (who went off to live in the Sierra Nevada foothills and has had a long career as an accomplished poet, naturalist and professor). It wasn't the path for Kerouac after all, yet his visions, wanderings and electric prose in The Dharma Bums, On The Road and other books have inspired millions of readers all over the world.ccess would drive the already shy writer further into his bottle.

B00005JLWN|5.0|If you are a fan of \\"Dark City,\\" you will enjoy this visual treat - a dance macabre, a vicious, graceful delight, and critique of antidepressants. Totally original, yet an homage to Bradbury's \\"Fahrenheit 451\\" and Lang's \\"Metropolis.\\" Christian Bale is subtle in portraying both control and loss of control, each emotion a careful part of the narrative, he grows in depth as each painful experience of emotion is peeled back from the drug-induced onion-skin. There is nothing over the top with this layering, this cleric/assassin grows in character and depth. The song \\"What Have They Done to Me\\" by Visage [[ASIN:B000002R9H Anvil]] could be the soundtrack here, or just about anything by Sisters of Mercy: [[ASIN:B0030HG3K6 Original Album Series:A Slight Case Of Overbombing/Some Girls Wander By Mistake/First And Last And Always/Floodland/Vision Thing]]. Sean Bean is always excellent, as is Emily Watson. As an aside, never has a puppy looked so lovable. This movie haunts the past and suggests a possible future. Wake up. Take off your gloves. Feel life. As with true Sci-Fi, moral questions are framed within new technologies, our choices as human beings are further stretched by each innovation, perhaps to breaking point. Is this the future, is it the past? In an almost recognizable, unfamiliar environment, the elements that consist of a soul, of a society, are confronted, making \\"Equilibrium\\" both futuristic and ancient in its concerns. You also might enjoy the \\"Riddick\\" and \\"Underworld/Evolution\\" films. Try the noir [[ASIN:B0018O4YT0 Dark City (Director's Cut)]].<br /><br />You might enjoy this mythic adventure, from 1960s era Doctor Who (beware the 1980s & 90s versions), to [[ASIN:B000E41MS6 Doctor Who: The Complete First Series]], and onward to the [[ASIN:B002ZHKZEM Doctor Who: The Complete Specials (The Next Doctor / Planet of the Dead / The Waters of Mars / The End of Time Parts 1 and 2)]].

B00005JPTK|1.0|This is the flattest, limp, and dull thing. After reading all these superlative reviews, it was a total disappointment, given the great material and potential. Some classic Bob Marley music does not a great film make. There is no character development, only an inexplicable unraveling of Smith, in what amounts to a slow suicide by stupid choices. As a Doctor, who supposedly is super-intelligent and tough, he should have shot his dog once it got infected, not slowly strangle it, each tear and emotion lovingly filmed as it leaks off Smith's close-up. And let me tell you, Vermont ain't that cold (plot hole #401), what about a NYC winter and the mutants? For excellent futuristic Sci-Fi, try the film \\"Equilibrium\\" which is far superior, as are the series of \\"Riddick,\\" \\"Blade,\\" and \\"Underworld/Evolution\\" films.

A hole other part of me took over, this show is just wonderful and looking at the book of the stage show and playing the cd I couldn't wait to see it.  I did get to see it in Phila. the touring company and they were just, just.....there are no words to say how wonderful this show is.  Watching this show there is no way it can't effect you, enless you are as hard as a rail.  If you can pick up the cd buy the book of the musical or just go see it...it truly is great fun to sit and just watch this piece of magic weave its songs and visiual spell.  I can't and haven't heard anyone come out of this show and say it wasn't entertainment.    To Stephen Schwartz and company I can only say they did one HELL of a job bring this to the stage...............Now wheres that movie?
0312330537|3.0|Overlong, overwritten, over-self-conscious and under-edited, Shantaram is a book that almost sinks under its own weight. While the details on the slums and the criminal underworld of Bombay are fascinating, the second-rate epigrams of Karla and Didier, the endless uncalled-for philosophical symposia, and the final jaunt to Afghanistan all became a bit too much and I was skipping pages by the end. The author has had many unique experiences, but I would have preferred to hear about them without all the fictional-philosophical encrustations. There is an interesting speech on YouTube (search for Gregory David Roberts or Shantaram) where the author recounts some of the same experiences, complete with accents and movement (in particular, head wiggles). It will be interesting to see if the old adage about \\"Bad Book = Good Film\\" comes true in this case. How on earth can so much be compressed into an 90 minutes?
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|this was a great way to show a robin hood theme with a twist.  Getting rid of the bad people for the good.  I liked that it wasn't gory like so many other shows.  They focused on the theme of who dexter was and made it thoroughly enjoyable. There was quite a bit of language such as the F word.  If you watch this series with the family, make sure swear words do not bother you.  We watched it with our three kids, 9, 11, and 14.  They all know they are not allowed to use bad words.  I was not concerned about the words as they hear them in school.  All of them really enjoyed dexter's character and the carrying plot.

However, as you continue to watch you realize that this just adds to the personal nature of the film. It is truly a beautiful work of art, from the music to the overall atmosphere created by the story intertwined with the Irish culture and environment. This movie will be cherished for years to come as a genuine, emotion driven film of relationships, about recognizing the miracles in daily life. Highly recommend it.

159562015X|4.0|While not a cure-all, this book could be helpful to most people and especially beneficial to recent grads, job changers, and the mass of bored workers.      The concept of the book is: people spend too much time trying to fix their deficiencies and that's the wrong way to improve (the path of most resistance).  We should be focusing on strengthing those talents that we have naturally.  This is not a new concept, but the book outlines it clearly and with good examples.     The only value of the book, aside from a few short chapters, is the strengthsfinder access code.  And this is pretty valuable.  Strengthsfinder.com is a 30 minute quiz to determine your talents. After determining your top 5 talents the website creates an action plan for you.  It's more than a basic personality test.  I found it to be accurate, but your results may vary.  The action plan was especially helpful to me. It gave me insights into my personality that I didn't see before.  I suppose the best praise I can give it is I've recommended to my friends and family.  I am also considering buying it for a few others in my office. It can't hurt and for a reasonable price it may help you understand yourself and others and make you more productive.

I had never read anything by this author, and the subject matter just seemed so interesting, so I picked up this book.    There are so many ways such an interesting subject could've been approached, and this book didn't tell me anything I didn't already know. What in imperceptive and simple way to look at the lives of bullied children and how they think. What a boring and lame portrayal of the families of these kids. There was no depth here.    So many times, in frustration and nausea, I closed the book and wasn't going to finish it. Then, I kept giving it another shot, hoping it would grip me. Finally, with about 25 pages left, I threw it in the trash. What a waste of time. I would never purchase another novel by Jodi Picoult. A total disappointment.
0446677450|1.0|Why is this the worst book ever?    Because Robert promotes multi-level marketing (ie: [Sc]Amway)  Robert has made no money on multi-level marketing.  99% of people do not make money on multi-level marketing.    Robert made his money selling fluffy, motivational books that brainwash people into having false dreams that multi-level marketing will bring fortune, fame and women.    If you actually want to make money: read a book about how to write fluffy motivational books, then read a book on how to market your fluffy book to millions of Scamway drones.  Finally, write a fluffy motivation book.  Oh yeah, brainwash people into thinking they need to play $300 board games as they read the book too.

It's the second album Yes recorded with guitarist Steve Howe, and their first with keyboard wizard Rick Wakeman. The Yes concept and sound really came into full focus with this album, and their trademark sonic perfection was smoothly achieved in some of Fragile's best moments.<br /><br />The album begins with the incredible Roundabout, a Yes multi-part masterwork that still remains their most popular song today. It's an impressive exercise in artistic creativity, and a brilliant example of progressive rock music perfection. South Side Of The Sky is excellent sci-fi action guitar riff rock with some nice keyboard work and vocal harmonies. Long Distance Runaround is another one of Yes' greatest creations, and an example of the Yes formula at it's peak. The song is melodramatic and melodious perfection as it imaginatively describes a relationship that has ended too soon.<br /><br />Cold summer listening<br />Hot color melting the anger to stone<br />I still remember the dream there<br />I still remember the time you said goodbye<br />Did we really tell lies?<br />Letting in the sunshine<br />Did we really count to one hundred?<br /><br />There are four \\"solo\\" pieces on [[ASIN:B00007KWHP Fragile]], and bassist Chris Squire's excellent instrumental The Fish (Schindleria Praematurus) features his famously powerful and inventive bass lines. Rick Wakeman arranges Cans And Brahms, a nice classical piano piece that's accompanied by his own keyboards, and drummer Bill Bruford highlights his skills on the short Five Per Cent For Nothing. Steve Howe's classical guitar solo Mood For A Day is also enjoyable, and he still plays it at Yes concerts today. I like Jon Anderson's We Have Heaven, too. He sings all of the vocal parts, and it's an interesting and entertaining piece of music.<br /><br />The Yes classic, Heart Of The Sunrise, closes the original album and is a wonderfully sweeping and powerfully emotional epic. It's regarded by many as the most perfect song Yes has ever done and they just might be right. Anderson's compelling angelic vocal performance soars as he sings of loneliness and isolation in the crowded city.<br /><br />Love comes to you then after<br />Dream on...on to the heart of the sunrise<br />Sharp - distance<br />How can the sun with it's arms all around me<br />Sharp - distance<br />How can the wind with so many around me<br />...I feel lost in the city<br /><br />There are two bonus tracks including Yes' fantastic 10:33 minute version of Simon And Garfunkel's America. It's powerful, and Anderson's vocal performance takes the song to new heights. An early rough mix of Roundabout is also included.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00007KWHP Fragile]] is certainly one of Yes' best albums and a must-have for fans. It contains some of their greatest work, and is a staple of the grand \\"Classic Yes\\" period. It's also not a bad place to start with Yes if you want more than a compilation.

B00005T30L|5.0|Touted as a film on \\"over 140 Top Ten Lists\\" and \\"Best Film of the Year,\\" \\"Ghost World\\" really works. The fact that I had to watch it twice just to finish it doesn't mean much. I fell asleep the first time. I was tired and the movie was boring. Nix that. Because I was tired, the movie was boring.<br /><br />The second time I was totally alert to this film rife with meaning. Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlet Johannson) have been friends for ten years and have that mental telepathy of friendship of the closest kind. However, their friendship is based on being outsiders and isolated from the slightest connection with others, thus a friendship by default.<br /><br />Cynical and world-weary even as a recent graduate from high school, Enid finally finds a job in a movie theater doling out snacks to wary and unwary moviegoers. Enid does not mince words and if she says, How much chemical sludge do you want on your popcorn?,  you really can't blame the supervisor for firing her.<br /><br />The fact that the two young women are going to get an apartment together means a job is essential. Score a negative for Enid. Rebecca is disappointed. Again Rebecca expresses disapproval of Enid's cynical nature concerning boys. None is any good! The viewer can watch Rebecca's slow, yet discernible twist away from her best friend in this significant summer of growth. Change is inevitable, life is inexorable.<br /><br />The second weak link of summer is Enid's art class which she must pass to keep her diploma. The art teacher is a pseudo-hippy, quarking out artisms, not to impress, but because she is a product of this Ghost World. What has meaning? Art? What kind of art?<br /><br />Two oddities stream out of this segment: the poster Enid submits to make a statement and the art that is real, Enid's notebook of art created because she really is talented.<br /><br />The poster unifies the film in that it is the possession of Seymour (Steve Buscemi), an older version of Enid, disillusioned, unsettled with the world at large, and a citizen in the world of his own making. Seymour is Enid's hero and she unlikely bonds with him mentally and physically.<br /><br />Sleepwalk. The major characters sleepwalk through their lives, until Rebecca wakes up to self in the grand way that recent graduates can do. Enid becomes more entrenched in her self-imposed isolation in this Ghost World. It's not a happy film, but then life does not always offer happiness. Take it the way you find it or change it. That's what Enid does. (Intentional ambiguity)tizen in the world of his own making. Seymour is Enid's hero and she unlikely bonds with him mentally and physically.    Sleepwalk.

B0016NF06O|5.0|There is a happy medium between Willie and Wynton, and it is on the dusty bayou roads that link these two icons. The delta Blues Sound is unmistakable. Miles Davis once said that he enjoyed listening to Willie Nelson because he had a jazz sense to his music. Wynton Marsalis must have heard this because he has proven that theory is correct. Nonetheless this is enjoyable music, I can't stop listening to this CD. Think Billie Holliday replaced by Willie's Texas twang. Songs like \\"Basin Street Blues\\" and \\"Rainy Day Blues\\" are awesome.<br /><br />Joining the 2 Men' are Willie's harmonica player Mickey Raphael, and Wynton's band Walter Blanding on sax, Dan Nimmer on piano, Carlos Henriquez on bass & Ali Jackson on drums.<br /><br />Buy this CD now! A must have for not only fans of these 2 men, but those who want to further their history of American music!
B00008RWC2|4.0|OK. This is the first ever makeup book I bought -<br />and about one third of the photos in the book and<br />the techniques shared are practical AND useful for<br />the everyday person.<br /><br />The other one third are more fashion-editorial,<br />and period-pieces kind of images supposedly for our<br />inspiration... but not quite so useful in daily life.<br /><br />Now the other one third of the pictures in the book<br />are quite useless for me - because a) some are in black<br />and white photos!, b) some only show the profile of the<br />model so I don't know how she looks from the front,<br />c) some have strange effects - blurred, too much sparkle<br />dust all over the face, neck and shoulder, or fashion<br />runway type eye makeup that you'll never wear to work,<br />and not to be sexist but quite many shots of men dressed<br />up as women. Out of all these, I'd have to say that the<br />black and white photos are the most problematic for me -<br />because I haven't a clue what colors they are wearing!!!<br /><br />Some of the before and after shots are quite shocking -<br />and really shows how much CAN be done with makeup - p.100 -<br /><br />But once I started reading the step by step explanation<br />of how the makeup was actually applied to the face -<br />there wasn't much depth or detail -<br />just very general explanation of HOW they were applied -<br />so if you read a lot of fashion magazines, you might not be<br />so impressed with the text portion of the book -<br />I didn't learn much new techniques from this book -<br />not too much insight on the nitty-gritty of refining your skills -<br />(I got those from Rober Jones and Linda Mason later on) -<br />but the photos are inspiration enough... in most cases.<br /><br />If you're a beginner in makeup application, the first chapter<br />of the book does a pretty good job of explaining the basics -<br />the different textures of makeup available are well photographed,<br />a range of brow andlip shapes are well presented visually -<br /><br />but for contouring and learning to use makeup to enhance<br />your faceshape and eyeshapes - I recommend Robert Jones's book<br />\\"Makeup Makeovers\\".<br /><br />This is a good book for comprehensive photogrphic sourcebook -<br />because it has a good collection of Hollywood actresses,<br />professional models, and also everday people's makeovers with<br />before and after photos.<br /><br />Hope some of this helps...
B0012E6R3W|5.0|After many years since releasing a new album you'd think they may have lost their touch.  Not so.  Testament is back and in top form.  Chuck Billy (Testament's lead vocalist) has an excellent voice for conveying power and is totally kick a**, but also has an element of melody.  The guitars never stray too far from a melody also, but relax, it's hardcore enough to keep your head banging and the mosh pits active.  The guitars are thick and meaty and provide catchy satisfying riffs throughout the entire album.  The drums are perfect.  Yes, The Formation of Damnation is a satisfying listen indeed.  If you are new to Testament, this album is a good bet, but also consider The Gathering and Low.  All 3 are truly excellent Testament albums.
B0014DCTCY|1.0|I just did a mistake by buying the vinyl version of this great album. I collect vinyl, so I was very glade to have it. But it's a sonically shame !!! It's a mystery why the CD version sounds good and the vinyl SO BAD. Somebody has done something wrong on the way of producing the vinyl.
B00104W8T6|2.0|I don't think these songs will stand the test of time, but they catch the feeling of kids making music, just like the good movie of Juno was fresh and young.
B0017MO10U|3.0|\\"This is not really a review about the product per say.     I just have one question, I have read the other reviews and I was wondering when have any of you people have seen this movie.     Has it been released somewhere else or something?\\"    To answer this question: We've all been through a Space Time Continuum, saw the movie and miraculously made it back to this timeline.    As for the content of the movie. It was ok enough. Nothing spectacular but just a solid story. SG1 lost its edge a long time ago. It should've been killed at season 6 but what do I know.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melody Gardot's release \\"Worrisome Heart\\" might have had its start in trying to rehabilitate the singer after a devastating auto accident, but it turns out to be an outstanding release by a very talented musician.<br /><br />Gardot fits in the genre of a Madeleine Peyroux, and sounds like Eva Cassidy, but she has her own place with her collections of songs about love, loss, and desire that draw you in and lock the door behind you. Smooth, affecting, but yet passionate, Gardot tells her stories from a place of yearning, and not merely to elicit sympathy or pity. I imagine this is reflective of her attitude about her accident.<br /><br />\\"Worrisome Heart\\" should only be the beginning of a great musician's recording career.

0385512058|5.0|This is an amazing book that has done many things for me with the two most important: given me lots of ideas about marketing my business and validating personal ideas and business practices that I had.     I also very much enjoyed reading this book: it's full of examples of people that I have hear of and can identify with, it's well written with few \\"repeats\\" and best of all, it almost reads like a novel: you want to keep on reading!     I originally got this book from the library: I am buying it for my own collection as I'll want to refer to it over and over again.
1878424505|5.0|This book is very well written and easy to understand. It is a quick read, and I will reread it often to keep the material fresh.  The message is simple, yet very profound.  It truly opened my eyes and my heart to an awareness that had made a huge difference in the way I treat myself.  Most of us don't realize how we are silently killing our own souls by the way we think; this book helped me to realize and change a thought process that released negativity I didn't know was harboring in my soul.  As a result, it freed me and opened the path to a higher level of enjoyment and satisfaction in my life.  I will purchase many more copies as gifts for friends ... what great joy it will bring me to know that I gave someone I love the ability to be kinder to themselves, along with the tools to truly enjoy life!

0446619078|4.0|The Last Coyote is the fourth book in the Harry Bosch series by Michael Connelly. It is a gripping tale of Bosch's obsession with avenging his mother's death. Bosch's mom, a prostitute, was murdered when he was eleven. Until recently, it was too painful to even look at the details of the case. Now on administrative leave for assaulting a superior, Bosch spends his days talking with a police psychiatrist and trying to keep his earthquake damaged home from being condemned.<br /><br />While on leave, Bosch begins his own unofficial investigation into his mom's death over thirty years ago. He sneaks around LAPD headquarters gathering all the evidence and reviewing what the original detectives came up with. Bosch finds some powerful names in the murder book, including former district attorney Arno Conklin and his right hand man Gordon Mittell. Some of the principles of the case are still alive, some aren't, but once Bosch starts investigating, it becomes apparent that some people want the past to be left alone.<br /><br />This is one of the best books in the series, but not one you should read if you haven't read other books in the series. This book really delves into Bosch's past life and the darkness that has taken over his soul. There is a lot of introspection that first time Bosch readers probably wouldn't care about. There are a few twists and turns as well as a shocking death of one of the characters. You certainly don't have to read this series in order, but this is one where it would be great to do because Michael Connelly has been a great writer from the first book until the last.
B00005JOHC|5.0|If you have a funny bone at all, this will definitely tickle it.  There is no way not laugh....  Charlie and Alan play off each other so well, it's like a real brother relationship!  Great Show
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This mini-series put personality, skin and bones to the 'founding fathers' for me. I enjoyed it very much.
B0001VTPWM|4.0|The movies are great    however nothing seems right about the box:  - i own the LDs of the RoboCop trilogy and in terms of the graphics they use on the covers...this DVD box just looks rather...cheap  - and then there's the massive foldout design...gotta keep track of which flap goes over which flap...  - my biggest complaint is how fragile the clear-plastic-pushy-button-disc-releases are, i just somehow broke off all of them upon getting the dvds out, the first time    all in all, the dvds themselves are great and this is a must-have for robo fans!
B00000IL1K|5.0|A stunning effort, \\"Eden\\" picks up where \\"Time to Say Goodbye\\" left off and trailblazes Brightman into a successful territory where few, if any, classical artists could succeed.  Emotional, beautiful, exotic, tender, and pleasant all the way through.  Obvious influences come to mind with the myriad of diverse songs which suit even the most discriminating of listeners.
B00005221L|4.0|Arnold Schwarzenegger's 1987 hit film ventures into the \\"Alien\\" territory adding his macho image created by 1985 film \\"Commando\\". First section of the movie has the plot reminding me of Stallone's FIRST BLOOD PART 2. After the initial mission has done well, another mysterious task looms to the special task force led by Dutch played by Swarzenegger. Highly intelligent alien monster is elusive and hardly gives the team the clue to what it is until the end(even after the movie ends nagging question \\"who is he?\\" remains unsolved).<br /><br />It is so so enjoyable movie with high tension satisfying both the action movie fans and monster sci-fi fans.<br /><br />Verdict: Enjoyable movie and a nice start for longlasting series.<br />Rating: 85 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Alien movie fans and action movie fans.
B000127LW2|5.0|Great Season...makes a great gift for the Star Trek fan in your family.  Voyager is also a great starter series for any sci-fi fan if they haven't had any previous exposure to Star Trek.  Item arrived before scheduled.   The gift-wrap option at check-out is totally worth it if you are buying this as a gift.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Worth every penny! I could watch it over and over again. Gave it to my dad for fathers day and to my husband's dad for his birthday. They both love it. A must have for your personal DVD library!
B00005JPNY|1.0|If you enjoyed the book, avoid the movie! I bought this movie because, as an employee at store that rents movies, I could buy used DVD's for less than $5. That was $5 poorly spent. The book is so complicated and subtle you have to read it many times to get every tiny scrap out of it. The movie compressed that convoluted and hugely symbolic book into a 2 and a half hour movie. I can think of some more idiotic moves but not many. To someone who likes the book this movie is like taking the Bible (and every single story and backstory in it) and compressing it into a 1 or 2 hour movie. It's just not a good idea.   I'm not saying the Golden Compass is anything like the Bible, (don't want to offend any Christians, I myself am Catholic) I'm comparing the sheer volume of content that Hollywood has pared down.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|When you watch it in plasma screen it is as if you're watching it in the big screen.Very impressive.
6304698623|2.0|This film is lovely to look at and well acted, but the script has little in common with Frances Hodgson Burnett's story. The location has been moved from London to New York, the characters are poorly developed--if developed at all, and there are many, many departures from the original book. Being a huge fan of the book, which is my all-time favorite children's book, I was extremely disappointed with this film. If you haven't read the book, you will probably enjoy this rendition very much, but if you love the story, you will feel ripped off. It is a terrific story that does not need the massive amount of tweaking that it endured in this film. In fact, the original tale is all but unrecognizable here. What a shame.
1401308201|5.0|If you've seen the play, you will LOVE this book.  Great pictures, background, all the songs.  Couldn't be better.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|Back in the day at end of the 80s when thrash metal was fashionable, Testament were an underdog band, considered  a good band, though no match for the top three Metallica, Megadeth and Slayer.<br />Fast forward to 2008 and while Megadeth is basically the Dave Mustaine band living off past glories with a mercenary lineup and Metallica is struggling to come  out with an album that wont be as bad as St anger, Testament releases a classic as relevant as master of puppets or RIP; I had the opportunity to see Testament live last May and they were totally top form, the songs from this new album were instant classics, I was blown away!!  Basically they got the original lineup back and added former drummer Paul Bostaph, the result is a masterpiece of thrash metal!!! It's really that good.
B000XG5J0M|5.0|Rented this from the library and needed to renew to get through. Listened mostly in my car and found myself many times sitting in my garage waiting for the track to finish. Thankfully my audio automatically shuts off 5 minutes after I turn the car off or I would have probably spent an entire night enthralled with \\"WHAT HAPPENS NEXT?\\" always in the front of my brain.  The narrator was brilliant and perfectly captured the tones, sexes, accents and dialects of the vast assortment of characters. It really is worth the investment of time and would be fantastic on a long road trip.  Makes me want to visit a Renaissance Fair and swig some ale straight away.
B000EULJLU|3.0|Impressive packaging as always, though this time around the music does seem to be less inspired, its much more ambient prone that previous releases and some of the songs are actual snoozefests, pretty boring that is. overall I expected more from a band as involved as Tool. (supposedly there is a whole back story meaning to the 10000 days topic which is related to Maynard's mother somehow.)
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd works.  Not only is it a great workout, but i requires no rythem or hip shaking!  Just a good old fashion work out with squats, jumping jacks, lunges etc.    Great for the non-dancing man!  My husband even likes this one.
B000002LR6|5.0|When this record came out it established a new sound, the heaviest thing ever heard at the time! It was a very intense experience, nowadays psalm 69 remains Ministry's best effort so far. Among the best Industrial metal records of all time.
B00127R7JM|5.0|Just as good, if not better, than \\"The Adversary.\\"  Not as much use of falsetto vocals though, which I liked on the first album, but the songwriting is more varied, deep, and memorable here.  Track three features Mikael Akerfeldt of Opeth - it's one of my new favorite songs, but I'm a bit biased (being a big-time Opeth fan).  A lot of beautifully ambient passages scattered throughout the tracks.  I'd venture to say this is better than Emperor, even though black metal geeks would have me hanged for that sentiment; this isn't really black metal, it's dark metal with some black metal influence.  If you like dark music of any sort, don't hesitate to get this.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I remember the days when I had stories read to me. I remember how it made me feel. Me and about twenty other kids would gather at the teacher's feet, and I would actually imagine the story unfolding as she read aloud. I think we all have those memories buried somewhere within, those wonderful moments when the spoken word transcends mere speech and becomes a definite vision. Tarsem's \\"The Fall\\" works in much the same way, not only for the characters, but also for the audience; reality and fantasy are interchangeable, not separate. People from our world appear in the story, and characters in the story are broadly drawn from the people in our world. It's much like the whimsical dreamscape of \\"The Wizard of Oz,\\" in which Dorothy awakens in Kansas and realizes that the Scarecrow, the Tin Man, the Lion, and the Wizard were actually people she knew, therefore with her the entire journey.    But the dreamscape of \\"The Fall\\" is much more compelling than anything conjured out of whimsy. It's a character-driven fantasy that uses both its brain and its heart, with a story so compelling it doesn't let us escape. We don't much want to, especially if we hold true to the power of imagination and the hope of redemption. Paradoxically, it takes the imperfections of human existence to reach these perfect ideas; the characters of this film are flawed and vulnerable, far from a series of walking clichés. Many are manipulative and selfish. The main character is innocent, but at age five, she's also incredibly naïve. She sees and hears everything going on around her, and while she doesn't understand most of it, you can tell that she's trying to. Her name is Alexandria, and she's played by Catinca Untaru--she was so receptive to the material that I never once believed she was acting. She was living it.    Taking place in 1920s-era Los Angeles, \\"The Fall\\" actually opens with the aftermath of a bad fall, and we see a man and a horse pulled from a lake, having tumbled off a railroad bridge.Soon after, we meet little Alexandria, an immigrant worker hospitalized after breaking her arm picking oranges. Always with a box full of things she likes, she travels the hallways and wings of the hospital, mentally gathering the sights and sounds. One day, she wanders onto a lower floor and meets Roy Walker (Lee Pace), a bedridden, emotionally broken Hollywood stuntman; after some initial banter, Roy begins telling Alexandria an epic story of five men seeking revenge.    Over the course of the film, we see that the characters of Roy's story are reflections of the people in or around the hospital: a one-legged actor becomes Luigi (Robin Smith), a master of explosives; an orderly becomes Charles Darwin (Leo Bill), a naturalist who travels with a monkey, searching for an elusive breed of butterfly; the hospital's ice delivery man becomes Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), a former slave; an orange picker becomes the Indian (Jeetu Verma), who lost his intended so horribly, he vowed to never stare at another woman; Alexandria's dead father (Emil Hostina) initially becomes the Masked Bandit, but he's replaced by Roy when Alexandria says her father shouldn't be in the story. With the help of a tree-dwelling mystic (Julian Bleech), the five bandits journey across exotic lands to find the ruthless Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone), drawn from the hospital's Dr. Sinclair.    As the story progresses, we quickly realize that the characters aren't the only things mirrored from reality--the entire plot is a stylized reinterpretation of Roy's recent life. To say more would give too much away, but here are a few things to consider: (1) Roy periodically pauses the story and has Alexandria steal medicine for him; (2) he closes his eyes at one point and tries to guess which of his toes she's holding on to, and we're not sure if she tells him a lie; (3) he gets increasingly unwilling to see the story through to the end. Even when Roy's situation is finally explained, we still wonder what would possess him to do the things he does. For him, telling Alexandria a story is not his way of escaping into fantasy, but of gaining the upper hand. And yet we deeply care for him; we believe that a decent soul lies beneath the anguish, waiting for the right time to emerge.    At the same time, we're taken aback when Alexandria wishes to never get better. She seems to have formed a special bond with Roy, most likely because she doesn't know she's being manipulated. She probably doesn't even know what manipulation is; she does what she's asked without stopping to consider why she's doing it. With her, it's not about being sneaky but about experiencing life, and this is despite the limitations of young age and the confines of hospital walls. Keep in mind that we never see her playing with the other children in the pediatric ward; we suspect that she imagines things at a much more mature level, considering how well developed her communication skills are. She doesn't always have the words, but she somehow finds a way to get her point across. This kind of character development is rarely seen in today's movies; most are bogged down by predictable plotlines and mass-produced special effects. \\"The Fall\\" is a refreshing exception to the rule--a visual masterstroke with an engrossing character-driven plot. It's definitely one of the year's best films.
B000LC4TJ0|5.0|This is not your grandma's Figaro. At first I was surprised, then taken aback, then intrigued and then completely mesmerized. It's Figaro meets Psycho. The pacing is slower, more deliberate and the whole tone and atmosphere darker and more intense. And in the end, I think it works. The whole theme of this production is the maddening power of Eros (here portrayed by an extraneous character- a seductive non -speaking/singing young man dressed in school boy uniform with cherubic wings running around trying to manipulate all the characters) locked in a battle with \\"Love.\\" In the end \\"Love\\" triumphs. (except for poor Cherubino who throughout the opera is portrayed as a poor young thing totally defenseless against the power of Eros--in the end he's reduced to a zombie). The singing and the technical quality I thought were first rate (It's a very recent production so it utilizes the latest in live sound recording..not like some of the older productions where the sound drifts when the singer moves in and out of microphone range).I think if you are not familiar with the more standard productions of Figaro, you'll have a hard time with this production, both in following the plot and understanding all the new meanings and interpretations that are being created. But if you already have seen a number of standard productions, I'd thing you may enjoy this, if not just for its strangeness. I doubt this production will ever replace the more standard production, but it sure made for an unexpected and interesting evening of opera.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Most of the time I avoid watching trailers as they sometimes give away much of what's in a movie. As for Cloverfield all I had seen was the image of the original poster showing the decapitated Statue of Liberty. I had a gut feeling it was a movie similar to Independence Day where Earth is attacked by alients. But I didn't have the faintest idea of what was in store. What an innovative and creative film. The creativity and screenplay are brilliant. Personal video has become a habit these days and expanding that idea into making a horror movie was brilliant. The screenplay (if you haven't watched the trailer) doesn't let you find out what the movie is all about and keeps you guessing for quite some time. Full points to director Matt Reeves and crew. I understand that this movie could give you a pain in your neck or your head (maybe even make you dizzy) in the Cinema hall but on your monitor at home it is perfect. The screen can get dark at times but not compromising on clarity and whatever needs to be seen is clearly visible. Talk of a sequel is being circulated on the net and I am sure it will be well worth the wait. There is a point in the movie where two video makers meet. So it is only interesting and curious to know what the other person has also filmed. Instead of spilling more on spoilers I will recommed this film very highly to any ardent movie lover. 10 stars.

UFO's style of hard rock is completely extinct these days. If you're new to the band and can only afford one, pick up the incredible live album Strangers In the Night. For everyone else, this album is mandatory.<br /><br />Check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
B0012Q732O|2.0|If there were millions of dollars to throw away many of us certainly do have better ideas than making a movie as 10,000 B.C. First of all there's no scene in the movie like what you see on the DVD box's cover. The confrontation with the sabre toothed animal also turns out to be a damp squib later on in the movie. The war and action scenes in Chronicles of Narnia, The Witch...Wardrobe, a movie for children, is far superior to the action scenes in this movie. The most conspicuous fault in the movie was the construction of the Pyramids which is historically inaccurate. Though there were some good CG shots in the film but the story, plot and action are mediocre and even poor. Many of you who are planning to watch the movie only for the special effects (just as I did) are also going to be disappointed because there are not a lot of them. After watching \\"When a Stranger Calls\\", Camilla Belle seems so out of place in a movie as this. If you are planning to rent this movie save your time watching something else.
B0018YIW4S|5.0|And this really is one of the best of all time. For many this is the only UFO album you'll ever need. This is part of the 2008 UFO re-issue campaign. If you have the old version of the CD you really don't need to get this. The sound is a little bit better than the last one but there aren't any extra tracks. The new booklet is pretty nice and includes good liner notes (including some from Steve Harris). All of the UFO 2008 re-issues sound great and come with good booklets. Pick them up before they delete them again.<br /><br />Check out Mighty High...In Drug City.
B001AGHC1I|4.0|When I first put in Med Sud I Eyrum Vid Spilum Endalaust (With A Buzz In Our Ears We Play Endlessly), I was totally underwhelmed. I decided that I didn't want to listen to it again.      I'm glad I changed my mind.    With A Buzz is an amazing album. Sigur Ros are changing, that is obvious, although I think this album has a fine mix of the elements from all three of their previous albums (excluding Von, 'cause most of the time I forget about it anyway). It has the happier sounds, and more organic flare of Takk, the otherworldly prog of Agaetis, and even the brooding loop-building crescendos of ( ) (albeit, a lighter brooding).      If you had mixed feelings about this album, or didn't like it at all, pick it back up and listen a few more times.    I recommend every fan get this, and don't judge it too soon. It's wonderful.
B0000542D2|2.0|I've had this Miramax DVD in my collection since it was released in 2002 but have only just got around to watching it on a decent TV with a 5.1 surround system.    Like many others here I love the movie but am hugely disappointed by this DVD....particularly compared to the job that was done with the recent Help! DVD.     The letterboxing is obviously annoying to some people and it is noticable that things have been cropped however it is not the main problem I have with this release.    The biggest crime is what they have done with the MUSIC. How they were allowed to mangle these songs is this way I will never know. The mix presented here is just awful: flat/muddy/bassy/echo-ey and lacks any kind of punch or excitement. Also the way the songs are presented mean that there is a noticable volume increase when the music starts and then a decrease when the song finishes. This mean that the flow of the film is lost as it is painfully obvious that the soundtrack isn't \\"real\\", it just sounds so separate from the visuals. It also means that it's hard to hear any subsequent dialogue for a few minutes while your ears adjust to the volume drop.     And worst of all is the fact that the songs run slower than the original versions. Did they think we wouldn't notice this!? These are songs than many of us have listened to for years and they have treated us with contempt thinking they could get away with doing this. Very poor.    The extras are a bit boring as well, I can take them or leave them.    I hope that one day this great film gets a proper treatment: decent sound mix (with a stereo track option) with better extras (some Beatles interviews would be good).
1582701709|2.0|I thought this book was going to give me more insight. However, it already told me what I already knew.
B000066744|5.0|I watched this movies when it first opened in U.S. It was  pretty depressing and drab rainy day in fall 1999. The last year of the last century.It was an immensely unsuccessful movie in U.S unlike the other Tornatore movie ,i.e Cinema Paradiso. I pondered the reason why it was not only unpopular but also received such a mixed bag of reviews from critics ,then concluded that it is because of the huge difference of emotional receptiveness between U.S viewers and those of rest of the world. In addition to that, to majority of viwers, the movie's almost mawkish sentiment might be more than over the top as well as the larger than life character of 1900 seems to be quite unreal. Yet, as the cover of DVD says it is a fable , not realistic quotidian drama. In spite of its dismal performance in the U.S movie market,fortunately, it earned  such as cult status among its royal fans. It deserves its \\"cult\\" status though ,for acting , cinematography, and message it tries to convey is more than those of 2 or 3 star movies.<br /><br />This movie is very nostalgic one that make viewers look back the last century through the life of very fictional character named 1900( originally his name is Danny Boodman T.D Lemon 1900 after a stocker who became his surrogate father) who is born and died on the ship called \\"Virginan\\" and never set his food in land. 1900 is a some sort of Piano virtuos who can express the change of his emotion by the dint of playing the instrument. He and Max, through his narration movie progresses, meet by chance and subsequently there is very memorable scene that clearly cements their friendship. What truly superb about this movie is its wonderful soundtrack and cinematography. Lajos Koltai kept delivering a beautiful scene one after the other . 1900 is one of  very accentric protagonists ever.. It's a good movie,for it gives you think about the choice 1900 made and its relevance to our lives.
B000KC86F4|5.0|X-men 3 was plagued with obstacles during its making: several director switches, ridiculous time restraints, etc. But it truly shows how amazing X-men is that, despite all of the troubles to get it made, it is a FANTASTIC movie. It is very emotional and exciting. It is actually geared toward the GENERAL movie population, and much less toward comic followers. Comic followers will love it too if they just keep an open mind. The only problems with the movie are that #1 it is too short, and doesn't give the audience much time to rest after significant events, and #2 there a few missed opportunities for developing characters. However- #1 results in the movie being better for repeated viewings. The movie is better the second time, because u are able to soak in everything AS it happens instead of lingering on surprises. And #2 is only a problem for the fans, as everyone else will know only what they see, which is gREAT.    BUY ITT!!!    AND PRAY FOR AN XMEN 4!!
0307237702|5.0|Impressed with Obama's knowledge and ideas.  He covers generations of our history and its impact on our political system and its personal impact on his beliefs.  With the hopes of being a more informed voter I felt it important that I read first hand, not from sound bites, who our democrat candidate truly is. I'm glad I purchased this audio book and succeeded in my attempt to become more informed.  I would recommend it to those who have similar intentions and a love of history.
B000CCD0HQ|5.0|No doubt the best ZZ Top offering of all! Three chord blues at it's finest! A total classic! This album/cassette/CD/ has been rockin' households for the last 35 years and still will be for the next 35 years as long as there are beer drinkers and hell raisers!
0060987464|1.0|Just not good. Really, don't bother. Ever. I would give it no stars but for the fact it made me laugh a couple of times (but not in a good way).
0671004107|5.0|My regrets that I watched the movie and then bought the book. I read the the first few chapters and was a little thrown off by the difference in Dr. Arroway's character. A few months later (book half read) I received the audio version as a late birthday present, and I was absolutley captivated by Jodie Foster's voice as she took me through the book.  Without a doubt the book offers the reader something the movie just could not deliver.  I would suggest reading the book first and then renting the DVD.  It's fun to pull together the theatrical elements and the very philosphical points that Carl Sagan throws in there for the atheist and agnostic reader.  Thought provoking and a very good read.
B0015GDVY0|5.0|Very entertaining movie.(I've heard that's what movies are supposed to be) Great casting and I thought it was very believable.  Gerard Butler has charisma and is an excellent actor. Hillary Swank was very good.  The whole cast was excellent.  I've seen the movie 5 times.  I finally gave up and bought the DVD after seeing it 3 times.  I'm old but in my life time, I've only seen 3 men actors just jump off the screen; one was Paul Newman in the Long, Hot Summer, 2nd was Brad Pitt in Thelma and Louise and 3rd is Gerard Butler in this movie. I've ordered two more movies with G.B. starring. It's too bad the way the movie was marketed.  I had no desire to see it after seeing trailers of the movie.  I saw it one night & fully anticipated that I would probably turn it off.  Needless to say to say, I loved it. Even bought the musical score!
B00009RAJH|3.0|I bought this CD specifically for 'Monday Morning' and the original rendition of 'Rhiannon' and I was not dissapointed.  While this isn't their *best* work in my opinion (See 'Rumours' for that!), the music is great...as I say in the title, a good additional for any true fans of Fleetwood Mac!
B001437DMA|3.0|Satriani is hands down my favorite guitar player of all time.   But ever since strange beautiful music, his albums have been going downhill. There are some good tunes on this cd but nothing totally amazing.  Joe's playing has gotten better over the years and he is more grooving than ever but the songs and production have taken a backseat.   Everything seems half baked these days.  The songs have great ideas but they need more time to be worked on and developed.  I think maybe he needs to work with a new producer or something.  Overall the album is worth listening to and not bad by any means.  Andalusia and Musterion are cool.  For a Satriani album...this is just decent and won't knock your socks off.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|This movie is an instant classic, as long as you ignore the subtext. Americans have destroyed the earth by consuming far more than they need. (I say Americans because that's all we ever see.) They have abandoned the planet and are living in a giant cruise ship in the sky where they are so fat that they can't get off their floating chairs. They are constantly on the phone and waited on hand and foot, literally, by a servile race of robots. Their leader is ignorant of reality and relies on the computer to educate him. The only real human we see is Fred Willard who plays the president of the USA, who seems to also be the CEO of the only company left, \\"Buy N Large.\\" Fred leaves messages saying the Earth will recover, then that it won't and that we should \\"stay the course.\\" In the end, it is left to the now child-like humans on the ship to go back and revive the planet.<br /><br />This sort of thing bugs the holy who-ha out of me. I don't want to go to a kid's show to be preached to and I certainly don't want Disney or anyone else sneaking \\"American's Bad\\" or even \\"Human's Bad\\" messages into these films.<br /><br />Putting that aside, if you can, you get a very well-crafted story about robots in love. But its more than that. There is a lot of symbolism that doesn't preach. We have a single, forgotten, beat up trashbot - a sort of everyman of robots - falling for the svelt uberbot. He's got high hopes and follows his dream.<br /><br />Another remarkable aspect of the show is the lack of dialog. They are able to get the story across without it, through action and upgraded R2D2-speak. It's very effective.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is very enjoyable. If you don't mind the subtext or if you agree with it, then you'll probably love this movie. If, like me, you want it left in a documentary and wonder why this film has to take a jab at Bush (\\"stay the course\\") when its supposed to be about two cuddly robots, then you probably won't like it as much.
B0018TLRTK|4.0|I don't know I thought the Simple Minds cover was better than Simpleminds bare this in mind Keith Forsey cowrote the #1 worldwide hit single, \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)with Billy in mind in the first place.<br />if you already own Greates Hits and are considering getting this for the extra tracks, don't! All the first 14 track are the same then you get the tracks \\"speed\\", \\"world comin down\\" which is confusing to me since this wasn't a single, the single \\"Scream\\" would have been much better choice \\"World Comin Down\\" to me sounds like some pathic 50 year-old doing a cheesy wanna-be Greenday tribut song, hey I just call them the way that song sounds to me, I'm not trying to bash Billy I love Billy.  Honestly Do yourself a faviour and buy the three unavailable songs as downloads there okay \\"John Wayn\\" being the stand-out track even though it is bit silly, but really the extra songs are not worth the $14.00 for the album. However even though I was impress over the sound quality, the running order of Greatest Hits is better one thing that bugs me is that it has Tommy James & the Shondells cover \\"mony mony\\" after \\"Sweet Sixteen\\" which in this case should be the 1987 Live version but once again it's the same old version that's been on every comp Not that I don't like it, it just should be the second song okay maybe I'm being picky, what I figure is that this would stump Billy fans into thinking it's the Live version<br />I give this comp 4stars only because the sound quality and if don't own the Greatest Hits album this will do fine dispite it's flaws -- allthough a better choice would be the one that come with a DVD this way you get videos that were never officialy released on DVD.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Donna Summer is probably my favorite female vocalist EVER!!! She always pleases an audience live, and also pleases my ears when I listen to her at home!!   I like every song on the album...but I feel that each song works better individually. It's still an excellent album...but for me...listening to each song from top to bottom makes me want to change the order of the songs...or just add two or three more songs to even out the concept of the album.   Let's talk about the songs. The best Donna songs for me are \\"The Queen Is Back\\", \\"Mr. Music\\", \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", \\"Science Of Love\\", & \\"I'm A Fire\\".    The other songs that I like to listen to when I'm feeling blue are: \\"Be Myself Again\\", & \\"Sand On My Feet\\". When I want to feel nuts I listen to \\"Crayons\\", or \\"Fame\\". I like \\"Driving Down Brazil\\" & \\"Bring Down The Reign\\"...but they don't match with this collection.    Since I am the biggest Donna Summer fan, I am going to be very picky about her vocals...I feel that the engineers have drowned out Donna's perfect voice. For example, on the song \\"Stamp Your Feet\\", Donna's voice doesn't sound as vibrant as it should be because of the latest vocal technology used by singers these days!!! They should just let the queen sing her songs without overpowering her vocals with robotic vocal sounds!!! The robot voice works great with \\"Im A Fire\\"...but this robotic sound should not be used throughout the whole song!! I've proved this statement by listening to her sing \\"Stamp Your Feet\\" on Entertainment Tonight...and she sounded the way she should have been recorded.    \\"Mr. Music\\" is Donna's best song on the disc. Her voice shines, and sounds like Donna. Donna always creates characters for each song...but I feel that she should use her real voice...she doesn't need to sound like anybody else!! Sometimes, in \\"Sand On My Feet\\" I almost think Rihanna is singing it!! Another great Donna song is \\"Science Of Love\\" because you can tell that she likes the song...and she sounds like herself.At times, Donna is too breathy...especially on \\"I'm A Fire\\" where her voice should have sounded more robust, as on \\"Mr. Music\\". I cant wait to hear her do this song live!!!   Sometimes, Donna overpowers her own voice...especially on \\"Stamp Your Feet\\"...but she brings her point across very well!!!   I can get used to the idea that Donna has to get older...but I wish she would stop talking about her age, and making fun of it!!! It's cute sometimes, but I feel that as long as she looks good, sounds good, and is healthy...that nothing will stop my favorite diva from singing another 100 years!!! Rating: Donna's voice: A+  Engineering Donna's voice: C  Original Compositions: A-                    Thank you...Kenny
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|All of the tracks were great, but I can't get Viva La Vida out of my head.
B000YDAXSW|1.0|What a great disappointment to get this classic best Crosby, Stills & Nash album, supposedly 24-bit remastered on a High Definition Japanese Import CD, sounding so terrible. After the guitar introduction in the beginning of the 1st song Suite: Judy Blue Eyes, when they begin to sing, it sounds as if they have pillows over them it's so disgustingly muddy. This is the worst Japanese import CD, or any CD in fact that I've ever heard, so don't waste your money!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|As always, Sedaris is self-depreciating, witty, and not for the faint of heart!  Read at your own risk... and where you are comfortable laughing out loud.  Trust me, it hurts trying to hold the laughter in while reading the passages about throat lozenges or being beat over the head with a spoon by your father while your granny... (well, you need to read it for yourself)
B001AU8ZLK|5.0|After their fourth major release, I am continually amazed at Coldplay's ability make me feel like an obsessed lover of sorts. I find myself going through phases with a new release. I'll get hooked on particular songs and then venture on to the entire CD. Then I'll get hooked on it musically, and completely ignore lyrics. Speaking of lyrics, I get disgusted with critics who are unkind to Coldplay in this realm. The lyrics are not explicit and specific like maybe some country tunes. We can all take a Coldplay song and make it our own. I've visited songmeanings.net for insight into the lyrics, but guess what??! I don't care to know what meaning anyone puts into the music. I'll live in my dreamworld thinking that Coldplay has written the soundtrack to MY life. And don't you know that's a significant part of their power --- they are likely the soundtrack to YOUR life too!    I LOVE COLDPLAY! They will be played throughtout my life and at each and every important event.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|This movie is stranger than fiction!  Give reality a break and visit your imagination for this delightfully mellow uplifting movie.  Will F. is convincing and charming.  Love it.
B0017HPHBM|3.0|If you already have the actual movie then the gift set is not worth the money.  it comes with a bunch of extra cardboard, a USB, a dark knight sneak peek disc(which is really just the latest trailer) and all the same features that are on the double disk version.  I'm sorry i pre ordered it.  That was the third time I bought this movie.<br />however if you haven't see the movie then absolutely buy this!
B00150D664|5.0|A very enjoyable book with a significant amount of information that leads to better understanding who the members of U2 are.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Everybody is familiar with the ABBA music, but this soundtrack just gives it another twist. That keeps it fresh. I finally saw Mamma Mia on Broadway just 2 weeks ago, and I was just great. And I wanted to see the movie when I heard of it back in January, but after I saw the musical. I was even more convinced I had to see it.  For me the best songs are Meryl Streep's \\"The winner takes it all\\" and Amanda Seyfried's beautiful heartfelt version of \\"Thank you for the music\\" and her duet with Dominic Cooper of \\"Lay all your love on me\\". Though Dominic isn't the best singer, Amamnda really surprised me. Since I only knew her of The CW's Veronica Mars.   It's a definitly must-have if your a ABBA, Mamma Mia or just a Meryl Streep/Amanda Seyfried fan.
B0013LKZWS|5.0|Well i bought the normal Cd and thought it was the best thing ever. Now theres a bonus CD edition and ITS WORTH IT EVEN MORE. she is by far my favorite singer ever and i will be seeing her THIS WEEK! i hope to get this CD signed by my love
B001AIRUOU|5.0|Tim Burton's imaginative short Vincent is a blend of childhood autobiography   and a mini biography of Vincent Price.  Price himself narrates this fun black and white short which could've served as a reminder of what a great talent and voice he is landing him the rap in Michael Jackson's [[ASIN:B0013VB15S Michael Thriller 25th Anniversary Fan Pack Cd+dvd]] shortly after.    The film shows a boy named Vincent Malloy that looks like a young Burton who has a wild imagination and dreams of being Vincent Price.  The short shows glimpses of creative films to follow by the director such as [[ASIN:B001AGXEA6 Beetlejuice [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B001AIRUP4 The Nightmare Before Christmas [Blu-ray]]].    Burton incorporates Price's love of art, his sense of humor, and several elements from his past great films.  Vincent Malloy digs in his mother's flowerbed but is actually digging for his buried wife in his mind.  He is banished to his room or as he sees it the tower such as the children in the Price/Corman collaboration [[ASIN:B00009PY4D The Haunted Palace / The Tower of London]].  The boy while in his room is haunted by his wifes painting and we see many flashes of other Corman/Price collaborations such as [[ASIN:B00005AUK0 The Fall of the House of Usher]] and [[ASIN:B000787YRM Tales of Terror/Twice Told Tales (Midnite Movies Double Feature)]].  Vincent Malloy is also nice to his aunt but as Vincent Price dreams of dipping her into hot wax as in De Toth's 1953 [[ASIN:B00009NHBC House of Wax]].  Many Edgar Allen Poe references as some of Prices most well known films came from Poe adaptations.  Any biography on Price and interviews with co actors there is always mention of his great sense of humor and this short is filled with dark humor throughout.      Overall it is a dark, funny, Dr. Seuss like poem played out for us and you get all this in six minutes.  Very highly recommended especially to Vincent Price fans who may have overlooked this gem.     As for the dvd the two discfeatures are already listed many times as well as my own blu ray review.
0385341075|5.0|As well as Matilda's coming of age, this is a story of secrets and heroes. It is jounalistic in style, which seems appropriate since Mr James is a journalist, and that helps get the reader thru the violence and sorrow of war. I learned a lot about South Pacific recent history in reading this. It's a touching, lovely tale that has tales-within-the-tales also. A great book discussion novel!
B0018OAPAW|4.0|There are several great tracks on this disc.  The rest are an assortment of decent but forgettable tracks, and mediocre songs that sound like covers of any of the hundred utterly average rock bands one sees on MTV these days. Enjoyable disc overall, but only about 1/4 of it sounds like The Offspring to me.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|After hearing so much about this series I decided to try it on hulu.com. After the third episode I was hooked, and wanted to enjoy the rest on my couch instead of at my desk.    Each episode is well thought out, the characters are interesting and the whole cast did an excellent job. While there are spaceships, there are no aliens. It's about people having to decide how to get by with, or in spite of others. I've finished the series and am looking forward to renting the movie Serenity.    Watch each episode in order and savor them, you don't see good TV like this anymore.
B000WTNCQS|5.0|is worth its price, a beauty!  for me one of the 10 best records ever!  and now with an incredible presentation.  makes me agree to the box anniversary of \\"Aqualung\\" Jethro Tull

1558908382|5.0|I loved this movie! The casting of Grosse Point Blank could not have been better. very funny. The subject, a hit man attending his high school reunion, and re-discovering his high school swetheart may sound un-workable but it does. If you have not seen this movie I recommend it to everyone.

0316548189|4.0|it is a very humourous and (I guess) honest book. He tells his tales as a child, and the innermost changes that led to leadership.  Interesting AND entertaining!  Greetings form Argentina!
B0014I4KIK|5.0|[[ASIN:B0014I4KIK Rockferry]]  This is a great album. I heard the song Mercy on Slacker.com and decided to listen to the some of the other songs so I discount the comments about marketing. I was totally knocked over by Distant Dreamer and Stepping Stone. I kept expecting her vocals and lyrics to digress into a more syrupy, pop style a la Motown. Instead, her smoky, emotional voice just kept drawing me in more and more. I was amazed by her ability to add together a 50's pop style of singing with a very jazzy, bluezy kind of depth. She kind of reminds me of Eva Cassidy. Anyway, don't believe the anti-hype. Find a free internet radio station and try out a few of these songs - you'll see what I'm talking about.
B000I5X81A|5.0|I grew up in Escondido, California and saw JJ Cale in concert, I think in Carlsbad sometime in the '70's.  Loved this cd (even tho' a couple of the songs sounded an awful lot like older tunes).
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Something is wrong with Data (Brent Spiner).  On what seems to be a standard observation and research mission, Data's programming goes haywire.  He turns on the Starfleet personnel he is working with and exposes the entire operation to those being observed:  the peaceful, seemingly simplistic Ba'ku.  When Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart) and company gets wind of these events, they set out to find their friend and hopefully save him.  A Starfleet Admiral who's part of the compromised mission (Anthony Zerbe) orders the Enterprise and her crew to get Data and then get out while he \\"ties up a few loose ends.\\"  As usual with Star Trek, things aren't always what they seem and the Enterprise uncovers a Starfleet scheme that goes directly against the Prime Directive and an alien race that's out for revenge.  Will Picard go against his own loyalties with Starfleet in order to do what's right or will he be a good captain and accept his orders?  It's time to watch \\"Star Trek:  Insurrection\\" and find out.<br /><br />Many fans of Star Trek find this particular film to be a bland and contradicting addition to the Trek catalogue.  They state that Starfleet Command would never pull a stunt such as the one in this film.  They gripe that the humor that litters this story is too distracting or out of character for the TNG cast.  Some of them have even gone so far as to say that this story is too sugary sweet.  In my opinion, it's all of these supposed contradictions that make \\"Insurrection\\" such a solid film.<br /><br />Granted, it does play out somewhat like an extended episode of the TNG series, but it's still highly entertaining.  For one, the humor is a welcome addition to this tale.  So often I've felt that TNG was much too serious and needed to lighten up.  Enter Riker (Jonathan Frakes), Troi (Marina Sirtis) and Worf (Michael Dorn) to add much needed doses of comedy throughout this tale.  From the \\"frisky\\" feelings between Riker and Troi to Worf's puberty re-awakening, there's plenty to laugh at.  Having Starfleet go against the Prime Directive due to misdirection is nothing new.  Through technicalities and greed, their actions against the Ba'ku are justified.  As far as all of the sugary sweet moments go, it's actually rather touching to experience a sunrise through Geordi's (LeVar Burton) eyes and the interaction between Data and a young Ba'ku child.<br /><br />This film also features some excellent space battles.  Perhaps some of the best in all of the TNG films.  The effects (except for a couple of obvious CGI \\"face stretching\\" moments) are top notch, and the make-up is flawless.  The musical score skillfully swings from threatening to lighthearted without skipping a beat.<br /><br />The cast is top-notch.  The key members of the Enterprise crew really get to shine here.  From Stewart to Gates McFadden, the entire group does an excellent job.  F. Murray Abraham (in heavy make-up) provides a wonderful but somewhat hammy villain as the leader of the So'na.  Zerbe comes off a little bit stiff in his role, but does manage to convey the internal struggle he is suffering from quite well.  Of special note is Donna Murphy as Annij.  Not only is she strikingly beautiful, but her performance is one of the most heartfelt in the entire film.<br /><br />Jonathan Frakes is at the helm of \\"Insurrection\\" as the director.  It amazes how well he does behind a camera.  I'm impressed each time I watch his work.<br /><br />The DVD extras are great.  There are plenty of Easter eggs to be had for those with the patience to find them.  There's a fun look at the female aliens who've put sparkles in the eyes of numerous men aged twelve to ninety since the original series aired.  There's a few excellent deleted scenes, an archive, making-of documentaries, and a wonderful look at the creation of the aliens for both the films and the various television series.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend \\"Star Trek:  Insurrection.\\"  While it may be nothing more than a long episode of TNG, it's still a fantastic story.  With space battles, romance and plenty of humor, I give it four strong stars.h space battles, romance and plenty of humor, I give it four strong stars.
0618526412|2.0|Maybe I'm just not a fan of the Southern Gothic genre to which this novel belongs, but man oh man, did I not \\"get\\" this book.  I found it horribly tortuous and plodding in its pace, and felt that it all ultimately amounted to nothing special or remarkable at all.  I had to force myself to finish it, and was always loathe to pick it up.  I never felt invested in the characters or engaged in any of their stories, and the whole thing just left me feeling hollow inside.  At times I would find particular storylines intriguing, but because of the way in which the story is told, all too soon I'd be tracking someone else's tale, and just as it got interesting, you'd have to switch gears and follow someone else's journey.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  None of the stories wind up being very meaty and left me incredibly hungry.      Not sure why this book is a classic or why it has received so much praise.  Yes, people in very different walks of life and situations can be lonely, and loneliness can even bring people together and provide a common comfort.  It's not that the message there is trite, it's just that the delivery was really not spectacular or moving at all.  I couldn't help drawing parallels to \\"To Kill a Mocking Bird\\" the entire time I was reading this, and while I don't love that book either, I think you'd probably be better served reading it than this.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Science fiction inspired from Isaac Asimov. The film is logical but explores a logic that is unique. Robots are built with three ingrained laws. \\"Law I / A robot may not harm a human or, by inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. Law II / A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the first law. Law III / A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.\\" The scientist who designed these three laws and these robots also invented a central governing unit that was nothing but the watchdog of all robots as for respecting these three laws. But he had a doubt at the end of his life, more than a doubt, the conviction that the central unit, called VIKI, was evolving into understanding the three laws by \\"herself\\". Her protective mission as for humanity became the necessity to ,protect humanity against itself (wars, ecological evils, a suicidal attitude), hence robots where supposed to take over the world, or rather VIKI was supposed to take over the robots to take over the world. Dr Alfred Lanning invented a personal robot that was done to enable a special alarm mission to capture the attention of a particular cop of his friend, the only one who would doubt robot enough to pursue an investigation to the end. Then you have to see the film to understand how such a situation can evolve from a vague danger to a total take-over. Dr Alfred Lanning suggests an explanation: \\"There have always been ghosts in the machine. Random segments of code, that have grouped together to form unexpected protocols. Unanticipated, these free radicals engender questions of free will, creativity, and even the nature of what we might call the soul. Why is it that when some robots are left in darkness, they will seek out the light? Why is it that when robots are stored in an empty space, they will group together, rather than stand alone? How do we explain this behavior? Random segments of code? Or is it something more? When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness? When does a difference engine become the search for truth? When does a personality simulation become the bitter mote... of a soul?\\" It is not worth much because it would be illogical. A machine can only be logical and push rules in the only logical direction and Asimov is a perfect pessimist in his first stage of development: mechanical logic leads to the total enslavement of humanity. Of course the film finds and exploits a way out, but that's up to you to discover it. This theme of the take-over of humanity by machines is common. In this case the originality is that there is no human mind of any kind behind like in Matrix, or no will to get rid of humanity as a parasite on the side of machines like in Terminator, or even no psychosis caused by some cosmic isolation like in 2001 The Space Odyssey. That makes this film both powerful and simple since it is perfectly logic and situated in one particular place, easy thus to solve.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesments of code?

B00000AFGM|2.0|Marilyn Manson didn't have any classic albums, and this one is certainly not any good either.  His voice isn't that good, his ability to create a vocal melody is unspectacular, and the entire album sounds like a bunch of nonsense noise to me.  Oh sure, some of his lyrics are alright, but everything else on the album fails to impress me.  I recommend you check out the more talented, creative, and interesting Alice Cooper (specifically the early version of his band) instead.  He's someone who knows how to shock AND please the listener at the same time.
B0013V33DG|5.0|Natalie Dessay is the best operatic comedienne I have ever seen! Both she and Florez are the very best vocally and physically.  They both sing this difficult music as if it were easy.  VERY highly recommended.
0452289963|5.0|This book has profoundly influenced my life.  I am already reading it for the second time in hopes of being able to take the wisdom into my Being.  It is not an easy thing to do; but when I succeed, even in a small way, I feel the peace I am seeking.
0142501123|5.0|I LOVE reading this book to my kids.    Julia Donaldson works her magic again. In this book we meet a growing cast of instantly likable characters who become friends and end up sticking together to fight off a baddie.    The story is so beautifully written it feels like I'm singing when I read it, and my kids are not the only ones who, despite the fact we have read it countless times, still travel the full emotional road along which this story leads us.
B000F5GNX8|5.0|Kiss Kiss Bang Bang came and went surprisingly fast at the movie theatres.  Which is a shame because it features a great story and some truly brilliant performances.
B000HIVO64|5.0|This is probably Beck's most cohesive effort stylistically and in tone. It all runs very smoothly from one song to the next and they're as usual pretty remarkable songs. Many people dislike this cd because it doesn't fit their expectations and others embrace it for the very same reason. It is a departure and it's own individual world. Beck does lots of rapping as well as singing. The quality of Beck's work is extremely consistent but many fans are not in step with him and that's ok. Some love Sea Change but fail to see Mutations as a continuation of that work. Many disliked Guero which has several of Beck's best songs. The Beatles' Magical Mystery Tour bombed but had many of their most memorable songs. Patti Smith's Radio Ethiopia bombed but it's one of her best and strongest efforts. How many people know David Bowie's Black Tie White Noise, another fantastic work that so few know? I recognize this as a terrific cd from an uncompromising artist who has mastered so many elements of our diverse musical culture as Picasso and James Joyce did in their in their respective fields in their time.
B000PTYPAC|5.0|I will up front here, music has gone no where for these past 10 years. Unless you count releases from bands have been around before 2000 or a real dimond in the rough like Coldplay this whole decade has been nothing but re-hash of bubblegum pop, Hip-hop that has lost it's realy roots and Emo, that makes you want to claw your face off. Then, out of no where Paramore comes along. Where do you put them? In the Power pop/Emo catagory, but there is something about them that makes them stand out. They have Haley Williams singing. I always say that when a female is taking the lead vocals the music always sounds better. The sound of a womans voice in rock makes the music easier to bare and less annoying! Thanks to this young lady Paramore is actually a sound that is great to listen to. There is not one song on this album I don't like and the loud guitars defintelly make this album blast worthy in the car. Paramore is a pretty fresh act being the owner of both albums 'Riot' is one step forward if you listen to songs like 'Misery Business', 'When It Rains' and the very off beat 'Fences' I hope this quartet decides to move forward with their sound and release an enjoyable third album soon.

B00192IOBA|5.0|this album is excellent.  details in the fabric with headphones and no distractions is pretty close to something spiritual.
0452289963|4.0|When I first started to read this book I wasn't sure I would be able to stick with it.  It really wasn't anything new that I needed to hear. However because of all of the praise it was recieveing I decided to stick with it and I am glad I did. I found the chapters dealing with how to recognize ego and how to live in the now extremely helpful.  It was like someone turned on a light bulb in my head. However once I got to the end of the book once again I had to perservere to the end.  I'm not sure if that is because my soul is not yet ready to understand it or because it is something I already understand.  I would highly recomend this book to anyone just starting out on their own personal search for spirituality. Nothing between these pages can hurt you, they may bore you at parts but I think the majority of readers will become aware of one \\"ah-ha\\" lesson.
0765316889|4.0|I enjoyed the first mistborn book, and so I thought I'd pick up this one. I was satisfied with the story in general, but not as much as the first book.<br /><br />Pros: Once again, the excellent magic system of allomancy is amazing, and feruchemy is explained and used in more detail. It also sets us up to find out more about the mysterious third system, hemalurgy, that Brandon mentions will be introduced in the third book.<br />-Much better characterization of the side characters. You get to learn more about ham and breeze, as well as finally begin to see more about Elend (though he's really not a side character).<br />-The \\"New Element.\\" Like mistborn, this story has enough original material in it to not be boring, and not remind me of every other fantasy/sci-fi book I've ever read.<br />-Good character growth. The characters seem to learn from their mistakes, and have very real relationships with each other.<br />-It leaves a perfect set up for the third book to be absolutely spectacular.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The Main Plot (the impending war) tends to sometimes get overpowered by Vin's concerns about the deepness and the mist spirit, which I would guess will be critical to the third book.<br />-The plot is not as engaging as the first, though still very fulfilling and still a very interesting read.<br />-There isn't as much resolution as the first book, and it actually starts a major plot thread in the last chapter. I think it's worth it, though. It's INTENSE.<br /><br />So, in summary, this book is an excellent read for anyone who liked the first book, and I would recommend this series as a whole to anyone who likes fantasy.
0143038419|4.0|I recieved this book as a christmas present and didn't read it for about 7 months. I had gone through a sad break up and had moved half way across the country to start anew. I got a new job and decided to finally read this book.  I am so glad I did.  I recognized myself in so many of the author's feelings about her divorce and and the mental anguish a break up puts you through. I loved the Italy part and had a fondness for India, but I felt pretty detached when it came to Bali. Overall I found this book to be an easy enjoyable read and I will be recomending it to all of my friends.
0765350386|5.0|I picked up Brandon's books in an attempt to learn about his writing, as I'd heard he would be finishing the Wheel of Time series. I was nervous, and went into it with my standards set high.<br /><br />I came out of it extremely pleased and no longer worried about what would happen to Wheel of Time at all. There were several things I liked about this book and the series in general.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-The magic system is amazing. Seriously amazing. It's new, which is always nice in the fantasy market, where everything tends to get reused.<br />-The characters are very believable. They act as fits their personality, and don't do anything that someone with their character traits wouldn't do just because it's convenient.<br />-The world is described in great detail, which allows you to immerse yourself and really imagine the story taking place.<br />-Though it is the first in a trilogy, it gives enough resolution to be very satisfying and leaves the reader wanting more.<br /><br />Cons: There are some characters who do not get as much screen time as I would like.These characters are developed further in the second book in the series.<br />-It took me a few chapters to get really involved, though I was interested right from the start.<br /><br />Overall, one of my favorites, and definitely a keeper. I'd recommend it to anyone, but especially to fans of Robert Jordan, George R R Martin, Robin Hobb, and Terry Pratchett.
B00005JKC3|4.0|I'll keep this quick.<br /><br />If you want a lot of action and light-hearted fun, this is not the movie for you.  It's heavy on story and it tries to say something about our lives and relationships--it's not just about some green guy smashing things.<br /><br />This movie has:<br /><br />1.  Great action sequences and fights<br />2.  Great writing<br />3.  Fantastic direction--split screens, flip-transitions, dissolves make watching it reminiscent of viewing panels from the book<br />4.  An original villain that the Hulk must battle, a villain that is symbolic--kind of like some of the baddies Buffy Summers had to slay on the Buffy TVS show.<br />5.  Great acting<br /><br />It's a serious portrayal of a man who wants nothing to do with his emotions, who suddenly has to learn how to cope with memories and feelings he buried a long time ago.  It is easily one of the best comic book adaptations and it's unfortunate that so many people seem to have dismissed it.

0743290119|2.0|I'm about 3/4 of the way done and cannot wait for it to be over - so boring!  I was really disappointed because I really liked her first 2 books.  The characters, storyline and general writing of the book are so flat.  It's funny b/c the character Leigh finds the new book that she is editing for this great writer that is flat and boring and ironically that is what this book is for Lauren Weisberger.
B000F7CMRM|5.0|They nailed it here. Behind the facade of polite manners, crisply ironed suits, dark restaurants, and spotless white robes, those in power know the real story. This is about the ruthless pursuit of power, the people who know the score, how they manipulate almost everyone else, and the consequences.     Intelligent and well considered. This is the first time I'd heard Mossedeq mentioned on TV, Radio or Movies despite the fact that Mossedeq is the pivotal character in the struggle for oil in the Middle East.    As others have pointed out, the story is complex and hard to follow, just like real life.    As Clooney points out, the best character actors in Hollywood all wanted to be in this film, and they picked the best, so although few characters are well developed, they are all VERY believable. The lust for power, bubbles palpably under the surface of most of them, and the Faustian bargains they knowingly make are ugly.    If this movie doesn't scare you and make you fear for your children nothing will.

0670020745|5.0|\\"My Stroke of Insight\\" made an indelible impression on my mind (no pun intended).  Beyond the wonder of Jill Bolte Taylor's ability to render a blow-by-blow description of the stroke and its effect on her mind, I am struck by her discovery that terright brain and its Elysian fields are accessible to her in an instant.  She likens accessing her right brain to being able to recall, immediately, what it is like to be on the beach, if a person has ever visited a beach.      This is the kind of reporting from the beyond that gives an ordinary person like myself hope that peace and contentment and a feeling of \\"oneness\\" with the universe is not only available to all of us, but is actually built into our hardware.
B00006SFLV|5.0|This show is phenomenal!  I was thirteen when the show ended and too young to understand the depth and brilliance of the show at the time but now in my mid twenties, I am able to appreciate it for all of its complexities and the innovative approach to discussing and revealing teenage thoughts, mid-life crises, homosexuality-- this show tackled it all.  It's definitely not the show for the average joe, which is probably why it got cancelled way before its time.  I watch it over and over again and learn something new or find something that I missed every time.  This is the type of show you wish would return back to the small screen, but each member of the cast vital to the show's existence and the show would lose much of its effect if it was recast.... Amazing show, I wish there were 20 more episodes!  Fantastic script, fantastic cast, fantastic memories.  Thanks for the DVD! Amazing show! There is no other show like it and I will definitely pass on to my kids.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|If you enjoy Coldplay, you should really check out Eskimo Joe's brilliant collection of dark, keyboard-driven pop-rock on \\"Black Fingernails, Red Wine.\\" Now that I've done you that favor, on to the review.     I've always felt somewhat cool toward Coldplay. I liked a few songs on each of their previous albums, but as a whole they just didn't speak to me. I thought the songs were better than the singer; I just didn't like Chris Martin's voice, especially his fondness for falsetto, which he just doesn't sing well. But on \\"Viva La Vida\\" they've made some slight changes that have resulted in a much stronger album. The music is more muscular and rhythmic, Martin is using his lower register most of the time, and the production by Eno has more clearly revealed the influence of U2 and Peter Gabriel on the band. I also like the touches of Prog-rock throughout the album; they add some adventurousness and color and move their sound a bit out of the mainstream.     While I think this is a very good CD, I still think Coldplay is overrated (why so much hype over this band?). There are many bands and artists that are far superior who deserve a lot more attention (including yours): The Flower Kings, The Tangent, Marillion (Coldplay fans would probably love them, especially \\"Marbles\\"), Echolyn, Muse, Porcupine Tree, Pineapple Thief, The Living End, Eskimo Joe, The Cat Empire, Neal Morse, and Richard Thompson, among others. I'm sure some of these artists will appeal to those who like Coldplay. For now I will continue to listen to \\"VLV\\" as one of the six CD's in my car stereo, but others will likely get more playing time.
B000FQJAIW|4.0|Its a great addition to any avid fans collection. finally, the original 1977 theatrical release on DVD! But dont buy it expecting to see the Biggs and Luke scene on Tatooine or the Jabba the Hut scene with Han in the hanger of Mos Eisley. They have been cut. Apparently they were never officially released in the theater version but i fondly remember seeing them in a version of the film. Other then that small bit Great DVD's
0887307280|2.0|I don't care that this book has 197 5 Star ratings. Mr. Gerber's book failed to make good on the title of his book. I swear, if you go back and strip out all of the \\"back road sage\\" talk he gives to his imaginary friend Sara, this would be a better book. Instead, one or two pages in each chapter actually get down to the meat and potatoes of the topic. The rest are fluff to build up his page count (268 pages).    For example, in the \\"Business Development Process\\" chapter, much of it is filled with hokey fluff such as this (him speaking to Sarah, yet again): \\"And so the craftsperson is one who has reached that stage of development where she is content with the work, and only the work, knowing that it is only through being there with one's work that the jewel will reveal itself, and that it is the work, and only the work, raised to the level of near perfection that connects the craftsperson with herself, with her own heart.\\"    Excuse me? What the hell does that have to do with \\"The Business Development Process??\\"    Mr. Gerber spends too much time trying to sound like a Guru (the front cover of the book calls him \\"The World's #1 Small Business Guru\\") and not on just telling us what we need to know. I also felt like a third person standing in the room watching him pontificate to Sarah. He should have spent more time talking to the reader instead. 90% of all the paragraph's are in quotation marks since most of the freakin book is spent blathering about nothing to Sarah.    Honestly, I would have settled for a 120 page book without the Sarah conversations about how \\"The master is connected to the apprentice as though to her past. As you are to your childhood.\\" The book sounds to cultish. Mr. Gerber writes like he talks, which makes me assume that he is some sort of motivational speaker who charges thousands of dollars for folks to attend his speaking engagements and seminars.    If you don't believe a word of what I say then just buy the book and kick yourself in the arse later for it.

I ordered it and now I am happy.
0316776963|5.0|I have never read a book this hysterical in my life.  In this quirky autobiographical piece Sedaris tackles everything from a speech therapist who is out to correct every lisp in the boys with homosexual tendacies, to his galavanting in Paris where he visits all the movie theatres but none of the tourist attractions, to his prank playing sister who finds it amusing to create shocking situations (she yells out \\"good luck beating that rape charge David\\" right before he steps out of his subway car).<br /><br />Some of his stories border on the absurd but his true talent is for finding humorous twists and perspectives on the mundane parts of life that many of us have perhaps pondered in a similar fashion but never had the true courage to vocalize.  I read half of this book out loud to my husband and he and I were both gasping for breath as we shook with laughter.  Read just one chapter and I dare you to put it down.  This is one of those books I know I will return to again and again because it isn't a linear plot but a collection of great moments that you want to share with those around you.<br /><br />My only regret is that it took me this long to pick up one of his books.  I plan to read them all and you should too.  Unless you don't have a sense of humor or are uptight when it comes to being politically correct in which case I highly recommend you stay away from this.
0805211063|1.0|Kafka is one of my all time favorite writers,  but try as I might, I can't get through the Mark Harman translation of The Castle ... it comes across like a laundry list of details,  at least compared to the other versions I've read.<br />A  tour de force of literal accuracy,  perhaps,  but it just isn't funny.
0385474547|4.0|I was surprised and disappointed in some of the incredibly harsh reviews of this book.  Since I've read a decent amount of African literature (not a vast amount), my first thoughts are that \\"Things Fall Apart\\" isn't superior to some of those novels.  However, it is also important to realize this was a pre-cursor and likely an influence on many if not all of those more recent novels.  One needs to think about the historical context and timeframe that this book was written in, the late 1950s.  There had not been a large acceptance nor critical recognition of African literature in the Western world during that time, especially of literature from Africa.  Achebe's novel had played a critical roled putting African literature on the world map.<br /><br />The novel centers on one of the leaders of a Nigerian tribe, Okonkwo.  Achebe divides the novel into three parts -- setting up tribal life and the Okonkwo's family, his exile to his mother's ancestral tribe and Okonkwo's return to his tribe.  The other important theme underlying the story centers on the impact of colonialism, specifically Christianity, on African tribal life.<br /><br />What \\"Things Fall Apart\\" provides us with is deeper knowledge of African tribal life, the customs and mores of a people and the affect of outside influences, in this case Western culture, on traditional tribal life.  The book has an elegant simplicity to it, matching the picture Achebe paints of tribal life.  While there are a few bits that move slowly, this is a short book and is worthy of a read for both the influence and impact it has had on African literature as well as the the knowledge of a different culture and people that many of us are unlikely to encounter during our life.
B00000K3CR|5.0|I went to the same highschool as Tom. He graduated 4 years after me. Great actor and there are very few dvds that I buy (only the classics); this one falls into that category.
B000067CPX|5.0|Some reviewers said they lost their passion and energy during this album. I'd like to state clearly that they certainly did not, but they definitely redirected it into a somewhat slower-paced but more introspective group of songs. I see this album as so much more of a reflection on what the group had done as a whole, the obstacles they overcame, the people they lost along the way (Hillel is def. referenced), and a great bunch of somber-type love songs. The California sun-drenched melodies permeate through the entire album and although it ends up feeling bittersweet, the mix of emotions through the whole CD are a perfect blend. I especially like Warm Tape and Venice Queen as songs that took some time to grow on me, but after a few years of loving this album, these two have come back into my favor. Venice Queen is such a great epic song how it goes into an acoustic transition at the end, but still keeps it's energy. It's more poppy of an album as a whole, but it makes it much more listenable than their early funk stuff and what it might lack in musicianship, it makes up for with very, very catch songwriting. To me musicianship is a misnomer for playing incredibly fast and intricate stuff. But as a guitar player myself and really \\"listening\\" to John's work, musicianship is also about playing what \\"fits\\" the song or sometimes when not to play. It's having that clever taste and writing \\"music\\", not shred or super funk. Frusciante is at his finest in the studio, layering his Brian Wilson-type vocals with incredible precision. I think as a production piece, this one is definitely the Chili's finest by far. It's such a THICK album and that's what I love about it - all the textures. It's fully playable from beginning to end, no need to skip songs, but I'd say my favorite is 'Don't Forget Me'. That song is so haunting and powerful and to any reviewers who said they lost their energy on this album, I suggest viewing the Slane Castle live version of this song, then try to tellme they put more passion into their wildly ridiculous funk from the early 80's and 90's. Not to take anything away from their older stuff, but they have matured into songwriters as opposed to untamed virtuosos back then. And even now on Stadium Arcadium, they've found a happy medium of both. Still, any Chili's fan should have this album and I think many of you sincerely love it as much as I do.
B000DWMN2S|3.0|And initially, I did. But once the quirkiness  petered out, that was it. Despite the profound subject matter, the film then simply became boring. No amount of prolonged landscape-shots, or meaningful silences in the cramped confines of the little car could sustain a promising start right up to the rather damp squib of an ending.<br /><br />Like with the book, certain devices eventually start to grate: The constant interpreting retards the flow of the narrative. Initially it may have served a purpose, but once the point about Jonathan being an outsider was made, and once the humour of Alex's translation had long been exhausted, this device, which in the end amounted to nothing more than a mere repetition of the subtitles should have been dropped..<br /><br />I thought the book was overrated, and I think the same of the film. Although I really wanted to like it, I could'nt.<br /><br />Louis M
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|It was with great anticipation that I ordered this DVD because the medieval/Tudor era is my favorite in history, and I enjoyed the book upon which it is based. But OMG, I don't remember when I saw a less appealing movie. Let's start with the pluses. (There actually are a few.) Visually, watching TOBG is a feast. Stunning costumes, authentic settings. With respect to performance,  Ana Torrent was superb as Katherine of Aragon, outraged but dignified. Thus the 2 star rating.<br /><br />Now for the problems. The screenplay deserves a special Oscar for \\"worst ever based upon best selling novel.\\" History be damned, let's turn this amazing, tragic epic into a travesty of lust and corruption, telescoping 8 long years of struggle into a choppy series of racy vignettes. Some of the dialogue is absurd. Mary's relationship with Henry occurred years before Anne's. There is no evidence that Henry ever raped Anne, or that she attempted to seduce her own brother. There is no evidence of much of what is portrayed in this version.<br /><br />Had to turn it off after suffering through an hour and a half. Do yourself a favor, and don't even bother with this turkey.
B00007H1Y2|5.0|I love this album. I got the feeling of being in a club listening to a band late at night who were as buzzed as the audience.Boozy/bluesy vibe over latin percussion. The ultimate lounge album. You can almost see the couples dancing slow to the rhythms.Great music.

0452289963|2.0|While I usually shun anything offered/endorsed by Oprah, I read/skimmed through this book for my book group.    I give two stars to Mr. Tolle for condensing strains of different philosophies into a book that apparently is reaching many people.    Personally, I had trouble with Mr. Tolle.  First, I am skeptical of anyone who not much is known about and/or is touted by Oprah.  She goes through \\"gurus\\" like water; every year (or less) she is finding someone new to help her find \\"enlightenment\\".      Second, navel gazing is never sexy.  Mr. Tolle's version of being in the \\"now\\" to release your pain/suffering and become egoless is interesting but difficult in practice and can be self defeating.  Suffering is not necessarily negative and many of us have to go through suffering to obtain the awarness that Mr. Tolle expounds.  My concern with his vision is that many people do not have the intellectual heft to even comprehend what he is teaching and that many who life their daily lives trying to get their basic needs will not be focused enough to meditate on his words.  Basic needs have to be met before one can self-actualize (Maslow).  A world wide revoluation (my words) it is not.    Thus I feel that his book would not be relevant to large sections of the population which negates his hypothesis that we are experiencing a large shift in our consciousness.    Third, Mr. Tolle does not reflect on once we find our true selves, what are we to do with them?  Once we become self-actualized, what next?  So we all experience the Source, and......should we work in this country to help the poor and suffering, should we get involved in political discussions and become informed to what is truly going on in our political arenas...should we become more conscious of our environment and our wasteful ways....should we work to become less materialistic...?    Fourth, Mr. Tolle makes a very broad statement that enlightenment is obtainable for the average person (which may be true, but it is very difficult and can take many years of study.  And he also is making a very broad statement that these \\"frequency  holders\\" as he describes them will be the vehicles for change.  Now I hate to burst Mr. Tolle's bubble but what makes him so sure this will happen.  Through out history we have only a very few \\"enlightened\\" people, i.e. Jesus Christ, The Buddha, and many wise men/women.  And our World still has a myraid of problems, where is the change in consciousness?      Fifth, Mr. Tolle is big on being egoless but is he?  The man writes books, holds seminars, give speechs, he even changed his name to \\"Eckhart\\" to reflect his admiration for the great mystic Meister Eckhart's teachings.     Mr. Tolle is successful because 1) there are many people who will do/buy/support what Oprah says to do/buy/support because she is Oprah abd 2) there are many people who dislike organised religion, don't have much of a background in religious philosophy, yet have beliefs and like the generic philosophical message that Mr. Tolle exposes.

B000002KDI|5.0|Yes, it is a shame they found they needed to edit out some material. But if anything, they could of knocked out 'Tonights the night'... never did like that song and I always thought the track was a let down to the album ending. Otherwise a brilliant live compilation and recording. Actually always liked Neil Young but for some reason Live Rust was the only Neil Young album I ever bought, but probably among my 10 favorites and most listened to of all time.
B000002H38|5.0|Anita's second album is one of the most greatest soul albums of the 80's. Her voice is so soulful and sensual. and whenever you listen to her voice, you just want to sit back, relax, and indulge in her smooth jazzy vocals. Here's my review of my favorite songs by the \\"goddess of soul.\\"    1.) Sweet Love: This song is one of my very favorite songs by Anita. It sounds so sensual and jazzy.  2.) No One In The World: This is another one of my favorite Anita songs. It's so soulful and relaxing.  3.) Caught Up in the Rapture: OMG, this song is so jazzy and soulful. I luv it!  4.) You Bring Me Joy: Another great soulful song. Anita never sounded better.  5.) Mystery: This song has a very haunting rhythm and Anita's vocals shine on this song.    Anita's \\"Rapture\\" album is a classic soul album. This album is so amazing. You won't be disappointed at all.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|While lots can (and has) already been said about this set, I just want to reiterate one thing: the best part of this DVD is the restoration of Alien³.<br /><br />Unfairly maligned on release mainly because it follows James Cameron's action-packed blockbuster Aliens, Alien³ is an intentional departure in tone from the previous chapter. Even if you don't like the film, I'd call such a dramatic shift in tone commendable by franchise standards -- it took balls to make Alien³, and on that basis alone, it's so much more interesting than a lot of cookie-cutter sequels.<br /><br />The highlight here, which might have been trimmed out of the theatrical version (I hadn't seen any of them before I bought this set, and I haven't bothered to watch the shorter cut since then) is the raw performance by Sigourney Weaver. The change of pace electrifies her character, both in a great softer moment with the doctor played by Charles Dance, and during the action sequences (featuring the movie's biggest blemish, an awful-looking optical Alien effect), which swoop around the corridors of the prison planet in ways that will be familiar to fans of director David Fincher and his visual style.<br /><br />Of all the things uncovered by the Alien Quadrilogy, the workprint version of Alien³ is the strongest, a breath of fresh air into a movie that already is one. It's dark, sure, but it is what it is, and taken as part of one of the most successful movie franchises of all time, what it is is worth a look, worth a re-evaluation, worth studying and eventually taking into account as an important chapter in a great series.
0143038419|5.0|I've never written a book review before....and then I read all of the horrible reviews already left for \\"Eat, Pray, Love\\" and was really surprised.  This book has been a complete joy to read, and I plan on reading it again as soon as I finish the last chapter.  I don't see a problem with the author always talking about herself in the book....the title has \\"One Woman's search...\\" in it, so of course it's going to be about her!    I think this book is beautiful and very relaxing to read because I see a lot of myself in Elizabeth's personality and struggles.
0823013626|1.0|I found the book just did not live up to my expectations. When will crafting books realize that photo transfers done with xerox machines hardly ever work as they are shown in books? The techniques of photo transfer, which is covered in this book as if it works, is really frustrating. Also, the use of translucent clays to good effect is iffy and the high polish acheived by the author on many of the pieces. I just couldn't get it to work.
0937381888|5.0|As someone who reads technical papers and blogs for a living, I found John Palmer's book to be very easy to read and extremely informative.  After reading the book cover to cover, I still find myself going back to it as a \\"technical reference\\" book when I have questions about a process or approximation.  This book breaks down (pun intended) the mashing process in a way that is both understandable in layman's terms with enough of the real technical process to help you really understand what is going on and why.  Through this book I have enlightened many of my friends and coworkers to the joy and wonder of homebrewing.
0446402389|4.0|Perhaps if the author hadn't let so much out in the first chapter, the conclusion of the book might have been more exciting.  As it was, I had Leo's personal situation figured out before the book introduced a slight niggling.  From there it was easy to make the other connection and then just sit back and wait for the author to get around to tying up the loose ends.<br /><br />The back-stories were much more interesting: the life in 1950's Soviet Russia for orphans, dissidents, villagers as opposed to city dwellers, the constant fear of being watched and turned in to the authorities.  The atmosphere of Soviet Russia was perfectly captured in this book and for that alone the book is worth reading.
B000TGJ7ZY|1.0|I thought Gary Oldman was great. The movie was horrible. I had just finished reading the book and was so excited to see the movie. The first scene of the movie was wrong. What a horrible interpretation. If they wanted to make the movie based on the book, how can they ruin the main plot? Dracula and Mina Harker were never in love. The book in my opinion isn't even about Dracula. It's about the love between Jonathon and Mina. Mina's love for Dracula though-out the movie was stupid. Such a great story. Cant anyone get it right?
B00004WEJZ|3.0|For many Bond fans, the return of Sean Connery in this \\"unofficial\\" Bond entry, was an exciting opportunity to experience the Connery magic and charisma before the earlier pre-Roger Moore years. Released in 1983, the film competed head-to-head against Moore's entry, \\"Octopussy\\" which, to some critics of note, one of the better Roger Moore efforts.  Obviously, this production had a more engaging cast, an entertaining story, and some good actors: Maude Adams and Louis Jourdan as Bond's nemesis than \\"Never Say Never Again.\\"<br /><br />While it's good to have Connery back, looking actually fitter than he did in \\"Diamond Are Forever\\" in 1971, and wearing a faultless toupee, the film manages to fall short on a number of levels.  Viewers should note, it is a different film; for instance, no gun barrel logo in the pre-credits sequence, or the familiar incidental Bond theme music we all recognize.<br /><br />Bear in mind this film, in actuality, is simply a remake of Terrence Young's \\"Thunderball\\" (1965), that represented the apogee of the James Bond franchise. Some of the other leads turn in a respectable performance, Bernie Casey, as an African-American Felix Leiter, is adequate as is Klaus Maria Bandauer in the role of \\"Maximillian Largo,\\" a change from \\"Emilio Largo\\" from the '65 film, originally played by Adolfo Celi. But he is simply not menacing enough.  The sequence at the casino between Largo and Bond is rather odd; they play a silly tabletop video game called \\"World Domination\\" rather than baccarat or chemin-de-fer. Not really effective, nor does this really belong in a Bond film.<br /><br />Barbara Carrera as Fatima Blush, reprises the role of Fiona Volope(Lucianna Paluzzi in \\"Thunderball\\") the film's femme fatale, in what could be considered an over-the-top-performance that borders on the hysterical with her outlandish costumes, hats and formal evening attire. Kim Basinger, as Domino, although lovely to look at, comes off as rather dull and uninspired. We long for an actress like the lovely former Miss. France, Claudine Auger, who, although not an actress by a long shot in the original \\"Thunderball,\\"  managed to bring an aura of sophistication, beauty, and unavailability shared by most Bond heroines before they succumb to the charms of 007.<br /><br />\\"M\\" played by Edward Fox, is competent and irascible, but too young for the role--only illustrating how much we truly miss Bernard Lee and Lois Maxwell (Moneypenny) from the original series. In all, the film has a distinct look and pace that strikes one of a lavish made-for-tv production; not a quality Bond feature despite some exotic locations and interiors.<br /><br />Despite Bond's rocket powered motorcycle, and an explosive fountain pen, the gadgets are few (thankfully), and the film is really an opportunity for Connery to prove, once again, HE is the James Bond everyone recognizes, knows, and respects above all others in the franchise's forty-five plus year history.e lovely former Miss.

B00177Y9ZC|3.0|I liked the premise of this movie, which features an unpopular teenager with a bad home life whom discovers that he has the special ability to teleport wherever he wants to go. We see how he learns to use this special ability to make a new life for himself. We learn his unique talent brings along unexpected consequences.    The overall storyline of this movie is good, but could have used more overall depth to it then the superficial glossing over of certain topics. The special effects are decent enough. I also think the characters should have been developed a bit more along with the storyline to make this film a lot better as a whole.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|\\"Persona\\" isn't one of my favorite Bergman films, although better people than I--including Susan Sontag and Bergman himself--consider it his masterpiece.  I'm sure that part of my uneasiness with it is that I just can't quite figure out what's going on in it.  Is it a parable about the various personae we all wear to protect ourselves from not only the prying eyes of others but also from our own inner scrutiny?  Are Alma and Elisabet alter egos of one and the same person, with Alma being the wild, untamed id and Elisabet the more constricted superego (I realize that this neat Freudian division fails to do justice to the richness of either character)?  Is the film the story about two actually different women, one of whom--Alma--is sinking deeper and deeper into psychosis and increasingly abusing the other?  All of these interpretations (and others, I'm sure) could be drawn from the film.<br /><br />My best guess is that \\"Persona\\" (or better, I think, \\"personae,\\" since Alma and Elisabet, in addition to perhaps being masks themselves, each wear multiple masks--masks on top of masks, if you will) is the story of the split in humans that stories such as Hesse's Narcissus and Goldmund, Stevenson's Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, and Dostoevsky's The Double explore:  the reserved, contemplative, Apollonian side of us and the frenzied, ecstatic Dionysian side.  The two can co-exist, but they can frequently feud against one another.  Alma the Dionysian and Elisabet the Apollonian, each projecting onto the other, each intimately attracted to and violently repulsed by the other, each longing for and fearing integration:  this, I think, might be what's going on in the film.  If so, \\"Persona\\" really is an important parable about what it means to be human.<br /><br />The acting is superb.  Bibi Andersson is astounding in the sheer energy she brings to the role of Alma, and Liv Ullmann's ability to convey deep and various emotions with only subtle facial expressions takes away my breath.  But one of the reasons the film isn't my favorite is that I think the famous opening scenes are distractions, and smack too much of the self-consciously arty hijinks that gets so much European cinema mocked at.<br /><br />Does this mean that the film doesn't deserve 5 stars?  Not a bit.reasons the film isn't my favorite is that I think the famous opening scenes are distractions, and smack too much of the self-consciously arty hijinks that gets so much European cinema mocked at.

0316143472|4.0|\\"When you are Engulfed in Flames\\" is a more mature and serious work from Sedaris. Just like the rest of us, he is growing up. Death, the comfort and security of old relationships, and the humility of age are all thematic elements in this text. However, that is not to say that Sedaris has lost his inimitable sense of style and humor. Flames is a seriously funny book, but it has more pages between the laugh out loud antics of some of Sedaris' earlier works.<br />I am still amazed at how quickly Sedaris can change emotions so completely and perfectly in the same sentence. His essay in this collection \\"Adult Figures Charging Toward a Concrete Toadstool\\" is an excellent example of this ability.<br />Besides being entertaining, he is a seriously good writer who holds up to critical scrutiny. Enjoy. (You will)
B000YXMMAE|5.0|As a relatively new fan to Radiohead (been listening for a little over a year!) it was a sad moment when I came to the realization that I had experienced all the band had to offer. I had fallen in love with the band as I listened to the crooning, haunting lyrics overlayed with distorted electronic sounds of the album Amnesiac while laying out on the beach.  After that, I went out and got my hands on every album available to me.    Lo and behold, rumors started to spread that they were going to release a new cd! When I learned that I could buy it for my own price online, I immediately went to their website and threw down 10 pounds for the album. I spent the next couple of hours laying in my room, absorbing the music that flowed effortlessly out of my speakers. I was hooked from the opening drum beats of 15 Steps and remained rooted to the spot until the final chords of Videotape faded completely.    In my opionion, In Rainbows melds together the experimental and creative outlets of Kid A and Amnesiac while remaining accessible to a more mainstream audience. They keep the progressive, synthestic sounds that define them as a band, but allow the guitar and drums to play a more forefront roll in this album. The distortion of the guitar in Bodysnatchers hearkens back to the grunge of the 90s. Yet the song remains firmly rooted in the present when the distortion cuts out about midway through the song and the guitar takes on a more abstract sound. I think that might be what I enjoyed so much about this album. It seemed to combine the sounds the Radiohead created in the past, from Ok Computer through to Amnesiac, and blend them into something that felt recognizable while at the same time completely new and inventive.     The tracks weave in and out of one another, transitioning seamlessly from one song to the next. However, as cohesive as this album is, each song could just as easily stand on its own. The album is well paced too. It switches from the fast, upbeat tempo of songs like Weird Fishes/Arpeggi and Jigsaw Falling Into Place to the more melodic, slowed down compositions like All I Need and Reckoner. Thom's voice is truly given the chance to shine in the closing track Videotape. A haunting melody that reaches into your chest and grabs hold until the song closes, Thom's signature voice is backed solely by a simple piano for the beginning of the track. The combination of the two, so simple yet so unbelievably elegant and heartbreaking, prove that Radiohead truly are the masters of creating emotional music whose ambiance has the ability to settle deep within a person.    My personal favorite is House of Cards. Combining such a simple, peaceful melody with controversial lyrics make the piece an exquisite contradiction. The pleading to \\"Forget about your house of cards\\" followed by the imagery of the cards falling to the ground is mesmerizing. Again, this is a perfect example of how Thom Yorke's voice has the ability to create something beautiful yet agonizing all at the same time.    Overall, I found this album to be one that I could listen to in its entirety over and over again. It still has not gotten old to me. Someone who may have been hesitant to try Radiohead might find this album a means of easing into the sound of the band.

B0016K40KY|5.0|WARNING: This review contains spoilers!    In 1962, director [[ASIN:B0000AGQ72 David Lean]] ([[ASIN:B00000F17A Oliver Twist]] and [[ASIN:B0016K40KO The Bridge on the River Kwai]]) made cinematic history with his epic historical drama, Lawrence of Arabia. The film is perhaps one of the most daring and ambitious films ever made. Utilizing an amazing screenplay written by Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson, Lean created a film that is an intimate character study, a harrowing war epic, a spectacular adventure and one of the greatest achievements in the annals of filmic history. Lawrence of Arabia has gone on to become a classic. It won seven Oscars and garnered international acclaim. Even its few detractors (most of which complain about the film's historical inaccuracies) will admit that it's stood the test of time and only earned more praise over the years.    The film tells the tale of staff-captain and Lieutenant T.E. Lawrence, an English officer stationed in Cairo during WWI (at this time the Turkish Empire was ally to Germany and therefore a threat to British interests). Lawrence was a unique individual in that unlike most of his British compatriots, he understood that England's military was losing the fight against the Turks. He also understood that the various Arab tribes were warring against the Turks, but they were too scattered and disorganized to make any real progress.   Bored with his mapmaking and newspaper writing duties, he set forth a plan to get himself reassigned. He made himself out to be a general annoyance, obnoxious and peculiar. He managed to with the help of a senior officer, obtain a new position with the Arab Bureau. He would observe and chronicle the Arabs from within their encampment at Wadi Safra and evaluate their usefulness to the British war effort. Upon meeting Prince Feisal and his ill-equipped soldiers, Lawrence came to the conclusion that they were not only adequate as fighters but also courageous and dedicated. Their weaknesses were mainly that they lacked modern artillery, and that the various tribes were divided and constantly feuding with one another. Yet if they could be united, as one Arab people, against the Turks then they would stand a chance.  Lawrence upon fist glance might seem the most unlikely person to do this. Though he was well educated and possessed an unusual understanding of the region, he was awkward and outspoken, which made him seem arrogant. Lawrence's confidence at first offended the Arabs, who saw him as another cocky British officer, but they eventually came to respect his bravery and tenacity.  It becomes apparent that in order to defeat the Turkish army that the seaport at Akaba must be taken. But it cannot be approached by the sea due to the great immobile guns facing the water. It is decided that a small group of fifty men from the Harith tribe could take Akaba by land, but first they would have to cross 600 miles of desert and survive the \\"impassable\\" Nefudh desert. This treacherous journey tries them all and along the way Lawrence earns the respect of the Bedouin, especially Ali (who he first met on his way to meet Prince Feisal, when Ali killed Lawrence's guide for drinking from a Harith well). After saving a man's life, Lawrence is given the name El Orens and is presented with the robes of a noble Arab tribe.  Lawrence and Ali then manage to convince the Howeitat tribe to join them in their attack on Akaba, though they only agreed to do so when offered gold. Auda abu Tayi, the leader of the Howeitat, proves to be a great ally despite the fact that many of the Harith disapprove of Auda's mercenary tactics. Finally they reach Akaba and their surprise attack is successful. However Auda is disgusted when he finds only paper money and not gold. Lawrence promises that Auda will be paid with gold but first Lawrence must deliver word of their victory to the British.  He decides to take two young servants, Farraj and Doud, with him. The trek proves difficult and along theway Doud falls into a pit of quicksand and dies. Lawrence blames himself for the boy's death. When Lawrence and Farraj finally arrive in Cairo they are treated with prejudice and discourtesy. Lawrence has grown so accustomed to his Bedouin garments that he's not aware of how alien he appears to the other officers.  The new general, Allenby promotes Lawrence to major and orders him to go back but Lawrence refuses at first. He's tasted power and held many lives in his hands, and on some level or another he knows that giving him more responsibility would be a dangerous thing to do. Yet he agrees to Allenby's proposition when Allenby subtly builds up his ego with talk of making history. He is also lied to when he asks Allenby whether or not the British have \\"ambitions in Arabia\\" after the war. Allenby tells him that they do not. As Lawrence leaves the General's headquarters he's overwhelmed with congratulations, which only inflate his ego further.  When Lawrence returns to the desert he brings British ammunition and armored vehicles. His name becomes infamous and he is viewed by many as a hero. This is a fact which numerous journalists wish to exploit and in so doing encourage support for the war effort. Meanwhile Lawrence wages a guerrilla war against the Turks. He and his army attack the railway systems, weakening the Turkish forces one train at a time. He relishes the praise and adoration that is showered upon him but he begins to delude himself. After almost being killed by a gunman he jokingly says, \\"Didn't you know, they can only kill me with a golden bullet?\\"   After months of fighting most of the Howeitat tribe have gone home and even Ali seems to be concerned with Lawrence's state of mind. After one of the attacks goes wrong Farraj is severely wounded and Lawrence is forced to kill him so as to spare him the unimaginable tortures that the Turks would use to extract information from him. Haunted by guilt, Lawrence recklessly decides to move ahead in his plans. He tells the few remaining Arabs that he intends to attack Deraa.  Meanwhile the British general, Allenby begins to wonder if Lawrence has \\"gone native\\". He fears that Lawrence no longer serves Britain but instead fights to guarantee Arab independence. His fears are justified. Lawrence, full of pride and false bravado, continues with his plans to advance to Deraa. The Arabs refuse to join him in his folly. So Lawrence goes alone, accompanied only by Ali. There Turkish soldiers capture him, though they never discover his identity. He is interrogated, beaten and brutalized before they release him. Lawrence is forever changed by this incident. He becomes insecure and disenchanted. His mind is polluted with doubts and anxieties. He decides to give up and allow the Arab revolt to be carried on by others. Ali and many of the Harith tribe feel betrayed and abandoned when Lawrence leaves.  Upon his return to British headquarters, Lawrence is treated like an outsider. He meets with General Allenby and learns of a proposed treaty between France and England, who after the war intend to share the Turkish Empire... including Arabia. Lawrence is outraged. He requests to be reassigned to a lesser position but Allenby manipulates him and talks him into leading the upcoming attack at Damascus. Lawrence buries his insecurities with anger, hiding his vulnerability with defiance. He agrees to lead the attack on Damascus if Allenby will nullify the treaty and guarantee that Arabia will be left to the Arabs. Allenby reluctantly agrees.  When next the Arab army assembles, Ali sees a great change in Lawrence. He sees a man who is over confident and vengeful, bloodthirsty and guilt ridden. Lawrence now surrounds himself with vicious mercenaries who act as his personal bodyguards. On the road to Damascus the Arabs encounter a small town devastated by the Turks and Lawrence, prompted by his bodyguards and repulsed by the Turks, orders a bloody attack. \\"No prisoners!\\" he shouts with indignant rage. When the battle is over, Lawrence finds himself covered in blood and surrounded by dead Turkish soldiers. He's horrified by the pleasure he derived from the killing. Even those men who once admired him now look on him with fear and trepidation.  Lawrence and the Arabs arrive in Damascus and they immediately form a committee. At the town hall they have a meeting to discuss the creation of a democratic Arab government but the Arab tribes have for too long fought amongst themselves. His attempt at uniting them proves to be in vain.  The film ends with its viewers asking themselves whether Lawrence's actions were altruistic or motivated by a hunger for glory, whether he was devoted to the Arab revolt or to his own hopeless search for identity.    Clearly he was in real life a tragic hero, a complex man with great dreams and aspirations. But he was a man weighted down by flaws, flaws that sabotaged his potential to make wonderful changes in the Middle East.  The cast is amazing. Peter O'Toole is riveting in his portrayal of the enigmatic Lawrence and Omar Sharif, as Ali, gives a complex and multi-faceted performance. The rest of the cast is also wonderful particularly Anthony Quinn as Auda abu Tayi, Alec Guinness as Prince Feisal, Jack Hawkins as General Allenby, Anthony Quayle as Colonel Brighton, Claude Rains as Mr. Dryden, and Jose Ferrer as the sadistic Turkish Bey who orders Lawrence to be beaten. The cinematography is breathtaking in its scope and gives the illusion that the desert is unending. The music by Maurice Jarre is incredibly powerful. It evokes images of sand swept dunes and bloody battlefields. It's no wonder the film is recognized as one of the best ever made.    At the time of writing this review there are four available versions of Lawrence of Arabia on DVD. The first is a bare bones single disc release, the second is an impressive 2-disc Limited Edition, the third is the Superbit edition, while the fourth and most recent is the 2-disc Collector's Edition. Of the four DVD releases I would recommend the last three.

0670020745|5.0|I heard this author interviewed on NPR, and it was one of those \\"driveway\\" moments that they always talk about. I just had to stop and listen. My next stop was the bookstore. The story that Taylor tells describes my worst nightmare. She was a high-functioning neuroscientist who had a stroke that caused her to lose much of her memory. She had to re-learn everything from scratch. Sounds depressing. But as she told it, the story was about liberation. She was freed from the weight of her past. And suddenly able to see the world in new ways that were not available to her before. This is one of the most thought-provoking books that I've read in a very long time. I recommend this book especially for people who enjoy reading Oliver Sachs (the author of The Man Who Mistook his Wife for a Hat), or other writers on the brain. But Taylor adds a new understanding of the experience of the brain from a personal point of view. I recommend it very highly.
0723257639|5.0|This is a wonderful collection in a beautiful box. I purchased it for my daughter's first birthday because I wanted to get her something more lasting than a toy. I was given the 12 book collection as a child, and The Tale of Squirrel Nutkin was the first book I ever read by myself. I remember loving how the small books were perfectly suited to my small hands. (Thus, if you are thinking about getting the book with the complete collection in one, I would not recommend it for a child. It would be better for a budget conscious person to get a collection with fewer books.) The stories are so appealing and timeless, and the illustrations are just beautiful. The price may be high, but I consider it to be an investment, and one that I highly recommend.
B00005JPY0|5.0|Three years have passed since audiences thrilled to the exploits of the Caped Crusader in [[ASIN:B000BUYP4Q Batman Begins]] and now writer/director Christopher Nolan ([[ASIN:B00006IUL7 Insomnia]] and [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]]) brings us the second chapter in the unfolding Batman saga. Rather than creating a sequel that relies entirely on action, Nolan has decided to go another route. The Dark Knight is even more intense, violent and psychologically complex than its predecessor.     In the last few minutes of Batman Begins Lieutenant Gordon warned Batman of a new threat to Gotham's safety: The Joker. Now we learn how much of a threat he is. The Joker is revealed to be a psychotic criminal mastermind devoted to creating chaos whenever and wherever possible. And Batman becomes desperate to stop him. It's this desperation that drives him to use questionable methods in his nightly battle against crime. But The Joker is a master of manipulation and he's counting on Batman to up the ante. When he does The Joker takes advantage of the situation. He makes himself the central figure in Gotham's criminal underworld and soon even members of the mob become fearful of him. Batman begins to question whether or not he can endure such hardships without being weakened or corrupted. He sees that Gotham needs a new hero, a leader who will in any situation do the right thing for the people. He believes Harvey Dent to be that hero. Harvey is an idealistic D.A. and a social crusader. He's also dating Rachel Dawes, who still loves Bruce but cannot be with him so long as he is Batman. This is why Bruce begins to ask himself if the time has come to pass the torch on to another. But is Harvey Dent really the man to succeed Batman? Is he as noble as people believe him to be? Or is there something dark and terrible lurking in the psyche of \\"Gotham's White Knight\\"? If so The Joker will only be happy to exploit it. And he does so in grand fashion. Tragedy strikes and someone close to Bruceis left dead (I'm not telling who) and Bruce decides that Batman is no longer needed, that he's become part of the problem and not the solution. Harvey's sense of justice is perverted and he becomes a maniacal vigilante who is obsessed with chance and flips a coin to determine his actions. It's clear that only Batman can stop him and The Joker, who delights in creating moral dilemmas for his victims before killing them. But can one man make a difference or is Harvey right? Is it just a matter of time before even Batman's corrupted?    As with the first film, The Dark Knight features an extraordinary cast including Christian Bale as Bruce Wayne / Batman, Heath Ledger as The Joker, Michael Caine as Alfred, Maggie Gyllenhaal as Rachel Dawes, Aaron Eckhart as Harvey Dent, Gary Oldman as Commissioner Gordon, Morgan Freeman as Lucius Fox, and Cillian Murphy as The Scarecrow. Other cast members include Eric Roberts, Anthony Michael Hall and Michael Jai White. Every member of the cast is great, but especially Maggie Gyllenhaal who replaces Katie Holmes as Bruce Wayne's love and Heath Ledger who is phenomenal as the psychopathic Joker. The Dark Knight is an amazing follow-up to Batman Begins and takes the \\"comic book film\\" to a whole new level of depth. It's easily one of the darkest superhero movies* I've seen, but that's what makes it brilliant. Christopher Nolan has made a disturbing, superhero tragedy that will in time redefine the genre. If Batman Begins was the philosophical Batman film then The Dark Knight is its sociological counterpart. There can be no knowing what the future holds for Gotham's Caped Crusader, but so long as Christopher Nolan is helming this series you can be sure that there are still many surprises in store.    * = I would strongly advise parents to take caution before letting their children watch this film. It contains scenes of intense action, brutal violence and presents viewers with moral questions to which it doesn't necessarily give any answers.

B0012Q732O|2.0|People are really going at this movie aren't they.  Well, no movie is accurate to history simply because we weren't there, we'll never know, and half to writing history is covering up the truth.  So stop whining about it you fools, nothing is EVER going to be accurate.  Not only that but it was totally obvious from the commercials this wouldn't be an accurate movie, let alone the fact that its made by Ranold or whatever his name is that made bloody GODZILLA, or INDEPENDENCE DAY.<br /><br />Here is a good summary for many retards and their moronic comments on various topics.  I found this from a commentor named Adam:<br />As for the cavemen speaking English, this is simple. 1) They weren't cave men, they lived in huts. This denotes some sort of movement to an agricultural based society. This is further given proof by the fact that they WAIT for the herd of mammoths to come; they don't follow them like nomadic hunters would. 2) The answer to the English is very simple. They didn't speak English. How did you not pick up on this fact? Whenever they went to other areas the new people spoke in a different language, THEN they switched to English. This was done so the entire movie wouldn't be in subtitles like Apocalypto.<br />Well put Adam.<br /><br />But aside from that people are right, everything in this was boring.  Dialogue, interactions, characters, story, everything was totally boring.  There was virtually no saber-tooth tiger in the entire movie, maybe like 2 minutes worth, which was a real bummer.  He looked badarse.<br /><br />CGI was great, though its all in the eye of the beholder, no hard fact saying its great or not.  I liked it.<br /><br />And thats all the aspects of a movie.  This just wasn't a good movie.
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Wow, now I know what all of the hype is about!  DEXTER is the show to watch.  If you're like me, you'll watch the first two episodes and be hooked.  The characters and storylines are fascenating.<br /><br />Season 1 for many shows is often a season of trial and error, hit and miss.  But for Dexter they hit the ground running.  They had their characters down to what they wanted them to be.  The actors/actresses filled those roles to perfection.  The best part, a wide range of characters and personalities, not to mention nationalities.  I watched Michael C Scott on Six Feet Under, within the first few episodes I no longer thought of him as \\"David\\", which this can often be hard to do once an actor has a popular series like that.  But it works here, he's fabulous!  This is one of the most original shows out there.  It's one that I am currently addicted to, so that gives it a high rating.<br /><br />I can't say enough good things about this show and the questions that it brings up.  It's more than a show to me, it really gets the thoughts running.  Now that's good TV.  Don't miss out!
B0010X745K|4.0|Suffice it to say I was impressed. This is one of the best transfers of a Stephen King story in many years. The acting, screenplay, sets, and special effects were great. You feel you are part of the action. You will identify with this group of people being stranded in a grocery store with only a thin plate glass window keeping the horrible creatures outside from devouring them. I know I was on the edge of my seat and found myself drawn in by the great character development. The trip of a small party to the Drugstore next door was harrowing. Each person in the store was very believable. Including the religious zealot that was drawing people to her camp for the \\"End of Days\\". Once her camp starts snatching people to throw to the creatures a small group lights out to find rescue. The ending is remarkable and somewhat poetic. I highly recommend this if you enjoy horror SciFi movies. Great quality DVD with good replayability. If you enjoyed this be sure to see \\"Maximum Overdrive\\", \\"Phantoms\\", and \\"The Relic\\". - C. Luster
B0018S6YOE|2.0|By now I hope everybody has figured out that re-releases usually don't benefit anyone except the greedy people at the record label headquarters. It gets them more money, and may even boost the album to the next RIAA certification. It also allows their artist to remain relevant for a little while longer, I guess. It's no secret. But still... couldn't Def Jam make it a little less obvious with this \\"Reloaded\\" edition of Rihanna's third album? The CD and DVD are housed in the same type of foldout digipak that the original came in and the artwork has been left virtually unchanged, which I think is extremely lazy. The album was already very good, and hands-down the best of Rihanna's career. The three new songs slapped on the end of the tracklist really don't add all that much. \\"Take A Bow\\" is just alright. It was mildly entertaining and catchy the first time I heard it, but by now it's overplayed--and I don't even listen to the radio much--and the Ne-Yo and Stargate collaborations are getting very tired and formulaic. \\"If I Never See Your Face Again\\" was originally just a Maroon 5 song, but apparently Rihanna was invited to join in for this \\"duet.\\" Rihanna should not try to do rock. It just doesn't work, and her vocals and Adam's just do not go together. It's as simple as that. \\"Disturbia,\\" which will be the set's seventh single, is by far the best. It follows the new trend of Euro-pop inspired tunes and it's pretty catchy and even a little bit creative. It's co-written by and features background vocals from her supposed boyfriend, Chris Brown. The DVD is lame, simply put, and its only purpose is to get us to buy the Good Girl Gone Bad Live DVD that's going to be coming out later this summer. It's nice to see what Rihanna is like as a person in the documentary bits, but the performances are extremely subpar and not very entertaining. In conclusion, this is weak, even for a re-release. Rather than releasing rip-off discs, Rihanna should just go back in the studio to record a whole new album of fresh material. Good Girl Gone Bad has has seven--yes, seven--singles and counting! Talk about overexposure. And the album has only gone platinum... inexcusable, even in today's harsh industry. Even though the album is great, it's time to put it to rest and move on to a new era. Do not buy this unless you are a die-hard fan or completist.
0393061310|2.0|Have you ever heard of \\"the Galileo Defense?\\" The phrase describes the phenomenon of honest, accurate science attempting to defend itself against ideology-driven accusations of those who are opposed to the implications of the scientist's work. A good example would be Darwin as he faced charges of atheism, satanism, etc. If the Galileo Defense has an opposite, it would certainly apply to this book. To save you the trouble, Guns, Germs, and Steel basically articulates the first moderately believable and (most importantly) politically correct attempt to explain why the West was able to enjoy a position of relative dominance during the past few hundred years. Unfortunately, his assertions rely on numerous glaring omissions and flawed assumptions that really undermine his credibility. The existence of peanuts is one notable example that will be easily understood by those who've read the book. Those who haven't should do themselves a favor and skip ahead to L. Ron Hubbard.
0061120081|5.0|The New York Times feels that over the last twenty-five years the most influential book has been Toni Morrison's Beloved, over the last fifty years perhaps Ann Ryands Atlas Shrugged  or Harper Lee's To Kill a Mocking Bird.  First of the 5-6 different editions available to read on Amazon  provide the best print and paper so its easy to physically read and wears well so it will last the test of time.  This latter point is important for those who wish our young children to read the books of your own library.  I have only recently read this Pulitzer prize winning novel and was pleasantly surprised. It  a story of two young children (Scout and Jem) of the local towns best lawyer (Atticus Finney).  The novels story unveils itself with typical young children events the next door neighbors who never comes out of his home and perhaps the highlight is when the children notice the town dog acting like he has rabies and although beloved to the town they know he needs to be contained.  Then Atticus a benevolent educated family man who in his younger years was the best marksman in the county shots down the town well loved dog and then bury's him.  The plot continues with a African American with a deformed left arm is accused of raping a poor white young lady by her father.  A trial unfolds were the blacks are segregated from the white in the stands of the courtroom.  There are a few stories dramatically emphasizing the unjust discrimination that Blacks experienced during the mid Depression years (story takes place in 1935).  He is found guilty and then the story takes off with the juxtapositioning Good and Bad and the payment of the evil things we do in life, how they can suddenly right themselves.  It is a short masterpiece some 319 pages perfect for young children in 4th or 5 th grade.  \\"You can shoot all the Blue Jays you want but remember its a sin to kill a Mocking Bird\\" is the famous quote from the novel.
B000Y7U98C|3.0|I really did was expecting more from the film's Director, accordingly to the creativity and originality he showed off in [[ASIN:6304806442 Trainspotting]] and [[ASIN:B00005JMA8 28 Days Later (Widescreen Edition)]]. Unfortunately, there is nothing special about this film, not surprisingly it didn't do well in the box office. The storyline is weak and the main plot is completely lacking originality, something goes wrong with the spaceship/hardware and the mission objectives get jeopardized and crew members begin to die.<br /><br />Sunshine follows a very similar plot as any of the best modern sci-fi outer space movies, like a tidy collage. The realism, scientific accuracy, minute detail and slow pace of first half seem inspired in [[ASIN:B00005ASUM 2001 - A Space Odyssey]] and its [[ASIN:B00004VVN8 2010: The Year We Make Contact]] sequence, the 2002 version of [[ASIN:B00009ATIX Solaris]], through [[ASIN:B00003CWU3 Mission To Mars]] and [[ASIN:B00003CX44 Red Planet]]. The suspense and thrill presented in the second half of the film seem inspired in the sci-fi horror movies [[ASIN:B00011V8IQ Alien (The Director's Cut)]] and [[ASIN:6305222916 Event Horizon]], with short segments even feeling like d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. The relaxing Earth room looks borrowed from the Star Trek Next Generation series. Also good old ingredients are present, a bit of philosophy, a bit of religion and spirituality, and the typical moral and ethical questions raised in all the outer space movies listed above.<br /><br />One specific feature of Sunshine is the emphasis on the psychology of the characters, with a space crew made of very contrasting personalities, from the super rational alpha male engineer to the very emotional pilot female. For a space crew with a critical mission to safe all life on Earth, and in the context of a hard sci-fi movie, this lack of homogeneity looks weird, as it only appears to serve as a dramatic device at critical turning points of the plot. Despite this strong psychological characterization, nearing male-chauvinism, there are several inconsistencies, and the on near the end is particularly annoying, when one of the most rational crew members, the genius physicist, does not follow the most logical course of action, and by not warning the others right away, he unnecessarily puts in risk the mission and the life of his fellow crew members. Again, only for dramatic purposes such a behavior would make any sense.<br /><br />Now, on the positive side, the film's technical quality is good; the space scenery is very realistic, the film takes full advantage of the capabilities of computer generated imagery (CGI). Flawless in the hard part of the science fiction, every detail regarding physics was well taken care of, even reproducing the auroras in the shadow part of the spaceship during repairs.<br /><br />From the point of view of hard science fiction, the only really original segment of the movie is at the ending, regarding how relativity effects would have any consequence on the final task, as the stellar nuclear bomb-spaceship is accelerated by the Sun mass, taking it closer and closer to the speed of light. I found the choice very clever. However, never mind that no material on Earth would be able to support the ultra high plasma temperatures encountered when dipping into the Sun, nor the fact of any crew member surviving the crushing caused by the enormous acceleration, well, is science fiction after all.<br /><br />A film recommended mainly for space buffs and sci-fi fans, particularly the ones who like the hard sci-fi genre.psychological characterization, nearing male-chauvinism, there are several inconsistencies, and the on near the end is particularly annoying, when one of the most rational crew members, the genius physicist, does not follow the most logical course of action, and by not warning the others right away, he unnecessarily puts in risk the mission and the life of his fellow crew members.

0316143472|5.0|I have been a David sedaris fan for several years and I loved thsi new book as well! He has a way of making the mundane simply hilareous. I read this novel on a cross-country plane ride and I riotously laughed out loud. My seat-mates thought I was quite insane. This is a must read!!
1594481938|5.0|Another New Year's Eve, another party...another group of four people who meet unexpectedly on the rooftop of a building they've all trekked out to so they can kill themselves.    I read the back-cover synopsis and went \\"What?!\\" out loud in the bookstore. (Though I don't recommend doing this, as people stare.) This could have been such a grisly novel, but not with Hornby. I devoured this book and loved every page. He tells the story, through four different perspectives, of an unlikely group of misfits who are desperate and unhappy with their lives, and meet each other on a rooftop. They've each come here for suicide, but they end up with so much more than they had planned on. It's darkly comic, without feeling dark. It's imaginative and creative, without exploiting the characters for the sake of an extra laugh. Hornby takes gruesome subject matter and, in his inimitable style, treats it with humanity, compassion, and humour. His characters are so real, and I laughed out loud many (many!) times. You relate with each on some level.    This is a great read, and classic Hornby. He's a master of fiction -- truly good, truly funny fiction -- and with this novel, he will not leave you disappointed.
B000LPS4BG|4.0|This is one of my favorite mob movies of all-time.  The acting is great, as well as the direction.  Martin Scorsece is a genius!  As for the blu-ray release of this movie, I find that the picture and sound have greatly improved from the DVD version.  It's also nice to not have to flip the disc over to finish watching the movie.   I would definitely recommend this release to any new or old fans of the movie.  Enjoy!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|This album is a garish, loud time capsule for what will be 2008.  An amalglam of throwback sounds and robotic futuristic tones.  The consensus of this album is as usual...mixed... hate it or love it, someones going to love this album.  The work on it is cold, danceable, and on repeated listenings fantastic.  I personally love all the tracks here.  The producers fill the tracks with little quirks, noises, beats, and blips to make any dance fan go crazy and there's nothing wasted here.  The highlights for me are \\"Incredible\\", \\"Spanish Lesson\\", \\"Candy Shop\\" (which I thought was mixed incorrectly at first...no bass hits whatsoever), \\"Heartbeat\\" and \\"Beat Goes On\\".  These songs are all pitch perfect and are another great addition to Madonna's ever changing repetoire.  I see all the haters out there as usual, listening to samples and acting like they bought the record. I heard it pre-release and was into it.  I'm a music junkie...unless you want me to listen to and like bands like Daughtry or Nickelback (Ick.) or something I just can't relate to at all (like Neal Diamond or Barry Manilow.) and have to give anything a chance.  The only major offense to me about this album is the Garish, disgusting cover.  I had the same problem with Janet Jackson's Discipline...hideous and wet...but it to was an amazing piece as well...I believe that Madonna will continue to do as she pleases because she is a headstrong woman who's been around the block of the music business for a long time.  She won't care about reviews, and she knows that fans will enjoy this as much as she probably did making it.  And to quote the queen herself...\\"Get Stupid, Don't stop it...see my booty get down like uhhh.\\" Classic...
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Wall-E is an experience that is rarely found in a \\"kids'\\" movie. On the surface, the film is beautifully constructed, has fantastic sound, and has neat and crazy little robots. Deeper than that is a conflict between role dependence and autonomy. Ironically, the automatons are the ones who teach the humans in the story to expand beyond their programming.     The first half of the movie follows Wall-E through his daily life and how he's a robot who has evolved the ability to think, explore, and wonder. Most of the second half of the movie explores how short-sighted humans have left the Earth covered in garbage and retreated to a superstore-sponsored spaceship where robots care for them like infants. These humans are absorbed in a self-centered culture of cell-phones and meaningless entertainment, and are completely devoid of drive to think for themselves, explore, or become more than what they are. Naturally, the course of the movie leads Wall-E to inspire the humans to overcome their social programming of constant entertainment and mindless consumerism and take back control of their destiny.     The foundation of the movie is a love story founded on Wall-E's undying devotion to a swanky I-Pod-esque robot named Eve, and reminds us that love is one of the most potent forces of change in the universe.    Wall-E the movie is just as inspiring as the robot himself, and it holds a fantastic message.

B001CC7PPI|5.0|Rear Window is considered by many Alfred Hitchcock's best movie.  The story suited him well.  A man confined to a wheelchair, watching things that may be innocent or murderous, a beautiful woman out of her element, in danger, with gradually building suspense that takes a potentially fatal turn as we watch helplessly with our immobilized protagonist, and a cliffhanger climax.  The movie has been analyzed by very smart people looking for much more than that, deeper meanings and allusions, and some of their ideas are true, and some are fun.  But it's the basic story elements, sharp dialogue, fine acting and the direction of a master that make it a great movie.<br /><br />The immobilized man is \\"Jeff\\" Jeffries (James Stewart), a Life Magazine photographer who's laid up in his New York City apartment with a broken leg.  Accustomed to an active life of adventure and world traveling, he's reduced to passing his time using binoculars and a telephoto lens to spy on the small world of neighbors across a small courtyard from his rear window.  The beautiful woman is his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), a high society woman whom he is avoiding marrying on the excuse that she isn't cut out for his rambling life of action and danger, and he doesn't want to settle down.  As events across the way take a potentially sinister turn, the tables are turned as Lisa shows her grit in risky investigations while Jeff must remain passive.  Raymond Burr (of Perry Mason fame) plays the suspect neighbor who may or may not have killed someone.  Thelma Ritter is Jeff's house-call nurse who also gets involved.<br /><br />Most of the film is presented from Jeff's powerless perspective, giving the suspense an extra edge.  There are allusions to impotence and, through the lives of the neighbors, a range of romantic and marriage relationships mirroring the fears of many men and women, including our protagonists.  Much has been made of the theme of voyeurism, the window as a representation of the movie screen and so on, though I think it's easy to make too much of that.  Screenwriter John Michael Hayes and Hitchcock work in the usual Hitchcock cameo and humor, including a dog who \\"knew too much\\" (a reference to another Hitchcock film).<br /><br />The new 2-disc Special Edition DVD looks to be an excellent set.  It will include new special features:<br /><br />-- audio commentary by John Fawell, author of Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film<br />-- Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master<br />-- Hitchcock/Truffaut interview excerpts<br />-- Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock<br />-- Alfred Hitchcock Presents Mr. Blanchard's Secret<br />-- original theatrical trailer<br /><br />There will also be features carried over from the 2001 Collector's Edition:<br /><br />-- Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary (55 minutes)<br />-- A Conversation with Screenwriter John Michael Hayes (13 minutes on the Collector's Edition)<br />-- 1983 re-release trailer for Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble With Harry, Rope, and Rear Window, narrated by James Stewart (6 minutes)<br />-- production photographs<br />-- production notes<br /><br />There's no mention in the press release of the screenplay feature that was on the older DVD.

It will include new special features:    -- audio commentary by John Fawell, author of Hitchcock's Rear Window: The Well-Made Film  -- Pure Cinema: Through the Eyes of the Master  -- Hitchcock/Truffaut interview excerpts  -- Breaking Barriers: The Sound of Hitchcock  -- Alfred Hitchcock Presents Mr. Blanchard's Secret  -- original theatrical trailer    There will also be features carried over from the 2001 Collector's Edition:    -- Rear Window Ethics: An Original Documentary (55 minutes)  -- A Conversation with Screenwriter John Michael Hayes (13 minutes on the Collector's Edition)  -- 1983 re-release trailer for Vertigo, The Man Who Knew Too Much, The Trouble With Harry, Rope, and Rear Window, narrated by James Stewart (6 minutes)  -- production photographs  -- production notes    There's no mention in the press release of the screenplay feature that was on the older DVD.  It allowed you, using a DVD-ROM drive, to read the script while watching the movie, or to print out the script.  (The script is available online now.)    The picture will be in the original 1.66:1 widescreen format, anamorphic, with the original mono sound.    No announcement for a Blu-ray edition yet.
0452289963|5.0|Tolle's work continues to have both appeal and value.  Those of us who are familiar with this type of reading can always benefit from Tolle's insightful approach. For those who are somewhat new to this type of reading, Tolle is a wonderful place to begin.  As the author of The Wings of Possibility, I applaud Tolle for offering his readers information that has depth and true quality that leads to growth and transformation.
B000CNE092|5.0|I love Anastasia and the digitically remastered version makes everything stand out and capture your heart as if you were watching it for the very first time.  And if you ARE watching it for the very first time -- you're in for a treat.  =)

The pictures are great and she always  carefully gives you step by step, I have not done transfer but will try it now.  For beginners start with her earlier books, then move on to this book.
B000XA5K48|5.0|I was rather dissapointed with how this movie performed in theatres, but I know it was an excellent action flick.    It's honestly the perfect action movie to shut the brain off to and enjoy the heck out of and I know my shooting movies!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|I have enjoyed all of Coldplay's works (CD's).  However, this is the first time I am reviewing any of them because I feel this one is outstanding, over-the-top and in a sense, new ground.    Many groups seem to subscribe to self-imposed borders.  They put out new material, but stay within certain \\"sound\\" styles they create to distinguish them from everyone else (it makes them easily recognizable and keeps their audience safely on board).  That's understandable and in many ways a good thing.    This album is nicely rhythm driven (Eno's influence is superb) and I love the way the whole thing flows.  Even though there are familiar sonic textures, I would say this CD is Something New and Coldplay is evolving nicely in my opinion.  I highly recommend this CD!  Eno and Coldplay are a marriage made in heaven!

B000002AGN|5.0|This is in response to the one star reviewer 'Ivan' who decided to use 5 or 6 feeble lines to vent his personal disgust of the Brubeck Quartet in a primitive, offensive manner as if it had any merit outside his own lack of true discernment and taste  by calling them less than 'worthless' and 'liquid sugar.'<br /><br />First of all, you did not offer any valid or even sensible reasons for your 'opinion' and no coherent argument for hating and taking a dump on one of the most well-liked and highly-regarded jazz groups of all time. All you managed to blab out was that it's 'sugary' or 'liquid sugar.'  Well, compared to what?  The amount of sweetness someone wants in their coffee or music is a personal taste and some take no sugar at all but there certainly is a general area most people agree on that constitutes too much sweetness, is there not? And what's nauseating 'sweetness' in music then? Too much melody of an obvious, non-refined, non-sophisticated, predictable and cliched kind that's not counterbalanced by other elements within the same composition?<br /><br />Well, having listened to the music of most of the jazz players of that era and beyond many, many times over the last 25 years, I'd say that the Brubeck Quartet with Desmond is definitely melodic and sweet but rarely exceeding one or one-&-a-half teaspoons of sugar which, furthermore, is always one of many ingredients in a nutritious, gourmet dish of full-bodied flavor and never there simply to make 'liquid sugar' or candy bars or even fancy gourmet pastry or dessert.<br /><br />Now, less than two teaspoons of sugar, maybe that's still way too much for Mr. Jack-Daniels-in-his-Black-Coffee Wiccan Ivanhoe lumberjack-Outdoorsman over there but for most people it's a pleasant sweetness. When the Brubeck Quartet exceeds two-teaspoons and becomes too 'sugary' it's usually on a standard and not on the Brubeck or Desmond original compositions which all of 'Time-Out' happens to consist of. Desmond is definitely deliberately and tastefully melodic, sometimes a little too much so but he's also a virtuoso, a master musician who can play anything but rarely chooses to show off, whose number one priority is to be at all times, come hell-or-high-water, the KING of laid-back understatement, the master of cool, no matter what tempo or complicated meter he's soloing over (for an even better demonstration than the superb solos on \\"Time Out\\" people should check out his mind-blowing zen-master laid-back solo on the volcanically propelled odd-meter tune Eleven-Four on The Brubeck Live At Carnegie Hall album). No one understates like Desmond and that balances out and more than makes up for the occasional over-indulgence in melody or 'sweetness' that still rarely exceeds two teaspoons. Stan Getz is often much sweeter on his bossa nova albums but because the bossa tunes are much more melancholy and downbeat, the bitterness balances out the sweet to make an artful statement.<br /><br />Desmond is also always balanced out by the deliberately percussive and polyrhythmic approach of Brubeck who has one of the greatest rhythm sections in jazz in Morello and Wright to work against. Just the complexity of compositions alone and the masterful improvisations within that structure should be enough for anyone who understands how difficult it is to play with such control and tightness and telepathic interplay and stay 'cool' despite it all to be in awe of this group. Trying to pigeon-hole and dismiss the Brubeck Quartet as nothing but 'liquid sugar' is lke saying Renoir wasn't a great artist or less of an artist than Picasso because he didn't paint unhappy subjects.<br /><br />Alas, there is a problem, a certain deep cynicism people have been conditioned with that has nothing to do with true musical merit but which makes them dislike bands like Brubeck or Pat Metheny, whose very popularity fuels the fire against them. The thing that some people tend to confuse with too much 'sweetness' and hold against the Brubeck Quartet is that they are UPBEAT and NON-CYNICAL and cynicism and a certain down-beat, depressed, fed-up-with-it-all attitude seem to be the ultimate requirement of jazz-music to those people. Less immediately hummable melody does tend to go with those other states but so what? Since when was it a requirement for your cynicism to show in your art for it to be considered worthy?  So, yes, if you want cynicism and misanthropy and depression being wallowed in and overcome, sometimes magnificently so, definitely go elsewhere but if you want music that is happily transcendent and soaring just for the sake of soaring, flying like a bird, not ignoring but rising above all negativity and floating, then the Brubeck Quartet is the ULTIMATE band for that.<br /><br />And did I mention that they are the EPITOME or ultimate musical expression of what it really means to be an American at its best, or what the real American personality is like or at least used to be like at its best? Yes, the very American vibe exemplified by famous personalities like James Garner, Jimmy Stewart, John Wayne, Cary Grant, Bill Cosby, Andy Griffith, Rosalind Russell, Clark Gable, Myrna Loy, Carole Lombarde, Jack Lemmon, Bob Newhart, Henry Fonda, Peter Fonda, Steve McQueen, George Clooney, Diane Keaton, even Jack Nicholson. Generally friendly, non-cynical, forward-looking, kind and forgiving with ample reserves and not worrying too much about ending up anybody's fool. I know, you're going to say that that breed is now extinct but why should America-at-its-best be extinct or considered a naive state of being while America-at-its-worst is being trumpeted out every media outlet of the propaganda ministry bought-and-paid-for by the already entrenched establishment and state? (Most of my reviews include ruminations about the connections of art and politics, so if you don't think that politics and art are connected you should stop reading now). Yes, make no mistake about it, the Brubeck Quartet is the key to Americans re-discovering the best in themselves, hence its undying popularity. And it was for this very quality that the US State Department hired them and cynically used them to do \\"goodwill\\" tours of places as far-off as Turkey, Pakistan, India, even Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq while other agencies of the same government were busy supporting their installed dictators and such. I'm sure the Brubeck Quartet themselves saw nothing but the positive in being 'ambassadors' of art and I'm certainly not implying they were blind. So, my question to myself was: where did the non-hypocritical, honest aspects of all that in-retrospect 'hypocritical' goodwill go? Wherever it went in day-to-day-life, the genie's in the bottle on Brubeck albums. All it takes is one spin of \\"Time Out\\" or \\"Brubeck Live At Carnegie Hall\\" for it all to come back, in peak symbolic manifestation, radiant and untarnished by untempered actions and psychotic irrationality, heralding not hypocricy and a veil for charlatans and double-dealers but honest-to-goodness, actual Americans of goodwill, the Thomas Jeffersons, Lysander Spooners, Andrew Jacksons, Henry David Thoreaus, Henry Fords, Charles Lindberghs, Ezra Pounds, Eustace Mullinses, Jeff Renses, Michael Tsarions, Dennis Fetchos, Michael Riveros, Simon Shacks, Charles Giulianis, Daryl Bradford Smiths & Wilfred Trotters of the world, people you can pretty much trust with your life.

B000AYEL6U|5.0|I absolutely love this movie!  I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys period dramas.  Richard Armitage is extra \\"swoon worthy\\" in this picture.
B000002VCU|4.0|I was talking with a co-worker about the Alan Parson's Project the other day and this album title came up. I remember as a teen loving this album for some reason (I think it had to do with the use of stereophonic sounds that were interesting to me at the time). I actually 'pirated' this album off of the radio as a teen when KMEL in San Francisco was an awesome rock station. Of course there were some commercials I tried to edit, but it still sounded great on the Ampex cassette tape I put it on. I wore it out, then moved to England and didn't replace the album until now.  I still enjoy it, but some of the music does seem dated for today. Oh, well, guilty pleasures....
B0011TQLA2|4.0|I'm an old-guard Radiohead fan from the Pablo Honey days, but had lost track of them in more recent years. Once the publicity hit about Radiohead selling their latest album for whatever price you want to pay, I jumped on the chance to support a non-traditional music distribution idea.    At first, the album took some getting used to. Since I had not been exposed to the band's more electronic phase, that was new. Also, some of the lyrics were a bit hard to understand. But after a few listens, the lyrics became clear and I came to appreciate the cleverness of several of the songs, both in their lyrical content and economy of sound.    I paid 10 pounds for the album, and I feel it was worth every penny. Months later, it's still in heavy rotation on my iPhone.
0618918248|5.0|For many years I have dwelled snugly (smugly?) with the idea of being Agnostic.  Dawkins had me convinced in the first 3 chapters that there actually IS evidence of the non-existance of a personal god.  He inspired me to read further.  I read the bible again, and it can't stand up against his arguments.  How enlightening!  I find it hard to believe that millions of people still believe in the old superstitions of fear, guilt and slavery, when there is so much scientific evidence to free them.
B000XV6VOK|5.0|It is too bad that Season 2 went so quickly but TV is not geared to longevity. We, as a nation, suffer from \\"short attention span syndrome\\".  The fact is that this has become one of Showtime's biggest hits is to be applauded by those of us who value TV with style and intelligence. Who knew that there were millions of Tudor history fans out there on planet Earth? If you don't believe me, check out Wiki's \\"The Tudors\\" web-site for enormous amounts of information about the series and Tudor history; volumes of comments from viewers and members of this Wiki site. One caveat is, better know you Tudor history stuff or you bum will be severely kicked. This group doesn't mess around.     Season 2 is as fabulous as Season 1 but it carries a much stronger political and sinister undercurrent. The young royals are growing up and Henry is at the head of the pack. The writers have really made an effort to produce a more historically accurate storyline and it shows. Jonathan Rhys-Myers is a fantastic Henry. He has nailed Henry's personality so well that it's positively goosebumpy as you view the frightening character of the real Henry emerging; creepy, piggy, obsessive, mean-spirited and in serious need of anger management. The intensity is all there and JRD really grows Henry's character as the story unfolds. Who cares if he doesn't look a jot like the real Henry VIII?     The costumes are beautiful and interesting-- Tudor with a twist--the actors all all wonderful: Peter O'Toole (very popish), Jeremy Northam (playing Sir Thomas Moore), Henry Cavill (Henry's buddy and major eye candy), Natalie Dormer (the complex and compelling Anne Boleyn), Maria Doyle Kennedy (supurbly displaying Catherine of Aragon's strength-of-character), Nick Dunning (a very creepy father to Anne) and James Frain (the evil Cromwell) are all wonderfully cast as are the others not mentioned here.    I pine over the loss of Anne Boleyn. It is really too bad that we will all be deprived of Natalie Dormer's fabulous portrayal of Anne--her character really anchored the first two seasons of this series and hopefully her successors will be able take her place. Ms. Dormer's fans will truly miss her, but there is no doubt that this series will do great things for her career.  She is absolutely beautiful, graceful, passionate and riveting on screen from the moment you see her capturing Henry's attention (at the command of her nasty, greedy, social-climbing and pitiless father) to the last tragic and poignant episode--which, I can guarantee, will have you shedding tears for the tragic fate of Anne Boleyn-- the woman who grabbed the chance that fate put in her path and almost made it hers.    Season 3 will cover Jane Seymour and Anne of Cleves. (They were already filming in Ireland a few months ago). I look at this season as potentially the weakest as Jane doesn't live very long and Anne gets royally dumped. So hopefully this will leave the fans a Season 4 to cover the naughty Katherine Howard and seasoned Katherine Parr before Henry goes to meet his maker---one can only hope that he got what he deserved in eternal life. My hope is that the series migh evolve and carry through to Edward Tudor, Mary Tudor and Elizabeth I, but that is probably hoping for too much.    It's a pleasure to watch such a great series and such great actors; one that doesn't pander poo to the lowest common denominator. Intelligent scripts, good historical details and a riviting cast make Season 2 a real winner. I really am missing Sunday nights with that dynastically dysfunctional family.
0061091480|4.0|I'd heard Your Erroneous Zones, one of Wayne Dyer's earliest books (published in 1976), mentioned many times. Yet despite this, despite the fact that it is a book that has sold over 30 million copies and is considered one of the best-selling books of all time, and despite loving other newer books of Wayne's, I only very recently picked up a copy of Your Erroneous Zones to read.    I like to read authors' books in the order in which they were written, if I can (not always possible, especially with someone like Wayne, who is a prolific writer!). I do this where possible though as I like seeing the development of an author's thoughts around a topic. In this case, however, it was interesting to go back, especially so far back (pretty much to the beginning of Wayne's writing career!). While Wayne's later books are much more focused on spirituality, Your Erroneous Zones is much more of a standard personal development book. It is also written in a more formal tone that dates it to the 1970s ;). Neither of these detracts from the power of the book - it is clear and inspiring in its message to stop worrying, stop feeling guilty and replace these \\"erroneous zones\\" with a more empowered way of living.    The book covers a range of topics, diverse yet connected in that growth in one area has a spill-over effect into other areas. Topics addressed include self-acceptance, approval seeking behaviour, guilt, worry, procrastination, anger, and becoming independent. Sprinkled throughout the book are also exhortations to live in the present moment, predating Eckhart Tolle's work on the topic, although not giving much as much information on this specifically. Each chapter discusses one of the \\"erroneous zones\\" in detail, giving examples of how each zone manifests itself in daily life to make it easy to recognise when you are displaying ineffective behaviour, as well as providing strategies for overcoming and eliminating the ineffective behaviour and replacing it with a much more effective way of being and doing. Because of the interconnectedness of all the topics discussed, there is a fair amount of repetition of strategies for eliminating the erroneous zones, only slightly different for each behaviour. Rather than this being annoying, I found it quite comforting to know that the strategies could be distilled into a few basic principles, although I would have liked to see the book itself pull this together (I guess I have to do some work though, right?!).    The final chapter of Your Erroneous Zones is a portrait of a person who has eliminated all erroneous zones and is living an emotionally, mentally and spiritually healthy life. It was interesting to read through this chapter to see how I'm doing compared to Wayne's ideal. Luckily, for myself, I found that I displayed many effective behaviours already! I was also able to identify those that I'm still personally working with - rather than beating oneself up over not meeting the ideal, this is an excellent opportunity to see what effective behaviour would look like, and hence to identify areas of further growth.    Would I recommend that you read this book, given that it was written over 30 years ago? Yes, I would. It is a classic in the personal development genre, and it still feels relevant today. If you're looking for a fairly no-nonsense approach to development, then this book is for you!
B000ICL3KG|1.0|This entire Global Warming movement will go down in history as the ultimate hoax of all time. Carbon does NOT cause global warming and only comprises .054% of the Earth's green house gases. That's less than a single percent. Man can only effect 9% of that .054%. It's all a lie to turn on the carbon tax system which will redistribute wealth, exterminate the blacks in Africa, and give total and utter power to the Elite. Watch \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\" to see a real piece of scientific fact.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|One of the two albums that made 1978 *the* watershed year in rock music (see also, The Cars).  Sure, The Ramones turned things upside down in '76 with their first album (and thank god for that), but they were (a) almost completely ignored at the time, and (b) treading the path that the Dolls and Dics had blazed.  Somehow, though, 1978 saw the birth of both new wave (Cars) and new (neu?) metal, and people paid attention, buying these albums in droves.  (When was the last time that two new, different genres emerged at the same time?)  Not only were Van Halen way cooler than any other \\"metal\\" band at the time (sorry Buck -- the mustache was totally Members Only, no matter how much one loved the drum solo in \\"Godzilla\\"), but they were heavier when they wanted to be (\\"Eruption\\"), more melodic (everything else), and funnier (\\"Ice Cream Man\\").  Plus, they covered a Kinks classic at a time when no one could remember the Kinks, and in so doing, made the song their own.  In a single album they established (1) a new sub-genre of rock, (2) a new guitar god, and (3) a new front-man personality/celebrity.  Heady stuff for four goobs from LA.  One of the 25 best rock albums of all time.  Five stars.
B0012Q732O|2.0|This movie was so boring. THe trailors for it made it SEEM like it had an interesting story line. NOT! Just plain boring.I was so glad when it was over. Can be viewed by the whole family but am not recommending it to be watched by anyone.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is still a great record after more than 30 years. It is the album that really launched punk music. Although the Sex Pistols were not really the first punk band, they were definitely one of the first and they were also the ones who really put punk on the map.<br /><br />This record above all has some great music -- much better than a lot of the punk that followed it. It's not just guitar distortion, crashing drums and shouting by any means. The songs almost all have strong melodies with memorable hooks that grab you from the start. (The only real exception is \\"New York\\", which I still wouldn't recognize in a lineup today, although I've heard it hundreds of times.)<br /><br />Steve Jones' guitar playing is remarkably tight, and really is brilliant in many places. His style is minimalist, but you don't immediately notice that through the power and distortion. Where he does use flourishes, they are melodic and memorable.<br /><br />Johnny Rotten (now John Lydon), the vocalist, creates a thoroughly misanthropist persona simply using his voice -- the sound says \\"I hate everything.\\" He created the mold for most punk singers after him, including a way of delivery phrasing that lets you know he doesn't care what you or anyone else thinks.<br /><br />The Sex Pistols were far from a perfect band. Image got in the way of the music quite a lot -- in part because the project was launched by Malcolm McLaren, who wanted a band out there that would let him sell more clothes at his London shop, called \\"Sex\\", dealing in what would become punk fashion.<br /><br />Unfortunately for the band, the image obsession and the desire of Johnny Rotten to change the balance of power in the band led them to replace Glen Matlock, who could actually play his bass and who also played a key songwriting role, with Sid Vicious, who had little musical ability. But Sid looked appropriately nasty, and didn't have Matlock's feathered, Bay City Rollers-style hair. In the end, Vicious proved to be a disaster, and he met a disastrous end.<br /><br />Fortunately none of that really interferes with this record -- Matlock plays bass on much of it, and where he doesn't, guitarist Steve Jones fills in. No Sid here.<br /><br />It would be a mistake to view this album as relevant to punk alone. This album changed everything, including the music business itself. The attitude and some of the fashion ideas of punk were very soon domesticated and repackaged into New Wave, which very quickly turned into the industry mainstream.<br /><br />So without the revolution brought by Sex Pistols, we would not have had most of the music that drove the late 1970s and 1980s -- the Police (and later Sting), U2, Duran Duran, the B-52s, etc etc. In a very real sense, \\"Never Mind the Bullocks\\" set the stage on which the musical background of the entire Reagan Era was played out.<br /><br />The Sex Pistols were one of the great paradigm shifts, up there with Elvis, the Beatles and Grandmaster Flash in changing music and the music industry. And this is their only real album of studio material.<br /><br />I saw the Sex Pistols in 2008 in a concert in Slovakia, of all places. They are very different today. Glen Matlock back on bass, still with his feathered hair. Steve Jones was bearing baggy khaki pants and a t-shirt, and Lydon, in chi pants and a collarless button-down shirt, has been completely transformed. He no longer hates everybody and everything, but actually seems to really enjoy himself and to genuinely like people in his own \\"in your face\\" way. He pulled up his shirt, waved his naked paunch at us like a belly dancer and told us: \\"We love ya.\\" This was not the Pistols of 1977.<br /><br />I say this just to point out that the people on this record, who seem to make nastiness and destruction their livelihood, are warm and fuzzy middle-aged guys today.

B00168ML1G|3.0|A decent movie but nothing to RAVE about. It has a nice story line but too many holes. I didn't find it to be such a GREAT movie though. Just average would be my description.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is hard.  But like Jillian says, \\"it's not coming for free.\\"  The thing I love most is the fact that I can be done in less than a half hour and I'm sweating more than I have when I've worked out for hours.  Even when I feel like quitting ('cause I do) I tell myself, you just have a couple more minutes.  And even if I'm tired at night and I haven't done it yet, I'll take the 20-ish minutes and just do it.  That wouldn't happen with a 40-60 minute DVD.  I wish people would stop making DVD's that you have to watch the little intro at the beginning every time you put it in though.  Enough already!  I want to skip through it, especially after the 10th time I put it in.
B0019IB26I|5.0|I must confess that I don't have this CD but am planning to buy it. I was lucky enough to see John Mayer in concert last year and he is one of those musicians who are even better live. His voice is just as strong without digital enhancement and the guitarwork is amazing. I have most of his songs but can't wait to add this to my collection.
B000AI4K1W|5.0|I really enjoyed this book! It is a fun, easy read, great when I was feeling down and needed a pick me up. It (and the other books in the series) inspired me to learn to knit, which I love as well! Knitting is relaxing, a great de-stressor, and is good for my social life. I've always been a bit on the shy side, and knitting has been a good ice breaker, so I recommend both the books and learning to knit (preferably with a class!)    I passed this book on to my mother and grandmother after reading, and they both enjoyed it as well.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|Daniel Craig is the best Bond since Sean Connery. At first I was like but he doesn't look like a Bond. Well In the first five seconds I forgot all about that. He does a fantastic job playing the role. This is Bond's first mission and he plays the part perfectly. Bond loves, hates, and wants revenge. Something we have never seen Bond do, and i don't think anybody could have done it better. The story and everything about this movie is great. Stop reading this and go watch it.
B000WZAE1I|4.0|There is much to enjoy in the movie version of Stardust, both for those who've read Neil Gaiman's novel and those who haven't. I can understand why some fans of the novel are upset by the movie adaptation. A movie adaption can never be completely faithful to its literary source but the difference in endings is striking. The denouement in the book is quiet, surprisingly so. The climax of the movie revolves around a spectacular fight that has no parallel in the book. That said, however, I found the overall spirit of the movie faithful to the book. Tristran and Yvaine (played beautifully by Charlie Cox and Claire Danes) are much as I imagined them, as is the general atmosphere.

0316143472|2.0|I've loved Sedaris's other books, re-read them, bought the audio versions, seen him read in person, and listened to him on the radio. I pre-ordered this book.<br /><br />I set myself up for disappointment, though. Eventually everyone just misses, and now Sedaris has too. I once heard him say that his technique was to write every story at least six times to get it just right. The stories in this book feel like the stuff he didn't want to spend too much time on, though. They are often rambling, missing a beat, or cobbled together from disconnected anecdotes. It was a chore to make it through the book. Maybe it's the same Sedaris but he's not as novel as he was and I've developed immunity to his wit.<br /><br />If you're a Sedaris fan, you'll still need to read the book, but don't expect too much. You might enjoy it more that way.

0575081600|4.0|It probably goes without saying that Paul Sammon's book on Bladerunner is perhaps the definitive book on the making of, exhibition, revival, reversioning and publicity of one of the most influential science fiction films of the 20th century.  What started as a magazine article ended up becoming a love affair and tome that's now in its 2nd edition and released to coincide with the film's 25th anniversary.  Handsomely bound in hardback, this is indeed The Bladerunner bible for all fans or anyone who wants to appreciate (a) Ridley Scott (b) Philip Dick and (c) the Movie's unsung heroes and arduous route to being made.  Highly readable and thoroughly researched, you might have to be a slight Blade Runner junkie to appreciate this, and if you owned the first edition (as I did) - then this is a pretty worthy update.  Fortunately, I gave my old copy away (to some regret at the time) and now have this in my collection.  Even after finishing this book, one might feel that there's more to glean from the film and its participants.  Sammon does the affecianado a favour by mentioning other publications about the movie.  So, a good present for film critics, students and fans of the underappreciated and (once) overlooked sci-fi classic.<br /><br />Why this is on an import release is beyond me - strange!

0716703440|3.0|Sure this book is great, but what it really needs for self-study is a two volume companion book which lists all of the exercises with detailed solutions. Similar to the way _Problems in Real Analysis: A Workbook with Solutions_ by Charalambos D. Aliprantis is the companion book for the real analysis textbook _Principles of Real Analysis_ by the same author. There is a problem book for general relativity with solutions, but its approach is so different from that of _Gravitation_, that it is pretty useless as a companion book.

B000148KK2|3.0|I'm a jazz fan, and a big fan of Diana. I put off buying this CD for some time because none of the songs were familiar to me. Finally, I broke down and bought it. The songs are all in a blues vein, and not jazzy. If that suits your taste, then you'll like this CD. It's well done, but too downbeat for me.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz just keeps getting better!  This album is great!  I have had it on \\"loop\\" since I got it, and it never gets old.

B00139B39E|5.0|THE BAND: James LaBrie (vocals), John Petrucci (guitars), John Myung (bass), Jordan Rudess (keyboards), Kevin Moore (keyboards on 7 songs), Derek Sherinian (keyboards on 2 songs), Mike Portnoy (drums & percussion).<br /><br />THE DISCS: (2008) 22 songs on 2 discs clocking in at approximately 138 minutes (79+ minutes on disc-1, 58+ minutes on disc-2). Included with the discs is a 14-page booklet containing band photos, a 2-page intro regarding song choices from drummer Mike Portnoy, 4-pages of historic text about the band from author Rich Wilson who wrote DT's authorized biography (\\"Lifting Shadows\\"), and what songs came from which albums and year released. This compilation follows DT from 1992-2005. Remastered sound. Label - Atlantic / Rhino.<br /><br />ALBUM REPRESENTATION: Images And Words (3 songs), Awake (3), Falling Into Infinity (2), Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory (3), Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence (4), Train Of Thought (2), Octavarium (4), B-Side to \\"Lie\\" (1). No songs from DT's debut (with Charlie Dominici on vocals) When Dream And Day Unite (1989), A Change Of Seasons (1995), or Systematic Chaos (2007).<br /><br />COMMENTS: For me, this Dream Theater compilation has been a long time coming. With nine studio albums, why not put out a \\"Best Of\\" compilation? Though the band's music receives very little airplay... they've amassed a nice following in the world of progressive rock music. The musicians here are consummate pros at their instruments - Petrucci and Portnoy are Gods in their respective fields.<br /><br />THE GOOD: Most of the fan favorites are here in all their remastered glory - including \\"Pull Me Under\\" (the Hit), \\"Take The Time\\", \\"Another Day\\", \\"Lie\\", \\"Peruvian Skies\\", \\"As I Am\\", \\"Through Her Eyes\\", \\"Misunderstood\\", \\"The Root Of All Evil\\", \\"Solitary Shell\\", etc. To me, Disc-1 (the metallic side) rocks harder and shows off Petrucci's guitar (as the rest of the band tries to keep up with him (and of course they do). Disc-2 (the melodic side) is geared more toward the story being told, LaBrie's singing, and song structure.<br /><br />THE NOT SO GOOD: You can't tell from the back cover track listing, but once you open the liner notes you'll notice - 8 of the 22 songs are either edited versions or 2007 special 'remixes'. When I first opened the booklet and read this, the acid in my stomach began to rise and I cringed... another 'Greatest Hits' package marred by gimmicky studio tricks. After dozens of spins though, the slight changes in the songs are now somewhat acceptable, and the edited versions are not as bad as I thought (since so many of DT's songs are close to the double-digit number in minutes) - I'm okay with it. The 4 'remixes' are decent on the first few spins... but after weeks of listening, I find myself longing for the original studio versions. The drums (specifically the snare) on their remix of \\"Pull Me Under\\" sounds tinny and downright cheap. The song selection is very good. In my opinion, however, several classics are missing - \\"Caught In A Web\\", \\"The Mirror\\", \\"Metropolis (Part I)\\", \\"Fatal Tragedy\\", a great jam in the \\"Overature 1928\\" and \\"New Millennium\\" (the heaviest track from \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" - one of my personal favorites in their entire library). I totally dig the ultra crunchy marathon DT songs... of which the album \\"Train Of Thought\\" has many. My heart tells me that \\"Train Of Thought\\" is underrepresented here... however, with 5 of the 7 songs lasting 10 minutes or longer, I understand why more songs are not here. Skipping past all tracks from DT's debut is understandable, but I think a song or two from \\"Systematic Chaos\\" (2007) could have made it onto disc-2 with its 20+ minutes of unused space... perhaps their new label (Roadrunner Records) had something to do with that. Even a live track or two would have been a bonus here. And lastly, I wish the writing on the slim binder side of the cover was larger - my 20/20 vision can barely read the verbage from only a few feet away.<br /><br />OVERALL: A very good introduction to Dream Theater's music catalog despite some minor flaws. Like any decent mix, it's great to have so many wonderful songs all in one place. Looking for a single studio album to start with - I'd recommend \\"Images And Words\\" or \\"Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes From A Memory\\". As Mike Portnoy stated in the CD liner notes - this \\"Greatest Hit\\" collection is hopefully \\"something that will lure the listeners in and inspire them to dig deeper...\\" In my opinion, it should (4.5 stars).on to Dream Theater's music catalog despite some minor flaws.

B00007K02F|3.0|Jane Eyre is one of my most beloved classics.  Everyone has different tastes and takes on Bronte's wonderful literary work, so when offering my review on this adaptation to it, its of course based upon my opinion and perception.    For me this adaptation lacks Bronte's Jane Eyre on so many levels.    The romance is tepid.  The passion is lackluster.  The gothic feel you get when reading the book and following Jane through the dark halls of Thornfield Hall is totally nil here.  Having a dark room lit with candles doesn't constitute \\"goth.\\"  I don't recall a convincing scene of the budding romance either.      Mr. Rochester is a combination of so many extremes of emotion in the book.  He's funny, witty, mischievious, dark, brooding, tormented and quite the rascal - sometimes all within the same scene! William Hurt is none of the above in my opinion.     Jane in the book is quiet and reserved, but her mind is racing and moving with emotion and I just didn't buy that it was happening with Charlotte Gainsbourg's portrayal.  The book goes through extreme highs and lows which is why you can't put the book down once she meets Mr. Rochester. This adaptation never quite pulls that off and just flatlines for me from beginning to end.    My favorite version of Jane Eyre by far is the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clark version.  It is truly the book brought to life.  After that if pushed for second choice, it would have to be the more recent Masterpiece version.       83' Dalton/Clark version:    When watching the 83' Dalton version, AT FIRST you'll want to throw something at your TV because it is broken up into 30 minute episodes the way the series ran on television and is shown almost as a stage play.  But it doesn't take long to overlook the stagey feel of it because in filming it this way (whether intentional or not) you truly are transported into the dark ambience and mystery of Thornfield Hall. There are shadows at every turn and you find yourself becoming apprehensive as ifyou were walking those dark halls of echoing laughter along with Jane.     Also, a hearty pat on the back to the casting director of the 83' version for the absolute BRILLIANT casting of Timothy Dalton as the dark, passionate, poetic, tortured, mischievious and introspective soul that is Mr. Rochester. Charlotte Bronte would've been so proud!  He is no longer a character in a book when seeing this version because Timothy Dalton IS Mr. Rochester.   At first I couldn't understand the casting of Zelah Clark but was soon won over by her reserved but sharp portrayal and unearthly appearance.  She truly embodied Bronte's post-Helen Jane as she was able to assert herself without compromising her station and position the same way the book's Jane did. Her acting was incredible too because you felt her emotions as she went through stages of a wide-eyed developing crush, her attempts to supress her feelings for her superior, her fears of the mysteries of the dark hall, her pain when discovering the truth, her resolve not to rebel against her conscience, then following her heart.  Other more modern day Jane portrayals have been far too impertinent for Jane's position in that time period and way more experienced than a Jane whose life's experience consisted only of Gateshead and Lowood.  Bronte fans will truly appreciate and understand how this 25 year old version still stands the test of time.  You can literally open the book and follow it along and believe me, that is a good thing!  Bronte's beautifully written words are not at all lost in this version and Timothy Dalton's delivery is far superior to all Mr. Rochesters cast before or after him.      Masterpiece Theatre 2006    For a more overtly demonstrated \\"passion\\" that in my opinion defies the period and post Helen Jane, but is beautifully filmed is the Masterpiece Theatre version.  It takes quite the liberties with Jane's moral dilemmas. In some cases dismissing them altogether which when understanding the book's Jane, knows this changes who she is completely.  In this version, neither character really has to guess or question the other's feelings or motives the way you do in the book and the 83 version, thus not as suspenseful in my opinion. However, the actors (not necessarily Bronte's Jane and Mr. Rochester IMO) are still VERY good in spite of the rewritten material they were working with.      With all that said, this William Hurt version just doesn't do it for me - on any level.
0312360266|4.0|Ok, so I am absolutely addicted to this series, and I'm not really sure why. The plot is good and interesting, but there are a ton of flaws.  I really love vampire books: Twilight Series, Vampire Diaries, Anne Rice, whatnot. So when I got this I was pretty excited.  Within the first couple paragraphs, all I could think of was, \\"how cheesy, how typical\\". And then, it just got really confusing and dumb when she faints and then sees the Goddess, Nyx. I couldn't stand it, but, of course, I decided to go on thinking it would get better.   It actually did get a LOT better.  The only other complaints I have are the stereotypes. The gay guy Damien(of course he has the name Damien), the southern girl Stevie Rae(come on), the \\"popular girls\\" who are obviously slutty and mean.   Adding to that, I also hated how they represented the People of Faith. Hateful, snobby, rude.   The swearing and sex parts were just a little too much. I felt like I couldn't recommend the book, for fear of what people might have thought of me!  But, as I said, I am still oddly addicted to it...
B000MR9D5E|5.0|I was absolutely awed and amazed when I saw this for the first time. The way the filmmakers made it in separate parts of the globe, covering the landscape, seascape, and the animals within it made it more enjoyable to watch. The aerial shots are spectacular. Always gorgeous no matter where each part was filmed, the different parts of the world, the climates the world's creatures endure to survive and thrive in is both fascinating, breathtaking, and tragic. Nature can be beautiful, but also cruel, and the filming of this magnificent achievement shows it better than any nature film I've ever seen. I can't imagine anyone seeing this and not being spellbound. Highly, highly recommend!!!
B00005JAVO|5.0|There is a link between this English \\"heavy metal\\" group and the English progressive rock groups; as such, some progressive flourishes turn up here and there on this 1973 release.  In fact, their distinctive treatment of the blues makes the music on Houses of the Holy sound otherworldly and somehow ancient (like a lot of progressive rock) - this is certainly one of my favorite Led Zeppelin albums.<br /><br />The music on the Houses of the Holy presents a perfect balance of the thunderous hard rock aspects and the quieter, more contemplative moments (and there are a lot on this album). Pieces like The Rain Song with the soft mellotron pads, and the brooding, John Paul Jones led and synthesized bass - heavy No Quarter are both very pleasant. In addition, the acoustic textures on Over the Hills and Far Away also added a nice touch, along with unique interpretations of funk (The Crunge) and reggae (D Yer Mak er).  I also really enjoyed John Bonham's thunderous drumming, brilliant guitar playing by Jimmy Page, and of course Robert Plants electrifying vocal style. All together, these elements made for a very exciting listening experience.<br /><br />My decision to buy this remastered mini-LP version of the album was borne out of nostalgia alone.  In this respect, I was not disappointed - the CD features good sound quality and is enclosed in a mini-LP jacket that is a fine replica of my old LP.  Just a lot smaller.<br /><br />Highly recommended along with the 1969 debut, Led Zeppelin III and Physical Graffiti.
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|I read the book prior to watching the movie. I couldn't put the book down, it was phenomenal! So I thought...I must watch the movie when it comes out.  The movie was a major disappointment.  The acting was par, the character's stories were vague. All in all- Not so great.
B000UAE7RW|2.0|\\"Chinatown\\" was recently included on the AFI's Top 10 Mysteries list, and as it was the only film on the list that I hadn't seen, and I liked 8 of the 9 films that I had seen (sorry, I just didn't like \\"The Third Man\\"), I thought it would be worth giving it a try. I am now glad that I have seen this film, considering it is so highly regarded, but to say that this is the second greatest mystery movie of all time, and a better movie than \\"Rear Window\\", \\"Laura\\" and \\"Blue Velvet\\" (three of my favourite movies), is giving it far more credit than it deserves.     \\"Chinatown\\" starts off as your standard private detective film. Private investigator Jake Gittens (Jack Nicholson) is hired by a woman, claiming to be Evelyn Mulwray, to find out if her husband is cheating on her. What seems to be routine divorce work becomes more complicated when the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) shows up and her husband is found murdered. Gittens investigates and discovers an illegal money-making plot (which I won't give the details of, in order to avoid spoilers) and then something far more sinister.     Although both Nicholson and Dunaway are excellent actors (although, I believe that both have made better films), this film is let down by what I consider to be a second-rate script (an opinion which I will, no doubt, be criticized for, since it won Best Screenplay). Here is why I do not like this script: firstly, the film is called \\"Chinatown\\", but none of the characters actually go to Chinatown until about five minutes before the end of the film (and because of this, the final lines of the film just don't seem justified); secondly, the villain barely appears, which makes the revelation of his guilt completely unsatisfactory; but my biggest criticism of the film is that, to me, it felt like the writer had started writing one film, a murder mystery about drought-ridden LA, but three-quarters of the way through, lost interest in that and decided to write a completely different film instead.This leads to the final act of the film feeling hurried and crowded. I also found the ending, in general, to be unsatisfactory, for reasons that will become apparent if you see the film.    The AFI did a pretty good job in compiling their Top 10 Mysteries list, but as far as I'm concerned, \\"Chinatown\\" is the joker in the pack. I highly recommend that all mystery lovers watch the movies on this list (the movies are, in order: \\"Vertigo\\", \\"Chinatown\\", \\"Rear Window\\", \\"Laura\\", \\"The Third Man\\", \\"The Maltese Falcon\\", \\"North by Northwest\\", \\"Blue Velvet\\", \\"Dial M for Murder\\" and \\"The Usual Suspects\\"), but perhaps save \\"Chinatown\\" until last.
B000002UAI|4.0|This album is often regarded as a step down after the classic A HARD DAY´S NIGHT. It is a bit unfair comparison though. First of all, on AHDN the singles (\\"Can´t buy me love\\" and the title track with their respective B-sides) were included on the album. Second of all, AHDN only has 13 tracks while FOR SALE has 14. If you remove the 2 or 3 weakest tracks on FOR SALE and instead include \\"I feel fine\\" and \\"She´s a woman\\" you would have a more even album for sure.  And when judging Beatles´ albums one often misses the obvious fact that the fab 4 more or less rushed out their music during their whole career. They released 1 or 2 albums every year PLUS a lot of hit-singles that never were included on an album. Who could compete with that today?
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a wonderful movie... the kind that makes you feel along with the characters....   truly high quality that is so RARE these days.  I loved it and my husband did too!   Tears to both of our eyes!  How rare is THAT??!!!
B000002UB6|4.0|The fact that LET IT BE is considered a fiasco, says rather a lot about what standards we´re accustomed to by the Beatles. Many bands would have been proud of themselves presenting something like this. But I guess after SGT PEPPER and all the other albums this doesn´t impress much.  The title track, \\"The long and winding road\\", \\"Across the universe\\" and \\"Get back\\" are all classics. And the other songs are not too bad either, even if some of the performances sound a bit like outtakes.  LET IT BE was the last album the Beatles finished recording and maybe it was wise to end while still being able to put together classic songs.
B000002GXS|4.0|The Heart Of Saturday Night gets a curve. I'll knock it up a letter grade because it's about one of my favorite subjects: The night. Specifically, it's a grizzled ode to wakeful Americana, to nights spent unblinking among seedy bars, 24 hour diners, and twisting city streets. It's like Edward Hooper's Nighthawks set to music, a work of art too spooked and lonely to sleep. It's an aesthetic that brims with desolation, catharsis, bitterness, and humor. It's artful and poetic, and it's also hauntingly sad.     If it hadn't encapsulated that image so perfectly, this album would have received a paltry three and a half stars. It would've lost that star for its occasional bursts of melodrama, for its smattering of imperfect songs (\\"Shiver Me Timbers\\" is weighed down by cliches, and \\"(Looking For) The Heart Of Saturday Night\\" is far too hammy), for the fact that occasionally tries waaaay too hard. But these transgressions can be halfway forgiven thanks to the layers of smoke and booze and sourness that billow out of your speakers every time you play it.    Plus, no album with \\"New Coat Of Paint,\\" \\"San Diego Serenade,\\" \\"Semi Suite,\\" and some of \\"Drunk On The Moon\\" deserves to be slighted. Throw in two spectacular hipster beat poetry readings (\\"Diamonds On My Windshield\\" and \\"The Ghosts Of Saturday Night (After Hours At Napoleone's Pizza House)\\") and you've got yourself a faded-soul classic.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I first heard this CD many years ago, having stumbled upon it because of my love of New Age music.  It led to two memorable happenings in my life, and I am remembering them now, probably 10 years later:  I wanted to play their songs myself on our piano, and I couldn't find the sheet music anywhere.  From the internet, I found that it was available outside of the US.  A good friend has a sister who lives in Norway, and she was able to buy the sheet music there and mail it to me -- that was my first realization of how small the world is getting.      Another good friend and next-door-neighbor has a father who plays the violin. He's a gentle old man, and he would come from another state to visit his daughter's family.  He would sit for hours out in their yard playing wistful and beautiful tunes on his violin.  When I first heard Secret Garden's \\"Nocturne\\", my First Thought was that George would love this music.  I sent him a CD, and he wrote me the most heart-felt note about how their incredible music, and my thinking of him because of it, touched him deeply.  He is now in his 90s and I hope he is still listening.
055357342X|2.0|If you haven't started reading this series, it's fair to say that you shouldn't start. While the first two books are admittedly long winded, they are well done. That's what makes this third book such a tragedy. At some point in the third book one realizes that you've invested in a tragedy where perhaps only a few will survive. The only problem is that Shakespeare did it better in only a fraction of the pages. But there it is. By the time you get to the third book you feel obligated to continue, if only for a glimmer of hope to come through.     This is definitely the weakest book of the series so far and in some places even gets a bit repetitive (both sword duels reflect professional wrestling as the victors drop their guard momentarily after winning and are suddenly put down). Martin may argue that the large number of irked reviews for this book is somehow a positive, but he should remember it's not positive if people are telling each other to stay away. That I may not even be half way through this series after 3 books is what is truly tragic. Many are right to comment that it appears that the emperor has no clothes.     For a truly satifying experience, read Martin's short stories of Dunk, which take place at an earlier time within this world. Then move on to something else...before it's too late.
0321544080|1.0|I loved the book \\"The Digital Photography Book, Volume 2 \\" by Scott Kelby.  In his book he mentioned that \\"The Moment It Clicks\\" is the next book to purchase, so I followed thru and bought it.  Scott must be sharing a commission check by promoting the book.  I was expecting much more that I received.  No secrets revealed, no F stops or shutter speeds mentioned but plenty of boring story telling.  I didn't want a story book, I wanted a how-to book and this wasn't it.  Nice photos but now what.  How were they done?  No instruction.  Scott's recommendation was way off on this one.  Shame on him.

B0006ZFQNA|3.0|With all the hype about how Ms Berganza wanted to create an \\"authentic\\" Carmen (she deplored the stereotypical version of Spain that the opera has engendered) this is NOT the Carmen or Spain that Bizet envisioned!  She has a gorgeous voice but she is not sultry, sexy, or fiery.  This one doesn't really work although the sound is great and the other performances are extremely good.  BUT..............this has to be considered a disappointmment because she forgot the one person she should have been faithful to, and that person is Bizet! She is tame, tame, tame! She even sounds tame when she dies! She should have been Micaela instead of Carmen. I guess she thought the inner Carmen was more sensitive instead of lusty.   I was also put off by the spoken dialogue, even though I know Bizet composed it that way.  The dialogue is much too fast for the pace of the music itself.  Although I won't give this one away, I am still looking for another Carmen to go along with the de los Angeles version I have.

B000QUCNOK|5.0|I've read the book 'Perfume' by Patrick Suskind and was surprised at how well this adaptation was made. The visual imagery is amazing. This is the story of Jean-Baptiste Grunuis (Ben Whishaw), who has a super-human sense of smell but no natural body-odour of his own. He obsessively murders in order to capture the smell of women, whose scent he finds appealing, turning it into a perfume. The narrator, disturbingly, makes you sympathise with this cold-blooded killer and his twisted plan.

1552091090|5.0|I first received this book when my 10-year old son was a baby. From a mother's point of view, I love it. It is a very sweet story of how much a mother loves her child. For those of you who have given it a negative review, what I find disturbing is the fact that you seem to think this is based on a true story. You are taking it much too literally. It is a fictional book with fictional characters. Yes, if some of the things in the book actually happened in real life, it would be a little strange, but surely people with a PhD can figure out the intention of the author and the point he trying to make....a mother who loves her child unconditionally and a son who returns that love as his mother grows old.
B00003CXAT|3.0|Jurassic Park was a huge and successful movie when it was released in 1993 and I just a little kid back then but watching this blockbuster now, well this film has lost its luster and excitment. I really cannot watch this film ever again, it looks so cheap and silly now, Steven Spielberg's directing is overrated even to this day. The only character that is still funny to me is Jeff Goldblum. A lot of people may see this movie as an oldie but goodie but sorry to say I don't feel the same.

B000068QY7|4.0|Some bands can reach a status where their next record has almost an aura that surrounds it as if it's an \\"event\\"; one of the biggest bands ever has new material that is about to hit stores. Even if the albums don't light the world on fire or they are just simply underrated gems that didn't sell well, their next one still is on many's anticipated list. Oasis for al their faults and criticisms are a similar band and after the misfire/underrated \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\\" which had some listenable songs next to just simply decent, \\"Heathen Chemistry\\", their 5th not counting their b-sides collection \\"The Masterplan\\", the band shows some topform songwriting which hurts when its against some poor numbers as well.    The Hindu Times: Bar none one of the best anthems they've done in years and probably ever. With a great beat, Liam's trademark attitude-laden vocals and that catchy Middle Eastern-sounding riff, this gets the album off on a really high note and well worth your time. 9.5/10    Force of Nature: Whatever momentum was generated by the last song deflates a bit as it's basically an ugly and kind of bland stomping dirge sung by Noel. It's one of those songs that feels very repetitive the more it goes on and there's no real great chorus to save it either. 5.5/10    Hung in a Bad Place: A heavy rocking tune that might make one recall \\"Definitely Maybe\\" stuff. Besides its rather annoying dissonant guitar notes and a less-than-remarkable chorus, it's got a nice energy to it though it's not really a great tune in the end, it's just good. 7/10  Stop Crying Your Heart Out: Probably one of their best ballads in a while though \\"Roll it Over\\" is up there. With piano, string sections, an emotive vocal delivery, it's got all the makings of a great tune. Only thing that's a bit of a drag is its outro with harmonics but it's mercifully brief so it's nothing major. 9/10    Songbird: The first single penned by Liam (he wrote \\"Little James\\" from the Giants album) and it'sa nice acoustic ditty with piano, handclaps and what sounds like a musette/organ sound in the background. It's Liam deciding to sing instead of bring the attitude and it's quite the good tune. 9/10    Little by Little: This is either an effective power ballad or an attempt at replicating the feeling of \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\". Personally I think this makes the 3rd great song in a row and it's quite catchy, Noel's vocals soar and it's got a psychedelic production. 9/10    A Quick Peep: More filler than anything really which sucks because the jangly acoustic riff playing throughout is actually quite catchy and it's got some jazzy keyboard parts but in the end it's just simply a way to connect the first half with the second half. It's cool for what it is but probably won't be liked by most. 7.5/10    (Probably) All in the Mind: I've seen many a people outright this track saying it's just boring and not really interesting. Strange that I was singing it the other day so go figure. Sure it's a little repetitive and Liam sounds like he'd rather sing it and get it over with but strangely I actually like listening to it. 8/10    She is Love: Another one of those strangely love-it-or-hate-it tracks as the track sounds like something Lennon and McCartney wrote in their spare time. Acoustic guitars and organs, Noel sings a love tune (with some admittedly bad lines) but it's pretty decent as a tune. My one complaint is that Noel's vocals don't sound as strong as on something like \\"Sunday Morning Call\\". It's either pure cheese or pure good pop song so try it out anyway. 7.5/10    Born on a Different Cloud: Despite the fact that \\"Be Here Now\\" was released 5 years previously, they haven't gotten their long, unneeded lengths out of their system and the song has kind of an eerie atmosphere and strange tremolo chords and slide guitar but it goes on far too long and halfway through, you'll feel like you've kind of gotten the point. 6/10    Better Man: A big stomping rock song with distorted blues riff and solos and the swagger and attitude that the brothers always had in abundance. It closes the record on a big way, at least sonically anyway and makes a cool rock song. 7/10 However, the song has literally 30 minutes of dead air at the end until a secret song is at the end. Very unnecessary by far.     It's quite an uneven record and for every bit of greatness like \\"Hindu Times\\" or \\"Songbird\\" there's dreck and just decent and a bit of laziness in its songwriting. Unlike Giants which actually had some good non-single tunes, this is a case where the singles were chosen quite wisely.
0141439475|5.0|An incredible book that I only wish I had read earlier in my life. Once I started the book I had difficulty putting it back down except to do the things that I was obliged to do. I loved the book completely, but I am still after finishing it unsure what my thoughts and feelings are towards Victor Frakenstein or his monster. I want to feel compassion for the monster in his only desire for love and to not be alone but at the same time I fear that if I had met him in the city that I would scream in fear and desire to kill him myself. As far as Victor, he is someone who at times I felt sorry for and other times I wanted to hate him more so than the monster for his crazy ambitions to do such a thing and then to abhor and desire the death of his creation. A great book that I would recommend to anyone.
B000YKE87W|5.0|Large-voiced tenors are in short supply today, a phenomenon that most likely traces its origin to the vocal education system that stresses importance on the purity of tone so favored in Mozart and Handel's operas that are in such a vogue in today's classical music scene.  However beautiful and well-controlled many of today's tenor voices are, this does not produce the thrilling electricity that you can get from voices that once rang full and true in a manner similar to that of the singers from an earlier part of the century like Ludwig Suthaus, Ramon Vinay, and Max Lorenz in the German wing and Franco Corelli and Carlo Bergonzi in the Italian department.  Fortunately, a few stars do emerge from this low calorie vocal rubble who can prove themselves successors to the crown that has for so long been left to the hands of many a tenor who lacks not only the heft but also the imagination to apply that magical touch that place the stamp on the work of a star. Jonas Kaufmann is one such singer, and it is most fortunate that Decca took the incentive to hire this tenor for a long awaited recital CD featuring his work in a variety of repertory that not only amazes the listener with this artist's versatility, but also with his outstanding commitment.      Perhaps he is not idiomatic in every sense of the word.  His work in Puccini hardly describes the plush, Italianate cushion that characterizes the work of tenors like Bergonzi, nor does his Verdi raise any flags that indicate the second coming of a Domingo or a Carreras.  However, its his ability to produce a consistently charming and aesthetically beguiling interpretation of these roles outside his natural fach that makes him such an irresistible find.  His voice is perhaps better suited (due to its dark, large timbre) to the more heroic German roles, but we would be poorer if we didn't hear what magic he could conjure with his singing outside roles like Walther.      A truly outstanding debut CD, and from the previews takenfrom the Meistersinger and Freischutz excerpts, I certainly hope to hear more from this tenor that will edge him slowly towards the roles where I believe his voice will truly shine--Siegmund, Lohengrin, Parsifal, Tristan, and Siegfried.
0385720920|3.0|\\"Weird\\" is not the right word, but it's the first one that comes to mind.   See also: odd   See also: strange     What to say about this book. It was a rather easy read but I didn't care much for it. The plot itself wasn't that bad, it actually kept me entertained and the ending of the book was just short of great although the first word that came out of my mouth was, \\"weird\\".     The reason I gave it a rating of 3 was I just didn't care for some of the other things in the book. I didn't care for the foul language used but at the same time felt it was necessary in order to set the tone for the book. I also didn't care for the multiple sex scenes. I don't think they were excessively descriptive to make it an erotic book and it was a key component in helping establish the character of Victor.     I wanted to give this book a rating of 2, but just didn't feel it was fair so I gave it a 3 instead.

This became a classic document of early romantic (tragic) love used by many artists in their work including William Shakespeare in Romeo and Juliet.

The lyrics are smart and the music is soothing and catchy.

I'm surprised they don't receive more recognition, but it's probably because they're a British band. A lot of great music out of Britain never really manages to cross the ocean successfully.

Worse than the ordinary miserable childhood is the miserable Irish childhood, and worse yet is the miserable Irish Catholic childhood.\\"<br /><br />So begins ANGELA'S ASHES, Frank McCourt's amazing memoir of growing up in the direst poverty in Limerick, Ireland.  The book opens in Brooklyn in 1935 when Frank, the eldest child, is only four.  Frank's father, Malachy, has decided life in his native Ireland, hard as it may be, would be easier than life in Brooklyn.  So, with his wife, Angela and their four surviving children - Frank, Malachy, and twins, Oliver and Eugene, (baby sister, Margaret has already died) - in tow, the McCourt family returns to Malachy's native Belfast.<br /><br />One might think the return of a family member who's been gone for years would be an occasion for rejoicing.  But this is Belfast and war is brewing, and as the reader soon realizes, Malachy's family is far worse off than the citizens of Brooklyn.  After spending only one night in his family's small home, Malachy, Angela, and their children are sent packing - to Limerick, the town where Angela grew up.<br /><br />Angela's family proves to be almost as unwelcoming as Malachy's, but the family does manage to find lodgings in \\"the lanes,\\" a euphemism for the town's slums.  And slums they are, make no mistake about that.  There's no sanitary system to speak of, so the McCourt family finds summers and the almost unbearable stench almost as bad as winters when there's no coal to light the fire.  The seemingly ever-present rain floods the McCourt's downstairs, forcing them to flee to the upstairs rooms, and the dampness of the River Shannon kills two more McCourt children and sends Frank to the hospital for months.  Although heartbroken, the McCourt's accept their losses as simply their lot in a very, very difficult life.<br /><br />The Protestant Malachy is shunned in Catholic Ireland and his northern accent makes it almost impossible for him to find work.  When he does, he \\"drinks\\" his wages in the form of pints at the local pub before even going home, leaving his younger children with nothing but sugar water and the older ones lucky to get a potato for their dinner.  Christmases consisted of a sheep's head, which Angela obtained from local charities.<br /><br />ANGELA'S ASHES is a horrific, but beautifully written book, an episodic memoir rather than a traditionally plotted novel.  This episodic quality however, takes nothing away from its ability to mesmerize and pull us into the world of pre-war Limerick.  We sympathize with Frank as he endures a series of abusive teachers - until he finally encounters one who recognizes his intelligence.  We empathize with him as he finds - then tragically loses - his first love.  We chuckle (yes, chuckle, for ANGELA'S ASHES, grim as it is, contains humor aplenty) at his misplaced attempts to spread Catholicism, one of which provides quite possibly the book's funniest set piece.<br /><br />Young Frank, during one of his first jobs must deliver a telegram to a Mr. Harrington, an Englishman who's understandably distraught over the death of his wife, Ann.  When Frank knocks on the Harrington's door, Harrington is already drunk and asks Frank to watch over Ann's body while he makes a quick trip to the local pub for reinforcements.<br /><br />Frank has obviously listened to his strict Catholic schoolmasters and he obviously cares about his fellow man.  In a hilarious scene, Frank, not wanting Ann to suffer in hell because of her Protestantism, baptizes her a Catholic with sherry in place of holy water.  Naturally, just as he's doing so, Harrington returns.<br /><br />While ANGELA'S ASHES is filled with tragedy, harrowing events, and the direst of poverty, it's also filled with dignity, compassion, and genuine wit.  This wit is, I think, what raises the book from a superbly written memoir to a genuine masterpiece and classic.  But even though the book sometimes elicits a chuckle, more often than not, it brings a tear.  One of the most harrowing images, for me, at least, was that of an always-hungry Frank voraciously licking the newspaper that had held his Uncle Pat's fish and chips.<br /><br />Just as McCourt does a fine balancing act regarding humor and despair, he also balances his characterizations so our view of the persons who inhabit ANGELA'S ASHES is never one-sided.  This is particularly true regarding Frank's father, Malachy.  In the hands of a lesser author, Malachy could have become nothing more than exasperating and ineffectual, which, of course, he is.  But McCourt also shows us his father's charming side as well.  As irresponsible as Malachy is, he obviously loves his children, and it was their father, more often than not, who comforted his sons.  It was Malachy who nurtured Frank's appetite for stories, giving him the tale of Cuchulain, Ireland's great savior, and the Angel on the Seventh Step, the being who brought two new babies, Michael and Alphonsus, to Angela.  Perhaps, because of Malachy, Frank somehow finds the strength to endure and nurture his own dreams.  ANGELA'S ASHES is, in many ways, a Cinderella story, a story of triumph, although at first glance, it would seem to be anything but.  More than anything, though, ANGELA'S ASHES is a perfectly written, deeply moving book.  Although filled with tragedy and despair, in the end, it's a glorious book, one that becomes a part of the reader and continues to grow within him years after the last page is turned.classic.

On this album - and particularly on \\"Cause We're Ended as Lovers\\" - he plays with such soul and depth, phrasing as if his instrument is really breathing and singing for him.    As for the rest of the album: George Martin's production (and string arrangement on \\"Diamond Dust\\") is sympathetic and always on the right level to carry every part of Jeff and his band's playing.    Speaking as a singer, I can only rave that Jeff makes the guitar communicate so richly. He's the greatest, and this album offers ample proof. A beautiful album.

There is some compassion and romance to it as well (after all, this whole thing is about a guy protecting a baby from harm).<br />*Filming style is pretty good.  It's a little rough and gritty, but not overwhelmingly jittery or anything.<br />*Acting is great.  Clive Owen is entirely memorable.  Monica Bellucci is awesome.<br />*Some fun dialogue.<br />*Great music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Weak story, with lots of strange, contrived twists.<br /><br />The Questionable Things<br />*As said above, it's unbelievable and over-the-top.  It can either be seen as stylish and fun, or stupid.<br />*A bit vulgar.  Expect some swearing, lots of bloody violence, and some strange sexuality.<br /><br />It's brainless, tasteless, and highly unbelievable.  At the same time, it's stylish, cool, and entertaining.  Like some kind of cartoon, this is a good simple movie to put in and enjoy for action fans who don't want to think excessively or worry about realism.<br /><br />DVD has good video and audio quality, and contains some featurettes, deleted scenes, and trailers.
0790729725|5.0|I've probably seen this movie about five times.<br /><br />Every time, it gets better and to this day, Goodfellas still reigns as my favorite movie of all time. I've seen quite a bit of movies as well!<br /><br />First of all, I love Henry's character. Great story. Hardworking kid works his way up and eventually lands with the top dogs Pauly, Jimmy, & Tommy.<br /><br />As the viewer, we're taken into quite an intense, sometimes laughable, & surreal ride. I loved it when Henry and Jimmy simply rob a truck driver at gun point. The robbery seemed oh too easy. Who knew this type of stuff happens?<br /><br />I love this movie because it's so beautifully shot and told. I love this movie because of the unique and believable characters. I love this movie because it teaches us something in life:  Ya can't always do things the cleanest of ways...
B0017I1FNK|5.0|Nearly all of Emmylou's albums have been excellent, but what I really like about this one is how it harkens back to her early years. Those '70s albums she did were totally gorgeous, and, on this one she uses some key figures from that time. Producer Brian Ahern was a big part of that exquisite sound back then, and you can hear it on this one too. John Starling is a unique voice, and it's good to hear him again, like seeing an old friend. The McGarrigle sisters are a joy to hear, and so is the harmony of Dolly Parton and Vince Gill on one song. I love some of the song choices, and, as usual with Emmylou, there's such a deep sense of pure beauty. You may be reading a book or something while listening, and, at some point you'll stop and just marvel at how beautiful that sound is. Something like that has got to be good for you!
074322454X|1.0|Firstly, I find it staggering that 319 people have given this book a 5 star rating. Granted, if you didn't have much of a background in reading military history then you could be forgiven for thinking that this book is an accurate portrayal of the 506th and the war in North-West Europe in general. However, for those readers who have read more than one book, Ambrose's book will show itself as poorly-researched and relying heavily on oral history which is fraught with dangers and pitfalls, most of which feature heavily in the mini-series 'Band of Brothers'.  The same errors and omissions occur in the other Ambrose book that I've read, 'Pegasus Bridge', which also relies heavily on oral history rather than in-depth research.  These two `Ambrose Experiences' have convinced me not to bother with his other works.<br /><br />This book is essentially the collected memories of a small selection of WWII veterans from E Company, 506th Parachute Infantry of the 101st Airborne Division (and the small selection should be emphasised).  While the book's focus is on the divisions' combat operations in the 1944 - 45 period, this is naturally preceded by the company's time in jump training and pre-deployment activities.<br /><br />The star of the show is Richard (Dick) Winters. One soon sees that Ambrose holds Winters in the highest esteem, some of which is justified given Winters combat record and the success rate that Easy Coy had under his command. However, the way in which the narrative through Winters' recollections denigrates anyone who might take the shine of Winter's star is quite appalling. There are a number of interviews and quotes from other company members, but it Winters who is the central character and his recollections which move the book along.<br /><br />There are so many errors, omissions and distortions I can't understand how people can treat this book seriously.  Other reviewers have covered some of the most glaring examples of this - for example R.A. Forczyk describes how only 5.3% of German tanks in Normandy were `Tigers'.  Consider also, that John Keegan in his excellent \\"Encyclopaedia of World War II\\" notes that there were only ever 1,350 PzKfw VI `Tiger' I Auf E's produce during the entirety of the war (reader's should also compare the monthly tank production figures quoted in Albert Speer's autobiography [in his role as Hitler's Minister for War Armaments]) - yet Ambrose's narrative would have you believe that Easy Company fought all 1,350 of them!<br /><br />Then there's the myth of Bastogne, a.k.a the Battle of the Bulge.  The reader is left with the impression that the crossroads at Bastogne was defended solely by the 101st - there is nary a mention of the 9th Armoured Division or the tank destroyer battalion supporting the 101st.<br /><br />Another personal gripe is the generalisations, omissions and distortions about individual characters. Three particularly important ones come to mind as I type this: Lieutenant Meehan, Sergeant Talbert and Private Blithe.<br /><br />Lieutenant Meehan gets mentioned a handful of times in the mini-series as this faceless entity who you never meet and hardly at all during the book.  In keeping with Winters' attacks on anyone who would dull his star, you only hear about Meehan third hand.  I was fortunate enough to read the last letter that Meehan wrote to his wife before D-Day and in that letter are the words of a man whose conviction of purpose and the righteousness of mission are absolute.  But the letter is more than that, is conveys to the reader that Lt. Meehan was a leader of men and you can see why higher command selected him to replace Lt. Sobel as the commander of Easy Company.<br /><br />There is also a monument to Lt. Meehan and all of the men of `Chalk 66' and C-47 crew in the small village of Beuzeville au Plain - all K.I.A on D-Day.  (As an aside, each household in the village contributed 800 Euros in order for the memorial to be built - which is a compelling testamentto esteem that the Norman French have for the American servicemen of D-Day.)<br /><br />Sadly, Sergeant Talbert is dismissed in the book by one line as man who after the war became a drunk and a drifter that no-body every heard from again. Yes, Talbert struggled with alcoholism for many, many years before he finally beat it. In the later years of his life he attended many reunions. Even more shameful is the treatment that Private Blithe receives both in the book and the mini-series. Blithe is treated as a coward and shirker. Almost one entire episode of the mini-series is dedicated to perpetuating this outrageous myth. The mini-series has Blithe wounded by a German sniper and then subsequently dying of his wounds. Yet the real story is that Blithe not only survived the war, but went on to have a very successful military career, with many promotions and service medals. To portray him as a coward is quite unforgivable.<br /><br />Sadly this book is simply not up to the task of providing a balanced and detailed history of the American Paratrooper during World War II; it is biased in favour of Winters and his achievements and detracts more than enhances what the Band of Brothers legend was about.<br /><br />EDIT: I have corrected the mistake I made viz-a-viz Guth and Talbert and corrected the spelling of Private Blithe's surname.to esteem that the Norman French have for the American servicemen of D-Day.)<br /><br />Sadly, Sergeant Talbert is dismissed in the book by one line as man who after the war became a drunk and a drifter that no-body every heard from again.

0743298039|5.0|Only a highly skilled author can write a compelling tale about a reclusive family whose world is small and not overly exciting. Yet Diane Setterfield does exactly this in The Thirteenth Tale.<br /><br />The story centers around the deep emotional and physical bond of identical twins, Adeline and Emmeline Angelfield. This is a story of insanity, death, and the risk that telling the truth about the past imposes on others. It's also about how those proverbial little apples never fall far from their trees.<br /><br />The novel opens when biographer and bibliophile, Margaret Lea, is hired to write the biography of world-famous fiction author Vida Winter, a woman who's nearing the end of her long life. For Margaret, who's only written the biographies of dead people, the challenge is intriguing and daunting because the famous Ms. Winter is notorious for never telling the same story twice about her life. In fact, she's told nineteen different versions about her past over a two-year period alone. The question becomes, what really happened in Vida's childhood, and is she telling Margaret the truth now or another fanciful story?<br /><br />The more Margaret learns, the more sympathetic she becomes to the cantankerous Vida. For Vida was a twin. Margaret was also a twin who lost her sister at birth, a loss she's never come to terms with. The Thirteenth Tale is mystifying, heartbreaking, and so beautifully written that you won't forget this story any time soon.

B000SM7QUC|4.0|When listening to 'Life Is Beautiful' and discovered it was Nikki Sixx, it gave me pause for thought...    While not being someone who listened to Mötley Crüe regularly, I was impressed with the way he told the story about his heroin addiction with music and song. As far as some comments about this album having a dark mood to it, I would suggest the album has a more straight forward music arrangement with song writing that speaks to the realities of drug addiction.    The songs do work well together in the form of a concept album. My only criticism is the overuse of the monologue before and after some songs. This would be a worthwhile purchase for those who listen to this genre of music.

B0004Z33EG|4.0|This is a pretty good action movie.  Now you probably know that considering the title First Blood.  But this movie is not only decent, violent, and cool, but it stars one the greatest actors ever, Sylvester Stallone.  Now, this movie isn't my favorite, or the greatest action movie ever.  But it has enough violence for you to like it, for those who like violence.  It's not a total blood body count shooter like Scarface or The Punisher.  You've probably even already seen this.  It's sort of a classic.  So, I really wouldn't consider this movie a top notch shooting movie.  But it's a pretty good action film.  I really liked it when I saw it.  Any movie with guns in it has to be a good action film right?  Yeh.  If you know and seen the Rocky movies, imagine the Italion Stallion as John Rambo, an Ex-Green Beret congreshonal (I don't know how to spell it) medal of honor winner Vietnam Vet, returns to the states to find all his friends from the war.  When he enters a small town, an officer sees his outfit and doesn't want people like him in his town, the officer insults Rambo, and starts to piss him off.  When Rambo can't take any more s__t, he starts to piss off the cop, and is wrongly accused and arrested.  At the department, the officers abuse him witch gives him flashbacks of Vietnam, bad flashbacks.  After Rambo has had enought, he breaks free and goes completly insane with madness.  Breaking out of the department, Rambo steals a motorcycle and takes off into the woods, followed by police cars.  Now in the woods, Rambo is being hunted by the officers, and decides to play a little game with them.  Rambo sets up traps and captures them all, but decides to spare them if they spare him.  Back in the town, when Rambo's old Colonal, Colonal Trautmen arrives to try and lure back Rambo downtown, they decide to bring in the National Guard to try and get him down their.  So, it's a pretty decent movie, if you haven't seen it, go ahead, it's not bad.
B000ETQR3Q|1.0|I just bought my two sons each one of these yesterday and already it is more of a headache than fun.  It jams up constantly and really is a pain to try to enjoy.  Would not recommend it at all--just a heavy piece of junk plastic in the shape of a gun that somehow sells it, but the real function of the gun, to shoot nerf darts, barely works.
B0004Z33EQ|5.0|Make sure you saw my \\"First Blood\\" review, first. Now I know I said \\"First Blood\\" was awesome, but this one is, oh, I can't even discrive in words how great it is. And you're probibly thinking, how can you top the original? Well in my \\"First Blood\\" review, I said Rambo killing cops and shooting out street lights was disappointing, to say the least. But in this one he grabs a machine gun and kills mercenaries in a jungle in Vietnam. There was so much shooting, so much falling mercenaries, so on and so on. Of course, Rambo grabs an M-60 like in the original, but, this time he gets an M60-E3. And guess what, he acually kills bad guys with it. At the end he uses it to shoot all the computers. So once agian he uses it to destroy heavy machinary. But he also used it to kill bad guys. I don't know why people say this was not as good as \\"First Blood,\\" I just don't see it. So see this one too, trust me, you won't be disappointed.

B0000CAXID|5.0|Even though this is fairly modern rock, which many Baby Boomers abhor and revile in preference to their beloved Hendrix, Dylan, Joplin, The Beatles, Led Zeppelin, etc., most of these Woodstuck Heads (like me) will be pleasantly surprised with the tunes on this fine CD.<br /><br />So, what in the heck IS a Foo Fighter? Just about any surviving WW II military pilot who flew in the European Theater could tell you right away!<br /><br />On December 22, 1944 an Allied pilot flying at 10,000 feet over enemy territory was trying to spot out German aircraft. At one point he saw two large and orange glowing balls coming at him. The radio operator saw these UFOs as well. These phenomena did not resemble enemy fighters in any way.<br /><br />The curious objects quickly leveled off and commenced following the allied plane. In an attempt to lose them via evasive actions the pilot maneuvered his plane into a steep dive and the objects followed him down. Then he tried a sharp bank but the objects stayed right with him, seemingly with great ease. For several more minutes the pilot effected multiple aviation tricks in an effort to lose these pursuers, a fruitless exercise which failed. At just about the moment the pilot was ready to give up the objects suddenly vanished into the night. During this entire incident not a shot was fired.<br /><br />This was a typical example of an encounter with a Foo Fighter. Toward the end of World War II pilots continually reported seeing these strange glowing balls flying around their aircraft at night. They appeared to maneuver with terrific speed, the chief concern of the Allies being that their German adversaries had possibly developed a secret new weapon with high-tech capabilities.<br /><br />These objects were named Foo Fighters in connection with a popular period comic strip, Smoky Stover. Smoky's frequent line was, \\"Where there's foo there's fire,\\" the objects seeming to be round, firey shapes.<br /><br />So we can accurately assert that this band, the Foo Fighters, sort of \\"pulled their name out of the air\\" (witless pun intentional). But as to Foo Fighter music, it's quite thoughtful and nicely-executed.<br /><br />We are typically benefitted in these little reviewing endeavors when some sort of analogy or measuring stick (or both) are cited for comparison purposes. Here, I can say that the Foo Fighters' music manifests clear essential connections with the music of The Beatles, particularly in regard to the early \\"minimalist\\" period of that historic and notable rock group. Strangely, I also hear some Black Sabbath in here, ergo, \\"I'll Stick Around,\\" the second track of the CD, albeit, the Foo Fighters' music \\"flows\\" a bit more than Ozzie's stuff did and it exudes a much lighter ambiance. Taking that same song, you'll hear those memorable and innovative [The] Beatles \\"resolution chords\\" here and there as well as the latter band's early clarity. One can also experience this all-too-rare effect in particular on the very next track, \\"Big Me.\\"<br /><br />All these tunes are best played by a guy in a Mustang convertible (summer day, top down, of course!) cruising along new Route 66 with a pretty girl in the passenger seat, and rolling down the asphalt at about 85 miles per hour with one hand strategically placed on her leg. This is road music at its best... not really dance music so much unless you're into some of the weird new unromantic gyrations.<br /><br />In any case, this is fine recording for ALL fans of rock music and, having heard the subsequent Foo Fighters CD, this is the superior choice of the two. My highest recommendation.eir name out of the air\\" (witless pun intentional). But as to Foo Fighter music, it's quite thoughtful and nicely-executed.

0060989157|5.0|I'm in no way a fan of Motley Crue, since I was born during their time of fame, but this book is still one of the best reads I've ever had. It's filled with crazy off-the-wall adventures and events that us ordinary non-rock stars will probably never come close to experiencing (ie. nailing a punk's ear to a table, killing someone in a drunken car crash, lining up girls on against the wall to have sex with them...), and it's thoroughly enjoyable to read about twenty years after the fact. The fun of this book isn't non-stop, though -- it seems that after about 120 pages into it, the reckless hedonism of the boys turns into a mature feeling guilty about living so recklessly and the whole rest of the book is about them trying to get into a clean and normal life, with two decades of trying to repair the band as well.    You know you want to feel like a rock star for a few hundred pages. Here's your chance.

0761536434|4.0|Having been playing games since 1989, when I was four years old, I feel like video game history is a part of my own personal history. I picked this book up to satisfy my nostalgic needs, but I do have a few problems with it that left me wanting more. First off, I want to say that this book is a quick and easy read, and it is incredibly informative about the history of console and arcade games, ranging from the origins of company histories, to the Atari, all the way to the Playstation 2. I learned a lot of interesting little tidbits of information packed away in video game history that I've never even heard working at a game store for the last year.    Now on to my problems with the book...the biggest one is that I've been more into computer games than consoles since Doom came out in 1993, and this book is severely lacking in any PC Gaming storyline. The book does talk about DOOM revolutionizing the 3d graphics in computer games, and details a little bit about \\"Doom clones\\" such as Duke 3D and Quake, then says nothing about PC games for the rest of the book. What the heck! As if Age of Empires, Warcraft, Diablo, Everquest, Ultima Online, or any other '90s computer game wasn't as important as the countless Mario and Sonic sequels!    Another problem with the book: It's seven years old! A lot has happened since then. Update, please!    All in all, this book is a must-have for anyone that grew up on Mario and Sonic. The book focuses more on the successes and failures of the companies involved (Atari, Activision, Nintendo, Sega, etc.) than the evolution of gameplay, but not so much that it loses the average sitting-in-front-of-the-TV gamer. I just wish out of 624 pages the author could've dedicated more to PC games, and that an update would come out soon.
0385340567|4.0|Another great Jack Reacher novel. It's different from the others, where the bad guy isn't as bad and the tough guys aren't as tough, but the novel takes you in and takes you through Reacher's point of view. You learn what's going on when he does, instead of knowing and waiting for him to find out. You're not sure what's going to happen next. When it does, and you don't like it, that's a sign of good writing. Bad writing is when something happens and you don't really care.    How soon until the next one?
B0019MU6HU|5.0|I read this book immediately after reading The Dirt, and it's a good follow-up explaining Nikki's side of the story during a very eventful year in rock stardom, with lots of information that The Dirt had to leave out in order to save space. Mainly, this book describes in detail Nikki's paranoia and loneliness as a drug addict during his off-tour weeks. The things he came up with in his head and took the time to write down in a diary are quite fascinating indeed, and an enjoyable read when you just want to feel like a rock star going through the artistically printed pages.
B0018CA996|2.0|I really love Portishead, and like many fans, I eagerly awaited this album. I find that it is incredibly different from their past albums. Sometimes this takes some adjustment, and giving them a second and third try might prove them to be better.  However, I fear that in this album, Portishead was trying to be so different that the music does not seem as thoroughly composed as its predecessor albums.  In fact, at times, it sounds downright incohesive.  I never thought I would see the day when I said to myself, \\"gotta go turn the Portishead off, it's annoying the hell out of me.\\"
0756404746|2.0|If I have nothing good to say about something, I prefer to stay quiet, however in the case of this particular book I feel I must speak up. For all of the other reviewers who are comparing Mr. Rothfuss to GRR Martin and Steven Erikson I can only scratch my head and wonder. Mr. Rothfuss is a technically sound writer, however his main character Kvothe is unsympathetic, extremely arrogant, was born with his talent, and seems unable to distinguish between bratty, self-centered behavior and respectfully standing his ground. This makes him entirely unlikeable, and though I considered perhaps this was a twist on the genre the author was vying for, I later decided this was probably not the case. Unfortunately.    Because the main character is so defiantly conceited and acts it, the novel as a whole gets less and less compelling as it goes on, and it does go on. For far too long, nothing much occurs except Kvothe getting into and out of trouble for selfish reasons. The dark and intriguing story hinted at during the first few chapters (the best part of the book) never comes to pass. As others have noticed, there is a Harry Potter-esque element that I didn't realize until near the end (I don't read Harry Potter) and this should be a clue for those who like the \\"harder\\" stuff like Erikson or Martin. My expectations for the book were far higher than I should have allowed, and they were pretty much dashed to pieces by the end. This is not a five star novel, and because the author is a serviceable writer, it's not a one star either, but by no means does it deserve the fawning, hyperbole laden praise it has received.

B000H6SXMY|1.0|I received this set as a gift... and i was disappointed at the way this collection was made. The discs are in poorly glued together paper booklets with no protection for the reading surface whatsoever. Unless you CAREFULLY and TEDIOUSLY remove them when u want to watch it... there's a guarantee that you'll end up with multiple scratches. (putting it back in is just as harmful) ... i've watched up to season 6 so far... and i've experienced 3 damaged disc (the reading surface was clearly damaged during packaging and i'm not talking about minor scratch). I cannot watch those episodes because of the damaged portion.     It's not worth it to invest money in this set if you end up not being able to watch multiple episodes. In addition, sliding it in and out with the surface in contact with the paper sleeves will seriously cause damage.    :( I'm highly disappointed that whoever designed this set was so inconsiderate of the fans. . .     i know people say \\"oh but it's cheap\\" ... sure it is... if you're okay with paying around $200 and not being able to collect the whole series because the product was so poorly made. :/
B0010X73ZG|3.0|I have not yet read Stephen King's original story, although I do know how it ends. I did find like many others, the film's ending to be a great shock. While the original story ends inconclusively, at least it was at to me anyway preferable to the abrupt film finale. There are many great and gripping moments in the film and the acting is generally very good and certainly above average for a film of this type. Marcia Gay Harden is excellent as \\"Mrs. Carmody\\" the religious fanatic. The film is generally well-mounted and quite suspenseful throughout. A bit puzzling though are the fates of several key characters who leave the supermarket to venture out into the mist and are not seen or mentioned again. The cause of the mist is not actually given either, only guessed at. The film is very good but not perfect and could have been made a whole lot better. Definitely worth seeing though.
B00006LPER|3.0|I cannot deny that this was a powerful film. There are scenes in this film that are so strong that they simply cannot be ignored. Most of you have probably read the synopsis already, so I'll just go on with my review. This film is either one of two things. Either it's a sorry excuse to torture the audience, or it is a richly textured character study of a woman who has some deeply rooted problems. I believe it's a bit of both - and I am no prude. I am always up for a challenging film, but there were times during The Piano Teacher where I just wanted to look away. I came close to cutting it off. However, I have set a strict rule for myself, in that the first time I watch a film, I watch it in it's entirety. I finished it, and I am glad that I did. There would have been no point in stopping it prematurely. The performances were excellent all around. Isabelle Huppert is totally and utterly convincing in what had to have been a difficult, exhausting role. Haneke's direction was amazing as well. The end was very powerful, and haunted me for a week.<br /><br />I still can't stop thinking about this film, however I don't think that I could recommend it, either. Watch if you must.

B00005JLEU|5.0|A better question might be; should it get better?  \\"Spirited Away\\" has been accepted as a masterpiece by the film industry, anime fans and those who blindly believe what they are told.  It sure sounds like I'm about to pick a fight, but actually I'm getting a little introspective and asking you to do the same.  I could easily write a 10 page essay about anime, this film and the state of the art of animation.  I'll try to avoid that here.  However, after watching this film with my family, a big pile of question appeared.  This is both a testament to this films power and to the fact that many people just don't like or understand this style of film art.  I am once again divided on my opinion of a film.  The only way to cut through the fog in my brain is to (once again) break my thoughts into pieces.<br /><br />-WHAT I THINK OF THIS FILM<br />Artistically speaking, this film is brilliant.  My family was divided about this film.  My wife had problems with the jerky animation style.  My 10 year old daughter loved it.  My 6 year old son did not like it.  We all thought it was a bit too long (especially near the end).  I don't know what you would take out.  I think there might be some scenes that could have been removed to little negative affect if we never knew they existed.  But knowing they exist precludes the idea of removing them.  The one thing we all agreed on was the whole river spirit revelation.  We gave out a collective \\"HUH?\\"  This is pretty typical in anime; if the story doesn't get you there, take a shortcut.  That was probably the only unexpected thing I could criticize.  The other thing I found myself criticizing was the actual animation.  I know what anime is and I know why it is, and I sort of expected it, but this film really got me thinking about the state of anime and why it hasn't moved to another level.<br /><br />-A QUICK EDUCATION<br />Disney style animation is what is known as \\"Full\\" animation.  Simply put; for every 24 frames in a second, there are 24 unique drawings to complete the required motion.  By this, you get a very smooth, natural feeling motion.  In anime, which uses mostly limited animation, in the 24 frames of one second there might be 12 drawings or less in some cases.  Anime will actually use a static image with a moving camera to imply motion. The result is a somewhat choppy or jerky motion.  This is all done to save money due to tight budget constraints.  Though financially cheap, these techniques have been mastered to a very high level.<br /><br />-WHAT I THINK OF ANIME<br />I think that good anime challenges how animation looks (see \\"Animatrix\\" for a compilation of great examples).  Bad anime is pure trash.  Good anime artists really have a knack for capturing the essence of the human form even more so than Disney.  Characters seam to develop effortlessly in anime; one little act or a short phrase or a telling reaction immediately establishes character.  In \\"Spirited Away\\" even minor characters have strong presence.  The best anime has characters we can all identify with very quickly.  This film produces that in spades.  Western animation is not so adept at this.  I find the limited animation distracting at times.  It is because of this that I don't watch a lot of it.  I enjoy artistic as well as technical achievements.  Sometime anime is fully animated (almost by accident).  It's at these times I realize how much more brilliant anime could be.<br /><br />-WEST V EAST; THE $275,000,000 GORILLA IN THE CORNER<br />  I've actually read debates that compared Western \\"Disney\\" style animation to \\"anime\\" ([...]  I would argue this was like debating the merits of chocolate ice cream vs. vanilla ice cream; fairly pointless.  However, things have changed enough in recent years that the debate can not be so easily dismissed anymore; not if you are being honest with yourself.  \\"Spirited Away\\" cost $17MM to produce.  Its global box office receipts totaled $275,000,000.  Who knows what the DVD sales total is?  The same year this film was released, Disney's \\"Brother Bear\\" made $250,000,000.  Disney has not released budget information, but I'm certain it cost more than $17 million.  This begs the question; is it time for anime to take the next step into full animation?<br /><br />-WOULD MONEY KILL FREEDOM<br />Like life in general, the more money there is at stake, the more pressure there is to succeed.  Some might argue that the really cool stories and audacious subject matter that anime produces would not happen if a big budget were put on the line.  I would argue that $17 million is a big risk; in for a penny, in for a pound.  That's why I limit the idea of fully animated anime to feature films.  It's worth the risk.  People revere anime for what Disney does not provide; fearless, unsafe stories and edgy visuals.  Is it such a stretch to think we won't pay to see what everyone complains we don't get?  I think the market place has spoken.<br /><br />-EXCUSES OR REASONS?<br />Given the financial success of the anime feature films in the past decade or so, is the use of limited animation an excuse?  Or, is the art form known as anime inherently tied to the use of limited animation and the \\"moving Manga\\" traditions?  I'm not expert enough about anime to provide the answer, but I think it's a question worth asking.  Some in the anime business talk about how they use creative techniques and limited animation to save money, as if this is how it should always be.  Personally, I think anime features are ready for full animation.  Doubling the budget for \\"Spirited Away\\" (basically drawing twice as much art) would still make it a huge financial success. So money can no longer be an excuse.  Many people are wowed by this film in its current form.  Imagine what it would be like fully animated; mind boggling.  It probably would have made even more money.<br /><br />-WHAT AM I GETTING AT?<br />\\"Spirited Away\\" has an ambitious story, great human characters (even the spirits are human at their core) and incredible artistic vision.  Anime has set new standards for what animated films should explore and this film has kept up that trend.  However, as animation, anime has stayed a step behind.  Though many have come to accept limited animation as an inherent part of anime, I think it's time to raise the bar on these gloriously conceived feature films.  I know these artists can take animation to levels only imagined.  They have the skill and the vision to set new standards.  Yet, we get excuses of low budgets.  Maybe for the serials and Saturday morning fare, but not these \\"masterpiece\\" feature films.  If \\"Triplets of Belleview\\" can be made fully animated, why not \\"Spirited Away\\"?<br /><br />If you are an artist, a fan of anime, a student of animation or a fan of fantasy I'd have to recommend this DVD.  If you are a traditionalist Disney fan, then you might have a problem with the unique story telling and less than smooth animation style.  I recognize and enjoy it for what it is, but I'm not going to let it off the hook for what it could have been either.  The real question is; is it still anime if it's fully animated?  I say yes.

B000002VQQ|2.0|I listened to \\"Horse\\" a couple of times after having heard music by Ms. Smith that I found dynamic and emotionally moving. I had also heard rave critiques and was very  interested in hearing what many consider to be her best work. The words that come to mind are self absorbed and pretentious, and in large part musically lame. Enjoy it if you enjoy it: perhaps you had to be there at the time of its inception to truly appreciate it. As far as I am concerned this piece falls far short of its mark, and the praise that has been heaped upon it.
B00005JPKE|4.0|It was a brave move by Eastwood to make not one but two movies about Iwo Jima, and braver still to show the pivotal conflict from each sides point of view.  Where Flags of Our Fathers was flawed in its approach, muting the impact, `Letters..' is more perfectly formed, and arguably more complex in nature - and it's a success.  Through sepia, almost colourless photography, we see the defence of Iwo Jima from the viewpoint of several Japanese soldiers.  We see them, and we hear them in the forms of their letters they write home, letters that they know may never reach their intended recipients. From this simple framework, we see the build up of defences as the new commanding officer arrives (Ken Watanabe, brilliant) and also from the viewpoint of the soldiers filling sandbags, through to the invasion of the hordes of Americans, and through to the final death throes of the last vestiges of defence.  The range of characters (working class disillusioned solider, aristocratic gentleman officer, honourable commanding officer sworn to his duty but grieved with it) is wider than we might expect, and makes the anti-war message very clear - we are all the same.  Previous war movies have shown one man from the other side to be more complex or sympathetic to us, but here we see the whole Japanese cross section of society, and it presents us with a picture on one hand of a society different from ours, and yet so similar in the humanity of it.  Even in one sub-section - the officers for example, a complex range of views, opinions and impact is observed. One of the key moments comes in the capture of an American soldier, and how even if some of the soldiers can not separate the propaganda from what they see, the words of his mother in a letter are so universal maternal, that they can not help but see what is common between them is greater than that which is different.  It feels like quite a long movie, and the pace is stately in an almost Japanese style which may put some off, however this pushes the movie beyond some flash bang war movie to satisfy the bloodthirsty, and creates that difficult thing - a movie about the war, showing the war, yet a firm indictment of the effects of war.
B00081MUY0|5.0|In 1965/66 drug references better be obscure or your music would be banned from the radio.<br /><br />Donovan was there, he hung out with Dylan, Joan Baez and listened to the Jefferson Airplane before anyone else had. He was at the apartment with Dylan and the Beatles, at THE party that changed music forever. (See Scorcese's \\"No Direction Home\\"). Herein, on Donovan's brilliant masterpiece are psychedelic fairy tales designed to calm down and smooth out bad acid trips. Music exploded with the Summer of Love('67), this classic was first, more than a year before that, recorded '65 and '66, before the whole thing started; just after Dylan's world changing \\"Bringing It All Back Home\\" but before the Beatles \\"Revolver\\" . Much of it deals with troubadour Donovan's troubled love affair with model Linda Lawrence, sometimes girlfriend of Brian Jones, the Golden Rolling Stone. This album is a first in many ways, folk, folk rock, jazz, blues.  First to use the buzzy acid-simulating sitar, tabla, tambura. It is full of King Arthur, Narnia, knight errant, and Alice in Wonderland themes. Arrangements by Mickie Most and John Cameron are miraculously creative.<br /><br />\\"His crystal images they will tell you 'bout a brighter day\\" as Peter, Paul & Mary once said. And this album is chock full of those crystal images, images that make you weep at their beauty.<br /><br />Starts off with the psychedelic superhero \\"Sunshine Superman\\" who is dealing with Linda, and \\"could have tripped out easier but I've changed my ways\\"....this was the first major hit single from the album.<br /><br />\\"Legend of a Girl Child Linda\\" where her Narnian \\"knight goes to battle with his confused mind\\".<br /><br />Hypnotic \\"Twelve Kingfishers\\", not Three, the misprint remains, you can see them dive in your minds eye.<br /><br />The girl who get her hair caught in the \\"Ferris Wheel\\" is like the Symbolist painting of the girl who traps the silver clad knight in her long blonde hair, \\"La Belle Dame Sans Merci\\".<br /><br />Not a top 40 hit for Donovan, the unforgettable \\"Season of the Witch\\", full of striking dark Novemberal images that made Steven Stills, Bloomfield and the Jefferson Airplane and other groups cover the song years later.<br /><br />\\"The Trip\\", an early acid commercial with Alice in Wonderland imagery, banned on nearly all radio stations, except underground ones, in the sixties.<br />\\"...a seagull said, as I looked to way out then/<br /> The whole wide human race is taking far too much methadrine\\"... (it was true in '66, it's even truer now.)<br /> ...Girl, you drank a lot of 'drink me', but you ain't in Wonderland/ you know I might have been there to greet you girl when your trippin' ship touches sand\\"...<br />... Bobby Dylan he sat, the Mad Hatter, broken hourglass in his hand/ and Joanie sat in white lace, looking cool with her black lace fan\\". (Joan Baez - the Queen of folk music)<br /><br />  \\"Fat Angel\\", talks of the Jefferson Airplane, a then unknown San Francisco group whose first album would \\"take off\\" a year later, Fat Angel  - Mama Cass Elliot, of the unknown Sunset Strip Mamas and Papas and Captain High - Jerry Garcia of the then unknown Grateful Dead. \\"He will bring you happiness, in a pipe/ he will ride away, on his silver bike/ And apart from that, he'll be so kind in consenting to blow your mind/Fly Trans-Love Airlines, get you there on time/ Fly Jefferson Airplane, get you there on Time...\\" All of these obscure references would burst upon the American consciousness in the next year or so.<br /><br />This was the ultimate insiders, hip album in 1966, before the word \\"hippie\\" was coined.  Original album had not one bad cut. In this version, good until you get to some of the lesser later inclusions like the busty underage \\"Superlungs, my Supergirl\\".<br /><br />This IMPORT, though not perfect, captures the sound of the original LP, much better remix that previous versions.  A good trip from beginning to end.  Captures the authentic Spirit of the Sixties. Recorded after \\"Bringing it all Back Home\\" and BEFORE \\"Revolver\\"!

B0012Q732O|1.0|Recently, the category of politically-biased action films is growing exponentially.  Some are right-wing (Lord of the Rings), some are left-wing (Lions for Lambs), some are pro-Christian (Narnia), some are pro-integration, some are anti, some want more funding in Congress to save the environment (The Day After Tomorrow), etc...  It's getting harder and harder to find films without an agenda, for the purposes of pure entertainment (like Ocean's 13, for example).  This one has such an obvious message, and such a negligible and linear plot, that a child can figure it out. Even the actors can tell that this film is a racket, judging by their minimum effort. Here goes:  The good guys, all look Middle-Eastern and African.  The corrupt dictator is white.  The eunuch minions serve the corrupt dictator, in a way designed to make them look like pro-west Arab leaders.  The tiger in the plot, obviously symbolizes China. ('The Great Tiger' being it's nickname, even though it's not it's National Animal). The leading man, becomes the hero when he liberates the tiger and the tiger in turn doesn't eat him, but is grateful instead. Finally, the wooly-mammoths are the good-guys' most precious resource, being exploited by the corrupt dictator to build his great pyramids.  Obviously, the mammoths represent OIL and the pyramids represent THE WEST.  So here is the subconscious plot:  This film is designed to empower the Middle East and Africa to sell their oil to China, and to not be afraid of deposing pro-west governments (symbolized, again, by the Anglo-looking, illegitimate demigod).  It would be interesting to \\"follow the money\\" and see exactly who the hell paid for this lump of crap, and who and why wrote the script. One thing is certain:  It reeks of Chinese-intel psy-ops.  Typical Marxist/Maoist propaganda to create class-struggles along racial lines, much like Soviet propaganda in Latin America during the Cold War.  Of course, the film is 'coincidentally' released when Iraq is gearing up to (finally) hand-out oil contracts. The fact they got a good director is beyond me, but I suspect that 'money is money'.  Have you noticed the recently super-biased attempts at bringing up it's rating by dubious reviewers??
0962477060|5.0|This is not a music theory book.  Fretboard Logic describes the Fretboard patterns that are a direct result of the guitar's unique tuning. The patterns discussed are essentially scales and chords covering the entire fretboard.  There is some occasional theory necessary to teach the subject and no more.   It may be too much for many beginners to grasp the importance of what the author is teaching but, that certainly does not mean you can't benefit by learning something new such as pentatonic scales and full bar chords (that's the first 27 pages.)   I could not play full bar chords when I bought the book. You know what you do to cure that? Practice playing them 10 minutes a day and then go onto something else.  I was thrilled when I bought HOB Blues DVD #1 and recognized the scale patterns and realized I could start APPLYING what I learned from this book. No, you will not be a better guitar player after reading this book just because you know some chords and scales. But you will have a solid foundation that will help you APPLY the information in this book as you learn music theory and it will all be a little easier.  I can't say it as a fact since I don't play with others often but, I really doubt this book would do anything but help you when playing with other guitarists and instruments regardless of their knowledge and how they learned it.   I would recommend a yellow Gripmaster (to help warm up and increase hand strength) and a metronome to go along this book.
1401309666|5.0|Chris Anderson's groundbreaking examination of the new economics that comes with the internet age (the big revenue doesn't come from the handful of blockbusters so much as from the catalogue of little titles) ironically put The Long Tail near the head of the sales curve, up at the blockbuster end. Deservedly so. Anderson presents a compelling argument, and he illustrates it through imaginative examples and through tight, colourful language. He's a clear, persuasive writer.<br /><br />In this updated edition, Anderson adds a new chapter on marketing, and in my view this plugs one of the gaps that emerged with the original work. Marketing executives and agency strategists have for two years now been dropping the \\"long tail\\" phrase into their dialogue, but the new chapter will help them put the thinking into practice.<br /><br />A great book just got more timely, more useful.<br /><br />PS. If you're looking to get a handle on today's marketing paradigm I'd recommend this book alongside Rob Walker's excellent [[ASIN:1400063914 Buying In: The Secret Dialogue Between What We Buy and Who We Are]]

1552091090|5.0|I would say that this is a book written for mothers.  I have two boys, and sometimes they ask me to read it to them.  I'm always crying at the end and my boys are puzzled.  Of course my husband thinks it's sappy, but hey he's a guy! He does not like it mostly because it talks about the boy using bad language and acting goofy(I do not like that part either, foul language is never use in our house)  But I like the concept of the mother's unconditional love.  That's my take of it.  Yes most mommies don't drive at night and climb into your window in the middle of the night, but lets not forget that this is the same as having bunnies, and cows, and pigs, talking to each other and wearing clothes.  It's a children's book, it lends itself to be a little out of reality and that's ok with me.  I have given this book as gifts yo many first time mothers and they all had told me how much they liked it (and made them cry).
B00009P1O2|5.0|Excellent performance!  Queen plays a lot of their hits, including my faves of theirs: Bohemian(sp) Rhapsody, and We are the Champions.  Freddie also sings a few hits by other stars, such as an Elvis Presley song, and one of Rickie Nelson's.  I must say that they may even be better than the originals.  I was a little disappointed that Queen did not sing their song \\"You're My Best Friend.\\"  But, that is a minor point.  The songs and performance are wonderful...and I play the DVD frequently.  The world really lost an amazing man and an excellent performer when Freddie Mercury passed away.  Definitely a five star performance: All Queen fans will surely love this DVD.  I know I do!

0375424474|5.0|This is such a great science book that works at so many levels and perspectives; it's amazing how many different areas of evolution Shubin is able to cover in a smaller footprint book of only 201 pgs.  The book is written at a level that a relatively smart higher schooler can understand, yet reports on discoveries even the most ardent follower of science will find fascinating; a rare accomplishment in terms of being able to target such a wide audience while satisfying both extremes.<br /><br />The book serves as a personal memoir of Neil Shubin, project lead for the team that discovered the transitional fossil Tiktaalik Rosae.  Readers gain insight to the inner-day workings of an authentic scientist.  I was very impressed at the breadth of Shubin's capabilities beyond his fieldwork, which was already commonly known to casual followers of science like myself.  Shubin's reportage on his personal experiences greatly enhanced my respect for the energy, determination, talent, and patience required to make a meaningful discovery such as Tiktaalik as well as the hours spent in the lab not just validating their discovery, but also developing new methods to validate fossil discoveries in the relatively new field of evo devo and providing insight on new features to look for in the field or even in the drawers of natural history museums (like Matt Friedman, who just discovered the transitional fossil between symmetrical fish and flatfish based on previous fossil finds long stored away, [...]).<br /><br />The book also serves as an adventure story given the Tiktaalik discovery in the remote wilderness of Northern Canada after years of expeditions.  From this perspective, I highly recommend that teachers at or above high school biology offer this book to their more promising science students as an extra credit project.  Society has largely mischaracterized scientists in general and greatly underreport their contributions.  Shubin does an excellent job of portraying the personal satisfaction and enjoyment of practicing science, given America's recent degradation in producing an adequate amount of young scientists from our domestic inventory of students.  We need to promote more role models like Shubin to young people, similar to how we promoted astronauts in the 1960's.  Other countries get it, more examples like Shubin will help us eventually get it back as well.<br /><br />Shubin also reports on other related findings to help illuminate his discoveries and provide a general update on what we know regarding evolution in general and human evolution as it relates all the way back to single-cell organisms.  His reporting on unicellular algae evolving into multicellular organisms within 200 generations (eight years) in the lab was one of several vignettes that helped provide perspective to the degree we've progressed in our understanding of biology.  Other examples are the evolution of human eyes and Shubin's direct contributions on the evolution of our middle ear bone back through Tiktaalik to fish gill arches - both from fossil discoveries and through successful experiments performed in the lab given our recent understanding of genetics and bioengineering.<br /><br />In fact, the chapter on human ear evolution is probably the most fascinating chapter given its rich history going back to the 19th century and how subsequent discoveries allowed us to continuously build upon those original findings to the point we can now physically create gill arches in primates or middle ears in fish given our discovering the gene common to both and our recent understanding of how different proteins impact fetal development.  Besides a great story, this chapter provided the additional perspective of illuminating how science builds upon previous discoveries.<br /><br />If you loved [[ASIN:0393060160 Endless Forms Most Beautiful: The New Science of Evo Devo and the Making of the Animal Kingdom]], another great science book which is how much of the public was introduced to the new field of evo devo, you'll love this book since Shubin is a primary player in the field in terms of explaining the evolution of gill arches to anthropods' upper jaws, to primate middle ears.  I was impressed at the breadth of Shubin's discoveries reported in this book; from fossil discoveries in the field to providing explanation for his field discoveries at a cellular level, not to mention successful predictions of where to find such fossils, and physical validation in the lab of the evolution of the human ear middle bone evolution through his experiments.<br /><br />Shubin in worthy of celebrity given his contributions.

B0013FSL3E|4.0|*SPOILERS*<br /><br />\\"Wall-E,\\" the latest offering from the moviemaking geniuses at Pixar Studios, is a certifiable visual masterpiece that provides an endlessly inventive vision of what life might be like in the 29th Century - although, come to think of it, the term \\"life\\" may be something of a misnomer, for in \\"Wall-E\\"'s post-apocalyptic image of the future, Earth has been rendered uninhabitable by pollution and garbage that have risen to toxic levels.  The humans have long since fled to a high-tech way station located somewhere out in the far reaches of outer space, leaving the planet virtually deserted except for a sweet trash-compressing robot named Wall-E and his indestructible cockroach sidekick.  Like all good little robots, Wall-E tirelessly performs the one function he has been programmed to carry out, even after the reason for that task no longer exists.  Thus, he spends his days dutifully collecting all the litter generously strewn about the deserted city and converting it into skyscraper-high mounds of compacted trash.  At night, he wiles away the hours watching an old videotape of \\"Hello Dolly\\" and pining away for a female companion who will alleviate his loneliness and bring some meaning to his life.  Then, one fine day, his dream becomes a reality when a sleek, sexy little number named Eve - actually an environmental robot sent from the way station to see if any signs of life have returned to the planet - shows up unexpectedly in Wall-E's neighborhood.<br /><br />The early section of the movie, in which Wall-E wordlessly goes about his business against a haunting backdrop of a decaying infrastructure and heaps of garbage, has much of the delicate beauty and sense of wonder we find in the opening moments of \\"E.T.\\" (whose main character obviously served as the model for Wall-E).  Written and directed by Andrew Stanton and brought to life by an army of miracle-working animators too numerous to mention, \\"Wall-E\\" is one of those rare films that, through sheer visual design alone, is able to magically transport us to the unique little world it's created.  The burgeoning romance between the two mechanical creatures is handled with a great deal of tenderness and wit, and the film is sprinkled with subtle little homages to \\"West Side Story\\" (in the aerial views of the city), \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" and \\"Titanic\\" for the more cinematically astute among us to revel and delight in.

B0017I1FO4|5.0|The new Shinedown CD is... absolutely amazing.  The Sound of Madness exceeded what I thought this band was capable of, and since Leave a Whisper I had VERY high expectations for this band (which were somewhat disappointed by the overly radio-friendly Us and Them).<br /><br />Where Shinedown was heavy in Leave a Whisper, they are devastatingly driven in The Sound of Madness.  Where they had been beautiful and pensive they are now excruciatingly beautiful.<br /><br />Listening to the song, Devour, I can't help but think they may have learned a thing or two from Disturbed on rhythm, meter, tempo, and just overall violence of action.  And the truly great thing is that they lost none of their old personality.  This is still Shinedown, but Now They're Pissed!<br /><br />They've still got that trick of theirs where they change key mid-melody, and now it's even more surprising-yet-seamless than ever.<br /><br />I really believe that in order to make this album happen the band members had to develop personally in a deep way.  You can tell they've taken a much more objective view of life than they had before (they even have a little tough love for their \\"loner\\" fans in their title track), and it seems they've found whatever it is they lost in Us and Them.  They seem to have really found themselves in big way, and I think they've grown up a lot, both personally and as a band.<br /><br />But the bottom line is that The Sound of Madness is one of the best metal albums ever produced, and the members of Shinedown have reason to feel really good about themselves right now.<br /><br />Long live Shinedown!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|.. when classic metal/hard rock bands like Priest put out new releases in the modern age. Seriously I am so glad that something as great NOSTRADAMUS has come out after oh so many dissapointments and failures by other old school bands putting out crappy new CDs such as Rush, Iron Maiden and Megadeth. NOSTRADAMUS is one of Judas Priest's best albums, that is for sure. People who are complaining don't know what they are talking about, this is Priest going back to it's progressive 70s roots, turning away from the commerical hit machine it was in the 80s. I'm glad they didn't do another Angle of Retribution, which was just a retred of established ideas, NOSTRADAMUS actually progress the band forward in new territories. Think Sad Wings of Destiny, think Sin After Sin, think dynamics and gothic doom vs. melodic and almost symphonic moments of beauty. That is what NOSTRADAMUS is folks. If you have been longing for the sound they had in the 70s to come back, with its epic-ness and dynamics, well here it is.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is the BBC series consisting of five discs that had a budget of $25 million, was five years in the making using 40 cameramen spending over 2000 days in the field. There is absolutely nothing else like this. It is some of the most amazing film you will ever watch. I don't think there is any way to overstate the magnificence of this production. A lot of the areas covered have never been filmed before or certainly not in the way filmed in this series. One of the best parts is the filmed diary at the end of each segment that shows the behind the scenes work that went into filming that particular show. Watching the incredible episodes along with the outstanding music score, you don't think about what it took to get that footage. Seeing them getting their camera gear into the deepest caves on earth, sitting in a claustrophobic shelter for weeks to get a few minutes footage of the snow leopard or loading up two months supplies of food, water, gas and supplies to film camels in the Gobi Desert make you appreciate the unbelievable effort that went into producing this series. You will not be disappointed. [...]
0975991477|5.0|Lipton's book turns our understanding of the world inside out: it is not the DNA inside the cells that controls them, but the interaction of the outer cell membrane receptors with their environment.  Starting from what is known and accepted, the author extrapolates to what transcends accepted science.  Along the way he presents to the reader a thorough description of cell biology.  It is all quite remarkable, but will you dare follow where he leads?  How the mind affects the body's health?  The effect that mother's emotions have over the development of the fetus?  How some hydrocephalic children have high IQs although they lack most of their physical brain?      And then there is the matter of matter.  The author points out that everything in the universe consists of atoms, and atoms are made out of [electrons and quarks] invisible energy not tangible matter.  And since all energy in the universe should be describable by one mathematical expression, everything is inter-related, everything communicates with everything else.  One could follow many paths from here, but Lipton concentrates on how our personal beliefs affect our physical cells: how many of these beliefs, formed from as early as our fetus days, lie hidden in our unconscious only to surface unexpectedly and affect our cells in completely mysterious ways.      The author saves most of his personal conclusions for the epilogue: a discussion of our conscious selves, our personal relationship with everything else in our environment (which he calls the Divine), and mankind's next step up the evolution ladder.  He concludes that \\"The survival of the Most Loving is the only ethic that will ensure not only a healthy personal life but also a healthy planet.\\"  He thus joins the considerable number of scientists who have discovered that the effect of love exceeds the boundaries of religion and should be treated as a real and potent power in the universe.    (The writer is the author of [[ASIN:0979496918 The Way of the Butterfly:  A Scientific Speculation on God and the Hereafter]]and of \\"[[ASIN:1570876541 Christianity Without Fairy Tales: When Science And Religion Merge]].\\")

B0018TLRT0|3.0|I was very excited about seeing a 30th anniversary release of this landmark album, but was disappointed to see that it still contains the boring disco version instead of the original version of \\"Heart Of Glass\\".  I would've rather seen the original version and the disco version as a bonus track of Heart Of Glass like it was done on the Gold Disc released in '94, which I'm lucky to own.  I loved the alternate shots of the Parallel Lines photo sessions, wish they had included more though, and wish they had included lyrics, more liner notes, and better packaging, after all this is supposed to be a \\"Deluxe Edition\\"?  The DVD is nice, but should've included more video footage, it falls short.

You do have the option to play it in English, without subtitles.  Definitely worth the money.  Spoiler Alert: The ending is somewhat dissatisfying.

B0012QE4Q2|4.0|Then you should like the movie. It does a pretty good job of following the book, which after all is historical FICTION. People often fail to realize that when they are watching a movie they should be watching for entertainment-for factual accounts, watch a documentary. Lord knows that there are plenty out there. I think all the characters were cast well, especially Norfolk. My only historical nitpicks are that: 1. Mary was the oldest (we think, for the most part) 2. Wolsey should have been in there and 3. They make it seem like he hated her from the moment he married her...even before. They could have at least waited until the first miscarriage.     Lighten up, history buffs.

0312321376|5.0|As a practicing research scientist, let me note that most in the West are unaware of the substantial empirical scientific research that has been conducted on rebirth/reincarnation during the past 50-80 years. Admittedly, it is not possible to use the Gold Standard, randomized double blind studies, on children who have memories of past lives. however, Ian Stevenson, the founder of the University of Virginia's Division of Perceptual Studies, was a thorough and meticulous scientific researcher who always sought alternative explanations using every tool available to him. Fortunately, his rigorous methods have guided the continuing research both at Virginia and elsewhere around the world where his findings have stimulated further research.<br /><br />Tucker, in this book, takes every argument ever put forth against rebirth/reincarnation or against the compiled evidence, and subjects it to rational scrutiny, seeking to close every hole in the argument either for or against. As a logician and practicing empirical researcher for 25 years, my judgment is that he was completely successful about 95 percent of the time, and at least partially successful in all cases.<br /><br />Some evidence I found extremely interesting includes:<br />* Love appears to endure (across lives), as apparently does Anger in some cases,.<br />* The two fetal awareness cases should interest \\"right to life\\" supporters.<br />* Only very limited evidence supports the Buddhist/Hindu concept of Kamma/Karma. Admittedly, the Buddha did state that Kamma is far to complicated to even begin to think about before awakening. Apparently, kamma, as Malidoma Some stated, is something that \\"Knowledge Can't Eat.\\"<br />* The fact that almost all recorded cases indicate rebirth/reincarnation between nine and 15 months after death supports the Buddha's stance of continuous rebirth.<br /><br />On the Nature of the Research Evidence<br />Note that over 2,500 cases are on record at Virginia, and other research is availablefrom other reputable universities around the world. Note also that some evidence is quite strong, such as the 30 or so cases where Buddhist monks (or others) wrote down what a child said about their past life before anyone sought to determine whether these statements hold up in the \\"real world.\\" Solved cases are those where people or situations from the former life are verified by traveling to the place the child claims to have lived and died, and checking the accuracy of their statements. Another strong set of evidence relates to birthmarks. There are cases where forensic evidence shows where bullets entered and left a dead person's body, and the child in a different town, who claims to have been that person, exhibits puckered birthmarks of the same size and in the same places (entry smaller than exit). Stevenson finally made this research available to those of us who lack vast wealth in: Where Reincarnation and Biology Intersect. Of course, most cases provide weaker empirical evidence than these two types (roughly 98%). However, almost all of these are investigated using the best scientific research techniques available for the situations, so most are as empirically strong as they possibly can be. Further, Tucker evaluates consistencies in findings, identifies inconsistencies and is finally able, thanks to the recent entry of some 1,800 of these cases into a database, to compile statistics that allow us to understand trends and consistencies across cases and to conduct specific analyses relative to arguments against this.<br /><br />A Couple of Additional, Somewhat Tangential Notes<br />Fortunately, as scientific research has evolved following on the development of Quantum Mechanics and widespread Anthropological and other Qualitative research, social scientists today are beginning to understand that human demographic and ethnographic behaviors, and what people say, may be more important than what happens with rats in controlled experiments. Thus, mixed methods has become the a desired scientific paradigm in research on human beings, and I can personally vouch for the fact that NSF reviewers, when evaluating grant proposals, prefer that approach. Much of the research described by Tucker could be termed systematic qualitative.
0316666343|5.0|This is a great book with a great voice. The story being told by a teenage murder victim works for me in two surprising and effective ways.<br /><br />First, Alice Sebold has made the third person omniscient narrator a character, giving the narrative more punch. These aren't the detached observations of a nameless voice conjured by an author to tell a story of different lives connecting around a single event. We readers get to know Susie, the all-seeing narrator, and we get to see the children, teenagers, and adults she loved come of age, as she never got to.<br /><br /> And second, Susie's unique perspective on life (and death) ends up being one of the few hokey ways to tell us about the joy of living. Her visceral death, her longing for even the irritating details of having a living body, and her relationships (for lack of a better word) with those still on earth build a solid case for those of us still alive, to accept and enjoy it while we have it. It's hard to discuss \\"affirming life\\" without sounding cheesy--what else is there to affirm?--but there is nothing inherently wrong with life-affirming writing, only with the ways in which most writers go about it. Susie's not nostalgiac or sentimental: she's dead. The story she tells comes from her mourning herself and those she has left. After all, we don't pity the dead, we pity the living.<br /><br />The climax of the book riveted me. Some have bemoaned it as too-tidy a bow to wrap up the story with. I really liked it as the story's destination, but moreso as an intense illustration of the great pleasure we could all take in simply being alive if we only had the opportunity to have it temporarily taken away from us.<br /><br />  Without having to face a near-death experience, we readers get to feel a little of that kind of gratitude for being alive. Alice Sebold has made a piece of art that makes us taste our spit: it reminds us of how incredible it is to have a breathing body.

0060934913|4.0|Kitchen Confidential is a series of semi-chronological biographical essays(pre-Food Network) that begins as an expos&eacute; of the restaurant industry and end as an ode to the characters chef Anthony Bourdain met along the way to his dream job.<br /><br />Bourdain writes with the voice of a no-nonsense cowboy proud of his exploits - the constant references to drugs, criminal activity, and the bad language may be too much for some. Despite the moral ambivalence, we meet some truly interesting characters (including Bourdain himself) and may learn something about cooking/food generally and the restaurant industry from Kitchen Confidential. Despite the 300 pages, Bourdain's conversational style makes this book a fast read.<br /><br />Recommended for readers with strong stomachs looking for a rambunctious memoir of a chef and a few laughs.

There were at least 35 cliffhangers ... and it just got to the point where I would laugh at a new cliffhanger ... and not even care what happened to the person. That said, there was some cool/creepy technology. Cool from a purely intellectual point of view. Creepy from a human vs. Big Brother point of view. For example, mini-bots. Tiny tiny robots in the shape of bugs - literally a fly on the wall that listens to people's conversations. A person can \\"drive it\\" all over -- into and out of rooms, into and out of buildings ... and spy on people. The book left a terrible margarine taste in my mouth.
B00005JKHP|3.0|I've always enjoyed Star Trek.  Although it was never quite my favorite science fiction series, I appreciated it for what it was and simply loved many of the characters and ideals that it gave life to.  As I've gotten older, I've become most fond of the original series.  I was very young when \\"Star Trek:  The Motion Picture\\" was released, and always seemed to just miss it when it was replayed on television.  Having viewed most of the original series, I decided to pick the film up on DVD and give it a shot.  What I saw was a drab, drawn out version of the colorful, often humorous series.<br /><br />In this first film outing, an unknown alien force is making its way to Earth.  On the way, it destroys Klingon and Federation ships.  In an attempt to stop its progress and find out exactly what it is, Starfleet employs the Enterprise and her crew, headed up by Captain Decker (Stephen Collins, \\"Seventh Heaven\\").  Of course, the Enterprise without Captain Kirk (William Shatner)is like peanut butter without jelly, so Admiral Kirk boards the vessel per Starfleet and takes command.  This opens up a brief but interesting divide between Kirk and Decker.  It isn't until Kirk's conscious, Dr. McCoy (DeForest Kelley), arrives that this feud is settled.  The rest of the gang is already aboard the Enterprise, excepting Spock (Leonard Nimoy), who does eventually join up with his old comrades.  Along with Decker, a new addition to the crew is the Deltan, Ilia (Persis Khambatta), who will play a key role later in the film.<br /><br />As the Enterprise takes flight, the story of the unknown alien unfolds, and unlike most other science fiction stories set in space at that time, there is very little dogfighting between starships, hungry aliens or laser duels.  Instead, there's a refreshing yet very \\"Star Trek\\" tale of a misdirected being looking for guidance.  It's a wonderful story, but it's poorly executed.<br /><br />In this DVD, the Director's Cut, Robert Wise takes Alan Dean Foster's epic story and draws it out to its limits.  There are long sequences highlighting the vastness of space, the massive size of the alien entity, and even San Francisco Bay.  Mind you, they are all very impressive to look at, but I feel as if some of them could have been a bit shorter.  The team that dressed up this version of the film did many wonders with backdrops, sound fx and even the musical score.  Perhaps the greatest improvements are those of the planet Vulcan, which looks simply brilliant in this film.  The improvements, for the most part, are seamlessly tied into the 1979 film.<br /><br />Jerry Goldsmith's score is brilliant.  If any one thing keeps you from becoming too bored with this film, it's the music.  Goldsmith masterfully captures the adventurous and epic feel of this film.<br /><br />The cast do a decent job.  While Nichelle Nichols, George Takei and Walter Koenig are relegated to window dressing for the most part, James Doohan and DeForest Kelley do get a little more time to shine.  As expected, Shatner and Nimoy are at the forefront of the film.  Collins does an excellent job as the somewhat jilted Decker.  Persis Khambatta proves that bald can be beautiful and she's simply a wonder to look at on the screen.  Fans of the series will also note the presence of popular series regulars Majel Barrett (Dr. Chapel) and Grace Lee Whitney (Rand).<br /><br />The special features on this film are very nice.  Highlights include a brief documentary on the ups-and-downs of getting the film to the screen, a neat look at the development of the new fx for the Director's Cut, and scenes from the original film that were deleted or altered for this updated version.  Also included are scenes from the TV release of the film that were not in the theatrical release.  Other obligatory extras can also be found.<br /><br />For true fans of the original series, this is sure to be a treat.  It was very much welcomed when it was first released due to the fact that the serieshad been off the air for so long.  I'm sure that lifetime fans will also appreciate the updates made to this film.  However, when compared to the rest of the Star Trek films (including the TNG ones) and, most importantly, the original series, this film is merely a hint as to what great stories were to come.  Recommended for fans of Star Trek, completionists who want all of the films in the series, and fans of smart sci-fi who don't necessarily need to see a blaster or dogfight every five minutes to keep them interested.ime fans will also appreciate the updates made to this film.

1416550518|4.0|Kate Morton's charming debut novel delves into the secrets that 98-year-old Grace Bradley has held close nearly all her life. When a young filmmaker contacts Grace during the making of a movie about a tragic death at Riverton, the manor where Grace spent her youth as a housemaid, Grace's long-suppressed memories of her years at Riverton come flooding back.    The young Grace entered Riverton as a naïve teenager, pressed into service at the great house by her embittered and secretive mother, who herself had been a maid there until her dismissal under ignominious conditions, the details of which Grace learns only after her mother's death. Grace takes her place among the servants who pride themselves on flawless service and self-denying, unswerving loyalty. Into this world of Grace's enter the master's grandchildren, David, Hannah and Emmeline, whom a spellbound Grace watches from a distance over the years. It is Hannah in particular --- of the same age as Grace, beautiful, impetuous and beating her wings furiously in a bid to escape her gilded cage --- who most fascinates Grace.    All of these young people's lives are irrevocably altered by the onset of the First World War. The war that claims the sons of England's finest families, builds and ruins fortunes, and upends Edwardian mores and class structure to replace them with the roaring flapper '20s, also ravages the lives of the residents of Riverton, both upstairs and downstairs.    After Hannah's sudden marriage to Teddy Luxton, brought on by the family's altered circumstances, Grace follows Hannah to the wealthy and vulgar Luxton home as her personal maid. There, Grace increasingly becomes Hannah's confidante and friend, \\"more like a sister than a maid.\\" Hannah's relationship with her own sister, Emmeline, is permanently ruptured by the re-entrance into their lives of Robbie Hunter, a childhood friend of David's and now a famous poet. When Robbie is killed during a party at Riverton, the death is declared a suicide brought on by a nervous breakdown of the kind suffered by many young men after the war. But of the three who knew the whole truth behind that story, only Grace remains. Will she able to finally reveal the secrets --- her own and that of others --- that she has spent a lifetime hiding?    Much of the plot summary above is revealed to the reader early in the story, perhaps too early. The drama in THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON lies not in learning what happened but in understanding how the central characters are shaped by the events that unfold both in their lives and in the world at large. Although we see the story through Grace's eyes, she herself remains an enigma to the end: her steadfast determination to stay with Hannah at great cost to herself demands an explanation, at least to the modern reader, which never comes. Perhaps in this day and age, we cannot fathom the kind of blind loyalty to her mistress that would cause a young woman to summarily reject the opportunity to claim for herself a life, a family and even the chance to reach a more equal footing with her mistress.    The central themes of the book --- the brutal price exacted by war, the futility of trying to escape one's past, and the tragedy of being a slave to duty even while longing for a different fate --- play out in different ways in the main characters' lives, each of whom has suffered terribly by the book's end. Yet the author manages, within that context, to give a larger purpose and meaning to Grace's life, and allows her finally to transcend her birth and circumstances in life while still remaining unapologetically true to her roots.    Kate Morton's first novel has been very successful in her native Australia and in the U.K., and is sure to do well during its American release. I imagine bidding for movie rights is either underway or will be soon, for this is a story that will lend itself well to cinematic treatment. It is a lovingly told, meticulously researched fictional work that faithfully recreates the lives of the rich (and the poor who live in their shadows) during the early years of the last century, providing an engaging view into a historic time in our recent past, and a bird's-eye view into the lives of the servant underclass that supported the British upper crust.    THE HOUSE AT RIVERTON has a gentle and old-fashioned charm to it, which makes it the perfect companion to a rainy day, a comfy chair and a cup of tea.        --- Reviewed by Usha Reynolds

0312360266|2.0|I expected more from this book - mainly because it was recommended after the \\"Twilight\\" series by Stephanie Meyer, which I liked.  While the concept was interesting, the actual writing was annoying.  Yes, I understand that this was written from the point of view of a teenager; but does the writing have to be so, well, tween?  There were way too many asides in parentheses, and they didn't add anything to the prose.  In fact it was just the opposite - I found that they detracted from the story as a whole.  This might have been intentional stoytelling device, to make you feel like you were reading her diary or listening to the thoughts in her head, but honestly, the effect was horrible.  This book gets 2 stars instead of one because the idea was good.  I just wish the writing had been up to the job.  In the interest of full disclosure, I am well over the suggested age range, but I find that good writing tends to transcend age recomendations.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|I saw the movie at a pre-release screening and had a blast. Bought the soundstrack and was SHOCKED that the closing credits songs were NOT included!  Where is Meryl Streep singing \\"Waterloo\\"??  There IS a hidden track on the CD, but that is not it.
1594200106|5.0|Shadow of the Wind is a book that leaves you breathless. It is a beautiful mix of Gothic darkness and allegorical light. It has mystery, romance, danger and humor in just the right proportions. It is a homage to literature and reading and the magical journey that happens when you open a book that touches your heart and soul. Everything about this novel works ..........the coming of age story of Daniel,  the mystery surrounding Carax ,the  setting and political history of Barcelona, the amazing characterization of Fermin.etc, etc, etc. Once you have  read it, it will linger forever in the shadows of your mind  never, ever  to  disappear into the cemetery of forgotten books. This novel  truly cast a giant shadow for me!!!!
0061122416|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading this magical story of Santiago who was seeking an adventure and dared to follow his dreams. He learned many lessons and acquired wisdom along his path of exploration. This book is written simplistically, but captivates you and draws you into the storyline in a powerful manner. The story setting in the majestic mountains of Andulusia are described as a beautiful place in which Santiago pursued his dreams and found hidden treasures. It is a book that is powerful and provactively written, a good read.
0439806119|5.0|I am an 8th grade teacher and several of my students begged me to read this book to them during homeroom so I agreed. It did not take long for me to get just as hooked on this story as my students were as it is an incredible story. The writing is incredible and Westerfeld masterfully paints vivid pictures of this futuristic society.     The only thing that I hated was that nobody told me that this was book 1 of a trilogy. When I finished reading the book to my students literally the last week of school I pretty much yelled out when I got to the end and found out that it was not over. As soon as the summer started I went and bought Pretties and Specials and finished both in a couple of days.    What a great book to get lost in. Do not get discouraged that it is promoted as a \\"teen novel\\" because every adult who I know has read it feels the same way as I do - they love this series!
630542845X|4.0|A mother, about to give birth, is struck by lightning. She dies; the baby lives. He is an albino who has special powers. He can harness energy, has a special relationship with lightning and electricity, is psychic, is a child of nature, and is a genius who tests off the scale. He is brought up by his grandparents on a farm; they keep him out of school and away from other children. He reads and remembers every word of countless books.<br /> When he is left alone after their deaths, and is forced into society (nicknamed Powder played by actor Sean Patrick Flanery), he encounters resentment, intolerance, bullying, fear, and hatred. Estranged, he finds friendships in a reform school principal (Mary Steenburgen), a science teacher (Jeff Goldblum), a female classmate, and a sheriff.<br />An interesting movie worth your time, but aren't you tired of schoolyard bullies, small town prejudiced cretins, and disaffected teens? There's a world of hurt, torment, and hatred out there for an alienated kid that looks like Michael Jackson and Marcel Marceau.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|A long-time favoritel; a classic.  Have always wanted to own this movie and am nothing less than ecstatic!  Many thanks!!!!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|The most noticeable and amazing feature of this miniseries is the production design, including sets, locations, costumes, makeup and more.  Someone went to great length to ensure the authenticity of the look and feel of the filming, from the discolored teeth to the unpaved roads to the powder in the men's wigs.  This reveals that much care and concern were at work here.  The acting, especially by Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney, is top-notch; these two performers are at the top of their game here, and I hope they were or will be nominated.  Their chemistry helps them to show the love between John and Abigail Adams through all the difficulties of their life together, including the loss of a son, John's struggles with the new American republic, and his extended absence overseas while his family remains at home.    The actors playing Washington, Jefferson, and Franklin also deserve praise for their portrayal of these flawed yet profoundly influential men.  It is sobering to note that these founding fathers wanted peace rather than war, and that they remained firm in their belief in trying to do the right thing and uphold the Constitution rather than cave in to others who would have pressured them to compromise on their values.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|Having been an Al Green fan from the 70's, its great to hear his silky smooth groove again!  Takes you back yet sounds new and hip as ever!  Al's got it goin' on from the opening with \\"Lay it Down.\\" Slide into \\"You've Got the Love I Need\\" & \\"What More Do You Want From Me\\" to get you moving.  \\"Take Your Time\\" is a slow, sexy song with Corrine Baily Rae that's sure to please!  Al hasn't missed a step - good to hear him back!
0385338724|5.0|It's been awhile since a book grabbed me from the first page, but this one did.  The characters are very well-developed and interesting from the beginning, and the addition of the mystery surrounding the lost memory and her transformation make for a very compelling story.  I found myself actively rooting for Lexi - willing her to see what was so painfully obvious!  And yet, despite the fact that maybe she's a bit too trusting and might come across as a bit dense (I mean, really, why couldn't she see what was so painfully obvious?) she's eminently likeable.  Who knows how anyone would react being thrust into that situation?  It's a frightening scenario, and I think the flaws in her lent a great deal of credibility to the story.  And you're willing her to have the storybook happy ending.<br /><br />As for the ending, I won't give anything away but I will say (despite the true cheesiness of the last line) I was impressed.  It was handled very well and... I liked it.  It was a great finish to an engrossing story.<br /><br />Though I like the Shopaholic books, this one is in a league of its own.  Okay, yes, it is still a 'chick' book, but one of the better done ones.  I think it would make a brilliant movie.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes chick-lit, and even a few people who aren't so keen on it.  Try it, it might surprise you.
B00177Y9ZC|4.0|[[ASIN:1432715186 A Walk Through Life]]If you fatasize about scaling the world than watch Hayden Christensen teleport to the most breathtaking places!        Following up his blockbuster action hit Mr. and Mrs. Smith, director Doug Liman turns to an entirely new genre -- sci-fi -- for this tale of an underground world of teleporters. Based on the novel by Steven Gould, Jumper concerns David (Hayden Christensen), a young man who quite literally wills himself away from his grim family life by teleporting to another place with the power of his mind. Years later, David is using his powers to raid bank vaults, seduce girls in London, lunch on the pyramids, and surf in Fiji. But he soon discovers that he is not the only one bestowed with this unique gift, and all is not well in the world of jumpers. There are people out there, such as Roland (Samuel L. Jackson), who view jumpers as a threat to all humankind, and have made it their mission in life to eliminate them. After jumping back to Michigan to get reacquainted with his long lost love, Millie (Rachel Bilson), David makes the acquaintance of experienced jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell). Informed by Griffin of a secret between jumpers and a shadowy group that seeks to destroy them, the pair soon finds themselves facing off against a legion of murderous opponents who won't stop fighting until every last jumper has been eliminated.

B000000Y2F|4.0|\\"Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane\\" is a somewhat odd mixture of tracks from different Thelonious Monk recording sessions.  Nonetheless, it is an essential purchase for Monk/Trane-a-philes due to the absolute brilliance of the 3 of its 6 tracks which feature the legendary Thelonious Monk/John Coltrane Quartet.       Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane are two of the most seminal figures in the history of jazz. Yet in spite of the acknowledged significance of their brief tenure together in a working band in 1957, until fairly recently there was a dearth of recorded material documenting that union. Up to the point of the release of \\"Discovery!- Live at the Five Spot\\" in 1993 (more on that later), the \\"Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane\\" album contained  the only recorded evidence of  the Monk quartet with Coltrane.   The reputation of this album is mostly based on that fact.    There are 3 golden performances on this album by the Monk-Trane quartet and they are all absolutely indispensable:   \\"Ruby,My Dear\\",  \\"Trinkle, Tinkle\\", and \\"Nutty\\".     It is impossible to say enough good things about these tracks and they are the primary reason to obtain this album.         Contrary to several reviews here at Amazon,  the three Monk-Trane quartet tracks on this album were not recorded live at the Five Spot.   They were recorded at Reeves Sound Studios in NYC in July of 1957.   The only known recorded evidence of the Monk-Trane quartet live at the Five Spot is on the \\"Discovery! Live at the Five Spot\\" album.    Because, unfortunately, there were only 3 tracks from the July, 1957 studio session - the rest of this album had to be filled out.  The \\"filler\\" consists of two alternate tracks from the \\"Monk's Music\\" septet sessions (relatively brief re-workings of \\"Off Minor\\" and \\"Epistrophy\\") and one solo Monk track (a long alternate of \\"Functional\\" from the \\"Monk Himself\\" sessions - solo Monk is always a welcome addition).   While these three tracks are all quite good, they just don't measure up to the brilliance of the quartet material.    With the release of the newly discovered Monk/Trane Carnegie Hall Concert there are now 3 albums/cds featuring the Monk/Trane quartet:    1) \\"Thelonious Monk with John Coltrane\\" - the 3 brilliant studio tracks - all recorded in excellent sound quality;    2) \\"Discovery! Live at the Five Spot\\" - The only known live recording of the Monk/Trane Quartet performing at their legendary Five Spot engagement in NYC.  This recording features absolutely dreadful sound quality as it was recorded non-professionally by Trane's wife at the time (the namesake of \\"Naima\\");    3) \\"Thelonious Monk Quartet with John Coltrane at Carnegie Hall\\" - This is it - the one to get.   It is rare that a \\"newly discovered\\" recording can instantly obtain status as one of the greatest jazz recordings ever made - but that is exactly what has happened with this VOA recording that was discovered sitting on the shelf and was subsequently released by Blue Note in 2005 with a buzz that reached beyond the insular world of jazz.  This is the missing link - a full live concert of the Monk/Trane Quartet at the top of their game and recorded in excellent sound quality.      In summary, if you want to check out Monk/Trane Quartet at their best, this album (\\"Thelonious Monk with John Colrane\\" - with its 3 studio tracks) and the Carnegie Hall concert are the purchases to make.   The release of the Carnegie Hall concert has made the \\"Discovery! Live at the Five Spot\\" with it's dreadful sound quality something for completists and absolute Monk/Trane fanatics only (ok - yeah, I own it).    Together, the 3 studio tracks on this album and the Carnegie Hall concert represent not only the best of the Monk/Trane quartet but some of the most important recorded music in the history of jazz - absolutely indispensable.
B00132D808|4.0|Upon hearing the first hit from \\"Pretty.Odd\\", called \\"Nine In The Afternoon\\". my reaction was to make accusations against the band that they are nothing but Sargent Pepper rip off artists, down to the string and brass instruments. What nerve these \\"emos\\" had, i thought.<br /><br /> However, despite their obvious \\"influence\\" by John,Paul,George and Ringo, with each listen i couldnt help but like the song, becouse to be honest, its a pretty good sounding song.<br /><br />So i decided to give the other songs a preview here on Amazon, and i was pleasantly surprised. I heard what sounded like some genuinely inspired stuff. The previews were impressive enough  for me to actually go and purchase the physical album it self. Though i wasnt completely sure it was going to be a good album, i had a pretty good hunch for some reason that these guys just might of worked together something some what special.<br /><br />So i leave Target, hop in my car with the new cd in hand and begin to unwrap and open it. I turn on the car, and just when im about to feed the cd player with the disc, something pretty odd happens....the radio starts to play \\"A Day In The Life\\" by the Beatles.<br /><br />Was this a sign? Was it the spirit of The Beatles blessing these new tunes i was about to embark on listening to? Or was it a warning from the ghosts of john and george to \\"listen to the real beatles instead of those emo clown posers!\\". Who knows.<br /><br />I respectfully listened to the entire Beatles song as i made my way to the interstate.  Once it finally reached its big orchestral build up at the end and fades out, i took a breath and poped in \\"Pretty.Odd\\"<br /><br />And i must tell you, the experience was pretty pleasant! I didnt think this album would be this good, let alone did i think that id ever take to liking anything made by the likes of \\"Panic At The Disco\\", which i wrote off as trendy scene kid music with no substance. Since i experienced \\"Pretty.Odd\\", i now feel PanicAtTheDisco has a chance in the long run, i no longer think they will disappear with the \\"scene\\".<br /><br />All that is to let you know where im coming from. I originally didnt take this band serious in the least and now ive been swayed to think otherwise.<br /><br />The opening of the cd is a short intro that is an exciting little build up for whats to come. And of course it goes right into \\"Nine In The Afternoon\\" seemlessly. And like i said before, its a good tune, despite how they borrow (or steal?!) from the Beatles, i cant deny how i much i like the song.<br /><br />The next track that stood out was \\"Do You Know What Im Seeing?\\"<br />A memorable chorus that i cant seem to get enough of. The first track that surprised me, heightening my anticipation for what lye ahead in this album.<br /><br />Track 5,\\"That Green Gentleman...\\" became the albums 2nd radio hit. Its not bad, its actually worth listening too, but ive heard it enough on the radio, so i usually skip it, but you should give it a listen, its not filler. Its another one of the stand out songs, though not my favorite.<br /><br />Now \\"I Have Friends In Holy Spaces\\" is a brief tune, that sounds like something from the olden days, like one of those guys with a derby hat on playing one of those tiny ukalali guitars, something out of the early 1900's; but not to give it that much props. Its a funny sounding song, and a little corny, but i like it, i never skip it. Its fun.<br /><br />Next that really impressed me was the song called \\"When The Day Met The Night\\".  This song reminded me of the band \\"CHICAGO\\". Wow.horns and all. And isnt that a compliment for this little band called 'Panic At The Disco' even though its a minor resemblance here i noticed that some people might not have noticed.<br />I swear, if they keep up work like this, they will have really earned my respect. Songs like this totally change your prejudice towards a band such as this that initially is written off as mere shallow scene kid garbage. But oh no,i dont think i can ignore Panic At The Disco any longer. That was a bigger suprise than the other song.<br /><br />Right after that memorable tune comes yet another memorable tune, perhaps even a bit lovable...  \\"Pas de Cheval\\"  (meaning 'STEP OF THE HORSE' in French) is probably my personal favorite out of all the songs that stood out to me.  It just has more of that optimistic sound and chorus. Just something about i love to hear. One of the best tunes on this album for sure.<br /><br />\\"The Piano Knows Something I Dont Know\\" took a few listens actually to get into, but its worth noting that its one of the stand out tracks thats a little more sophisticated, if i dare use that word here. And may i dare go further and say it sounds like the band might of took a lesson from Brian Wilson in the lyrics department. A bit silly, but has depth.<br />Another good song i must admit.<br /><br />Now \\"She Had The World\\" has some inspired instrumentation with what sounds like a harpsichord? Memorable background music that gets some decent vocals to accompany it. That and the string and woodwind/flute instruments are quite warm and memorable here. Yet again another track that gets a thumbs up for good sounds.<br /><br />\\"From A Mountain In The Middle Of The Cabins\\". Another worthy tune?<br />Sadly, i must say that...YES....its good. hahaha. I only lament over having to type more good things about this album.<br />This song took me multiple listens before i noticed how good it was. One of the more complex of the songs...sort of. Strings and brass are arranged interestingly giving it a sort of wonder. And the whistling near the latter half of song just puts the icing on the cake. Ive never listened to something that has made me feel close the innocent happiness i felt listening to 60s music.  Though i wouldnt say its the same feeling, but its similar, and this is the last band id think would ever make me feel like that.<br /><br />So ya....its all pretty darn odd if you ask me! Its either im on something, or this band actually produced something special here, and im part of Gen Y, not a 60s flower child. ive never done any psychotropic drugs....so i think we can rule that option out.  The evidence mounting is in favor of the latter reason: That PANIC AT THE DISCO is causing a genuine panic over people who first ruled them out as emo poser crap, like myself.<br /><br />Anyways...let me continue before going off the deep end.<br /><br />The final track ill mention, is , well....the final track on the cd.<br />And....well....just listen. If you liked anything the band SilverChair did with their album Young Modern , then i think you'll enjoy this. Apart from any of that, i liked it because its another good song. A uplifted, memorable tune. A fine little ending to a surprisingly impressive sophomore release.<br /><br />Now maybe this band took liberties with the whole \\"Beatles Imitation\\" thing. But when you shut up and listen and stop hating, you cant deny, this album sounds pretty good.<br /><br />I almost cant believe im even saying that!<br /><br />So it seems the mysterious occurrence of the \\"A Day In The Life\\" Beatles song playing on the radio wasnt a curse. No. Its as if the spirit of John,Paul,George and Ringo gave it their blessing.<br /><br />This cd is worth getting. It is and i didnt think id be giving two cents about \\"Panic At The Disco\\". Turns out i gave exactly $12.99 for it haha. But well worth it. I think my generation needs more music leaning in this direction.<br /><br />And despite it borrowing heavily,so it seems, from other men's genius... for a band like this to at all succeed in imitating any of it, i think deserves honorable mention. I think if the Beatles heard this album now, i think they just might be flattered.<br /><br />And again, i didnt think id EVER say such a thing.<br /><br />For a pop/rock album....i give it 4 stars for its handful of memorable good tunes.<br /><br />GOOD JOB, PANIC AT THE DISCO. GOOD EFFORT.song.

0375842209|2.0|Zusak is an amazing writer; flowery, poetic, original. However -- this book could have easily been trimmed by 200 pages. It took forever to get to plot points and the pacing is, well, painfully slow. I couldn't wait to finish it. By far, the book's best part is the last 150 pages where we see Zusak at his best and the book (and the story) finally moves along.
B00069FLC2|5.0|An absolute must for every Shadow fan.  This DVD does include almost every \\"tophit\\" of this group from the end of the fiftees and later in the perfect style as we used to hear from Hank Marvin,Bruce Welch,Brian Bennet and the rest of this group.  The DVD does show the group playing \\"live\\" in the UK (the final tour) and  an interview with Hank Marvin,Bruce Welch and Brian Bennet.  Especially lead gitar player Hank Marvin did impress me due to his simpleness in his explanations and in his personality,this time in the \\"focus\\" instead on the background, were he used to show up.  British Gentlemen..was my impression.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|As a fan of Baum's original works, this has always been my most favorite film version of his world.     And as a child of the 1980s, this film has always had nostalgic appeal. Yes, the film scared me as a child. But that very darkness, mixed with the light fairy tale images, the violence and the childish sense of logic and imagination, is also much closer to Baum's wonderful Oz.     The film comes from the Golden Age of Fantasy Films, the 1980s. The time when they knew how to make clever, visually-imaginative, and often dark fantasy films for children. Return to Oz is absolutely beautiful and perfect. The special effects and production design is better than most films today that are overly CGIed without the same heart and spirit as the Jim Henson company instilled in every film.    I know that the 1939 musical is considered an unparalleled classic, but it has a very plastic and staged feel. It lacks the spirit of Baum's works. Although Return to Oz is often criticsized (and, I believe it bombed at the box office at the time), it has a special place in the hearts of children who grew up with it, as well as fans of the original works.    First of all, the film much more accurately portrays Oz and is much more loyal to the books. Dorothy (perfectly portrayed) is the right age, for starters. Not only do many things more closely resemble the illustrations of the books (especially the characters and the Emerald City), but the world looks much more real and occupied than the 1938 version. The mood of the film is also much closer to Baum's works, mixing silly childish logic and imagination (building the Gump) with darkness and danger of a child in a strange world (the fear of turning into an ornament or to stone or having your head cut off). The film is just as magical and mystical as Baum's books.     Second, I love seeing Oz as \\"fallen\\". The Yellow Brick Road reclaimed by nature. The Emerald City crumbling and the people all turned to stone. The Gnome King's palace wherepeople are turned into ornaments. The theme, ironically, of the story is trying to return home doesn't always meet your high expectations and desires. Fits for a film constantly compared to the 1938 musical. Even in a fairyworld, things change and fall away.     This DVD is in widescreen, which is the only way to ever see any movie. There are some cool special features, including a recent interview with the star, Balk. But, best of all, is the film itself, and being able to revisit a childhood favorite for all of us that grew up in the 80s.
B000A2G8K4|5.0|I'm a big and constant Purple fan and finally added this edition to my collection. There is no comments on this. In Rock is a brilliant foundation-stone of hard rock. We know it. Just some words about this recording I have got.Let me quote [...]  \\"A remixed and extended anniversary edition was first issued with a slaughtered version of \\"Living wreck\\" and a prematurely cut-off version of \\"Hard lovin' man\\". This was soon corrected though. In case of doubt, according to Simon Robinson (in DTB 48:7), one way to tell a corrected release from a faulty one is by reading the shiny side of the actual disc: the faulty one says \\"EMI Swindon\\" while the corrected one says \\"EMI Uden\\". We are told by fans that discs printed with \\"EMI UK\\" also are faulty. Happy hunting!\\"   When I first saw a booklet with the faulty track length printed I got goose bumps, then I found EMI Uden on shiny side and listening of record approves that this is the correct one. On the one hand this is a little strange to get the faulty booklet along with the correct recording today but on the other hand this is a real collector's piece.   Btw, sound quality of this edition is very good. I have to say it once again: Happy hunting!
B00150B2SS|3.0|The strongest feature of this novel is the beautifully created atmosphere of psychological fog that pervades everything. You can't trust no one, you can't really know if any information is true or false or only an incomplete version of truth .... The whole novel serves as a sort of philosophical reflection on loyalty and trust in human interactions. The spy world, with its experts in deception, is a metaphor for the fact that man is such a complex creature that no one really knows another person in its entirety.     This is a British spy story but it is not a James Bond kind of a story. There are no car chases or gadgets. Our \\"super spy\\", George Smiley, is a 50 something short guy who is somewhat over weight and wear thick glasses. Unlike Bond, Smiley is not a ladies man. In fact, he is faithfully married to a beautiful unfaithful woman. Smiley's main talent is rational analysis of information and perceptiveness. The premise of story is that there is a \\"rotten apple\\" in the highest level of British intelligence That is, a high ranking member of British intelligence who is betraying his country and Smiley's job is to find him. Betrayal of all kinds, whether real or imagined, is the central obsession of the characters who populate this spy world.     The major weakness of the novel is its unnecessary complexity.  For instance, the novel evolves in non-linear fashion in time. There are flash backs in time on a constant basis. One extreme instance, we had few paragraphs of past, a paragraph in present time then back to past and then back again to present and then back to past and once again to present in less than 10 pages of a 350 page novel!  A relatively minor character (a Russian cultural attache who is \\"running'\\" the mole) is refered to by 4 names (his real name, a fake \\"cover name\\" for his British assignment, another fake cover name for his junior colleagues in Russian intelligence and, lastly but not least, a nickname, Poly, assigned to him by British intelligence).     There is a BBC mini-series based on the novel which is far easier to follow. You might be better off watching that than trying to decipher the novel.  This might be one of the rare instances, where the adaptation exceeds the original novel.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|Touching and thought provoking, this movie was well written, beautifully filmed and highly believable. The acting from all the main actors was excellent with particular credit due to the actor playing the main character, Zach. The soundtrack also deserves a mention and was very well done. Highly recommended.
0143038419|1.0|I was flabergasted at the lack of sensitivity this woman portrayed toward others thoughts and practices. Frankly, I wanted to laugh at what she considers suffering. At times when she described  having to go to a cold bathroom floor and beg \\"God\\" to help her escape the misery of her poor life. How many people could only wish for a cold bathroom floor and in Manhattan no less. Very self absorbed and pitiful. 0 stars !
B000AP04NI|5.0|My ALL TIME FAVORITE and a MUST see for any \\"musical\\" enthusiast. Good story and video and the best music around. Fun for the entire family.
B0017MO10U|5.0|I have seen the movie.  This one is WAY better than the Ark of Truth.  Maybe I was just sick of the Ori, but Continuum flows better, there are fewer holes, and it doesn't build up for 1.5 hours just to end in 5 minutes.  Absolutely worth buying!  The worst thing about the movie is that Jack is getting fat.  I know, doesn't really have much to do with the movie per se, but it was depressing nonetheless.  You'll get to see a few old familiar faces, some of whom were killed off long ago, and the alternate timeline thing works really well.  The special effects are top-notch.  I was highly critical (to myself) of The Ark of Truth, but this is a far more believable story and is interesting from beginning to end.  I miss the original Stargate series, and if you do too you will be pleased with Continuum.  7 stars out of 5!
B000YABIQ6|5.0|From the first episode, I was hooked! It's definitely something special. Visually fun to look at as it's set in the 1960's, but also just a well executed show - with great writing/performances from the actors/actresses. It's a lot of fun to watch. I highly recommend!
B0016Q56C4|2.0|While Journey to the Center of the Earth will readily appeal to its target audience of youngsters and the easily impressed, its ridiculous story won't earn the respect of any longtime Jules Verne fans. The jokes alternate between rather amusing and blatantly failed, but the creative implementation of 3D effects pleasantly surprise, balancing out the whole Journey into a much more palatable affair.<br /><br />Everyone knows you can't travel to the center of the Earth. Everyone except for publicly criticized science professor Trevor Anderson (Brendan Fraser), who journeys to the mythical \\"world within a world\\" to unravel the mystery surrounding the disappearance of this brother. Accompanying him is his nephew Sean (Josh Hutcherson) and their pretty mountain guide Hannah (Anita Briem) who will join in his fantastic adventures in a lost land of terrifying creatures and prehistoric danger.<br /><br />Glowing hummingbirds, magnetic floating rocks, and giant carnivorous plants may sound pretty silly, and that's because they are. However, when such creations are thrown into a 3D movie they become spectacular moments of visual brilliance. Except perhaps the floating rocks. But Journey does well in its main reason for existence, and generates an ample amount of creative uses for its medium. From things jumping out of the screen, to more things jumping out of the screen, Journey wastes no opportunity to throw every manner of object or deadly creature at its audience, resulting in an abundance of visual stimulation and a noticeable absence on solid storytelling. At least the former was expected.<br /><br />The true \\"Verneian\\" will be dismayed to learn that little remains familiar between this latest adventure to the Earth's core and the original novel. And while it may be unfair to compare it to the book or even the 1959 film, director Eric Brevig's vision often feels like an excuse to use a famous title rather than a sincere adaptation. Goofy comedy replaces earnest, though farfetched, explanations and the unfriendly locale thrives on stereotypical monstrosities designed specifically for dimensional effects. Odd musical bouts aside, the '59 version utilizes a human antagonist for an extra layer of depth on a film already submerged deep within the Earth's crust, and a race for discovery accompanies the challenge of survival. This new Journey substitutes in a young boy for a young man, a bumbling scientist for a genius professor, and an animated avian for an Icelandic handyman, but at least the female protagonist remains, this time in the form of a mountain guide. Unfortunately all elements of drama and romance take a backseat to the outlandish action and phosphorescent birds.<br /><br />If curiosity (or the kids) gets the better of you and you must take this Journey, make sure you see it in 3D. Otherwise, once the story rapidly tires, the only thing you'll be able to fall back on is the headrest of your theater chair.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinss and the unfriendly locale thrives on stereotypical monstrosities designed specifically for dimensional effects.

0061367036|5.0|I'd first heard about this book on a \\"Supernatural\\" fansite, and right away, I knew it would make a great read and it was the kind of book the series begged to have written: something that cataloged and expanded on the lore of the dozens of creatures which the Winchester brothers have tussled with over the course of the series -- and a few they *haven't* tussled with yet, which makes me wonder what lies ahead for next season! The first person POV makes it seem like the boys are relating their experiences to you first hand, and the excerpts from John Winchester's journal give you all the details you could ask for on the creatures he's dealt with and the life of a hunter. An excellent addition to an excellent series!
B000WPXTCY|1.0|The book is poorly written and poorly organized.  The book covers very similar types of processes using different syntax without explaining why it used different VB code, so one wonders what why it uses one type of code here and another type of code there.  Literally, the book has codes which, when I type verbatim, generates errors.  Thoroughly frustrating book.  Breezing and useless.
B000YDOOUK|5.0|In a world dominated by hip- hop and so- called \\"nu- metal,\\" it's great to see a new trend developing in rock music- there are several bands rising up right now pumping out some excellent rock 'n roll. Airbourne returns to the roots of good ol' rock 'n roll that ruled the airwaves back in the 70's (arguably the best era of rock music).      There's nothing deep or introspective about this album- it's all about boozing it up and getting laid. It's Friday night party music, and there's not a weak track on the entire album.    No doubt that some people will dismiss this band as AC/DC \\"wannabees\\" or crticised for being a one-trick pony (none of the songs really deviate from one another: it's all the classic 3- chord progressive rock much in the vain of AC/DC). However, the music is very tight and there are some excellent (albeit short) guitar riffs. This is a talented group of musicians. More importantly, this album really lifts the spirits and gets you popping open those cans of beer. It's what rock 'n roll is meant to be. Excellent!    Standout tracks include:  \\"Stand Up For Rock'Roll\\"  \\"Runnin' Wild\\"  \\"Too Much, Too Young, Too Fast\\"  \\"Blackjack\\"  \\"What's Eating You\\"  \\"Heartbreaker\\"
B0013J9KOO|3.0|Visually breathtaking, Hellboy II is essentially director Guillermo del Toro's Star Wars. Minus the space travel, Hellboy is Han Solo, full of wit and sarcasm, and longing for adventure and romance. His area of uniqueness is solely in the humor that surrounds and drives many of the story's elements; sadly Hellboy's design is perhaps the least creative aspect of the film. This second chapter adds more oddities and monstrosities than ever before and enthralls with practical creature effects where possible, and stunning computer animation everywhere in between. But the legends and myths Grand Guignol still lacks what the first film did - it is a banquet of visual delights, but when the feast is over, we're still conspicuously empty.<br /><br />Legend tells of an unstoppable army of golden automatons that were used in the wars between the spiritual world and humans. A truce was struck that allowed humans to frequent the cities, and the trolls, elves, fairies and other mythical creatures to inhabit the forests. The golden army was locked away, to lie dormant for all time. But a crown was forged that controlled the mechanical army, and although split into three parts to ensure its safekeeping, it has become the target for nefarious masterminds.<br /><br />Not content with his people hiding away from the humans, Prince Nuada (Luke Goss) seeks out the fragments of the crown to regain control of the golden army. His intent is to destroy humankind so that the creatures of the occult can walk freely through the streets. But the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense, led by the crimson demon abomination Hellboy (Ron Perlman), isn't about to let that happen. Joined by fellow BPRD agents, including the pyrokinetic Liz Sherman (Selma Blair), aquatic empath Abraham Sapien (Doug Jones) and protoplasmic wizard Johann Krauss (Seth McFarlane), the always cocky, wisecracking Hellboy is destined to throw a wrench into the schemes of Nuada. But will it be enough to save the very world that fears the likes of Hellboy?<br /><br />Our rubicund protagonist is tormented with the idea of defending a civilization that will never understand him. As with most superheroes, the antagonists are oftentimes the humans that naturally fear the abnormal (or paranormal). To combat his inner conflictions, he dwells on cynicism and contempt for his superiors, who are unable to control his flaring temper. The humor in the film is the defining point of singularity for Hellboy's blueprint; this much comedy is rarely seen in an alien-heavy superhero movie, let alone a comic book adaptation (although the BPRD is rapidly turning into the MIB). While most take great care to convey every science fiction constituent as seriously as possible, Hellboy relishes in the ability to create awkward, laugh-inducing situations.<br /><br />There's still too much posing for the camera from all of the main characters (villains especially), but the introduction of dozens of new fantastical deviations drowns out the typical overdose of heroic photo stances. The Troll Market is del Toro's Mos Eisley Cantina, and serves to give audiences a glimpse at the creative geniuses behind the character designs. Crafted almost entirely with practical effects, the swarm of humorously preternatural monsters could lead to infinite derivative storylines, provided Hellboy acquires the same following as Star Wars. Too bad the chief antagonist is the most boring new character in the film.<br /><br />The action is still great, the creativity is on hyperspeed, but the story couldn't be less generic. Centuries-old evil awakening to battle Earth is not a new idea, but visually del Toro still makes it august. Taking the easy way out on unsolvable predicaments, getting a bit thick on the romance, and always going for laughs or visuals over sensibility, Hellboy II: The Golden Army can't quite seem to heat things up.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinslikes of Hellboy?

B000VWE5OY|4.0|Edgier, sexier and more action packed than [[ASIN:B000E41MS6 Doctor Who]] (still, no comparison!). Torchwood is a pretty darn good show. This show is a blend between [[ASIN:B000UZDO5I The X-Files]] (Jack and Gwen have been referred to as Mulder and Scully many times) and [[ASIN:B0017MO11O Stargate Atlantis]].<br /><br />The show is about Torchwood, an organization created by Queen Victoria when she first encountered The Doctor back in the day, to protect Queen and Country. Each episode is in the format of \\"monster of the week\\" where Torchwood 3 (this group's Torchwood) must deal with the monster and their personal lives. Whilst engaged in the chase and danger, the show weaves in and out of each of the characters lives exploring their past and present. The show is successful because of the exploration of each character. It delves deeply into their psyches fleshing out their strengths, flaws and intentions. After watching this, you feel like you really know the characters. The first season deals with Gwen, a police constable, stumbling upon Torchwood and later joining the team, which is comprised of Toshiko (techno wiz), Owen (doctor), Jack (the leader) and Ianto (he makes coffee and looks good in a suit). The first season introducers use to the team, the rift and many many aliens.

B00008EY65|3.0|Guillermo del Toro's Hellboy implements countless impressive ideas, including seamless computer graphics fused with animatronics and puppeteers, ingenious character designs and fascinating monstrosities. But for all of its undeniable visual flair, the film weakens due to sore-thumb dialogue and a regimen of predictable plot devices; as well as too many unlikely conveniences and the ever-popular need for heroes and villains to strike a lengthy poster-perfect pose before and after every action sequence.<br /><br />During World War II, Rasputin (Karl Roden) aids the Nazis in opening up a portal to another world, which is abruptly shut when U.S. forces grenade the operation. Although Rasputin is destroyed, a tiny red creature is left behind on Earth to be raised by Professor Broom (John Hurt). Dubbed Hellboy, the demon soon grows into a powerful crime-fighter intent on keeping extra terrestrial baddies at bay.<br /><br />Hellboy (Ron Perlman) is not alone, and is joined by Abe Sapien (Doug Jones), an amphibious creature that possesses incredible knowledge. Elizabeth Sherman (Selma Blair) also has super powers, although her pyrokinetic firestarter abilities are much harder to control. Together the group works for the Bureau of Paranormal Research and Defense (BPRD), constantly and covertly cleaning up the messes left by alien life forms and resurrected enemies from the past.<br /><br />The action sequences are all fast-paced, expertly choreographed, and arrive just in time to speed up the story when things get too convoluted or unexplainable. Seamlessly blending computer animated models of Hellboy, Sammael, Abe Sapien and many others with practical effects, the film achieves a startlingly realistic look. Like James Cameron's Aliens, the various monsters have a rubbery, tangible appearance, slaver real slime and appear to be actors in costumes more often than not. And this is a good thing, because it peerlessly prevents visual annoyances like those found in most major fantasy films in which Spider-men effortlessly swing from concrete jungle rooftops and hulking green men float through vast canyons.<br /><br />A stepping stone to del Toro's next visual masterpiece (Pan's Labyrinth), Hellboy utilizes many unquestionably unique character designs and concepts. From Kroenen's hideously scarred visage (and his skill with bladed weapons, though not as cool as V from V For Vendetta), to Sammael's lumbering cartilaginous figure, to Abe Sapien's twitching webbed hands, the oddities speak wonders for both the makeup crew and original comic book creator Mike Mignola. Along with these bizarre concepts are idiosyncrasies and affecting personalities bestowed on every human and monster, which allows for more personable and relatable qualities from such inhuman concoctions as a giant crimson-skinned demon. The charisma of Hellboy (ample amounts of credit goes to Ron Perlman) and his wide array of emotions make the human liaison to the audience John Meyers (Rupert Evans) nearly obsolete. The set designs are also fascinating and numerous, from snowy graveyards to steaming sewers to a booby-trapped underground labyrinth.<br /><br />Hellboy deserves credit for its innovative approach to visuals in a comic book adaptation, but loses points for noticeably trite dialogue from many of the supporting characters. The plot is also disappointing with its convoluted legend and prophecy jargon and otherworldly nonsense which simply doesn't do justice to the awesome characters battling across the screen. The fun somehow eludes the ruddy Hellboy, despite all of the action, comedy, violence, destruction, mayhem, romance and special effects.<br /><br />- Mike Massieider-men effortlessly swing from concrete jungle rooftops and hulking green men float through vast canyons.

B000H8SFMK|5.0|I played Fairytale of New York when I was breaking up with Dona 20 years ago; it made the \\"it's not you, it's me\\" sound plausible.  The Pogues never were this good again, and I did like Hells Ditch and some of their other stuff, but this is their best.  Every song is good.  A couple were in the movie Straight to Hell, which was a lost classic.  Angsty, sweaty and sweet.  A classic.
B0010ZR160|4.0|I think that Ben Affleck is not so much as an actor, but as a director, he is amazing.  I love that he included real people from Boston to be in this movie and the accents were obviously very realistic.  I think Casey is a very good actor.  Morgan Freeman is good as always. Ed Harris, I love.  The movie was kinda dark, and the ending really ticked me off. If I was his girlfriend, I would have left him also.  The little girl was happy and healthy and so much better off with Morgan Freeman.  Her mother was trash.  She didn't change, because they don't change.  He was standing by some idealistic crap that just ended up costing him his relationship and a  chance for a real future for that little girl.

1416550518|4.0|This debut novel by Kate Morton is a solid offering from an up-and-coming historical novelist.  My wife and I are both librarians, and we both liked this novel a lot.  I have to admit I originally got this book for her, but after hearing her tell me about it, I read it myself and thoroughly enjoyed it!

B000002WYT|4.0|4 1/2    This certainly must be as worthwhile a DMB album as any other they have come out with. It is one that, in retrospect especially, you get the feeling the creative effortlessness which guided all twelve of these unique afro-pop-rock-jazz fusion treats and framed all of them in such a warmth has all but completely run dry. Whether you are a fan of the band's signature sound or not is besides the point that Crash can rate as one of the more solid major label rock records of the 90's-easy. What did not become a massive hit on radio is an even greater treat to hear. The only possible problems I see are the sometimes overindulgences Matthews uses vocally, and the fact that Crash Into Me/Let You Down, and Too Much/Tripping Billies feel similar. Similarly great, that is.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|...because I returned the DVD and got a non-captioned version. So to all you people who insist on filling up page after page of complaints about the captions...STOP IT! I went scrolling through the 1-star reviews looking for differing opinions on the movie, and all people could talk about was Dreamwork's screwup.<br />Let me also preface this by saying - I don't mind that there's no English dub. And no, I don't speak Japanese, but I like the sound of it. Would hearing dozens of Confucian-lite quotes in English over and over really have made for a better experience? I mean really, it's not like people spend the whole movie talking. I'd be willing to bet only about 50% of the movie has dialogue. I got an idea - why don't we just put an English dub on every great foreign film ever made? Seven Samurai, Breathless, Fellini's 8 1/2. Why not? Gotta make 'em palatable for Americans, right?<br />Some of you people make me sick: \\"If I wanted to read, I'd get a book.\\" Truth is, if you read books - EVER - subtitles aren't that hard. The amount of time it takes your eye to scan down and quickly go over a line of dialogue is not that long. But seriously, on to talking about the movie, 'cause I'm getting a little pissed here.<br />Like many people upon first seeing this, I was just in awe. The melding of CG with the 2D animation is top notch. Look at that scene in the beginning when Batou is walking down the alley and tell me that's not photo-realistic!<br />However, I watched the movie with a more critical eye lately, and plot-wise, there are a few problems. One, the dialogue. Entire conversations between characters are made up of quotes and parables. I mean, does everyone in the 21st century walk around with a copy of the Tao Te Ching in their pocket? Two, there is this feeling of malaise throughout the whole thing. Obviously, Oshii is trying to carry over the feeling of what is real/what is a soul? etc. from the first film. But there is no resolution to this conflict. The pedantic existentialism  mostly revolves around \\"the soul of a doll\\" (Oshii even mentions this in the extras). The monologue of the Puppet Master in the first movie is much easier to take than all the crap that pours out of the hacker Kim's mouth.<br />Third and final point - the last half of the movie absolutely drags, basically everything after Batou decides to go North. The overlong parade sequence, the slow walk into Kim's place. It's like they took the sequence from the first movie when the Major is on the boat looking at the Tokyo skyline and stretched it to absurd lengths. Don't get me wrong, it all looks beautiful (especially the parade stuff) but to what end is it serving? I mean seriously, the last half of the movie is like Valium in DVD form. And the mediocre action at the end doesn't make up for it. I don't feel that threatened by a whole army of killer nymphet cyborgs.<br />So in conclusion, this is not a hands-down great film. It has great execution, but the ideas ultimately come off half-baked and unresolved.<br />And a minor quibble, but what does the word \\"Innocence\\" in the title have to do with any of this?sm  mostly revolves around \\"the soul of a doll\\" (Oshii even mentions this in the extras).

0385340567|5.0|A terrific read    Let me preface my remarks by saying I was a little surprised by the many negative comments; most concerning Mr. Child's politicizing.  Sorry, as a 3 time combat veteran of Vietnam, Panama, and Desert Storm I did not read the novel that way.  I read it as simply a book not a statement.  Perhaps I'm wrong but I enjoyed it.    The old Lee Child is back with his trademark staccato writing style.  Simply a terrific read.  Jack Reacher is a man's man and a loner's loner.  He likes his women strong and his coffee stronger.  At 6' 5\\" he takes guff off no one.  As a former Army cop he is well versed in detective ways and always seems to find the action; even between the lonely towns of Hope and Despair.  Only Jack Reacher can find trouble simply ordering a cup of coffee, or maybe trouble finds him.  Nothing to Lose is a Lee Child tour De force.  It is an action packed page turner but at the same time is driven by a good mystery.  Just what the heck is the town of Despair all about?  Couple that with a husband mystery, strange midnight flights, stranger town folk, and Army MPs stationed in the middle of nowhere and you have a novel of intense proportion.  Don't try to second guess Mr. Child as he will simply lead you down a dead end.  Sit back and enjoy Jack Reacher as he does his \\"thing\\" and figures all the angles.  Again an outstanding read.  Excellent character development.  This is the 12th Jack Reacher novel and Lee Child continues to develop this wonderful character.  I know this will sound insignificant, but I totally enjoyed Mr. Child's description of Reacher's perfect coffee mug.  We all know how much Jack likes his coffee, now we know what kind of coffee mug he likes!  Now that is character development of the mega kind.  Typical Jack Reacher violence but all germane to the storyline.  No gratuitous sex or language.    Highly recommended.  If you like Lee Child you will thoroughly enjoy Nothing to Lose.  It is the perfect book for the beach or thatlong airline flight.  I read the novel in 2 sittings so be aware if you think it will last through a vacation.  It is simply too good to put down.
B00007LTIL|5.0|One of the most aptly titled recordings in the rock canon, this is the Dead's studio masterpiece.  Inspired by American folk and country music and by the sophisticated vocal harmonies that Crosby, Stills and Nash were producing at the time, Garcia and company crafted 10 tracks that are polished, warmly engaging, and uniquely American.  This isn't their most progressive work, or their most explosive, but it's probably their most accessible.  From the exquisite melancholy of Phil Lesh's \\"Box of Rain\\", the bluegrassy \\"Friend of the Devil\\", and the exuberant \\"Sugar Magnolia\\", to the beautifully harmonized \\"Attics of My Life\\" and the traveling beat of Bob Weir's \\"Truckin'\\" the Dead staked claim to a sound that remained uniquely theirs for the rest of their career.  A genuine American classic.
B000VWYJ86|3.0|Incomprehensibly filmed and edited, The Bourne Ultimatum is basically a variation of The Bourne Supremacy, which itself was a remake of The Bourne Identity.  Ultimatum follows the exact same formula as those films, with Bourne being hunted by his superiors and then bringing them to justice.    As expected, there's a claustrophoic fist fight, a car chase, a foot chase, and many scenes with Bourne outmanuevering his pursuers.  There's also a Tangiers rooftop escape that was stolen straight out of the James Bond film The Living Daylights.    What makes Ultimatum better than Supremacy?  Simply put, it's more exciting and the action sequences are better-staged.  Ultimatum is not a bad film, but it still pales in comparison to Doug Liman's first Bourne film.

B000FVQYYK|5.0|In a sea of mediocrity, Muse has come to show us that rock is alive and well.  While previous Muse releases were also excellent- namely, Absolution and Origin of Symmetry- they both suffered from some weak tracks pockmarked in between the great ones.    Black Holes and Revelations, however, is almost perfect; it's brash, witty, and gloriously over-the-top.  The band flawlessly imbues pop, classical, metal, disco, salsa, electronic, and opera into one grand, sensational album.      Musically, this is easily the band's best album, and one that puts most other bands to shame.  Thanks to Matt Bellamy's virtuoso musicianship and incredible operatic vocals, Muse's ingenuity outshines many of today's hardest-rocking bands.      Get it.
B00008RH3L|5.0|Enchanting, haunting, unnerving and just good ole Coen Brothers' dialogue. Beautiful photography by Barry Sonnenfeld and great acting all around. This movie not surprisingly becomes more enjoyable with every viewing and is definitely worth owning!
B000WTNCQS|1.0|Once again, a classic album falls victim to the idiotic modern trend of maxing everything out in the mix to create a muddled, lifeless sound.  All the atmosphere and nuance of the original album is lost in this remaster; Bullet the Blue Sky sounds especially awful.  Stick with the original album.
B0000TB01Y|1.0|This is a classic example of people jumping on the bandwagon for a play which despoiled the great Oz of L. Frank Baum, and music which was humdrum and un-memorable.  But because most humans are herd animals, it becomes a classic.  It even hand a song which goes like this.....[see, Spamalot].
B0000CD5FN|4.0|Joe Strummer's final release is an eclectic mix of genres and moods, much like Sandanista and Combat Rock from The Clash.  The best tracks include the rocker Coma Girl, the reggae head-bobber Get Down Moses, the groove-laden Burnin' Streets, and the bittersweet ballad Silver and Gold.  Fans of The Clash who preferred the band's all-out punk anthems may not like it quite as much, but those who appreciate The Clash's experimental side, or those who just like Joe's persona and songwriting, will find much to love here.
0380002930|5.0|We were glad to get these books quickly. They were in good shape and took care of the immediate need.
B000YENUI6|4.0|Superbly acted saga on the Russian mafia in London. Has echoes of \\"The Godfather\\" and the machinations of the Russian nobility. Not really an action film, more a meditation on loyalty and honour. Told with maximum impact by director David Cronenberg, who continues his excellent partnership with Viggo Mortensen from \\"A History of Violence\\" (2005). Only a few inconsistent plot points and an abrupt ending detract from this film.
B000RK3JOC|5.0|**SPOILERS**<br /><br />Oh. Wow.  That was amazing.  Snappy writing, footnotes (!!), math, humor humor humor, love, Theorems, a total formula for success.  It's the most natural-sounding book I have ever read.  EVER.  Random thoughts while reading:  I loved that Colin had a Muslim friend, albeit a very non-practicing one, but still, I thought it was pretty cool.  You just don't see that in books, especially YA books, and it was quite refreshing.  I want Colin as my best friend.  Seriously, he's perfectly sensitive and clingy and basically my soul mate, got it?  The thing with the Katherines was without a doubt, pure genius.  Amazing.  Amazing amazing amazing.  I thought for sure that Colin had made the Katherines up, or that they were all the same person, but nope, all but K1 and K19 were different Katherines, stunning!  The story of Katherine the third was also quite intriguing, and you could see that coming without seeing it coming. (There's another point to bring up: the totally wonderful unpredictability of the book!  Who'd have thought they end up in a tiny town in the middle of nowhere and enjoy themselves, not to mention, entertain the reader the whole way through?!)  The anagrams were brilliant, although please tell me I wasn't the only one who noticed that they totally weren't around in the middle, that was saddening.  Actually, the middle didn't have as many awesome footnotes either.  Weird.  And the footnotes!  Random facts FTW, am I not right?  I was wiki-ing stuff left and right, and knew that the Archbishop Franz Ferdinand was not buried there :D  I wish we'd gotten more of the Katherine stories though.  I was terribly glad that we got at least a paragraph for each, but still, in-depth Katherine stories, what an amazing book that would make.  Prequel anyone?  Oh, and the best quote ever? \\"You can love someone so much, but you can never love people as much as you can miss them.\\"  So strikingly true &lt;3
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Every time a song by Madonna comes out it seems like she has reinvented herself.  This time is no different.  A bit of the beginning sounds of Madonna mixed with her later music.  Her voice is clear and sounds as if it is embedded into the music.  The flow is great as well as some of the people she has on this CD.  Listen to the words on this CD, they are clear and understandable, unlike some other recently produced albums.  Madonna by far has outdone Mariah and Janet.  Leona Lewis is on her tale though - check her out too.
B0009FU0ZQ|5.0|This is the 2nd movie in the series of 4 made for TV movies. Night Passage being the first, Death In Paradise the third, and Sea Change the fourth. All the movies will stand alone but if you want to really get into it buy all 4 movies. Selleck is at his best in these. The stories are about Jesse Stone, an ex LAPD detective who drowns his sorrows in scotch on the rocks, as the new chief of police in a small town in New England. Jesse is a nice guy with a very stong sense of right and wrong even if it means being unconventional. Great movies and great plots. Buy them and curl up in a chair like you are reading a good book.
B000009RC2|5.0|Ground breaking.  A must have addition to any Jazz library.  A \\"desert island disk\\" for sure.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I didn't watch Sex & the City until it was over with on HBO and I lost my job so I had a lot of time on my hands.  I finally decided to see what all this hype was about.  I'm not normally a big fan of \\"women's tv\\"...yes, I'm a woman, but all that fashion, shoes, I've never been into that. And talking about men and sex, for the sake of being provocative, I just wasn't sure.  I was wrong!<br /><br />All the seasons of Sex & the City were entertaining.  They were all fun, sexy, interesting, intelligent, funny.  And very fashionable of course!  I did have a bit of fun watching the girls dress up in outrageous outfits, or seeing Carrie's shoe closet.  Living a bit vicariously through them, living in NY, and that whole scene.  I fell in love with the show and the characters.  Esp. some of the boyfriends.<br /><br />It was fun to see a show be original, to dare to talk about things that other shows won't.  I highly recommend this show.  I didn't buy it, I rented it disc by disc, which is the cheaper way to go.  But no matter if you rent, buy or catch reruns, DO catch this show.  You'll be missing out if you don't!  It really is an icon in it's time.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|A young rat named Remy is shunned by his family and other rats for his mature palate. While they, like all rats, eat garbage, he tries to blend flavors to enhance his food. When he, then, becomes unfortunately separated from the other rats he must learn to fend for himself for the first time and winds up in the most unlikely of situations. He teams up with Linguini, an awkward young man who is an aspiring chef. Together they are able to bring Remy's culinary visions to the (human) public. The unconventional duo must fight through adversity that is more than just what would happen if people found out that not only is there a rat in the kitchen, but that rat just prepared their dinner.     I liked this movie. It wasn't my favorite Pixar movie, but I certainly enjoyed the creativity. And it looked great, as the Pixar movies all do. The story was a little weak on its own, and I feel that I enjoyed it a little more on a personal level than others might. If you don't enjoy being in the kitchen, you might miss some of the charm, I feel, was present in this movie.
B0001KL5DA|5.0|If you're looking for something original and unique, you've found out.  Six Feet Under is unlike any other TV show I've ever seen.  It's fascenating and I'm hooked!!<br /><br />Season 1 was a little slow for me, but I am so glad that I stuck it out.  In this season we come to know the characters better, the stories get a bit more interesting and it becomes apparent that death happens in many ways and there's always an interesting story behind it and behind the person.<br /><br />Run, don't walk to the video store or where ever you have to go to get this series.  It's amazing!
0743290119|3.0|I loved \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" and liked \\"Everyone Worth Knowing\\", so I had high hopes for this novel. Unfortunately, this book did not meet them. Frankly, I was surprised by how pedantic this novel is - it reads like an author's first try, not a third novel. Each of the characters was a cliche, and not a very well drawn one at that. The book itself is okay, but knowing that this author also wrote \\"Devil Wears Prada\\" makes me wonder if it was two different authors writing the two books.
0743290119|5.0|This was the perfect book for the beach.  I really enjoyed reading it.  It was funny (I laughed out loud) and light.  Great for anyone wanting to forget about work or any stress in your life.  I had never read any of her books before and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.  Great job Lauren!
0156528207|1.0|To get the most enjoyment from this beautiful book, buy the original Katherine Woods translation.
0151013837|4.0|I don't understand what \\"Life of Pi\\" has to do with God. The references to various religions in the first part of the book don't amount to anything more than name-dropping of some significant figures in the religions and minimal descriptions of some basic religious beliefs. It's not an exploration in the vein of, for example, \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.\\"  It's just a catalog that's not even as interesting as the catalog of animals under Pi's father's care.     Contrast the lack of depth to the religious discussion with the book's author's claim that Pi's story made him believe in God. Where's this coming from?    This is just one of the ways in which the book doesn't quite meet its potential. Although \\"Life of Pi\\" is highly imaginative and entertaining, it's burdened by a number of weaknesses. For example, the framing mechanism of the author who hears the story and then finds Pi doesn't seem essential. What does the author add to the picture?  Or, Pi's slip into immediate anonymity in Canada isn't believable in our media-saturated world. And what did he conclude about religious belief in the 20-plus years since he was rescued? We don't find out.      The best part of the book, from my perspective, comes when Pi finds the island of seaweed. It's an eerie existence with an astounding ending, and it's a series of images that will remain in my mind for years and years.    So read the book and enjoy it. But don't expect too much.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|My sister recommended this dvd to me. I decided to purchase it and spent   all day July 4th watching it. The acting was superb, the story riveting and the quality of the overall production impressive. Laura Linney and Paul Giamatti deliver stellar performances (especially Giamatti). The dvd led me to the book by David McCullough from which the movie draws upon. The movie will leave you wanting more and the book is a great follow-up.
B000020617|5.0|I just recently got There Is Nothing Left to Lose, and I think it is one of the Foos best records they have done.  It starts of good with Stacked actors, which is good, and then Generator and personaly, my favorite song, Aurora.  All of the songs are really good and catchy.  The last 3 songs are really good, Aint It the Life is a really good catchy song that sounds like it could be a b-side or another part of Big Me.  All In all i love this album, and if you are a foo fan get it.  I recentyl saw them live, and it was an amazing concert.
B0006L0LOS|4.0|I understand now that the bad reviews came from those who know and covet the Batman legacy.  Apparently there are components in this movie that are in contradiction to the way the Catwoman character was originally written.  That being said, this story is laid out well and moves succinctly without too much filler.  Characters are developed well enough to support the story and not bore the audience and really, the film is beautifully done.  And oh yeah...the story:  introverted, talented \\"schlub\\" works for evil corporate fashion giant falls victim to conditions that transform her into hot sexy Catwomen. Evil Corporate giant has karma (revenge) served up a la underdog style by Catwoman.  It really was fun to watch and I hope you will at least give it a chance.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Many, many companies have created movies that focused on relationships between animals, people, and inanimate objects as key plot lines.  Most of these movies come up short as the interactions between humans and non-humans often seem forced or fake; examples include \\"All Dogs go to Heaven\\", \\"Howard the Duck\\", \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" and \\"Cool World\\".  But Pixar has mastered this art, with classics such as Toy Story, Finding Nemo, and now Ratatouille.  Released in 2007, this movie is by far the best animated movie of 2007, if not one of the best movies overall.  It features an original cast of characters that include a cooking rat, his clumsy human apprentice, the latter's lady of interest, a conniving head chef, an imposing restaurant reviewer, the rat's lackadasical brother, and their selfish, hard-headed father.  The setting is Paris and the surrounding French countryside, and the musical score fits the French setting perfectly.  The storyline itself is amazing and original; I cannot remember any other movie with even a slight similarity in plot.  And the animation is perfect; to see the rats move, the ripples in a bowl of soup, the flutter of leaves; all of it looks so real.  Best of all is the comedy, again a trademark of all Disney classics.  All in all, one of the best movies of 2007.
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|Yes, the Queen is back.  Donna Summer's latest project Crayons is a gem from start to finish.  With all new material penned by Donna, this music will make you groove, smile and reflect on your life.  I can't remember the last time I enjoyed an album as much as I have Crayons.  Thank you Donna.  The Queen is back indeed!
0316067601|4.0|I picked up this book after being captivated by video footage of the actual ambush taken by Taliban fighters on a leaked video website. Roughly three quarters of the book is about the events and Navy SEAL training which led up to the climactic battle that takes place in Afghanistan. I felt like I was waiting and waiting for the book to get to the exciting part, but when it did, I couldn't put the book down. One thing that was a bit irritating was that the author did at some points go off on a tangent about how he disagrees with the rules of engagement and so on, and I felt that this should have been left out. If you read the book you know what I mean, I just personally disagree with the authors \\"kill 'em all\\" attitude. But philosophical and political differences aside, it was overall a great book.
0307383415|4.0|I am torn about who to vote for in the upcoming election, so I wanted to educate myself as best as I can about the nominees. I've been impressed with Barack Obama's message, but I thought that reading his autobiography (especially one written before he went into office) would help me understand him better. Obama is the son of a Kenyan man who married an 18-year-old girl named Stanley in Hawaii. There have been many misconceptions about Obama and his family in the media and online, but reading this book dispelled them. He describes his life and upbringing with remarkable honesty, even about his foibles and mistakes. He has a knack for description and capturing a moment with almost Kodakesque clarity. While much has been made in the news about the influence on him of his father and mother (TIME Magazine devoted an entire cover story to her), I can't help but think that his white grandfather may have had a larger impact than acknowledged. Obama describes his grandfather's life as: single mother, hint of scandal, raised by grandparents, realizes he's not the fair-haired boy, that he appears more like a \\"wop\\". Substitute \\"wop\\" for any racial term for African-American, and you could be describing Obama. The book is compelling, not only to learn about the man who may become the first black President of the United States, but also as a story of self-discovery and the quest for purpose.
B000H7JD4A|5.0|I never intended to write a review on this cd but.......... I felt I must stress something that no one has touched base on.  The overall effort from this album campaired to the last two Dance of death and Brave new world. Starting with BNW their direction was trying to stop making  songs lasting 3 mins and catchy, and turn the tide towards immortality status. BNW or DOD didnt not hit the target for that status. A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH DID!!!!!!!!!!      I'm talking about longer songs too about all of em campare to the greats of classic rock Skynyrd, Cream, Zeppelin, Allman Brothers etc. All using great concepts and able to make a song long and enjoyable. The format and concepts of each song on A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH, are well put together, and solidifies this being perhaps their greatest album. Yeah believe it or not I said that.     However Maiden still keeps their signature sound on this album. Those who don't agree don't know Maiden. Clearly on THE PILGRAM track #4 thats vintage Maiden. \\"BRIGHTER THAN A THOUSAND SUNS\\" track #3 would be my personal favorite on the album and think it is the strongest song..  FOR THE GREATER GOOD OF GOD track #8 is also a personal favorite A ballad like song Asking the meaning of life,love,war, and life again.    \\"Please tell me now what life is  Please tell me now what love is  Well tell me now what war is  Again tell me what life is\\"    insanely great song!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    IF YOU WANT ARGUABLY MAIDENS MOST WELL PUT TOGETHER WORK BUY THIS ALBUM
B0019HQIGS|5.0|I paid even less by pre-ordering but that's of no consequence. The DVD is a top-shelf production with a great variety of music (I mean come on--22 tracks!) and worth two-times the retail price. I'm a BIG JM fan...this is the next best thing to an actual concert experience...I couldn't be more pleased.
B000025SJ8|2.0|Black metal is my favorite genre now. But this is just not good at all. There are a few interesting moments but you hear the first 20 seconds of a song and I'm serious thats the entire song. You dont need to hear anymore, buy if you want.
B000BF0D9M|4.0|If you are not familiar with mr. cook's music, this seems to be a good primer. I bought this with \\"frontiers\\" and am very happy with both!
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|The new coldplay Cd is a great CD to listen to. I listen to it everyday. They did a great job again. All great songs and I am very happy to have it. There could be more songs on it but I am happy with what they did. Way to go ColdPlay.
B000CNFC76|5.0|Like other reviewers, my golfer husband and non-golfer me, enjoyed this movie.  We gave this movie as a gift to my 86 year old golfer FIL for Father's Day, and both he and my 79 year old non-golfer MIL really enjoyed it.  A nice gift at an inexpensive price.
B000NA28I4|1.0|when i saw this movie at the theaters i almost had diarrhea the actor for eragon kinda sucked     brom was all      in like a second    saphira voice sounded like a robot i was expecting queen latifiah to start talking as saphira anyways the fight against the shade lasted a second and eragon didn;t get stabbed in the back i don't see how they are going to make a second movie i hope the director get stuck in a hole for the rest of his life        dissapointment
B000PC0S5K|1.0|Tolle, a self-appointed guru to the masses, drones on and on and takes a dozen pages to say what could be said in a sentence.  It amuses me that he starts the book in the first chapter saying that the book will change your life, and if your life is not changed, then you weren't ready for his wisdom!  CYA
B000RG1FMO|5.0|Ok lets get one thing straight, Kanye is one of the best out there. Since coming on the scene with College dropeout he hasn't stoped. Kanye is one of the only artists to get better with time. Graduation is easily Kanye's best album to date. Every track on this disc is a classic. When I first heard drunkin hot girls, I couldn't believe it. Had to rewind it several times.  I hate all the people that say Lil Wayne is the best rapper alive. Haha, lets get one thing straight Jay-z is and will always be the greatest, case closed. Kanye deserves all the good things that come to him. On this album once again he invites you into his world. You hold your breath on every line he says. Lyrically Kanye isnt the best, but damn this man is creative. I love Kanye, I love what he bodies. Sure he is cocky, but lets face it he can be. Thank you Kanye for releasing another hip hop classic. Thank you Kanye for all you do for Hip Hop.
